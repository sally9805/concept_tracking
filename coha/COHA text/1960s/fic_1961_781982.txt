 | I eased the stick forward again and by the time I shot past , I was only about a hundred feet over it . I went into an Immelmann and looked back . They were at the windows already . The dark Mexican and Indian girls in their brightly colored dresses and the men in their faded blue work clothes . I could almost see the whites of their frightened eyes looking after me . I grinned again . Their life was dull enough . Let them have a real thrill . I pulled out at the top of the Immelmann and went on to twenty-five hundred feet . Then I hit the stick and dove right for the tar-pitched roof . The roar from the big Pratt &; Whitney engine crescendoed and deafened my ears and the wind tore at my eyes and face . I narrowed my lids and drew my lips back across my teeth . I could feel the blood racing in my veins , my heart pounding and the juices of life starting up in my gut . Power , power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy beneath me . Where I held the stick like my cock in my hands and there was no one , not even my father , to say me no ! The black roof of the plant lay on the white sand like a girl on the white sheets of a bed , the dark pubic patch of her whispering its invitation into the dimness of the night . My breath caught in my throat . Mother . I did n't want to turn away . I wanted to go home . Ping ! One of the thin wire struts snapped clean . I blinked my eyes and licked my lips . The salty taste of the tears touched my tongue . I could see the faint gray pebbles in the black tar of the roof now . I eased back on the stick and began to come out of the dive . At eight hundred feet , I leveled off and went into a wide turn that would take me to the field behind the factory . I headed into the wind and made a perfect three-point landing . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from Los Angeles . Nevada Smith was walking across the field toward me as the plane rolled to a stop . I cut the switches and the engine died , coughing the last drop of fuel out of its carburetor lungs . I looked out at him . Nevada never changed . From the time I was five years old and I first saw him walking up to the front porch , he had n't changed . The tight , rolling , bowlegged walk , as if he 'd never got used to being off a horse , the tiny white weather crinkles in the leathery skin at the corner of his eyes . That was sixteen years ago . It was 1909 . I was playing around the corner of the porch and my father was reading the weekly Reno paper on the big rocker near the front door . It was about eight o'clock in the morning and the sun was already high in the sky . I heard the clip-clop of a horse and came around to the front to see . A man was getting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace . He threw the reins over the hitching post and walked toward the house . At the foot of the steps , he stopped and looked up . My father put the paper down and got to his feet . He was a big man . Six two . Beefy . Ruddy face that burned to a crisp in the sun . He looked down . Nevada squinted up at him . " Jonas Cord ? " My father nodded . " Yes . " The man pushed his broad-brimmed cowboy hat back on his head , revealing the crow-black hair . " I hear tell you might be looking for a hand . " My father never said yes or no to anything . " What can you do ? " he asked . The man 's smile remained expressionless . He glanced slowly across the front of the house and out on the desert . He looked back at my father . " I could ride herd but you ai n't got no cattle . I can mend fence , but you ai n't got none of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " You any good with that ? " he asked . For the first time , I noticed the gun on the man 's thigh . He wore it real low and tied down . The handle was black and worn and the hammer and metal shone dully with oil . " I 'm alive , " he answered . " What 's your name ? " " Nevada . " " Nevada what ? " The answer came without hesitation . " Smith . Nevada Smith . " My father was silent again . This time the man did n't wait for him to speak . He gestured toward me . " That your young'un ? " My father nodded . " Where 's his mammy ? " My father looked at him , then picked me up . I fit real good in the crook of his arm . His voice was emotionless . " She died a few months back . " The man stared up at us . " That 's what I heard . " My father stared back at him for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my behind . Then before I could catch my breath , I was flying through the air over the porch rail . The man caught me with one arm and rolled me in close to him as he went down on one knee to absorb the impact . The breath whooshed out of me and before I could begin to cry , my father spoke again . A faint smile crossed his lips . " Teach him how to ride , " he said . He picked up his paper and went into the house without a backward glance .  | Still holding me with one hand , the man called Nevada began to rise again . I looked down . The gun in his other hand was like a live black snake , pointed at my father . While I was looking , the gun disappeared back in the holster . I looked up into Nevada 's face . His face broke into a warm , gentle smile . He set me down on the ground carefully . " Well , Junior , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the house but my father had already gone inside . I did n't know it then but that was the last time my father ever held me in his arms . From that time on , it was almost as if I were Nevada 's boy . I had one foot over the side of the cockpit by the time Nevada came up . He squinted up at me . " You been pretty busy . " I dropped to the ground beside him and looked down at him . Somehow I never could get used to that . Me being six two like my father and Nevada still the same five nine . " Pretty busy , " I admitted . Nevada stretched and looked into the rear cockpit . " Neat , " he said . " How d'ja get it ? " I smiled . " I won it in a crap game . " He looked at me questioningly . " Do n't worry , " I added quickly . " I let him win five hundred dollars afterward . " He nodded , satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada taught me . Never walk away from the table after you win a man 's horse without letting him win back at least one stake for tomorrow . It did n't diminish your winnings by much and at least the sucker walked away feeling he 'd won something . I reached into the rear cockpit and pulled out some chocks . I tossed one to Nevada and walked around and set mine under a wheel . Nevada did the same on the other side . " Your pappy ai n't gon na like it . You messed up production for the day . " I straightened up . " I do n't guess it will matter much . " I walked around the prop toward him . " How 'd he hear about it so soon ? " Nevada 's lips broke into the familiar mirthless smile . " You took the girl to the hospital . They sent for her folks . She told them before she died . " " How much do they want ? " " iWenty thousand . " " You can buy ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked down at my feet . " Get your shoes on and come on , " he said . " Your father 's waiting . "  | He started back across the field and I looked down at my feet . The warm earth felt good against my naked toes . I wriggled them in the sand for a moment , then went back to the cockpit and pulled out a pair of Mexican huarachos . I slipped into them and started out across the field after Nevada . I hate shoes . They do n't let you breathe . 2 I KEPT RAISING SMALL CLOUDS OF SAND WITH THE HUARACHOS AS I walked toward the factory . The faint clinical smell of the sulphur they used in making gunpowder came to my nose . It was the same kind of smell that was in the hospital the night I took her there . It was n't at all the kind of smell there was the night we made the baby . It was cool and clean that night . And there was the smell of the ocean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small cottage I kept out at Malibu . But in the room there was nothing but the exciting scent of the girl and her wanting . We had gone into the bedroom and stripped with the fierce urgency in our vitals . She was quicker than I and now she was on the bed , looking up at me as I opened the dresser drawer and took out a package of rubbers . Her voice was a whisper in the night . " Do n't , Joney . Not this time . " I looked at her . The bright Pacific moon threw its light in the window . Only her face was in shadows . Somehow , what she said brought the fever up . The bitch must have sensed it . She reached for me and kissed me . " I hate those damn things , Joney . I want to feel you inside me . " I hesitated a moment . She pulled me down on top of her . Her voice whispered in my ear . " Nothing will happen , Joney . I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her whisper changed into a sudden cry of pain . I could n't breathe and she kept crying in my ear , " I love you , Joney . I love you , Joney . " She loved me all right . She loved me so good that five weeks later she tells me we got to get married . We were sitting in the front seat of my car this time , driving back from the football game . I looked over at her . " What for ? " She looked up at me . She was n't frightened , not then . She was too sure  | of herself . Her voice was almost flippant . " The usual reason . What other reason does a fellow and a girl get married for ? " My voice turned bitter . I knew when I 'd been taken . " Sometimes it 's because they want to get married . " " Well , I want to get married . " She moved closer to me . I pushed her back on the seat . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you said you loved me . " I did n't look at her . " A man says a lot of things when he 's humping . " I pulled the car over against the curb and parked . I turned to her . " I thought you said you 'd be careful . " She was wiping at her tears with a small , ineffectual handkerchief . " I love you , Joney . I wanted to have your baby . " For the first time since she told me , I began to feel better . That was one of the troubles with being Jonas Cord , Jr . Too many girls , and their mothers , too , thought that spelled money . Big money . Ever since the war , when my father built an empire on gunpowder . I looked down at her . " Then it 's simple . Have it . " Her expression changed . She moved toward me . " You mean-you mean  --  we 'll get married ? " The faint look of triumph in her eyes faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant have the baby if you want it that bad . " She pulled away again . Suddenly , her face was set and cold . Her voice was calm and practical . " I do n't want it that bad . Not without a ring on my finger . I 'll have to get rid of it . " I grinned and offered her a cigarette . " Now you 're talking , little girl . " She took the cigarette and I lit it for her . " But it 's going to be expensive , " she said . " How much ? " I asked . She drew in a mouthful of smoke . " There 's a doctor in Mexican Town . The girls say he 's very good . " She looked at me questioningly. " 11vo hundred ? " " O.K. , you got it , " I said quickly . It was a bargain . The last one cost me three fifty . I flipped my cigarette over the side of the car and started the motor . I pulled the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where you going ? " she asked . I looked over at her . " To the beach house , " I answered . " We might as well make the most of the situation . " She began to laugh and drew closer to me . She looked up into my face . " I wonder what Mother would say if she knew just how far I went to get you . She told me not to miss a trick . " I laughed . " You didn't. "  | She shook her head . " Poor Mother . She had the wedding all planned . " Poor Mother . Maybe if the old bitch had kept her mouth shut , her daughter might have been alive today . It was the night after that , about eleven thirty , that my telephone began to ring . I had just about fogged off and I cursed , reaching for the phone . Her voice came through in a scared whisper . " Joney , I 'm bleeding . " The sleep shot out of my head like a bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down to Mexican Town this afternoon and now something 's wrong . I have n't stopped bleeding and I 'm frightened . " I sat up in bed . " Where are you ? " " I checked into the Westwood Hotel this afternoon . Room nine-oone . " " Get back into bed , I 'll be right down . " " Please hurry , Joney . Please . " The Westwood is a commercial hotel in downtown L.A. Nobody even looked twice when I went up in the elevator without announcing myself at the desk . I stopped in front of Room 901 and tried the door . It was unlocked . I went in . I never saw so much blood in my life . It was all over the cheap carpeting on the floor , the chair in which she had sat when she called me , the white sheets on the bed . She was lying on the bed and her face was as white as the pillow under her head . Her eyes had been closed but they flickered open when I came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bent over her . " Do n't try to talk , baby . I 'll get a doctor . You 're gon na be all right . " She closed her eyes and I went over to the phone . There was no use in just calling a doctor . My father was n't going to be happy if I got our name into the papers again . I called McAllister . He was the attorney who handled the firm 's business in California . His butler called him to the phone . I tried to keep my voice calm . " I need a doctor and an ambulance quick . " In less than a moment , I understood why my father used Mac . He did n't waste any time on useless questions . Just where , when and who . No why . His voice was precise . " A doctor and an ambulance will be there in ten minutes . I advise you to leave now . There 's no point in your getting any more involved than you are . " I thanked him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Her eyes were closed and she appeared to be sleeping . I started for the door and her eyes opened . " Do n't go , Joney . I 'm afraid . "  | I went back to the bed and sat down beside it . I took her hand and she closed her eyes again . The ambulance was there in ten minutes . And she did n't let go of my hand until we 'd reached the hospital . 3 I WALKED INTO THE FACTORY AND THE NOISE AND THE SMELL closed in on me like a cocoon . I could feel the momentary stoppage of work as I walked by and I could hear the subdued murmur of voices following me . " El hip . " The son . That was how they knew me . They spoke of me with a fondness and a pride , as their ancestors had of the children of their patrones . It gave them a sense of identity and belonging that helped make up for the meager way in which they had to live . I walked past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the back stairway to my father 's office . I started up the steps and looked back at them . A hundred faces smiled up at me . I waved my hand and smiled back at them in the same way I had always done , ever since I first climbed those steps when I was a kid . I went through the door at the top of the stairway and the noise was gone as soon as the door closed behind me . I walked down the short corridor and into my father 's outer office . Denby was sitting at his desk , scribbling a note in his usual fluttery fashion . A girl sat at a desk across from him , beating hell out of a typewriter . ' Iivo other persons were seated on the visitor 's couch . A man and a woman . The woman was dressed in black and she was twisting a small white handkerchief in her hands . She looked up at me as I stood in the doorway . I did n't have to be told who she was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes and she turned her head away . Denby got up nervously . " Your father 's waiting . " I did n't answer . He opened the door to my father 's office and I walked through . He closed the door behind me . I looked around the office . Nevada was leaning against the left wall bookcase , his eyes half closed in that deceptive manner of alertness peculiar to him . McAllister was seated in a chair across from my father . He turned his head to look at me.  | My father sat behind the immense old oak desk and glared . Outside of that , the office was just as I remembered it . The dark oak-paneled walls , the heavy leather chairs . The green velvet drapes on the windows and the picture of my father and President Wilson on the wall behind the desk . At my father 's side was the telephone table with the three telephones and right next to it was the table with the ever present carafe of water , bottle of bourbon whisky and two glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it about three o'clock . I checked my watch . It was ten after three . My father was a bottle-a-day man . I crossed the office and stopped in front of him . I looked down and met his angry glare . " Hello , Father . " His ruddy face grew even redder . The cords on his neck stood out as he shouted , " Is that all you got to say after ruining a day 's production and scaring the shit out of half the help with your crazy stunts ? " " Your message was to get down here in a hurry . I got here as quickly as I could , sir . " But there was no stopping him now . He was raging . My father had that kind of a temper . One moment he would be still and quiet , and the next , higher than a kite . " Why the hell did n't you get out of that hotel room when McAllister told you ? What did you go to the hospital for ? Do you know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an accomplice abetting an abortion . " I was angry now . I had every bit as much of a temper as my father . " What was I supposed to do ? The girl was bleeding to death and afraid . Was I supposed to just walk out of there and leave her to die alone ? " " Yes . If you had any brains at all , that 's just what you 'd have done . The girl died , anyway , and your staying there did n't make any difference . Now those goddam bastards outside want twenty thousand dollars or they 'll call for the police ! You think I 've got twenty thousand dollars for every bitch you plug ? This is the third girl in a year you got caught with ! " It did n't make any difference to him that the girl had died . It was the twenty grand . But then I realized it was n't the money , either . It went far deeper than that . The bitterness that had crept into his voice was the tip-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father was getting old and it was eating out his gut . Rina must have been at him again . More than a year had passed since the big wedding in Reno and nothing had happened . I turned and started for the door without speaking . Father yelled after me . " Where do you think you 're going ? "  | I looked back at him . " Back to L.A. You do n't need me to make up your mind . You 're either going to pay them off or you 're not . It does n't make any difference to me . Besides , I got a date . " He came around the desk after me . " What for ? " he shouted . " To knock up another girl ? " I faced him squarely . I had enough of his crap . " Stop complaining , old man . You ought to be glad that someone in your family still has balls . Otherwise , Rina might think there was something wrong with all of us ! " His face twisted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . His lips drew back tightly across his teeth in a snarl , the veins in his forehead stood out in red , angry welts . Then , suddenly , as an electric switch cuts off the light , all expression on his face vanished . He staggered and pitched forward against me . By reflex , my arms came out and I caught him . For a brief moment , his eyes were clear , looking into mine . His lips moved . " Jonas  --  my son . " Then his eyes clouded and his full weight came on me and he slid to the floor . I looked down at him . I knew he was dead even before Nevada rolled him over and tore open his shirt . Nevada was kneeling on the floor beside my father 's body , McAllister was on the telephone calling for a doctor and I was picking up the bottle of Jack Daniel 's when Denby came in through the door . He shrank back against the door , the papers in his hand trembling . " My God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes lifted from the floor to me . " Who 's going to sign the German contracts ? " I glanced over at McAllister . He nodded imperceptibly . " I am , " I answered . Down on the floor , Nevada was closing my father 's eyes . I put down the bottle of whisky unopened and looked back at Denby . " And stop calling me Junior , " I said . BY THE TIME THE DOCTOR CAME , WE HAD LIF 1ED MY FATHER 'S body to the couch and covered it with a blanket . The doctor was a thin , sturdy man , bald , with thick glasses . He lifted the blanket and looked . He dropped the blanket . " He 's dead , all right . "  | I did n't speak . It was McAllister who asked the question while I swung to and fro in my father 's chair . " Why ? " The doctor came toward the desk . " Encephalic embolism . Stroke . Blood clot hit the brain , from the looks of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful it was quick . He did n't suffer . " It was certainly quick . One minute my father was alive , the next moment he was nothing , without even the power to brush off the curious fly that was crawling over the edge of the blanket onto his covered face . I did n't speak . The doctor sat down heavily in the chair opposite me . He took out a pen and a sheet of paper . He laid the paper on the desk . Upside down , I could read the heading across the top in bold type . DEATH CERTIFICATE . The pen began to scratch across the paper . After a moment , he looked up . " O.K. if I put down embolism as the cause of death or do you want an autopsy ? " I shook my head . " Embolism 's O.K. An autopsy would n't make any difference now . " The doctor wrote again . A moment later , he had finished and he pushed the certificate over to me . " Check it over and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had everything right . Pretty good for a doctor who had never seen any of us before today . But everybody in Nevada knew everything about the Cords . Age 67 . Survivors : Wife , Rina Marlowe Cord ; Son , Jonas Cord , Jr . I slid it back across the desk to him . " It 's all right . " He picked it up and got to his feet . " I 'll file it and have my girl send you copies . " He stood there hesitantly , as if trying to make up his mind as to whether he should offer some expression of sympathy . Evidently , he decided against it , for he went out the door without another word . Then Denby came in again . " What about those people outside ? Shall I send them away ? " I shook my head . They 'd only come back again . " Send them in . " They came in the door , the girl 's father and mother , their faces wearing a fixed expression that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . " I 'm sorry we could n't meet under happier circumstances , Mr. Cord . " I looked at him . The man 's face was honest . I believe he really meant it . " I am , too , " I said . His wife immediately broke into sobs . " It 's terrible , terrible , " she wailed , looking at my father 's covered body on the couch . I looked at her . Her daughter had resembled her but the resemblance  | stopped at the surface . The kid had had a refreshing honesty about her ; this woman was a born harpy . " What are you crying about ? " I asked . " You never even knew him before today . And only then to ask him for money . " She stared at me in shock . Her voice grew shrill . " How can you say such a thing ? Your own father lying there on the couch and after what you did to my daughter . " I got to my feet . The one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did to your daughter ? " I shouted . " I did n't do anything to your daughter that she did n't want me to . Maybe if you had n't told her to stop at nothing to catch me , she 'd be alive today . But no , you told her to get Jonas Cord , Jr. , at any cost . She told me you were already planning the wedding ! " Her husband turned to her . His voice was trembling . " You mean to tell me you knew she was pregnant ? " She looked at him , frightened . " No , Henry , no . I did n't know . I only said to her it would be nice if she could marry him , that 's all I said . " His lips tightened , and for a second I thought he was about to strike her . But he did n't . Instead , he turned back to me . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Cord . We wo n't trouble you any more . " He started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , Henry , " she cried . " Henry . " " Shut up ! " he snapped , opening the door and almost pushing her through it in front of him . " Have n't you said enough already ? " The door closed behind them and I turned to McAllister . " I 'm not in the clear yet , am I ? " He shook his head . I thought for a moment . " Better go down to see him tomorrow at his place of business . I think he 'll give you a release now . He seems like an honest man . " McAllister smiled slowly . " And that 's how you figure an honest man will act ? " " That 's one thing I learned from my father . " Involuntarily I glanced at the couch . " He used to say every man has his price . For some it 's money , for some it 's women , for others glory . But the honest man you do n't have to buy  --  he winds up costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " McAllister said . I stared at the lawyer . " My father was a selfish , greedy son of a bitch who wanted to grab everything in the world , " I said . " I only hope I 'm man enough to fill his shoes . " McAllister rubbed his chin thoughtfully . " You 'll do all right . "  | I gestured toward the couch . " I wo n't always have him there to help me . McAllister did n't speak . I glanced over at Nevada . He had been leaning against the wall silently all the time . His eyes flickered under the veiled lids . He took out a pack of makin 's and began to roll a cigarette . I turned back to McAllister . " I 'm going to need a lot of help , " I said . McAllister showed his interest with his eyes . He did n't speak . " I 'll need an adviser , a consultant and a lawyer , " I continued . " Are you available ? " He spoke slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Jonas , " he said . " I 've got a pretty heavy practice . " " How heavy ? " " I gross about sixty thousand a year . " " Would a hundred thousand move you to Nevada ? " His answer came quick . " If you let me draw the contract . " I took out a pack of cigarettes and offered him one . He took it and I stuck one in my mouth . I struck a match and held it for him . " O.K. , " I said . He stopped in the middle of the light . He looked at me quizzically . " How do you know you can afford to pay me that kind of money ? " I lit my own cigarette and smiled . " I did n't know until you took the job . Then I was sure . " A returning smile flashed across his face and vanished . Then he was all business . " The first thing we have to do is call a meeting of the board of directors and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there might be any trouble on that score ? " I shook my head . " I do n't think so . My father did n't believe in sharing . He kept ninety per cent of the stock in his own name and according to his will , it comes to me on his death . " " Do you have a copy of the will ? " " No , " I answered . " But Denby must . He has a record of everything my father ever did . " I hit the buzzer and Denby came in . " Get me a copy of my father 's will , " I ordered . A moment later , it was on the desk  --  all official , with a blue lawyer 's binding . I pushed it over to McAllister . He flipped through it quickly . " It 's in order , " he said . " The stock is yours all right . We better get it probated right away . " I turned to Denby questioningly . Denby could n't wait to answer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it on file .

" And when you get through with him , call the directors and tell him I 'm having a special meeting of the board at breakfast tomorrow . At my house . " Denby went out and I turned back to McAllister . " Is there anything else I ought to do , Mac ? " He shook his head slowly . " No , not right now . There 's only the German contract . I do n't know too much about it but I heard your father say it was a great opportunity . It 's got something to do with a new kind of product . Plastics , I think he called it .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look began to come over McAllister 's face . For a moment , I did n't know what it was , then I recognized it . Respect . " I 'll be there at five , Jonas .

I think I ought to know their names before the meeting . " The look of respect on his face grew deeper . " Yes , Jonas , " he said , going out the door . I swung around to Nevada and looked up at him . " What do you think ? " I asked . He waited a long moment before he answered . Then he spit away a piece of cigarette paper that clung to his lip . " I think your old man is resting real easy . " That reminded me . I had almost forgotten . I got up from the chair and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the blanket and looked down at him . His eyes were closed and his mouth was grim . There was a slightly blue stain under the skin of his right temple , going on up into the hairline . That must be the embolism , I thought . Somehow , deep inside of me , I wanted some tears to come out for him . But there were n't any . He had abandoned me too long ago  --  that day on the porch when he threw me to Nevada . I heard the door behind me open and I dropped the blanket back and turned around . Denby was standing in the doorway . " Jake Platt wants to see you , sir . " Jake was the plant manager . He kept the wheels turning . He also  | listened to the wind and by now the word must be racing all over the plant . " Send him in , " I said . He appeared in the doorway beside Denby as soon as the words were out of my mouth . He was a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the office , his hand out-stretched . " I just heard the sad news .

" He shook his head mournfully . " A great man . " I walked back behind the desk . And you 're a great actor , Jake Platt , I thought . Aloud I said , " Thank you , Jake . " He turned to me , his face brightening at the thought of his act going over . " And I want you to know if there 's anything you want of me , anything at all , just call on me . " " Thank you , Jake , " I said again . " It 's good to know there are men like you in my corner . " He preened almost visibly at my words . His voice lowered to a confidential tone . " The word 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to say something to them ? You know them Mexicans and Indians . They 're a might touchy and nervous and need a little calming down . " I looked at him . He was probably right . " That 's a good idea , Jake . But I think it would seem better if I talk to them myself . " Jake had to agree with me whether he liked it or not . That was his policy . Not to disagree with the boss . " That 's true , Jonas , " he said , masking his disappointment . " If you feel up to it . " " I feel up to it , " I said , starting for the door . Nevada 's voice came after me . " What about him ? " I turned back and followed his glance to the couch . " Call the undertakers and have them take care of him . Tell them we want the best casket in the state . " Nevada nodded . " Then meet me out in front with the car and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without waiting for his reply . Jake trotted after me as I turned down the back corridor and went out onto the stairway leading to the plant . Every eye in the factory turned toward me as I came through that doorway onto the little platform at the top of the staircase . Jake held up his hands and quiet began to fall in the factory . I waited until every machine in the place had come to a stop before I spoke . There was something eerie about it . It was the first time I had ever heard the factory  | completely silent . I began to speak and my voice echoed crazily through the building . " Mi padre ha muerto . " I spoke in Spanish . My Spanish was n't very good but it was their language and I continued in it . " But I , his son , am here and hope to continue in his good work . It is indeed too bad that my father is not here to express his appreciation to all you good workers himself for everything you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is enough for you to know that just before he passed away , he authorized a five-per-cent increase in wages for every one of you who work in the plant . " Jake grabbed my arm frantically . I shook his hand off and continued . " It is my earnest wish that I continue to have the same willing support that you gave to my father . I trust you will be patient with me for I have much to learn . Many thanks and may you all go with God . " I started down the steps and Jake came after me . The workers made a path as I walked through . They were silent for the most part ; occasionally , one would touch me reassuringly as I passed by . Twice I saw tears in someone 's eyes . At least my father did n't go uncried for . Even if they were tears in the eyes of someone who did n't know him . I came out of the factory into the daylight and blinked my eyes . The sun was still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed so long ago . The big Pierce-Arrow was right in front of the door , with Nevada at the wheel . I started across toward it . Jake 's hand on my arm stopped me . I turned toward him . His voice was half whining . " What did you have to go and do that for , Jonas ? You do n't know them bastards like I do . Give ' em an inch , they 'll want your arm . Your father was always after me to keep the pay scale down . " I stared at him coldly . Some people did n't learn fast enough . " Did you hear what I said in there , Jake ? " " I heard what you said , Jonas . That 's what I 'm talking about . I ? " I cut him off . " I do n't think you did , Jake , " I said softly . " My first words were Mi padre ha muerto . ' My father is dead . " " Yes , but ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . But I 'm not . I 'm here and the only thing you better remember is that I 'm exactly like him in just one way . I 'll take no crap from anyone who works for me , and anyone who does n't like what I do can get the hell out ! " Jake learned fast . He was at the car door , holding it open for me . " I did n't mean anything , Jonas . I only ? " There was no use explaining to him that if you pay more , you get more . Ford had proved that when he gave his workers raises the year before . He more than tripled production . I got into the car and looked back at the factory . The black , sticky tar on the roof caught my eye . I remembered it from the plane . " Jake , " I said . " See that roof ? " He turned toward it and peered at it . His voice was puzzled . " Yes , sir ? " Suddenly I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed my eyes . " Paint it white , " I said .  | I DOZED AS THE BIG PIERCE ATE UP THE TWENTY MILES BETWEEN my father 's new house and the factory . Every once in a while , I would open my eyes and catch a glimpse of Nevada watching me in the rearview mirror , then my eyes would close again as if weighted down by lead . I hate my father and I hate my mother and if I had had sisters and brothers , I would hate them , too . No , I did n't hate my father . Not any more . He was dead . You do n't hate the dead . You only remember them . And I did n't hate my mother . She was n't my mother , anyway . I had a stepmother . And I did n't hate her . I loved her . That was why I had brought her home . I wanted to many her . Only , my father said I was too young . Nineteen was too young , he had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a week after I had gone back to college . I met Rina at the country club two weeks before vacation was over . She came from back East , someplace in Massachusetts called Brookline , and she was like no one I had ever met before . All the girls out here are dark and tanned from the sun , they walk like men , talk like men , even ride like men . The only time you can be sure they are something else is in the evenings , when they wear skirts instead of Levi 's , for even at the swimming pool , according to the fashion , they look like boys . Flat-chested and slim-hipped . But Rina was a girl . You could n't miss that . Especially in a bathing suit , the way she was the first time I saw her . She was slim , all right , and her shoulders were broad , maybe too broad for a woman . But her breasts were strong and full , jutting rocks against the silk-jersey suit that gave the lie to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk and  | honey of their sweetness in your mouth . They rested easy on a high rib cage that melted down into a narrow waist that in turn flared out into slim but rounded hips and buttocks . Her hair was a pale blond that she wore long , tied back behind her head , again contrary to fashion . Her brow was high , her eyes wide apart and slightly slanted , the blue of them reflecting a glow beneath their ice . Her nose was straight and not too thin , reflecting her Finnish ancestry . Perhaps her only flaw was her mouth . It was wide  --  not generous-wide , because her lips were not full enough . It was a controlled mouth that set firmly on a tapered , determined chin . She had gone to Swiss finishing schools , was slow to laughter and reserved in her manner . In two days , she had me swinging from the chandeliers . Her voice was soft and low and had a faintly foreign sound that bubbled in your ear . It was about ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I first knew how much I wanted her . It was a slow , tight waltz and the lights were down low and blue . Suddenly she missed half a step . She looked up at me and smiled that slow smile . " You 're very strong , " she said and pressed herself back against me . I could feel the heat from her loins pouring into me as we began to dance again . At last , I could n't stand it any more . I took her arm and started from the dance floor . She followed me silently out to the car . We climbed into the big Duesenberg roadster and I threw it into gear and we raced down the highway . The night air on the desert was warm . I looked at her out of the corner of my eyes . Her head was back against the seat , her eyes closed to the wind . I turned off into a date grove and cut the motor . She was still leaning back against the seat . I bent over and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like a well on an oasis in the desert . It was there for when you needed it . I reached for her breast . Her hand caught mine and held it . I lifted my head and looked at her . Her eyes were open and yet they were guarded . I could not see into them . " I want you , " I said . Her eyes did not change expression . I could hardly hear her voice . " I know . " I moved toward her again . This time , her hand against my chest , stopped me . " Lend me your handkerchief , " she said , taking it from my breast pocket . It fluttered whitely in the night , then dropped from sight with her  | hands . She did n't raise her head from the back of the seat , she did n't speak , she just watched me with those guarded eyes . I felt her searching fingers and I leaned toward her but somehow she kept me from getting any closer to her . Then suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my spine and I almost climbed halfway out of the seat . I took out a cigarette and lit it with trembling fingers as she crumpled the handkerchief into a small ball and threw it over the side of the car . Then she took the cigarette from my mouth and placed it between her lips . " I still want you , " I said . She gave the cigarette back to me and shook her head . " Why ? " I asked . She turned her face toward me . It shone palely in the dark . " Because in two days I 'm going home . Because in the stockmarket crash of twentythree , my father lost everything . Because I must find and marry a rich husband . I must do nothing to endanger that . " I stared at her for a moment , then started the engine . I backed the car out of the date grove and set it on the road for home . I did n't say anything but I had all the answers for her . I was rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parlor and went into my father 's study . As usual , he was working at his desk , the single lamp throwing its light down on the papers . He looked up as I came in . " Yes ? " he asked , as if I were someone in his office who had intruded in the midst of a problem . I hit the wall switch and flooded the room with light . " I want to get married , " I said . He looked at me for a moment as if he was far away . He had been , but he came back fast . " You 're crazy , " he said unemotionally . He looked down at his desk again . " Go to bed and do n't bother me . " I stood there . " I mean it , Dad , " I said . It was the first time I had called him that since I was a kid . He got to his feet slowly . " No , " he said . " You 're too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never occur to him to ask who , what , why . No , only I was too young . " All right , Father , " I said , turning toward the door . " Remember I asked you . " " Wait a minute , " he said . I stopped , my hand on the doorknob . " Where is she ? " " Waiting in the parlor , " I answered . He looked at me shrewdly . " When did you decide ? " " Tonight , " I answered . " Just tonight . "  | " I suppose she 's one of those silly little girls who show up at the club dance and she 's waiting on pins and needles to meet the old man ? " he asked . I rose to her defense . " She 's not like that at all . As a matter of fact , she does n't even know that I 'm in here asking you . " " You mean you have n't even asked her yet ? " " I do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my years . " I know her answer . " My father shook his head . " Just for the record , do n't you think you had better ask her ? " I went out and brought Rina back into the room . " Rina , this is my father ; Father , this is Rina Marlowe . " Rina nodded politely . For all you could tell from her manner , it could have been high noon instead of two o'clock in the morning . Father looked at her thoughtfully . There was a curious expression on his face I had never seen before . He came around his desk and held out his hand to her . " How do you do , Miss Marlowe ? " he said in a soft voice . I stared at him . I had never seen him do that with any of my friends before . She took his hand . " How do you do ? " Still holding her hand , he let his voice fall into a semi-amused tone . " My son thinks he wants to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young . Do n't you ? " Rina looked at me . For a moment , I could see into her eyes . They were bright and shining , then they were guarded again . She turned to Father . " This is very embarrassing , Mr. Cord . Would you please take me home ? " Stunned , unable to speak , I watched my father take her arm and walk out of the room with her . A moment later , I heard the roar of the Duesenberg and angrily I looked around for something to vent my spleen on . The only thing available was the lamp on the table . I smashed it against the wall . ' Iivo weeks later , at college , I got a telegram from my father . RINA AND I WERE MARRIED THIS MORNING . WE ARE AT THE WALDORFASTORIA , NEW YORK . LEAVING TOMORROW ON LEVIATHAN FOR EUROPEAN HONEYMOON . I picked up the telephone and called him . " There 's no fool like an old fool ! " I shouted across the three thousand  | miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason she married you was for your money ? " Father did n't even get angry . He even chuckled . " You 're the fool . All she wanted was a man , not a boy . She even insisted that we sign a premarital property agreement before she would marry me . " " Oh , yeah ? " I asked . " Who drew the agreement ? Her lawyer ? " Father chuckled again . " No . Mine . " His voice changed abruptly . It grew heavy and coarse with meaning . " Now get back to your studies , son , and do n't meddle in things that do n't concern you . It 's midnight here and I 'm just about to go to bed . " The telephone went dead in my hands . I stared at it for a moment , then slowly put it down . I could n't sleep that night . Across my mind 's eye unreeled pornographic pictures of Rina and my father in wild sexual embrace . Several times , I woke up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowly I opened my eyes . The first thing I saw was Nevada 's face . " Wake up , Jonas , " he said . " We 're home . " I blinked my eyes to clear the sleep from them . The last piece of sun was going down behind the big house . I shook my head and stepped out of the car . I looked up at the house . Strange house . I do n't think I 'd spent more than two weeks in it since my father had it built and now it was mine . Like everything else my father had done . I started for the steps . Rina had thought of everything . Except this . My father was dead . And I was going to tell her . 6 THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AS I CROSSED THE VERANDA . MY father had built a traditional Southern plantation house , and to run it , he had brought Robair up from New Orleans . Robair was a Creole butler in the full tradition . He was a giant of a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient as he was big . His father and grandfather had been butlers before him and even though they had been slaves , they had instilled in him a pride in his work . He had a sixth sense for his duties . Somehow , he was always there when he was wanted .  | He stepped aside to let me enter . " Hello , Master Cord . " He greeted me in his soft Creole English . " Hello , Robair , " I said , turning to him as he closed the door . " Come with me . " He followed me silently into my father 's study . His face impassive , he closed the door behind him . " Yes , Mr. Cord ? " It was the first time he had called me Mister , instead of Master . I looked at him . " My father is dead , " I said . " I know , " he said . " Mr. Denby called . " " Do the others know ? " I asked . He shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have n't said anything to the other servants . " There was a faint sound outside the closed door . Robair continued speaking as he moved swiftly toward it . " I figured you would want to break the sad news yourself . " He threw the door open . There was no one there . He stepped quickly out the door . I followed him . A figure was hurrying up the long staircase that curved around the entrance hall to the upper floor . Robair 's voice was low but held the whip of authority . " Louise ! " The figure stopped . It was Rina 's personal maid . " Come down here , " he commanded . Louise came down the steps hesitantly . I could see the terrified look on her face as she approached . " Yes , Mr. Robair ? " Her voice was frightened , too . For the first time , Robair let me see how he kept the servants in line . He moved almost lazily but his hand met her face with the impact of a pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many times do I tell you not to listen at doors ? " She stood holding her hand to her face . The tears began to run down her cheeks . " Now you get back to the kitchen . I 'll deal with you later . " She ran toward the kitchen , still holding her face . Robair turned back to me . " I apologize for her , Mr. Cord , " he said , his voice once more deep and soft . " Ordinarily , my servants do n't do such a thing , but that one is pretty hard to keep in her place . " I took out a cigarette and almost before I had it in my mouth , Robair struck a match and held it for me . I dragged deep . " That 's all right , Robair . I do n't think she 'll be with us much longer . " Robair put out the match and carefully deposited it in an ash tray . " Yes , sir . " I looked at the staircase speculatively . Oddly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder . " Mrs. Cord is in her room . " I looked at him . His face was an impenetrable butler 's mask . " Thank you , Robair . I 'll go up and tell her . " I started up the staircase . His voice held me . " Mr. Cord ? " I turned and looked down at him . His black face gleamed . " What time shall I serve dinner , sir ? " I thought for a moment . " About eight o'clock , " I answered . " Thank you , sir , " he said and started for the kitchen . I knocked softly at Rina 's door . There was no answer . I opened it and walked in . Her voice came from the bathroom . " Louise , bring me a bath towel . " I walked into the bathroom and took a large towel from the stack on the shelf over her dressing table . I started for the enclosed bathtub just as she slid back the glass door . She was gold and white and gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a moment surprised . Most women would have tried to cover themselves . But not Rina . She held out a hand for the towel . She wrapped it around her expertly and stepped from the tub . " Where 's Louise ? " she asked , sitting down at the dressing table . " Downstairs , " I answered . She began to dry her face with another towel . " Your father would n't like this . " " He 'll never know , " I answered . " How do you know I wo n't tell him ? " " You wo n't , " I said definitely . It was then that she began to sense something was wrong . She looked up at me in the mirror . Her face was suddenly serious . " Did something happen between you and your father , Jonas ? " She watched me for a moment ; there was still a puzzled look in her eyes . She gave me a small towel . " Be a good boy , will you , Jonas , and dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled up into the mirror . " You see , I really do need Louise . " I took the towel and moved closer to her . She let the big bath towel slide down from her shoulders . I patted the beads of moisture from her flawless skin . The scent of her perfume came up to me , pungent from her bath warmth . I pressed my lips to her neck . She turned toward me in surprise . " Stop that , Jonas ! Your father said this morning you were a sex maniac but you do n't have to try to prove it ! "  | I stared into her eyes . There was no fear in them . She was very sure of herself . I smiled slowly . " Maybe he was right , " I said . " Or maybe he just forgot what it was like to be young . " I pulled her off the seat toward me . The towel fell still further until it hung only by the press of our bodies . I covered her mouth with mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm and strong and I could feel her heart beating wildly beneath it . Maybe I was wrong but for a moment , I thought I could feel the fires in her reaching toward me . Then , angrily , she tore herself from me . The towel lay unheeded on the floor now . " Have you gone crazy ? " she spit at me , her breast heaving . " You know at any minute now he could come walking through that door . " I stood very still for a second , then let the built-up pressure in my lungs escape in a slow sigh . " He 'll never come through that door again , " I said . The color began to drain from her face slowly . " What what do you mean ? " she stammered . My eyes went right into hers . For the first time , I could see into them . She was afraid . Just like everyone else that had to look into an unknown future . " Mrs. Cord , " I said slowly , " your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and she sank slowly back onto the seat . By reflex , she picked up the towel and placed it around her again . " I ca n't believe it , " she said dully . " What is it that you ca n't believe , Rina ? " I asked cruelly . " That he 's dead or that you were wrong when you married him instead of me ? " I do n't think she even heard me . She looked up at me , her eyes dry , but there was a gentle sorrow in them  --  a compassion I never knew she was capable of . " Was there any pain ? " she asked . " No , " I answered . " It was quick . A stroke . One minute he was as big as life and roaring like a lion , and the next ? " I snapped my fingers . " It was like that . " Her eyes were still on mine . " I 'm glad for his sake , " she said softly . " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet slowly . The veil came down over her eyes again . " I think you 'd better go now , " she said . This was the familiar Rina , the one I wanted to take apart . The distant one , the unattainable one , the calculating one . " No , " I said . " I have n't finished yet . " She started past me . " What is there to finish ? " I seized her arm and pulled her back toward me . " We 're not finished , " I said into her upturned face . " You and me . I brought you home one  | night because I wanted you . But you chose my father because he represented a quicker return for you . I think I 've waited long enough ! " She stared back at me . She was n't afraid now . This was the ground she was used to fighting on . " You would n't dare ! " For an answer , I pulled the towel from her . She turned to run from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me . With my other hand , I caught her hair and pulled her head back so that her face turned up to mine . " No ? " " I 'll scream , " she gasped hoarsely . " The servants will come running ! " I grinned . " No , they wo n't . They 'll only think it a cry of grief . Robair 's got them in the kitchen and not one will come up unless I send for her . " " Wait ! " she begged . " Please wait . For your father 's sake ? " " Why should I ? " I asked . " He did n't wait for me . " I picked her up and carried her into the bedroom . Her fists and hands scratched at my face and beat against my chest . I threw her on the bed , the white satin cover still on it . She tried to roll off on the other side . I grabbed her shoulder and spun her back . She bit my hand and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knee across her thighs and slapped viciously at her face . The blow knocked her back on the pillow . I could see the white marks left by my fingers . She closed her eyes for a moment and when she opened them , they were clouded and there was a wildness in them that I had never seen before . She smiled and her arms went up around my neck , pulling me down to her . Her mouth fastened against mine . I could feel her body begin to move under me . " Do it to me , Jonas ! " she breathed into my mouth . " Now ! I ca n't wait any more . I 've waited so long . " Her searching fingers ran down my hip and found my core . She turned her face into the pillow , her movements becoming more frenetic . I could hardly hear her fierce , urgent whisper . " Hurry , Jonas . Hurry ! " I started to get up but she could n't wait for me to get my clothing off . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was like a burning bed of coals . She drew my head down to her neck . " Make me pregnant , Jonas , " she whispered into my ear . " Make me pregnant like you did to those three girls in Los Angeles . Put your life into me ! " I looked into her face . Her eyes were clear and there was a taunting triumph in them . They reflected none of the passion of the body beneath me . Her arms and legs tightened around me . She smiled , her eyes looking into mine . " Make me pregnant , Jonas , "  | she whispered . " Like your father never would . He was afraid someone would take something away from you ! " " What what ? " I tried to get up but she was like a bottomless well that I could n't get out of . " Yes , Jonas , " she said , still smiling , her body devouring me . " Your father never took any chances . That 's why he made me sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his precious son ! " I tried to get up but she had moved her legs in some mysterious manner . Laughing , triumphant , she said , " But you 'll make me pregnant , wo n't you , Jonas ? Who will know but us ? You will share your fortune with your child even if the whole world believes it to be your father 's . " She rose beneath me , seeking and demanding my life force . In a sudden frenzy , I tore myself from her , just as my strength drained from me . I fell across the bed near her feet . The agony passed and I opened my eyes . Her head was turned into the pillow and she was crying . Silently I got to my feet and left the room . All the way down the hall to my room , I kept thinking , my father cared , he really cared . Even if I did n't see it , he loved me . He loved me . But never enough to show it . By the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cheeks . 7 I WAS ON THE TINY INDIAN PINTO THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS TEN years old , galloping insanely across the dunes . The panic of flight rose within me but I did n't know what I was running from . I looked back over my shoulder . My father was following me on the big strawberry roan . His jacket was open and blowing in the wind and I could see the heavy watch chain stretched tight across his chest . I heard his voice , weird and eerie in the wind . " Come back here , Jonas . Damn you , come back ! " I turned and urged the pinto to even greater speed . I used my bat unmercifully and there were tiny red welts on the horse 's side from where I had hit him . Gradually , I began to pull away . Suddenly , as if from nowhere , Nevada was beside me , riding easily on his big black horse . He looked across at me calmly . His voice was low .  | " Go back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a son are you , anyway ? " I did n't answer , just kept urging my horse on . I looked back again over my shoulder . My father was pulling his horse to a stop . His face was very sad . " Look after him , Nevada . " I could hear him only faintly , for there was a great distance between us . " Look after him , for I have n't the time . " He turned the strawberry roan around and began to gallop away . I stopped my pony and turned to look after him . He was already growing smaller in the distance . Even his outline was fading in the sudden tears that leapt to my eyes . I wanted to cry out after him , " Do n't go , Father . " But the words stuck in my throat . I sat up in bed , my skin wet with perspiration . I shook my head to get the echo of the dream out of it . Through the open window I could hear the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went over to the window and looked out . The sun was at five o'clock and casting a long morning shadow . Down in the corral , several of the hands were leaning against the fence , watching a rider trying to break a wiry bay colt . I squinted my eyes against the sun . I turned from the window quickly . That was the kind of medicine I needed . Something that would jar the empty feeling out of me , that would clean the bitter taste from my mouth . I pulled on a pair of Levi 's and an old blue shirt and started from the room . I headed down the corridor to the back stairs . I met Robair just as I came to them . He was carrying a tray with a glass of orange juice and a pot of steaming coffee . He looked at me without surprise . " Good morning , Mr. Jonas . " " Good morning , Robair , " I replied . " Mr. McAllister is here to see you . I showed him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to wait . There were more important things I had to do . " Thank you , Robair , " I said , turning for the front staircase . " Mr. Jonas , " he called after me . I stopped and looked back at him . " If you 're goin ' to talk business , Mr. Jonas , I find you always talk better if you got something in your stomach . " I looked at him , then at the tray . I nodded and sat down on the top step . Robair set the tray down beside me . I picked up the glass of orange juice and drained it . Robair poured the coffee and lifted the cover from the toast . I sipped at the coffee . Robair was right . The empty feeling was in my stomach . It was going away now . I picked up a slice of toast . mi  | If McAllister noticed the way I was dressed , he made no comment about it . He came directly to the point . " The ten per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , spreading some papers on the desk . " Tivo and one half per cent each . Rina Cord and Nevada Smith ; two percent each , Judge Samuel Haskell and Peter Commack , president of the Industrial Bank of Reno ; and one per cent to Eugene Denby . " I looked at him . " What 's the stock worth ? " " On what basis ? " he asked . " Earnings or net worth ? " " Both , " I answered . He looked down at his papers again . " On the basis of average earnings the past five years the minority stock is worth forty-five thousand dollars ; on the basis of net worth maybe sixty thousand dollars . " He lit a cigarette . " The earning potential of the corporation has been declining since the war . " " What does that mean ? " " There just is n't the demand for our product in peacetime that there is in war , " he answered . I took out a cigarette and lit it . I began to have doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell me something I do n't know , " I said . He looked down at the papers again , then up at me . " Commack 's bank turned down the **27;203;TOOLONG loan your father wanted to finance the German contract you signed yesterday . " I put the cigarette out slowly in the ash tray . " I guess that leaves me a little short , does n't it ? " McAllister nodded . " Yes . " My next question took him by surprise . " Well , what did you do about it ? " He stared at me as if I were psychic . " What makes you think that I did ? " " You were in my father 's office when I got there and I know he would n't call you just to settle with that girl 's parents . He could have done that himself . And you took the job . That meant you were sure of getting your money . " He began to smile . " I arranged another loan at the Pioneer National Trust Company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just to be on the safe side . " " Good , " I said . " That will give me the money I need to buy out the minority stockholders . " He was still staring at me with that look of surprise in his eyes when I  | dropped into the chair beside him . " Now , " I said , " tell me everything you 've been able to find out about this new thing my father was so hot about . What was it you called it ? Plastics ? " 8 ROBAIR SERVED A RANCH-STYLE BREAKFAST : STEAK AND EGGS , hot biscuits . I looked around the table . The last plate had been cleared away and now Robair discreetly withdrew , closing the big doors behind him . I drained my coffee cup and got to my feet . " Gentlemen , " I said , " I know I do n't have to tell you what a shock it was yesterday to find myself suddenly with the responsibility of a big company like Cord Explosives . That 's why I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best for the company . " Commack 's thin voice reached across the table . " You can count on us to do what 's right , son . " " Thank you , Mr. Commack , " I said . " It seems to me that the first thing we have to do is elect a new president . Someone who will devote himself to the company the same way my father did . " I looked around the table . Denby sat at the end , scribbling notes in a pad . Nevada was rolling a cigarette . He glanced up at me , his eyes smiling . McAllister sat quietly next to him . Haskell and Commack were silent . I waited for the silence to grow heavy . It did . I did n't have to be told who were my friends . " Do you have any suggestions , gentlemen ? " I asked . Commack looked up at me . " Do you ? " " I thought so yesterday , " I said . " But I slept on it and this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big nut to crack for someone with my experience . " For the first time that morning , Haskell , Commack and Denby brightened . They exchanged quick looks . Commack spoke up . " That 's pretty sensible of you , son , " he said . " What about Judge Haskell here ? He 's retired from the bench but I think he might take the job on to help you out . " I turned to the Judge . " Would you , Judge ? " The Judge smiled slowly . " Only to help you out , boy , " he said . " Only to help you out . "  | I looked over at Nevada . He was smiling broadly now . I smiled back at him , then turned to the others . " Shall we vote on it , gentlemen ? " For the first time , Denby spoke up . " According to the charter of this company , a president can only be elected by a meeting of the stockholders . And then only by a majority of the stock outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , " Commack said . " The majority of stock is represented here . " " That 's a good idea , " I said . I turned to the Judge , smiling . " That is if I can vote my stock , " I added . " You sure can , boy , " the Judge boomed , taking a paper from his pocket and handing it to me . " It 's there in your father 's will . I had it admitted to probate this morning . It 's all legally yours now . " I took the will and continued . " All right , then , the director 's meeting is adjourned and the stockholder 's meeting is called to order . The first item on the agenda is to elect a president and treasurer of the company to replace the late Jonas Cord . " Commack smiled . " I nominate Judge Samuel Haskell . " Denby spoke quickly . Too quickly . " Second the nomination . " I nodded . " The nomination of Judge Haskell is noted . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to his feet . " I nominate Jonas Cord , Junior , " he drawled . I smiled at him . " Thank you . " I turned to the Judge and my voice went hard and fiat . " Do I hear the nomination seconded ? " The Judge 's face was flushed . He glanced at Commack , then at Denby . Denby 's face was white . " Do I hear the nomination seconded ? " I repeated coldly . He knew I had them . " Second the nomination , " the Judge said weakly . " Thank you , Judge , " I said . It was easy after that . I bought their stock for twenty-five thousand dollars and the first thing I did was fire Denby . If I was going to have a secretary , I did n't want a prissy little sneak like him . I wanted one with tits . Robair came into the study , where McAllister and I were working . I looked up . " Yes , Robair ? " He bowed his head respectfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suh . " I got to my feet and stretched . This sitting at a desk for half a day was worse than anything I 'd ever done . " O.K. , I 'll go right up . " McAllister looked at me questioningly . " Wait for me , " I said . " I wo n't be long . " it  | Robair held the door for me and I went up the stairs to Rina 's room . I knocked on the door . " Come in , " she called . She was sitting at her table in front of a mirror . Louise was brushing her hair with a big white brush . Rina 's eyes looked up at me in the mirror . " You wanted to see me ? " I asked . " Yes , " she answered . She turned to Louise . " That 's all for now , " she said . " Leave us . " The girl nodded silently and started for the door . Rina 's voice reached after her . " And wait downstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me and smiled . " She has a habit of listening at keyholes . " " I know , " I said , closing the door behind me . " What is it you wanted to see me about ? " Rina got to her feet . Her black negligee swirled around her . Through it I could see she was wearing black undergarments , also . Her eyes caught mine . She smiled again . " What do you think of my widow 's weeds ? " " Very merry-widowish , " I answered . " But that is n't what you asked me up for . " She took a cigarette and lit it . " I want to get out of here right after the funeral . " " What for ? " I asked . " It 's your house . He left it to you . " Her eyes met mine through a cloud of smoke she blew out . " I want you to buy the house from me . " " What 'll I use for money ? " " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father always got it for the things he wanted . " I studied her . She seemed to know exactly what she was doing . " How much do you want ? " I asked cautiously . " One hundred thousand dollars , " she said calmly . " What ? " I exclaimed . " It is n't worth more than fifty-five . " " I know , " she said . " But I 'm throwing in something else  --  my stock in the Cord Explosives Company . " " The stock is n't worth the difference ! " I exploded . " I just bought twice as much this morning for twenty-five thousand ! " She got to her feet and walked over to me . Her eyes stared coldly up at me . " Look , Jonas , " she said coldly , " I 'm being nice about it . Under the Nevada law , I 'm entitled to one-third your father 's estate , will or no will . I could break the probate of the will just like that if I wanted to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up in court for five years . What would happen to all your plans then ? "  | I stared at her silently . " If you do n't believe me , why do n't you ask your lawyer friend downstairs ? " she added . " You already checked ? " I guessed . " Damn right I did ! " she snapped . " Judge Haskell called me as soon as he got back to his office ! " I drew in my breath . I should have known the old bastard would n't let go that easy . " I have n't got that kind of money , " I said . " Neither has the company . " " I know that , " she said . " But I 'm willing to be reasonable about it . I 'll take fifty thousand the day after the funeral and your note endorsed by the company for ten thousand a year for the next five years . " I did n't need a lawyer to tell me she 'd had good advice . " O.K. , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on downstairs . I 'll have McAllister prepare the papers . " She smiled again . " I could n't do that . " " Why not ? " I demanded . " I 'm in mourning , " she said . " How would it look for the widow of Jonas Cord to come downstairs to transact business ? " She went back to her vanity table and sat down . " When the papers are ready , send them up . 9 IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN WE GOT OUT OF THE TAXI IN FRONT of the bank building in downtown Los Angeles . We went through the door and walked back to the executive offices in the rear of the bank . McAllister led me through another door marked PRIVATE . It was a reception room . A secretary looked up . " Mr. McAllister . " She smiled . " We thought you were in Nevada . " " I was , " he replied . " Is Mr. Moroni in ? " " Let me check , " she said . " Sometimes he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She disappeared through another door . I looked at McAllister . " That 's the kind of secretary I want . She 's got brains and a nice pair of boobs to go with them . "  | He smiled . " A girl like that gets seventy-five , eighty dollars a week . They do n't come cheap . " " Yuh got ta pay for anything that 's good , " I said . The secretary appeared in the doorway , smiling at us . " Mr. Moroni will see you now , Mr. McAllister . " I followed him into the inner office . It was large , with dark , woodpaneled walls . There was a big desk spang in the middle of it and a small man with iron-gray hair and shrewd dark eyes sitting behind it . He got up as we came into the room . " Mr. Moroni , " McAllister said , " this is Jonas Cord . " Moroni put out his hand . I took it . It was n't the usual soft banker 's hand . This one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many years of labor contained in that hand and most of them had not been behind a desk . " It 's good to meet you , Mr. Cord , " he said with a faint trace of an Italian accent . " My pleasure , sir , " I said respectfully . He waved us to the chairs in front of his desk and we sat down . McAllister came right to the point . When he had finished , Moroni leaned forward across his desk and looked at me . " I 'm sorry to hear about your loss , " he said . " From everything I 've heard , he was a very unusual man . " I nodded . " He was , sir . " " You realize , of course , this makes quite a difference ? " I looked at him . " Without trying to stand on a technicality , Mr. Moroni , I thought the loan was being made to the Cord Explosives Company , not to either my father or me . " Moroni smiled . " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man behind the company . " " My experience is limited , sir , but I thought the first objective of a good banker was to achieve adequate collateralization for a loan . I believe that was inherent in the loan agreement that Mr. McAllister made with you . " Moroni smiled . He leaned back in his chair and took out a cigar . He lit it and looked at me through a cloud of smoke . " Mr. Cord , tell me what you believe the primary responsibility of the borrower is . " I looked at him . " To make a profit on his loan . " " I said the borrower , Mr. Cord , not the lender . " " I know you did , Mr. Moroni , " I said . " But if I did n't feel I would make a profit on the money you 're going to lend me , there 'd be no point in my taking it . " " Just how do you expect to make that profit ? " he asked . " How well do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not as well as I should , Mr. Moroni . Certainly not as well as I will next  | week , next month , next year . But this much I do know . Tomorrow is coming and a whole new world with it . There 'll be opportunities to make money that never existed in my father 's time . And I 'll take advantage of them . " " I presume you 're referring to this new product you 're acquiring by the German contract ? " " That 's part of it , " I said , even if I had n't thought of it until he mentioned it . " Just how much do you know about plastics ? " he asked . " Very little , " I admitted . " Then what makes you so sure it 's worth anything ? " " Du Pont and Eastman 's interest in the American rights . Anything they 're interested in has to be worth something . And , your agreement to lend us the money to acquire those rights . As soon as I clear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three months in Germany learning everything there is to know about plastics . " " Who will run the company while you 're away ? " Moroni asked . " A great deal can happen in three months . " " Mr. McAllister , sir , " I said . " He 's already agreed to join the company . " A kind of respect came into the banker 's face . " I know my directors may not agree with me , Mr. Cord , but I 've decided to give you your loan . It has certain elements of speculation that may not conform to what they consider sound banking practices , but the Pioneer National Trust Company was built on loans like this . We were the first bank to lend money to the producers of motion pictures and there 's nothing quite as speculative as that . " " Thank you , Mr. Moroni , " I said . He picked up the telephone on his desk . " Bring in the Cord loan agreement and the check . " " You will note , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred thousand dollars , we have extended your credit under this agreement to a maximum of five hundred thousand dollars . " He smiled at me . " One of my principles of banking , Mr. Cord . I do n't believe in budgeting my clients too closely . Sometimes a few dollars more make the difference between success and failure . " Suddenly I liked this man . It takes one crap-shooter to recognize another . And this man had it . I smiled at him . " Thanks , Mr. Moroni . Let 's hope I make a lot of money for both of us . " I leaned over and signed the loan application .  | " I 'm sure you will , " Moroni said and pushed the check across the desk at me . I picked it up and gave it to McAllister without looking at it . I got to my feet . " Thank you again , Mr. Moroni . I 'm sorry I have to run but we have to get back to Nevada tonight . " " Tonight ? But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my own plane , Mr. Moroni . That 's how we came up . We 'll be home by nine o'clock . " Moroni came around his desk . There was a look of concern on his face . " Better fly low , Mr. Cord , " he said . " After all , we just gave you a lot of money . " I laughed aloud . " Do n't worry , Mr. Moroni . It 's as safe as an automobile . Besides , if anything happens to us on the way down , just stop payment on the check . " They both laughed . I could see the look of nervousness cross McAIlister 's face , but to his credit , he did n't say anything . We shook hands and Moroni walked us to the door . " Good luck , " he said as we walked out into the reception room . A man was sitting on the couch . He got to his feet slowly . I recognized Buzz Dalton , the pilot whose plane I had won in a crap game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you say hello to your friends ? " A smile broke over his face . " Jonas ! " he exclaimed . " What the hell are you doin ' here ? " " Diggin ' for a little scratch , " I said , taking his hand . " You ? " " The same , " he answered , a dejected look coming over his face again . " But no luck so far . " " Why ? " I asked . Buzz shrugged . " I got a mail contract . L.A. to Frisco . Twelve months guaranteed at ten thousand a month . But I guess I 'll have to pass it up . I ca n't get the dough to buy the three planes I need . Banks think it 's too risky . " " How much do you have to borrow ? " " About twenty-five grand , " he said . " Twenty for the planes and five to keep them flying until the first check comes in . " " Yuh got the contract ? " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked at it . " It sounds like a good deal to me . " " It is , " he answered . " I got it all worked out . I can net five grand a month after expenses and amortization . Here 's the paper I worked out on that . "  | The figures seemed right to me . I had a good idea what it cost to run a plane . I turned around and looked at Moroni . " You meant what you said in there ? About my additional credit ? There 's no strings on it ? " He smiled . " No strings at all . " I turned back to Buzz . " You got your money on two conditions , " I said . " I get fifty per cent of the stock in your company and chattel mortgage on your planes amortized over twelve months , both payable to the Cord Explosives Company . " Buzz 's face broke into a grin . " Man , you got yourself a deal ! " " O.K. , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be kind enough to arrange the details for me ? I have to be back tonight . " " I 'll be glad to , Mr. Cord . " He smiled . " Make the loan for thirty thousand dollars , " I said . " Hey , wait a minute , " Buzz interrupted . " I only asked for twenty-five . " " I know , " I said , turning back to him with a smile . " But I learned something today . " " What 's that ? " Buzz asked . " It 's bad business to lend a guy just enough money to give him the shorts . That 's takin ' a chance and you both can lose . If you really want him to make it , lend him enough to make sure he can do the job . " My father had the biggest funeral ever held in this part of the state . Even the Governor came down . I had closed the plant and the little church was packed to the rafters , with the overflow spilling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small pew down in front . She stood straight and tall in her black dress , her blond hair and her face hidden by the black veil . I looked down at the new black shoes on my feet . They were my father 's shoes and they hurt . At the last minute , I 'd discovered I did n't have anything in the house except huarachos . Robair had brought the shoes down from my father 's closet . He had never worn them . I promised myself I would never wear them again , either . I heard a sigh run through the congregation and looked up . They were closing my father 's coffin . I had a last quick glimpse of his face , then it was gone and there was a curious kind of blankness in my mind and for a moment I could n't even remember what he looked like . Then the sound of weeping came to my ears and I looked around out of the corners of my eyes . The Mex women from the plant were crying . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Jake Platt , tears in his whisky eyes .  | I looked at Rina standing next to me . I could see her eyes through the dark veil . They were clear and calm . From the congregation behind us came the sound of many people weeping for my father . But Rina , his wife , did n't weep . And neither did I , his son . 10 IT WAS A WARM NIGHT , EVEN WITH THE BREEZE THAT CAME IN through the open windows from across the desert . I tossed restlessly on the bed and pushed the sheets down from me . It had been a long day , starting with the funeral and then going over plans with McAllister until it was time for him to leave . I was tired but I could n't sleep . Too many thoughts were racing through my mind . I wondered if that was the reason I used to hear my father pacing up and down in his room long after the rest of the house had gone to bed . There was a sound at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stillness . " Who is it ? " The door opened farther and I could see her face ; the rest of her dissolved into the darkness along with the black negligee . Her voice was very low as she closed the door behind her . " I thought you might be awake , Jonas . I could n't sleep , either . " " Worried about your money ? " I asked sarcastically . " The check 's over there on the dresser along with the notes . Just sign the release and it 's yours . " " It is n't the money , " she said , coming still further into the room . " What is it , then ? " I asked coldly . " You came to say you 're sorry ? To express your sympathy ? Is this a condolence call ? " She was standing next to the bed now and looked down at me . " You do n't have to say things like that , Jonas , " she said simply . " Even if he was your father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 'm sorry . " But I was n't satisfied with that . " Sorry about what ? " I flung at her . " Sony he did n't give you more than he did ? Sorry that you did n't many me instead of him ? " I laughed bitterly . " You did n't love him . " " No , I did n't love him , " she said tightly . " But I respected him . He was more a man than anyone I ever met . " I did n't speak .  | Suddenly she was crying . She sat down on the edge of the bed and hid her face in her hands . " Cut it out , " I said roughly . " It 's too late for tears . " She put her hands down and stared at me . In the darkness , I could see the wet silver sparkle rolling down her cheeks . " What do you know it 's too late for ? " she cried . " Too late to love him ? It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not capable of love . I do n't know why . It 's the way I am , that 's all . Your father knew that and understood it . That 's why I married him . Not for his money . He knew that , too . And he was content with what I gave him . " " If that 's the truth , " I said , " then what are you crying for ? " " Because I 'm frightened , " she said . " Frightened ? " I laughed . It just did n't fit her . " What are you afraid of ? " She took a cigarette from somewhere in her negligee and put it in her mouth unlit . Her eyes shone at me like a panther 's eyes must in a desert campfire at night . " Men , " she said shortly . " Men ? " I repeated . " You  --  afraid of men ? Why , you 're the original teasing ? " " That 's right , you stupid fool ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their demands , putting up with their lecherous hands and one-track minds . And hearing them disguise their desire with the words of love when all they want is just one thing . To get inside me ! " " You 're crazy ! " I said angrily . " That 's not the only thing we think of ! " " No ? " she asked . I heard the rasp of a match and the flame broke the darkness . She looked down at me . " Then look at yourself , Jonas . Look at yourself lusting for your father 's wife ! " I did n't have to look to know she was right . I knocked the match angrily from her hand . Then , all at once , she was clinging to me , her lips placing tiny kisses on my face and chin , her body trembling with her fears . " Jonas , Jonas . Please let me stay with you . Just for tonight , " she cried . " I 'm afraid to be alone ! " I raised my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black negligee . Her flesh was cool and soft as the summer desert breeze and her thrusting nipples rasped across the palms of my rising hands . I froze , staring at her in the darkness . There was only her face before me , then the taste of her salty tears on her lips and mine . The anger inside me washed away in the cascading torrent of desire . And with only my devil to guide us , together we plunged into the fiery pleasures of our own particular hell .  | I awoke and glanced at the window . The first flicker of dawn was spilling into the room . I turned to look at Rina . She was lying on my pillow , her arm flung across her eyes . I touched her shoulder lightly . She took away her arm . Her eyes were open ; they were clear and calm . She got out of bed in a smooth , fluid motion . Her body shone with a young , golden translucence . She picked up her black negligee from the foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as she walked over to the dresser . " There 's a pen in the top right drawer , " I said . She took out the pen and signed the release . " Are n't you going to read it ? " I asked . She shook her head . " What for ? You ca n't get any more than I agreed to give you . " She was right . She had forgone all rights to any further claims in the estate . Picking up the check and the notes , she walked to the door . She turned there and looked back at me . " I wo n't be here when you get back from the plant . " I looked at her for a moment . " You do n't have to go , " I said . Her eyes met mine . I thought I caught a hint of sadness in them . " No , Jonas , " she said softly . " It would n't work out . " " Maybe , " I said . " No , Jonas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under the shadow of your father . He was a great man but so will you be . In your own way . " I reached for a cigarette on the bedside table and lit it without speaking . The smoke burned into my lungs . " Good-by , Jonas , " she said . " Good luck . " I stared at her for a moment , then I spoke . My voice was husky from the cigarette . " Thank you , " I said . " Good-by , Rina . " The door opened and shut quickly and she was gone . I got out of bed and walked over to the window . The first morning red of the sun was on the horizon . It was going to be a scorcher . I heard the door open behind me and my heart leaped inside my breast . She had come back . I turned around . Robair came into the room carrying a tray . His white teeth flashed in a gentle smile . " I thought you might do with a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jake Platt had a gang of men up on the roof , painting it white . I grinned to myself and went inside .  | That first day was hectic . It seemed that nothing went right . The detonator caps we had sent to Endicott Mines were faulted and we had to rush-ship replacements . For the third time that year , Du Pont underbid us on a government contract for pressed cordite . I spent half the day going over the figures and it finally boiled down to our policy on percentage of profit . When I suggested that we 'd better reexamine our policy if it was going to cost us business , Jake Platt protested . My father , he said , claimed it did n't pay them to operate on a basis of less than twelve per cent . I blew up and told Jake Platt that I was running the factory now and what my father had done was his own business . On the next bid , I 'd damn sure make certain we underbid Du Pont by at least three cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the production foreman came in with the production figures . I 'd just started to go over them when Nevada interrupted me . " Jonas , " he said . I looked up . He had been there in the office all day but he was quiet and sat in a corner and I had even forgotten that he was there . " Yes ? " I answered . " Is it all right if I leave a little early ? " he asked . " I got some things to do . " " Sure , " I said , looking down at the production sheets again . " Take the Duesenberg . I 'll get Jake to drive me home . " " I wo n't need it , " he said . " I left my own car in the lot . " " Nevada , " I called after him . " Tell Robair I 'll be home for dinner at eight o'clock . " There was a moment 's hesitation , then I heard his reply . " Sure thing , Jonas . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected and pulled the Duesenberg up in front of the house at seven thirty , just as Nevada came down the steps with a valise in each hand . He stared at me in a kind of surprise . " You 're home early . " " Yeah , " I answered . " I finished sooner than I thought . " " Oh , " he said and continued down the steps to his car . He put the valises in the back . I followed him down and I could see the back of his car was filled with luggage . " Where you going with all that stuff , Nevada ? " " It 's mine , " he said gruffly . " I did n't say it was n't , " I said . " I just asked where you were going . " " I 'm leavin ' . "  | " On a hunting trip ? " I asked . This was the time of the year Nevada and I always used to go up into the mountains when I was a kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Wait a minute , " I said . " You just ca n't walk out like that . " His dark eyes bore into mine . " Who says I ca n't ? " " I do , " I said . " How 'm I going to get along without you ? " He smiled slowly . " Real good , I reckon . You do n't need me to wetnurse you no more . I been watchin ' you the last few days . " " But  --  but , " I protested . Nevada smiled slowly . " All jobs got to end sometime , Jonas . I put about sixteen years into this one and now there 's nothing left for me to do . I do n't like the idea of drawing a salary with no real way to earn it . " I stared at him for a moment . He was right . There was too much man in him to hang around being a flunky . " You got enough money ? " He nodded . " I never spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pappy would n't let me . " " What are you going to do ? " " Join up with a couple of old buddies . We 're takin ' a Wild-West show up the coast to California . Expect to have a real big time . " We stood around awkwardly for a moment , then Nevada put out his hand . " So long , Jonas . " I held onto his hand . I could feel the tears hovering just beneath my eyelids . " So long , Nevada . " He walked around the car and got in behind the wheel . Starting the motor he shifted into gear . He raised his hand in farewell just as he began to roll . " Keep in touch , Nevada , " I yelled after him , and watched until he was out of sight . I walked back into the house and went into the dining room . I sat down at the empty table . Robair came in with an envelope in his hand . " Mr. Nevada left this for you , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written laboriously in pencil : DEAR SON , I ai n't much of a man for good-bys , so this is it . There ai n't nothing any more for me to do around here so I figure it 's time I went . All my life I wanted to give you something for your birthday but your pappy always beat me to it . Your pappy gave you everything . So until now there was nothing you ever wanted that I could give you . In this envelope you will find something you really want . You do n't  | " Now , mebbe , you 'll get used to it , " Charlie said . " After all , you own fifty per cent of this spread . Time you settled down and got to work on it . " " I do n't know , " Nevada said . " I kinda got me the travelin ' itch . I figger I been in one place long enough . " " Where you goin ' to travel ? " Charlie asked . " There ai n't no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to every place . You 're thirty years late . " Nevada nodded silently . Charlie was right but the strange thing was he did n't feel thirty years late . He felt the same as he always did . Right for now . " I put the woman in your cabin , " Charlie said . " Martha and I been waitin ' supper for you . " Nevada got back into the car . " Then I better go an ' get her . We 'll be back as soon as I git washed up . " Charlie nodded and went back inside as the car started off . At the door , he turned and looked after it as it wound its way up the small hill toward the back of the ranch . He shook his head and went inside . Martha was waiting for him . " How is he ? " she asked anxiously . " I do n't know , " he answered , shaking his head again . " He seems kinda mixed up an ' lost to me . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada went in . He reached for the oil lamp beside the door and put it on a table . He struck a match and held it to the wick . The wick sputtered a moment then burst into flame . He put the chimney back on and replaced the lamp on the shelf . Rina 's voice came from behind him . " Why did n't you turn on the electricity , Nevada ? " " I like lamp light , " he said simply . " Electric light ai n't natural . It 's wearin ' on the eyes . " She was sitting in a chair facing the door , her face pale and luminous . She was wearing a heavy sweater that came down over the faded blue jeans covering her legs . " You cold ? " he asked . " I 'll start a fire . " She shook her head . " I 'm not cold . " He stood there silent for a moment , then spoke . " I 'll bring in my things an ' wash up . Charlie and Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bring them in . " " O.K. " They came out into the night . The stars were deep in the black velvet and the sound of music and laughter came faintly to them from down the hill .  | She looked down toward the casino . " I 'm glad I 'm not one of them . " He handed her a suitcase . " You never could be . You ai n't the type . " " I thought of divorcing him , " she said . " But something inside me kept me from it even though I knew it was wrong from the beginning . " " A deal 's a deal , " he said shortly as he turned back into the cabin , his arms full . " I guess that 's it . " They made two more trips silently and then she sat down on the edge of the bed as he stripped off his shirt and turned to the washbasin in the corner of the small bedroom . The muscles rippled under his startlingly white skin . The hair covering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward his flat , hard stomach . He covered his face and neck with soap and then splashed water over it . He reached for a towel blindly . She gave it to him and he rubbed vigorously . He put down the towel and reached for a clean shirt . He slipped into it and began to button it . " Wait a minute , " she said suddenly . " Let me do that for you . " Her fingers were quick and light . He felt their touch against his skin like a whisper of air . She looked up into his face , her eyes wondering . " How old are you , Nevada ? Your skin is like a young boy 's . " He smiled suddenly . " How old ? " she persisted . " I was born in eighty-two , according to my reckoning , " he said . " My mother was a Kiowa and they did n't keep such good track of birthdays . That makes me forty-three . " He finished tucking the shirt into his trousers . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleased despite himself . " Let 's go and git some grub . " She took his arm . " Let 's , " she said . " Suddenly , I 'm starving . " It was after midnight when they got back to the cabin . He opened the door and let her enter before him . He crossed to the fireplace and set a match to the kindling . She came up behind him and he looked up . " You go on to bed , " he said . Silently she walked into the bedroom and he fanned the kindling . The wood caught and leaped into flame . He put a few logs over it and got up and crossed the room to a cupboard . He took down a bottle of bourbon and a glass and sat down in front of the fire . He poured a drink and looked at the whisky in the glass . The fire behind it gave it a glowing heat . He drank the whisky slowly . When he had finished , he put the empty glass down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the chair and walked over to the couch  | and stretched out . He had just lighted a cigarette when her voice came from the bedroom door . " Nevada ? " He sat up and turned toward her . " Yeah ? " " Did Jonas say anything about me ? " " No . " " He gave me a hundred thousand dollars for the stock and the house . " " I know , " he replied . She hesitated a moment , then came farther into the room . " I do n't need all that money . If you need any ? " He laughed soundlessly . " I 'm O.K. Thanks , anyway . " " Sure ? " He chuckled again , wondering what she would say if she knew about the six-thousand-acre ranch he had in Texas , about the half interest in the Wild-West show . He , too , had learned a great deal from the old man . Money was only good when it was working for you . " Sure , " he said . He got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed , Rina . You 're out on your feet . " He followed her into the bedroom and took a blanket from the closet as she got into bed . She caught his hands as he walked by the bed . " Talk to me while I fall asleep . " He sat down on the side of the bed . " What about ? " he asked . She still held onto his hand . " About yourself . Where you were born , where you came from  --  anything . " He smiled into the dark . " Ai n't very much to tell , " he said . " As far as I know , I was born in West Texas . My father was a buffalo-hunter named John Smith and my mother was a Kiowa princess named ? " " Do n't tell me , " she interrupted sleepily . " I know her name . Pocahontas . " He laughed softly . " Somebody told you , " he said in mock reproach . " Pocahontas . That was her name . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read it someplace . " Her hand slipped slowly from his and he looked down . Her eyes were closed and she was fast asleep . Quietly he got up and straightened the blanket around her , then turned and walked into the other room . He spread a blanket on the couch and undressed quickly . He stretched out and wrapped the blanket around him . John Smith and Pocahontas . He wondered how many times he had mockingly told that story . But the truth was stranger still . And probably , no one would believe it .  | It was so long ago that there were times he did n't believe it himself any more . His name was n't Nevada Smith then , it was Max Sand . And he was wanted for armed robbery and murder in three different states . 2 IT WAS IN MAY OF 1882 THAT SAMUEL SAND CAME INTO THE small cabin that he called home and sat down heavily on a box that served him for a chair . Silently his squaw woman heated some coffee and placed it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat there for a long time , his coffee growing cold before him . Occasionally , he would look out the door toward the prairie , with its faint remnant patches of snow still hidden in the corners of rises . The squaw began to cook the evening meal . Beans and salt buffalo meat . It was still early in the day to cook the meal , because the sun had not yet reached the noon , but she felt vaguely disturbed and had to do something . Now and then , she would glance at Sam out of the corners of her eyes but he was lost in a troubled world that women were not allowed to enter . So she kept stirring the beans and meat in the pot and waited for his mood and the day to pass . Kaneha was sixteen that spring and it was only the summer before that the buffalo-hunter had come to the tepees of her tribe to purchase a wife . He had come on a black horse , leading a mule that was burdened heavily with pack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet him . They sat down in a circle of peace around the fire with the pot of stew cooking over it . The chief took out the pipe and Sam took out a bottle of whisky . Silently the chief held the pipe to the glowing coals and then , when it was lit , held it to his mouth and puffed deeply . He passed it to Sam , who puffed and in turn passed it to the brave seated next to him in the circle . When the pipe came back to the chief , Sam opened the bottle of whisky . He wiped the rim of it carefully and tilted it to his lips , then offered it to the chief . The chief did the same and took a large swallow of the whisky . It burned his throat and his eyes watered and he wanted to cough , but he choked back the cough and passed the bottle to the brave seated next to him .  | When the bottle came back to Sam , he placed it on the ground in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat out of the pot . He chewed elaborately on the fatty morsel with much smacking of his lips and then swallowed it . He looked at the chief . " Good dog . " The chief nodded . " We cut out its tongue and kept it tied to a stake that it would be properly fat . " They were silent for a moment and the chief reached again for the bottle of whisky . Sam knew it was then time for him to speak . " I am a mighty hunter , " he boasted . " My gun has slain thousands of buffalo . My prowess is known all across the plains . There is no brave who can feed as many as I. " The chief nodded solemnly . " The deeds of Red Beard are known to us . It is an honor to welcome him to our tribe . " " I have come to my brothers for the maiden known as Kaneha , " Sam said . " I want her for my squaw . " The chief sighed slowly in relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored . For she was tall for a maiden , almost as tall as the tallest brave , and thin , her waist so thin that two hands could span it . There was not enough room inside her for a child to grow , and her face and features were straight and flat , not round and fat , as a maiden 's should be . The chief sighed again in relief . Kaneha would be no problem now . " It is a wise choice , " he said aloud . " The maiden Kaneha is ripe for child-bearing . Already her blood floods thickly to the ground when the moon is high . " Sam got to his feet and walked over to the mule . He opened one of the packs and took out six bottles of whisky and a small wooden box . He carried them back to the circle and placed them on the ground before him . He sat down again . " I have brought gifts to my brothers , the Kiowa , " he said . " In appreciation of the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their council . " He placed the whisky bottles in front of the chief and opened the little box . It was filled with gaily colored beads and trinkets . He held the box so that all could see and then placed it , too , before the chief . The chief nodded again . " The Kiowa is grateful for the gifts of Red Beard . But the loss of the maiden Kaneha will be a difficult one for her tribe to bear . Already she has won her place among us by her skills in her womanly crafts . Her cooking and sewing , her artistry in leather-making . " " I am aware of the high regard in which the Kiowa hold their daughter  | Kaneha , " Sam said formally . " And I came prepared to compensate them for their loss . " He got to his feet again . " For the loss of her aid in feeding the tribe , I pledge the meat of two buffalo , " he said , looking down at them . " For the loss of her labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought with me . And to compensate them for the loss of her beauty , I bring them ? " He paused dramatically and walked back to his mule . Silently he untied the heavy rolled pack on its back . He carried the pack back to the seated council and laid it on the ground before them . Slowly he unrolled it . A sigh of awe came unbidden from the circle . The chief 's eyes glittered . " ... the hide of the sacred white buffalo , " Sam said . He looked around the circle . Their eyes were fixed on the beautiful white skin that shone before them like snow on the ground . The albino buffalo was a rarity . The chief that could be laid to rest on such a sacred hide was assured that his spirit would enter the happy hunting grounds . To the skin-traders , it might be worth almost as much as ten ordinary hides . But Sam knew what he wanted . He wanted a woman . For five years , he had lived on these plains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore once a year at trading time in the small room back of the skin-trader 's post . It was time he had a woman of his own . The chief , so impressed with the munificence of Sam 's offer that he forgot to bargain further , looked up . " It is with honor that we give the mighty hunter Red Beard the woman Kaneha to be his squaw . " He rose to his feet as a sign that the council was over . " Prepare my daughter Kaneha for her husband , " he said . He turned and walked toward his tent and Sam followed him . In another tent , Kaneha sat waiting . Somehow , she had known that Red Beard had come for her . In keeping with maidenly modesty , she had gone into the waiting tent so that she might not hear the bargaining . She sat there calmly , for she was not afraid of Red Beard . She had looked into his face many times when he had come to visit her father . Now there was the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the flap . The bargaining was over . She only hoped that Red Beard had at least offered one buffalo for her . The women burst into the tent . They were all talking at once . No bride had ever brought greater gifts . The mule . Beads . Whisky . The hide of a sacred white buffalo . ' Iivo buffalo for meat . Kaneha smiled proudly to herself . In that moment , she knew that Red Beard loved her . From outside the tent came the sound of the drums  | beginning to beat out the song of marriage . The women gathered in a circle around her , their feet stamping in time to the drums . She dropped her shift to the ground and the women came close . One on each side of her began to unplait the long braid that hung past her shoulders . Pvo others began to cover her body with grease from the bear , which was to make her fertile . At last , all was done and they stepped back . She stood there naked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body shone with the grease and she was straight and tall , her breasts high and her stomach flat , her legs straight and long . The flap opened and the medicine man entered . In one hand he carried the devil wand , in the other the marriage stick . He shook the devil wand in the four corners of the tent and sprang twice into the air to make sure there were no devils hovering over them , then he advanced toward her . He held the marriage stick over her head . She looked up at it . It was made of highly polished wood , carved into the shape of an erect phallus and testes . Slowly he lowered it until it rested on her forehead . She closed her eyes because it was not seemly for a maiden to look so deeply into the source of a warrior 's strength . The medicine man began to dance around her , springing high into the air and mumbling incantations over her . He pressed the stick to her breasts , to her stomach , to her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until now it was covered with the bear grease from her body . Finally , he leaped into the air with a horrible shriek and when his feet touched the earth again , everything was silent , even the drums . As in a trance , she took the marriage stick from the medicine man . Silently she held it to her face , then her breasts , then her stomach . The drums began again , beating slowly . In time with their rhythm , she lowered the stick between her legs . Her feet began to move in time to the drums , slowly at first , then faster as the drums picked up tempo . Her long black hair , which hung to her buttocks , began to flare out wildly as she began to move around the circle of women , holding out the marriage stick for their blessing and cries of envy . The circle completed , she once more stood alone in its center , her feet moving in time with the drums . Holding the marriage stick between her legs , she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai-ee , " the women sighed as they swayed to the tempo of the drums . " Ai-ee , " they sighed again in approbation as she lifted herself from the stick . It was not seemly for a maiden to be too eager to swallow up her husband . Now they held their breath as once more the stick began to enter her . Each was reminded of her own marriage , when she , too , had looked up at  | the circle of women , her eyes pleading for help . But none dared move forward . This the bride must do for herself . Through Kaneha 's pain , the drums began to throb . Her lips grew tight together . This was her husband , Red Beard , the mighty hunter . She must not disgrace him here in the tent of women . When he himself came into her , instead of his spirit , the way for him must be easy and quick . She closed her eyes and made a sudden convulsive movement . The hymen ruptured and she staggered as a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Slowly she straightened up and removed the marriage stick . She held it out proudly toward the medicine man . He took it and quickly left the tent . Silently the women formed a circle around her . Naked , in its center so she would be shielded from other eyes , she walked to the tent of the chief . The women stood aside as she entered . In the dim light , the chief and Sam looked up at her . She stood there proudly , her head raised , her eyes respectfully looking over their heads . Her breasts heaved and her legs trembled slightly . She prayed that Red Beard would be pleased with what he saw . The chief spoke first , as was the custom . " See how profusely she bleeds , " he said . " She will bear you many sons . " " Aye , she will bear me many sons , " Sam said , his eyes on her face . " And because I am pleased with her , I pledge my brothers the meat of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent to go down to the river to bathe . Her prayers had been answered . Red Beard was pleased with her . Now she moved heavily , swollen with his child , as he sat at the table wondering why the buffalo did n't come . Something inside him told him they would never come again . Too many had been slain in the last few years . At last , he looked up from the table . " Git the gear together , " he said . " We 're moving out of here . " Kaneha nodded and obediently began to gather up the household things while he went out and hitched the mules to the cart . Finished , he came back to the cabin . Kaneha picked up the first bundle and started for the door when the pain seized her . The bundle fell from her hands and she doubled over . She looked up at him , her eyes filled with meaning . " You mean now ? " Sam asked , almost incredulously . She nodded . " Here , let me help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving her . " No , " she said firmly in Kiowa . " This is for a woman , not for a brave . " Sam nodded . He walked to the door . " I 'll be outside . " It was two o'clock in the morning when he first heard the cry of a baby from inside the cabin . He had been half dozing and the sound brought him awake into a night filled with stars . He sat there tensely , listening . About twenty minutes passed , then the door of the cabin opened and Kaneha stood there . He struggled to his feet and went into the cabin . In the corner on a blanket in front of the fire lay the naked baby . Sam stood there , looking down . " A son , " Kaneha said proudly . " Well , I 'll be damned . " Sam touched it and the baby squalled , opening its eyes . " A son , " Sam said . " How about that ? " He bent over , looking closely . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin was white and the eyes were blue like the father 's , but the hair was black and heavy on his little head . The next morning they left the cabin . 3 THEY SETTLED DOWN ABOUT TWENTY MILES OUTSIDE OF DODGE City and Sam started to haul freight for the stage lines . Being the only man in the area with mules , he found himself in a fairly successful business . They lived in a small cabin and it was there Max began to grow up . Kaneha was very happy with her son . Occasionally , she would wonder why the spirits had not given her more children but she did not worry about it . Because she was Indian , they kept to themselves . Sam liked it that way , too . Basically , he was a very shy man and his years alone on the plains had not helped cure his shyness . He developed a reputation in the town for being taciturn and stingy . There were rumors floating around that actually he had a hoard of gold cached out on his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Max was eleven years old , he was as lithe and quick on his feet as his Indian forebears . He could ride any horse he chose without a saddle and could shoot the eye out of a prairie gopher at a hundred yards  | with his .22 . His black hair hung straight and long , Indian fashion , and his eyes were dark blue , almost black in his tanned face . They were seated at the table one night , eating supper , when Sam looked over at his son . " They 're startin ' up a school in Dodge , " he said . Max looked up at his father as Kaneha came to the table from the stove . He did n't know whether he was supposed to speak or not . He kept eating silently . " I signed you up for it , " Sam said . " I paid ten dollars . " Now Max felt it was time for him to speak . " What fer ? " " To have them learn you to read an ' write , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that fer ? " Max asked . " A man should know them things , " Sam said . " You do n't , " Max said with the peculiar logic of children . " And it do n't bother you none . " " Times is different now , " Sam said . " When I was a boy , there war n't no need for such things . Now ever'thing is readin ' or writin ' " " I do n't want to go . " " You 're goin ' , " Sam said , roaring suddenly . " I already made arrangements . You can sleep in the back of Olsen 's Livery Stable durin ' the week . " Kaneha was n't quite sure she understood what her husband was saying . " What is this ? " she asked in Kiowa . Sam answered in the same language . " A source of big knowledge . Without it , our son can never be a great chief among the White Eyes . " This was enough reason for Kaneha . " He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big medicine . She went back to her stove . The next Monday , Sam brought Max over to the school . The teacher , an impoverished Southern lady , came to the door and smiled at Sam . " Good morning , Mr. Sand , " she said . " Good mornin ' , ma'am . I brought my son to school . " The teacher looked at him , then at Max , then around the yard in front of the school cabin . " Where is he ? " she asked in a puzzled voice . Sam pushed Max forward . Max stumbled slightly and looked up at the teacher . " Say howdy to yer teacher , " Sam said . Max , uncomfortable in his clean buckskin shirt and leggings , dug his bare feet into the dirt and spoke shyly . " Howdy , ma'am . " The teacher looked down at him in stunned surprise . Her nose wrinkled up in disgust . " Why , he 's an Indian ! " she cried . " We do n't take Indians in this school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son , ma'am . " The teacher curled her lip cuttingly . " We do n't take half-breeds in this  | school , either . This school is for white children only . " She began to turn her back . Sam 's voice stopped her . It was icy cold as he made probably the longest speech he ever made in his life . " I do n't know nothin ' about your religion , ma'am , nor do I mind how you believe . All I do know is you 're two thousand miles from Virginia an ' you took my ten dollars to teach my boy the same as you took the money from ever'body else at the meetin ' in the general store . If you 're not goin ' to learn him the way you agreed , you better take the next stage back East . " The teacher stared at him indignantly . " Mr. Sand , how dare you talk to me like that ? Do you think the parents of the other children would want them to attend school with your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sam said . " I did n't hear none of them say no . " The teacher looked at him . Sam could see the fight go out of her . " I 'll never understand you Westerners , " she said helplessly . She looked down at Max disapprovingly . " At any rate , we ca n't have him in school in those clothes . He 'll have to wear proper clothes like the other children . " " Yes , ma'am , " Sam said . He turned to Max . " Come on , " he said . " We 're goin ' to the store to get you regular clothes . " " While you 're at it , " she said , " get him a haircut . That way , he wo n't seem any different from the others . " Sam nodded . He knew what she meant . " I will , ma'am , " he said . " Thank you , ma'am . " Max trotted along beside him as they strode down toward the general store . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he had thought about it . " Am I different than the others , Pa ? " Sam looked down at him . It was the first time he 'd thought about it , too . A sudden sadness came into him . He knelt down in the dust of the street beside his son . He spoke with the sudden knowledge that came from living off the earth . " Of course you 're different , " he said , looking into Max 's eyes . " Everybody in this world is different , like there are no two buffalo alike or no two mules . Everybody is alike an ' yet everybody is different . " By the end of Max 's first year in school , the teacher was very proud of him . Much to her surprise , he had turned out to be her best pupil . His mind was quick and bright and he learned easily . When the term ended , she made sure to get Sam 's promise that his son would return in the fall . When the school closed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from Olsens ' and settled down . During that first week , he was kept busy repairing all the damage done to the cabin by the winter . One evening , after Max had gone to bed , Kaneha turned to her husband . " Sam , " she said in English . Sam almost dropped the leather harness on which he had been working . It was the first time in all their years together that she had called him by name . Kaneha felt the blood rush into her face . She wondered at her temerity . Squaws never spoke to their husband except in reply . She looked down at the floor in front of her . " It is true that our son has done well in the school of the White Eyes ? " She could feel his gaze boring into her . " It 's true , " she heard his voice reply . " I am proud of our son , " she said , lapsing into Kiowa . " And I am grateful to his father , who is a mighty hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , still watching . " While it is true that our son learns many things in the school of the White Eyes that make mighty medicine , there are things also that he learns that disturb him greatly . " " Such as ? " Sam asked gently . She looked up into his face proudly . " There are some among the White Eyes who say to our son that he is less than they , that his blood does not run red like theirs . " Sam 's lips tightened . He wondered how she would know this . She never came into town , she never left the place . He felt a vague guilt stir inside him . " They are stupid children , " he said . " I know , " she said simply . He reached out his hand and touched her cheek gratefully . She caught his hand and held it to her cheek . " I think it is time we send our son to the tents of the mighty chief , his grandfather , so that he may learn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . In many ways , it was a wise suggestion . In one summer with the Kiowa , Max would learn all the things he needed to survive in this land . He would also learn that he came from a family that could trace its blood further back than any of the jackals who tormented him . He nodded . " I will take our son to the tents of my brothers , the Kiowa , " he said . He looked at her again . He was now fifty-two and she was little more than half his age . She was still straight and slim and strong ; she had never run to fat the way Indian women usually did . He felt his heart begin to swell inside him .  | He let the harness drop from his hand and he drew her head down to his chest . His hand stroked her hair gently . Suddenly he knew what he had felt deep inside him all these years . He turned her face up to him . " I love you , Kaneha , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . " I love you , my husband . " And for the first time , he kissed her on the mouth . 4 IT WAS ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON THREE summers later when Max stood on a wagon in the yard back of Olsen 's Livery Stable , pitching hay up into the open loft over his head . He was naked above his buckskin breeches and his body was burnt a coppery black by the blazing sun that hung overhead . The muscles rippled easily in his back as he forked the hay up from the did not dismount but sat there , looking at him . Max did not interrupt his work and after a moment , one of them spoke . " Hey , Injun , " he said . " Where is the Sand boy ? " Max threw another forkful into the loft . Then he sank the pitchfork into the hay and looked down at them . " I 'm Max Sand , " he said easily , resting on the fork handle . The men exchanged meaningful looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who had spoken before said . Max stared at them without answering . His blue eyes were dark and unreadable . " We were over at the stage line but the place was closed . There was a sign there that said your pappy hauled freight . " " That 's right , " Max said . " But this is Saturday afternoon an ' he 's gone home . " One of the others pushed forward . " We  --  got a wagonload of freight we got to get over to Virginia City , " he said . " We 're in a hurry . We 'd like to talk to him . " Max picked up the pitchfork again . He tossed another forkful of hay into the loft . " I 'll tell him when I get home tonight . " " We cai n't wait that long , " the first man said . " We want to make the deal and get on out of here tonight . How do we find your place ? "  | Max looked at them curiously . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run of people that had freight for his father to haul . They looked more like gunmen or drifters , the way they sat there with their guns tied low on their legs , their hats shading their faces . " I 'll be th'ough here in a couple of hours , " Max said . " I 'll take you out there . " " I said we was in a hurry , boy . Your pappy wo n't like it none if he hears we gave our load to somebody else . " Max shrugged his shoulders . " Follow the north road out about twenty miles . " Without another word the three turned their horses around and began to ride out of the yard . Their voices floated back on the lazy breeze . " Yuh 'd think with all the dough of Sand 's got buried , he 'd do better than bein ' a squaw man , " one of them said . Max heard the others laugh as he angrily pitched hay up into the loft . It was Kaneha who heard them first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon for it was then that Max came home from school . She went to the door and opened it . " Three men come , " she said , looking out . Sam got up from the table and walked behind her and looked out . " Yeah , " he said , " I wonder what they want . " Kaneha had a premonition of danger . " Bolt the door and do not let them enter , " she said . " They ride silently like Apache on the warpath , not open like honest men . " Sam laughed . " You 're just not used to seein ' people , " he said . " They 're probably jus ' lookin ' for the way to town . " " They come from the direction of town , " Kaneha said . But it was too late . He was already outside the door . " Howdy , " he called as they pulled their horses up in front of the cabin . " You Sam Sand ? " the one in the lead asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do for you gents ? " " We got a load we want hauled up to Virginia City , " the man said . He took off his hat and wiped his face on his sleeve . " It 's pow'ful hot today . " " It shore is , " Sam nodded . " Come on inside and cool off a bit while we talk about it . " The men dismounted and Sam walked into the cabin . " Fetch a bottle of whisky , " he said to Kaneha . He turned back to the men . " Set yourself down . What kind'a freight yuh got ? " " Gold . "  | " Gold ? " Sam asked . " They ai n't enough gold out heah to haul in a wagon . " " That ai n't what we hear , " one of the men said . Suddenly there were guns in their hands . " We hear you got enough gold buried out heah to fill up a wagon . " Sam stared at them for a moment , then he laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Yuh don ' believe that crazy yarn , do yuh ? " The first man came slowly toward him . His arm flashed and the gun whipped across Sam 's face . Sam fell backward against the wall . He stared up at the man incredulously . " Yuh 'll tell us where it is befo ' we through , " the man said tightly . The air in the cabin was almost unbearably hot . The three men had drawn off into a corner and were whispering among themselves . Occasionally they would glance across the room at their captives . Sam hung limply , tied to the support post in the center of the cabin . His head sagged down on his naked chest and the blood dropped down his face , matting on the graying red hair of his beard and chest . His eyes were swollen and almost closed , his nose broken and squashed against his cheek . Kaneha was tied in a chair . Her eyes were fixed unblinkingly on her husband . She strained to turn her head to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not move , she was bound too tightly . " Mebbe he ai nt ' really got the gold , " one of the men whispered . " He 's got it all right , " the first one said . " He 's jus ' tough . Yuh don ' know them of buffalo hunters like I do . " " Well , you ai n't never goin ' to make him talk the way yuh 're goin ' , " the short man said . " He 's gon na die first . " " He 'll talk , " the first man answered . He went to the stove and took a I burning coal from it with a pair of fire tongs . He walked back to Sam and pulled his head back against the post by his hair . He held the tongs in front of Sam 's face . " Wheah 's the gold ? " Sam 's eyes were open . His voice was a husky croak . " They ai n't none . For God 's sake would n't I tell yuh if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Sam 's neck and shoulder . Sam screamed in pain . " They ai n't no gold ! " His head fell sideways . The man withdrew the burning coal and the blood welled up beneath the scorched flesh and ran down his chest and arm . The man picked up a bottle of whisky from the table and took a swig from it . " Th'ow some water on him , " he said . " If n he wo n't talk for hisself , mebbe he 'll talk for his squaw. "  | The youngest man picked up a pail and threw water over Sam . Sam shook his head and opened his eyes . He stared at them . The oldest man put the bottle down and walked over to Kaneha . He took a hunting knife from his belt . The other men 's eyes followed him . He cut the rope that bound her to the chair . " On yer feet , " he said harshly . Silently Kaneha rose . The man 's knife moved quickly behind her and her shift fell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The youngest man licked his lips . He reached for the whisky and took a drink , his eyes never leaving her . Holding Kaneha by the hair , his knife to her back , the oldest man pushed her over toward Sam . They stopped in front of him . " It 's been fifteen years since I skinned an Injun , squaw man , " he said . " But I ai n't fergot how . " He moved swiftly around in front of her , his knife moving lightly up and down her skin . A faint thin line of blood appeared where the knife had traced from under her chin down her throat through the valley between her breasts across her stomach and coming to a stop in the foliage of her pubis . Sam began to cry , his own pain forgotten , his body wracked with bitter sobs . " Leave her be , " he pleaded . " Please leave her be . They ai n't no gold . " Kaneha reached out her hand . She touched her husband 's face gently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said in Kiowa . " The spirits will return evil to those who bring it . " Sam 's face fell forward , the tears running down from his eyes across his bearded and bleeding cheeks . " I am sorry , my dear one , " he said in Kiowa . " Tie her hands to the legs of that table , " the older man commanded . It was done quickly and he knelt over her , his knife poised at her throat . He looked back up toward Sam . " The gold ? " he asked . Sam shook his head . He could not speak any more . " My God , " the youngest man said in a wondering voice . " I 'm gittin ' a hard on . " " That 's an idee , " the man with the knife said . He looked up at Sam . " I 'm shoah the man wouldn ' min ' if n we used his squaw a little bit before we skinned her .

" Hold her laigs , " he said . " I 'll go first . "  | It was almost seven o'clock when Max rode up to the cabin on the bay horse that Olsen lent him . The cabin was still and there was no smoke hi coming from the chimney . That was strange . Usually , his mother would be cooking when he got home . He swung down off the horse and started for the cabin . He stopped suddenly , staring at it . The door was open and moved lazily in the thin breeze . An inexplicable fear came into him and he broke into a run . He burst through the door and came to a stop in surprised shock , his eyes widening in horror . His father hung tied to the center post , his mouth and eyes open in death , the back of his head blown away by the .45 that had been placed in his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . There was a shapeless mass lying in a pool of blood , which bore the outline of what once had been his mother . The paralysis left him at the same moment he started to scream , but the vomit that rose in his throat choked off the sound . Again and again he gagged until there was no more inside him . He clung weakly to the side of the door , the sour stench from his stomach all around . He turned and staggered blindly out of the cabin . He sank to the ground outside and began to cry . After a while , his tears were gone . He rose to his feet wearily and walked around to the back of the house to the watering trough . He plunged his head in and washed the vomit from his face and clothing . Then , still dripping , he straightened up and looked around . His father 's horse was gone but the six mules were browsing unconcernedly in the corral and the wagon was still under the lean-to in back of the cabin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so proud were still in the pen . I He wiped his arms across his eyes . He had to do something , he thought ! vaguely . But he could n't bring himself to bury what was in the cabin . They were n't his mother and father ; his parents could never look like that . There was only one thing to do . He walked over to the stack of firewood and gathered up an armful . Then he walked back into the house and put it down on the floor . It took him almost a half hour until firewood lay'covering the floor like a blanket , three layers thick . He looked at it thoughtfully for a moment then turned and went outside again . He took the harness down from the lean-to wall and hitched the mules up to the wagon . He picked up a crate and went through the pen , throwing all the chickens into it . He placed the crate in the wagon . Then one by I one , he lifted the sheep into the wagon and tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of mules and the wagon around to the front of the cabin and tied the bay horse 's lead to the back of the wagon . Then he walked them all to the road about two hundred yards from the house and tethered the team to a small scrub tree and went back to the house . He picked up the pitch bucket and went inside . Slowly he smeared the pitch over the firewood that lay on the floor . He kept his eyes down and away from the bodies of his parents . He stopped at the door and smeared the last of the pitch on that . He hesitated a moment , then remembering something , he went back into the cabin . He reached up on the shelf where his father had kept his rifle and pistol but they were not there . He pushed his hand farther along the shelf and felt something soft . He took it down . It was a new buckskin shirt and breeches his mother had made for him . It was bright and soft and clean-chamois colored . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under his arm and went back to the door . He held a match to the pitch stick until it was blazing brightly . After holding it for a second more to make sure , he threw it into the cabin and stepped back from the open door . He looked up at the sky in sudden surprise . The sun had just gone down and night had fallen in quick anger . The stars stared balefully down on him . A cloud of heavy , billowing smoke poured out of the doorway . Suddenly , there was a crack like thunder and a flame leaped through the doorway as the tinder-dry wood caught fire . He walked down to the road and got up on the wagon and began to drive to town . He did not look back until three miles later , when he reached the top of a small rise . There was a bright-orange flame reaching high into the sky where his home had been . 5 HE DROVE THE WAGON INTO THE YARD BEHIND OLSEN 'S LIVERY Stable . Then he got down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He climbed up the back steps and knocked at the door . " Mister Olsen , " he called out .  | A shadow darkened the light of the window . The door opened and Olsen stood there . " Max ! " he said . " What you doin ' back here ? " Max stared up into Olsen 's face . " They killed my ma and pa , " he said . " Killed ? " Olsen exclaimed in surprise . " Who killed ? " Attracted by the sound of her husband 's voice , Mrs. Olsen appeared in the doorway behind him . " The three men , " Max said . " They asked me an ' I gave them the directions to my house . An ' they killed ' em . " He hesitated a moment and his voice almost broke . " An ' they stole Pa 's hoss an ' took his rifle an ' pistol , too . " Mrs. Olsen saw into the shock that lay behind the boy 's facade of calm . She pushed her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You come inside an ' let me fix you somethin ' hot to drink , " she said . He looked into her eyes . " They ai n't time , ma'am , " he said . " I got to be gettin ' after them . " He turned to Olsen . " I got the mules an ' the wagon an ' four sheep an ' sixteen chickens outside in the yard . Would you give me a hundred dollars an ' the pinto for ' em ? " Olsen nodded . " Why , sure , boy , " he said . The mules and the wagon alone were worth three times that . " I 'll even give you the big bay if you want . He 's a better hoss . An ' I 'll throw in a saddle , too . " Max shook his head . " No , thank you , Mr. Olsen . I want a pony I can ride without a saddle an ' one that 's used to the plains . He wo n't have as much to tote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , if that 's the way you want it . " " Can I have the money now ? " Max asked . " Sure , boy , " Olsen answered . He turned back into the room . Mrs. Olsen 's voice stopped him . " Oh , no , you 're not , " she said . She drew Max into the house firmly . " First , he 's goin ' to eat something . Then he 's goin ' to sleep . Time enough in the morning for him to start . " " But they 'll be further away by then , " Max protested . " No they wo n't , " she said with woman 's logic . " They got to stop to sleep , too . They wo n't be any further ahead of you then than they are right now . " She closed the door behind him and led him over to the table . She pushed him into a chair and placed a plate of soup in front of him . Automatically he began to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , " Mr. Olsen said . When he came back into the house , Max was sleeping , his head resting in his crossed arms on the table . Mrs. Olsen gestured her husband to silence . " You just ca n't let him go after those men by himself , " she whispered .  | " I got to go , ma'am . " Max 's voice came over her shoulder . She turned around and looked at him . " You ca n't , " she cried out . " They 're grown men an ' they 'll hurt you . Why , you 're just a boy ! " He looked up into her face and she was aware for the first time of the pride that glowed deep in those dark-blue eyes . " They hurt me all they 're goin ' to , ma'am , " he said . " I 'm ' bout sixteen , an ' with my mother 's people , a boy ai n't a boy no more once he 's sixteen . He 's a man . " On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a walk and studied the side of the road carefully . After a few minutes , he stopped and dismounted . He looked along the edge of the road carefully . The four horses had stopped here . They had milled around for a little while and then two of them had gone back onto the road toward Virginia City . The other two had gone eastward across the plains . He remounted and rode along the plains , his eyes searching out the trail until he found what he was looking for . One of the horses had been his father 's . He recognized the shoe marking in the soft earth . It was lighter than the other marking , which meant he was not being ridden , but led . It also meant that the man up ahead must have been the leader , otherwise they would n't have let him take the horse , which was the most valuable thing they had stolen . A few miles farther along the trail , he saw some horse droppings . He stopped his horse and jumped down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not more than seven hours old . They had wasted more time along the trail than he 'd thought they would . He got back on the pinto and pushed on . He rode most of that night , following the trail in the bright moonlight . By the evening of the next day , he was less than an hour behind his quarry . He looked up at the sky . It was about seven o'clock and would be dark soon . The man would be stopping to make camp if he had n't already . Max got off his horse and waited for night to fall . While he sat there , he cut a forked branch from a scrub tree and fitted a round stone onto it . Then he bound the stone to the crotch with thin strips of leather , winding them down the branch to make a handle . When he was finished , he had a war club as good as any he 'd learned to make the summer he spent with the Kiowa . It was dark then and he got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took the horse by the halter and started forward cautiously on foot . He walked slowly , his ears alert for any strange sound , his nostrils sniffing at the breeze for the scent of a campfire . He was in luck , for he caught the scent of the campfire from about a  | quarter mile away . He tied the pinto to a bush and pulled the rifle from the pack on the horse 's back . Silently he moved forward . The whinny of a horse came to his ears and he dropped to the ground and peered forward . He figured the horses were tied about three hundred yards ahead of him . He looked for the campfire but could n't find it . Cautiously he made his way downwind from the horses in a wide circle . The smell of the campfire was strong in his nostrils now . He raised his head from the tall plain grass . The campfire was about two hundred yards in front of him . He could see the man , sitting hunched over it , eating from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had picked a camp site between two rocks . That way , he could be approached only from in front . Max sank back into the grass . He would have to wait until the man was asleep . He stretched out and looked up at the sky . When the moon was up , a few hours from now , it would be time for him to move . Until then , it would do no harm for him to rest . He closed his eyes . In a moment , he was sleeping soundly . His eyes opened suddenly and he stared straight up at the moon . It hung white and high in the sky over him . He sat up slowly and peered over the grass . The campfire was glowing faintly now , dying slowly . He could see the shadow of the man lying near the rocks . He started to inch forward . The man snored lightly and turned in his sleep . Max froze for a moment , then the figure was still again and Max inched forward a little farther . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tip of the fingers . He crawled around behind and picked up a small pebble from the ground beside him . Silently he took the war club from his belt and got up into a half crouch . Holding his breath in tightly , he threw the stone near the man 's feet . With a muttered curse , he sat up , looking forward , his gun in his hand . He never knew what hit him as Max brought the war club down on his head from behind . Max came back with the pinto about the time that dawn was breaking in the east . He tied his horse to the scrub near the others and walked back to look at the man . His eyes were still closed . He was breathing evenly though there was a smear of blood along his cheek and ear where the club had caught him . He lay naked on his back on the ground , his arms and legs outstretched tautly , staked to the ground . Max sat down on the rock and began to whet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , the man opened his eyes . They were dull  | at first , then gradually they began to clear . He tried to sit up and became aware that he was tied down . He twisted his head and looked at Max . " What 's the idee ? " he asked . Max stared at him . He did n't stop whetting his knife . " I 'm Max Sand , " he said . " Remember me ? " Max walked over to him . He stood there looking down , the knife held loosely in his hand . There was a sick feeling inside him as he looked at the man and pictured what must have happened in the cabin . The image chased the feeling from him . When he spoke , his voice was calm and emotionless . " Why did you kill my folks ? " " I did n't do nothing to them , " the man said , his eyes watching the knife . " You got my pa 's hoss out there . " " He sol ' it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sell the on'y hoss he had , " Max said . " Let me up outa here , " the man screamed suddenly . Max held the knife to the man 's throat . " You want to tell me what happened ? " " The others did it ! " the man screamed . " I had nothin ' to do with it . They wanted the gold ! " His eyes bugged out hysterically . In his fear , he began to urinate , the water trickling down his bare legs . " Le ' me go , you crazy Injun bastard ! " he screamed . Max moved swiftly now . All the hesitation that he had felt was gone . He was the son of Red Beard and Kaneha and inside him was the terrible vengeance of the Indian . His knife flashed bright in the morning sun and when he straightened up the man was silent . Max looked down impassively . The man had only fainted , even though his eyes stared upward , open and unseeing . His eyelids had been slit so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like strips of ribbon down his body from his shoulders to his thighs . Max turned and walked until he found an anthill . He scooped the top of it up in his hands and went back to the man . Carefully he set it down on the man 's pubis . In a moment , the tiny red ants were everywhere on the man . They ran into all the blood-sweetened crevices of his body , up across his eyes and into his open mouth and nostrils . The man began to cough and moan . His body stirred . Silently Max watched him . This was the Indian punishment for a thief , rapist and murderer . It took the man three days to die . Three days of the blazing sun burning into his open eyes and blistering his torn flesh while the ants industriously foraged his body . Three days of screaming for water and three nights of  | agony as insects and mosquitoes , drawn by the scent of blood , came to feast upon him . At the end , he was out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down to look at him , he was dead . Max stared at him for a moment , then took out his knife and lifted his scalp . He went back to the horses and mounted his pinto . Leading the other two animals , he turned and rode north toward the land of the Kiowa . The old chief , his grandfather , came out of his tepee to watch him as he dismounted . He waited silently until Max came up to him . Max looked into the eyes of the old man . " I come in sadness to the tents of my people , " he said in Kiowa . The chief did not speak . " My father and mother are dead , " he continued . The chief still did not speak . Max reached to his belt and took off the scalp that hung there . He threw it down in front of the chief . " I have taken the scalp of one of the murderers , " he said . " And I come to the tent of my grandfather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow . " The chief looked down at the scalp , then up at Max . " We are no longer free to roam the plains , " he said . " We live on the land that the White Eyes allow us . Have any of them seen you as you approached ? " " None saw me , " Max answered . " I came from the hills behind them . " The chief looked down at the scalp again . It had been a long time since the scalp of an enemy hung from the post before his tepee . His heart swelled with pride . He looked at Max . The White Eyes could imprison the bodies but they could not imprison the spirit . He picked up the scalp and hung it from the post then turned back to Max . " A tree has many branches , " he said slowly . " And when some branches fall or are cut down , other branches must be grown to take their place so their spirits may find where to live . " He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a maiden whose brave was killed in a fall from his horse two suns ago . She had already taken the marriage stick and now must live alone in a tent by the river until his spirit is replaced in her . Go now and take her . " Max stared at him . " Now ? " he asked . The chief thrust the feather into his hand . " Now , " he said , with the knowledge of all his years . " It is the best time , while the spirit of war and vengeance still rages like a torrent in your blood . It is the best time to take a woman . " Max turned and picked up the lead and walked down through the camp with the horses . The Indians watched him silently as he passed by . He  | walked slowly with his head held high . He reached the bank of the small river and followed it around a bend . A single tent stood there , out of sight of the rest of the camp . Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs and lifted the flap of the tent and walked in . The tent was empty . He lifted the flap again and looked out . There was no one in sight . He let the flap down . He walked to the back of the tent and sat down on a bed of skins stretched out on the floor . A moment later the girl came in . Her hair and body were wet from the river and her dress clung to her . Her eyes went wide as she saw him . She stood there poised for flight . She was n't much more than a child , Max saw . Fourteen , maybe fifteen at the most . Suddenly he knew why the chief had sent him down here . He picked up the feather and held it toward her . " Do n't be afraid , " he said gently . " The mighty chief has put us together so that we may drive the devils from each other . " 6 ASTRIDE THE WIRY PINTO , MAX CAME DOWN THE RAMP FROM the railroad car behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the last steer had entered the stockyard and then dropped the gate bet hind it . He took off his hat and wiped the sweat from his forehead on his sleeve and looked up at the sun . It hung almost overhead , white hot , baking into the late spring dust of the yards . The cattle lowed softly as if somehow they , too , knew they had come to the end of the road . The long road that led up from Texas , to a railroad that took them to Kansas City , and their impending doom . Max put the hat back on his head and squinted down the fence to where the boss sat with the cattle-buyers . He rode down toward them . Farrar turned as he stopped his horse beside them . " They all in ? " " They all in , Mr. Farrar , " Max answered . " Good , " Farrar said . He turned to one of the cattle-buyers . " The count O.K. " Eleven hundred and ten head I make it . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrar got down from the fence . " I 'll come over to your office this afternoon to pick up the check . "  | The buyer nodded . " It 'll be ready . " Farrar got up on his horse . " C'm on , kid , " he said over his shoulder . " Let 's get over to the hotel and wash some of this steer-shit stink off n us . " Man , " Farrar said , after a bath . " I feel twenty pounds lighter . " Max straightened up from putting on his boots and turned around . " Yeah , " he said . " Me , too . " Farrar 's eyes widened and he whistled . Max had on an almost white buckskin shirt and breeches . His high-heeled cowboy boots were polished to a mirror-like sheen and the kerchief around his throat was like a sparkle of yellow gold against his dark , sun-stained skin . His hair , almost blue black , hung long to his shoulders . Farrar whistled again . " Man , where 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last set my ma made for me . " Farrar laughed . " Well , you shore enough look Injun with them on . " Max smiled with him . " I am Indian , " he said quietly . Farrar 's laughter disappeared quickly . " Half Indian , kid , " he said . " Your pappy was white and he was a good man . I hunted with Sam Sand too many years to hear you not proud of him . " " I am proud of him , Mr. Farrar , " Max said . " But I still remember it was white men killed him an ' Ma . " He picked his gun belt up from the chair and strapped it on . Farrar watched him bend over to tie the holster to his thigh . " You still ai n't give up lookin ' for them ? " he asked . Max looked up . " No , sir , I ai n't . " " Kansas City 's a big place , " Farrar said . " How you know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , I 'll find him , " Max answered . " This is where he 's supposed to be . Then I 'll go down into West Texas an ' get the other one . " Farrar was silent for a moment . " Well , dressed like that , you better look out he do n't recognize you and find you first . " " I 'm hopin ' he does , " Max said quietly . " I want him to know what he 's dyin ' for . " Farrar turned away from the bleak look in the boy 's eyes and picked up a shirt . Max waited quietly for him to finish dressing . " I 'll pick up my time now , Mr. Farrar , " he said when the man had pulled on his trousers . Farrar walked over to the dresser and picked up his poke . " There you are , " he said . " Four months ' pay  --  eighty dollars  --  an ' the sixty dollars you won at poker . " Max put the money in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrar. "  | " Sure I ca n't talk you into comin ' back with me ? " Farrar asked . " No , thank you , Mr. Farrar . " " You ca n't keep all that hate in your soul , boy , " the older man said . " It ai n't healthy . You 'll only wind up harmin ' yourself . " " I ca n't help that , Mr. Farrar , " Max said slowly . His eyes were empty and cold . " I ca n't ferget it 's the same breast that fed me that bastard 's usin ' to keep his tobacco in . " The door closed behind him and Farrar stood there staring at it . Mary Grady smiled at the boy . " Finish your whisky , " she said , " while I get my dress off . " The boy watched her for a moment , then drank the whisky quickly . He coughed as he went over to the edge of the bed and sat down . Mary looked over at him as she slipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelin ' ? " The boy looked at her . She could see the vagueness already in his eyes . " All ri ' , I guess , " he answered . " I ain ' used to drinkin ' so much . " She came over and stood looking down at him , her dress over her arm . " Stretch out and shut your eyes . You 'll be all right in a few minutes . " He looked up at her dumbly , without response . She put out her hand and pushed his shoulder . A hint of awareness sparked in his eyes . He tried to get to his feet , his hand locked around the butt of his gun , but the effort was too much . He collapsed , falling sideways across the bed . Expertly Mary bent over him and lifted his eyelid . The boy was out cold . She smiled to herself and crossing to the window , looked out into the street . Her pimp was standing across the street in front of a saloon . She raised and lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the hotel . She was dressed by the time he got up to the room . " You took long enough gettin ' him up here , " he said surlily . " What could I do ? " she said . " He would n't drink . He 's just a kid . " " How much did he have on him ? " the pimp asked . " I do n't know , " Mary answered . " The money 's in his back pocket . Get it an ' let 's get out of here . This hotel always gives me the creeps . " The pimp crossed to the bed and pulled the money out of the boy 's back pocket . He counted it swiftly . " A hundred and thirty dollars , " he said . Mary went over to him and put her arms around him . " A hundred and  | thirty dollars . Maybe we can take the night off now , " she said , kissing his chin . " We could go over to my place and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " What ? Are you crazy ? " he rasped . " It 's only eleven o'clock . You can turn three more tricks tonight . " He turned to look down at the boy while she picked up her pocketbook . " Do n't forget the bottle of whisky , " he said over his shoulder . " I wo n't , " she answered . " He do n't look like no cowboy , " he said . " He looks more like an Indian to me . " " He is , " she said . " He was looking for some guy who had a tobacco pouch made from an Indian woman 's skin . " She laughed . " I do n't think he even wanted to get laid . I got him up here by lettin ' him think I knew who he was lookin ' for . " The pimp looked down thoughtfully . " He 's carryin ' a gun , too . It should be worth somethin ' to the guy he 's lookin ' for to know about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " Maybe , " the pimp said . " C'm on . " It was almost two o'clock in the morning before the pimp found the man he was looking for . He was playing cards in the back of the Golden Eagle . The pimp touched him on the shoulder cautiously . " Mr. Dort , " he whispered . " What the hell do you want ? " The pimp licked his lips nervously . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Dort , " he apologized quickly . " I got some information that I think you ought to have . " The pimp looked around the table nervously . The other men stared at him . " Maybe it 's better private like , Mr. Dort , " he said . " It 's about that tobacco pouch . " He pointed to the table where it lay . Dort laughed . " My Injun-tit tobacco pouch ? Somebody 's allus tryin ' to buy it . It ai n't for sale . " " It 's not that , Mr. Dort , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the hell are you tryin ' to tell me ? " " I figger it 's worth somethin ' ? " Dort rose swiftly . He grabbed the pimp 's jacket and slammed him tightly against the wall . " What should I know ? " he asked . " It should be worth something , Mr. Dort , " the pimp said , his eyes wide in fright . Dort was one of the worst killers in town . " It 'll be worth something , " Dort said menacingly . " If you do n't talk real quick ? "  | " There 's an Indian kid in town lookin ' for you , " the pimp said in terror . " He 's packin ' a gun . " " An Injun kid ? " Dort questioned . Slowly his grip relaxed . " What did he look like ? " Quickly the pimp described Max . " His eyes , was they blue ? " Dort asked harshly . The pimp nodded . " Yeah . I saw them when he picked one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know he was Indian at first . You know him ? " Dort nodded without thinking . " I know him , " he said . " That was his mother 's . " All their eyes were on the tobacco pouch now . Dort picked it up and put it in his pocket . " What 're you goin ' to do ? " the pimp asked . " Do ? " Dort repeated dully . He looked at the pimp , then at the table of men around him . He could n't run away now . If he did , everything would be gone . His reputation , his position in this oblique society . " Do ? " he said again , this time with growing strength and conviction . " I aim to do what I shoulda done a year ago . Kill him . " He turned back to the pimp . " Where is he ? " " I 'll take you to him , " the pimp said eagerly . The others at the table looked at each other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait for us , Tom , " one of them called . " This ought a be some fun . " When they got to the hotel , Max had already left . But the hotel clerk told them where they could find him tomorrow . At the stockyards at two o'clock . The clerk was supposed to meet him there and collect a dollar for the room . Dort threw a silver dollar on the counter . " There 's your dollar , " he said . " I 'll collect it for you . " Farrar leaned against the fence , watching Max cut the prime steers into the feed pen . A man was leaning on the fence next to him . " That boy 's got a sixth sense with a horse , " Farrar said , without looking at him . The man 's voice was noncommittal . " Yeah . " He finished rolling a cigarette and stuck it in his mouth . " Got a match ? " " Why , sure , " Farrar said , reaching into his pocket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hand froze as he saw the tobacco pouch in his hand . The man followed his gaze .

" They the best things for keepin ' tobacco moist an ' fresh . They ai n't much for wear , though . This one 's gettin ' awful thin . " Suddenly , Farrar turned from the fence to signal Max . " I would n't do that if I were you , " the man said . There was a rustle of movement behind him and Farrar became aware of the other men . He watched helplessly as Max dropped the gate on the last of the steers and rode over to them . Max got off his horse and tied it to a post . " All finished , Mr. Farrar , " he said with a smile . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He threw the tobacco pouch to Max . " Here , have yourself a smoke . " Max caught it easily . " Thanks , mister , " he said . He looked down at the pouch to open it . He looked up at the man , then down at the pouch again , his face going pale . The pouch fell from his fingers and the tobacco spilled onto the ground . He stared up at the man . " I never would 've known you , you had n't done that , " he said softly . Dort laughed harshly . " It 's the beard , I reckon . " Max started to back away slowly . " You 're one of them , all right . Now I recognize you . " " I 'm one of them , " Dort said , his hand hovering over his gun . " What 're you goin ' to do about it ? " Unconsciously Farrar and the others moved to the side . " Do n't do anything , Max , " Farrar called hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea how fast he is . " Max did n't take his eyes from Dort 's face . " It do n't make no difference how fast he is , Mr. Farrar , " he said . " I 'm goin ' to kill him . " " Go for your gun , Injun , " Dort said heavily . " I 'll wait , " Max said softly . " I want you to die slow , like my ma . " Dort 's face was turning red and flushed in the hot sun . " Draw , " he said hoarsely . " Draw , you goddam half-breed son of a two-bit Injun whore . Draw , damn you ! " " I ain ' in no hurry to kill you , " Max answered softly . " I ain ' even goin ' for your head or heart . I 'm goin ' to ' shoot you in the balls first , then a couple of times in the belly . I wan na watch you die . " Dort began to feel fear growing in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watching men . He stared at Max . The boy 's face shone with hatred ; his lips were drawn back tightly across his teeth . Now , Dort thought , now . I might just as well get it over with . His hand moved suddenly toward his gun .  | Farrar saw the movement but fast as he shifted his eyes , it was n't quick enough to see Max 's gun leap into his hand . It roared almost before Dort 's gun had cleared its holster . The gun fell from Dort 's hand and he sank to his knees in the dirt , his hands grabbing at his crotch . Max started walking toward him slowly . Dort kneeled there for a moment in almost a praying position , then lifted his hand and looked at it . The blood ran down from his fingers . He stared up at Max . " You son of a bitch ! " he screamed and grabbed for the gun in the dirt beside him . Max waited until Dort lifted the muzzle toward him , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he lay on the ground , his body twitching slightly . Max walked closer and stood over him , looking down , the smoking gun still in his hand . Ttvo days later , Max was given his choice of joining the Army or standing trial . There was a lot of talk about a war with Cuba and the judge was very patriotic . The chances were Max could have got off on self-defense , but he did n't dare take the chance even with witnesses . He had a date he had to keep , with a man whose name he did n't even know . 7 NEVADA STIRRED RESTLESSLY , WITH THE VAGUE FEELING THAT someone else was in the room with him . Automatically he reached for a cigarette , and when his hand hit empty air and fell downward against the side of the couch , he came awake . It was a moment before he remembered where he was , then he swung his legs off the couch and reached for his pants . The cigarettes were in the right-hand pocket . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame flared in the darkness and he saw Rina sitting in the deep chair , looking at him . He drew deeply on the cigarette and blew out the match . " Why ai n't you sleeping ? " he asked . She took a deep breath . " I could n't sleep , " she said . " I 'm afraid . " He looked at her quizzically . " Afraid , Rina ? Afraid of what ? " She did n't move in the chair . " I 'm afraid of what will happen to me. "  | He laughed quietly , reassuringly . " You 're all set and you 're young . You got your whole life in front of you . " Her face was a luminous shadow in the darkness . " I know , " she whispered . " That 's what I tell myself . But the trouble is I ca n't make myself believe it . " Suddenly , she was on her knees on the floor in front of him . " You 've got to help me , Nevada ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things take time , Rina , " he said . Her hands caught at his . " You do n't understand , Nevada , " she said harshly . " I 've always felt like this . Before I married Cord , before I ever came out here . Even when I was a little girl . " " I reckon , sometime or other , everyone 's afraid , Rina . " Her voice was still hoarse with terror . " But not like me ! I 'm different . I 'm going to die young of some horrible disease . I know that , Nevada . I feel it inside . " Nevada sat there quietly , his hand absently stroking her head as she cried . " Things 'll be different once you get back East , " he said softly . " There 'll be young men there an ? " She raised her hand and looked up at him . The first faint flicker of morning light illuminated her features . Her eyes were wide and shining with her tears . " Young men , Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scorn . " They 're one of the things I 'm afraid of . Do n't you think if I were n't , I 'd have married Jonas instead of his father ? " He did n't answer . " Young men are all alike , " she continued . " They only want one thing from me . " Her lips drew back across her white teeth and she spat the words out at him . " To fuck ! To do nothing but fuck , fuck , flick ! " He stared at her , a kind of shock running through him at hearing her clear and venomously ladylike articulation of the so familiar word . Then it was gone and he smiled . " What do you expect , Rina ? " he asked . " Why are you tellin ' me all this ? " Her eyes looked into his face . " Because I want you to know me , " she said . " I want you to understand what I 'm like . No man ever has . " The cigarette scorched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " Because you 're not a boy . " The answer came quickly . " You 're a grown man . " " An ' you , Rina ? " he asked . Her eyes became almost defiant but her voice betrayed her unsureness . " I think I 'm a Lesbian. "  | He laughed . " Do n't laugh ! " she said quickly . " It 's not so crazy . I 've been with girls and I 've been with men . And I 've never made it with a man , not with any man like I have with a girl . " She laughed bitterly . " Men are such fools . It 's so easy to make them believe what they want to . And I know all the tricks . " His male vanity was aroused . " Maybe that 's because you ai n't never come up against a real man . " A challenging note came into her voice . " Oh , no ? " He felt her fingers lightly search his thighs beneath the blanket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed her head into his lap . He felt the movement of her lips , and suddenly he was angry . He pulled her head back by the hair . " What 're you tryin ' to prove ? " he asked harshly . Her breath came hard and uneven . " That you 're the man , " she whispered . " The one man that can make me feel . " He stared at her , not answering . " You are the one , Nevada , " she whispered . " I know it . I can feel it down inside me . You can make me whole again . I 'll never be afraid any more . " She turned her head again but his hand held her firm . Her eyes were wide and desperate . " Please , Nevada , please . Let me prove how I can love you ! " She began to cry again . Suddenly , he got to his feet and went over to the fireplace . He stirred the coals alive , fed them kindling and another log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room . He turned to look at her . She was still sitting on the floor in front of the couch , watching him . Slowly he walked back toward her . " When I asked you up here , Rina , I thought I was doin ' the right thing . " He sat down and reached for a cigarette . Before he could light it , she held a match for him . " Yes , Nevada ? " she questioned softly . The flame glowed in his eyes and died as the match went out . " I ai n't the man you 're lookin ' for , Rina . " Her fingers touched lightly on his cheek . " No , Nevada , " she said quickly . " That 's not true . " " Mebbe not , " he said and a slow smile came over his lips . " But I figger I 'm too young . You see , all I want to do with you is  --  fuck , fuck , fuck ! " She stared at him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up quickly and took the cigarette from his mouth . Her lips brushed fleet-  | ingly against his for a moment , then she walked to the fire and turned to face him . She put the cigarette between her lips and inhaled deeply . Then she made a slight movement and the robe fell to the floor . The leaping fire turned her naked body into red gold . Swiftly she threw the cigarette into the fireplace behind her and started back toward him . " Maybe it 's better this way , " she said , coming down into his outstretched arms . " Now we can be friends . " " THE SHOW 'S IN TROUBLE , " THE CASHIER SAID . Nevada glanced at Rina . She was looking out the window of the ticket wagon , watching the last act of the Wild-West show going on in the arena . The faint sounds of the whooping and yelling drifted back to them on the still , warm air . " How much trouble ? " Nevada asked , his eyes coming back from her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're booked in a week behind Buffalo Bill Cody 's show for the whole summer . If these two weeks are any indication , we 'll drop forty thousand this season . " A bugle sounding a charge hung in the air . Nevada shifted in his uncomfortable wooden chair and began to roll a cigarette . The performance was almost over now . The cavalry was coming to the rescue of the beleaguered pioneers . He stuck the cigarette in his mouth . " How 'd you let a stupid thing like that happen ? " he asked , the cigarette dangling unlit from his lips . " Was n't my fault , Nevada , " the cashier answered quickly . " I think the agent sold us out . " Nevada did n't answer . He lit the cigarette . " What you going to do ? " the cashier asked worriedly . Nevada filled his lungs with smoke . " Play out the season . " " For forty grand ? " The cashier 's voice was shocked . " We ca n't afford to lose that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was flushed and embarrassed . He wondered why the man seemed so upset . It was n't his money that was going to be lost . " We ca n't afford not to , " Nevada said . " We fold up , we lose all our top hands . They wo n't sign with us for next year if we dump ' em now . "  | Nevada got to his feet , walked over to the window and looked out . The Indians were riding out of the arena with the whooping cavalry hot after them . He turned back to the cashier . " I 'm takin ' Mrs. Cord down to the railroad station . I 'll drop in at the agent 's office after that . You wait for me here . I 'll be back . " " O.K. , Nevada , " the cashier answered . Nevada took Rina 's arm as they went down the wagon steps . They cut across the field to his car . All around them hustled performers , hurrying their horses to the corral , racing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their plans for the evening . Rina turned to him as they reached the car . " Let me stay with you , Nevada , please . " He smiled slowly . " I thought we had that settled . " " But , Nevada , " Her eyes grew serious . " There 's nothing for me back East . Really . Here , at least , I can feel alive , excitement ? " " Stop actin ' like a kid , " he said . " You 're a grown woman now . This ai n't no life for you . You 'd be sick of it in a week . " " I 'll buy half your losses this season if you let me stay , " she said quickly . He looked at her sharply . He thought she had n't even heard the conversation back in the wagon , she had seemed so engrossed in the show . " You ca n't afford it , " he said . " And you can ? " she countered . " Better'n you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing goin ' for me . " She stared at him for a moment , then got into the car . She did n't speak until they were at the station and she was ready to board the train . " You 'll write me , Nevada ? " she asked . " I ai n't much for writin ' , " he said . " But you 'll keep in touch ? " she persisted . " You 'll answer if I write you ? " He nodded . " You 'll let me come and visit you sometimes ? " she asked . " If I 'm lonely and frightened ? " " That 's what friends 're for , " he said . A hint of moisture came into her eyes . " You 've been a good friend , Nevada , " she said seriously . She kissed him on the cheek and climbed up the steps of the Pullman car . At the door , she turned and waved brightly , then disappeared inside . He saw her face appear in the window for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone and he turned and walked out of the station .  | He walked up a rickety flight of stairs that led into a dust-ridden corridor . The paint on the door was scratched and worn , the lettering simple and faded . DANIEL PIERCE-BOOKING AGENT The office lived up to the reputation of the corridor outside . A girl tl looked up at him from a littered desk . Her hair bore traces of its last henna rinse , the gum cracked in her mouth as she asked , almost hostilely , " What d' ya want ? " " Dan Pierce in ? " he asked . She studied Nevada for a moment , her eyes taking in his worn leather jacket , the faded Levi 's , the wide-brimmed cowboy hat . If you 're lookin for a job , " she said , " there ai n't any . " " I 'm not lookin ' for a job , " he said quickly . ? I , m lookin ' for Mr. Pierce . " " You got an appointment ? " Nevada shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody without an appointment , " she said brusquely . " I 'm from the Wild-West show , " Nevada said . " He 'll see me . " A spark of interest appeared on her face . " The Buffalo Bill show ? " Nevada shook his head . " No . The Great Southwest Rodeo . " " Oh . " The interest vanished from her face . " The other one . " Nevada nodded . " Yeah , the other one . " " Well , he ai n't here , " she said . " Where can I find him ? " he asked . " I do n't know . He went out to a meeting . " Nevada 's voice was insistent . " Where ? " Something in his eyes made her answer . " He went over to Norman Pictures . He 's on the back lot trying to sell them some client for a Western . " it " How do I get there ? " " It 's out on Lankershim Boulevard , past Universal , past Warner 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw the big billboard in front of Universal as soon as he turned onto Lankershim . UNIVERSAL PICTURES THE HOME OF TOM MIX AND TONY  | SEE RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE A UNIVERSAL PICTURE A few minutes later , he passed another sign in front of Warner Bros . WARNER BROS . PRESENT MILTON SILLS IN THE SEA HAWK A VITAGRAPH PICTURE The Norman studio was about five miles farther down the road . The usual billboard was out in front . BERNARD B. NORMAN PRODUCTIONS PRESENT THE SHERIFF OF PEACEFUL VILLAGE WITH AN ALL-STAR CAST He turned in at the big gate where a gateman stopped him . " Is Dan Pierce here ? " Nevada asked . " Just a moment , 1 ' 11 see . " The guard went back into his booth and checked a sheet of paper . " You must be the man he 's expecting , " he said . " He 's on the back lot . Follow the road there right out . You ca n't miss it . " Nevada thanked him and put the car into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with people . Some were actors in varying costumes but most seemed ordinary working men , wearing overalls and work clothes . He rolled past some very large buildings and after a few minutes was out in the clear . Here there was nothing but scrub grass and hills . He came to another sign as he reached the foot of the first hill . PEACEFUL SET PARK CARS HERE He followed the arrow . Just off the side of the road were a number of cars and trucks . He pulled in next to one of them and got out .  | " Dan Pierce up there ? " Nevada asked a man sitting in one of the trucks . " Is he with the Peaceful crew ? " the driver asked . " I reckon , " Nevada said . " They 're just over the hill . " At the crest of the hill , Nevada paused and looked down . A little below was a knot of people . " Roll ' em , they 're coming ! " a heavy voice shouted . Suddenly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as it took the curve , Nevada saw the driver jump off and roll to the side of the road . A moment later , the horses broke free of their traces and the coach tilted off the side of the road and went tumbling down the hill . The dust had scarcely subsided when a voice shouted , " Cut ! Cut ! God damn it , Russell . You jumped too soon . The stage did n't go over the hill for a full forty frames after you ! " The driver got up from the side of the road and walked slowly toward the group of men , dusting his jeans with his hat . Nevada started down the hill . He searched the crowd for Pierce , but did n't see him anywhere . A man walked past , carrying a can of film . " Is Dan Pierce around ? " Nevada asked . The man shrugged his shoulders . " I du n no . Ask him , " he said , pointing at a young man wearing knickers . " Is Dan Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to go up to the front office for a phone call . " " Thanks , " Nevada said . " I 'll wait for him . " He began to roll a cigarette . The stentorian voice was shouting again . " Is Pierce back with that goddam stunt man yet ? " " He went to phone him , " the young man said . A startled look came to his face as he looked at Nevada again . " Wait a minute , sir , " he yelled and started toward Nevada . " You the guy Pierce was expecting ? " " I guess so . " " Come with me , " the young man said . Nevada followed him into the group of men clustered around a tall man next to the camera . The young man stopped in front of him . " This is the man Pierce was expecting , sir . " The man turned and looked at Nevada , then pointed at a cliff on the next hill . Below the cliff flowed a wide stream of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water ? "  | Nevada followed the pointing finger . It was about a sixty-foot drop and the horse would have to leap out at least fifteen feet to land in the water . " We have the stream dug twenty-five feet deep right there , " the director said . Nevada nodded . That was deep enough . " I reckon it can be done , " he said . The director broke into a smile . " Well , I 'll be goddamned ! " he roared . " We finally found us a man with balls . " He clapped Nevada on the back . " You go over there and the wrangler will give you the horse . We 'll be ready just as soon as we get this shot here . " He turned back to the cameraman . Nevada tapped him on the shoulder . " I said I reckon it can be done , " he said . " I did n't say I 'd do it . " The director stared at him curiously . " We 're paying triple the stunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , I 'll make it a hundred . " Nevada smiled . " You got me wrong . I came out here lookin ' for Dan Pierce . I ai n't no stunt-rider . " The director 's mouth twisted contemptuously . " You cowboys are all alike . All talk and no guts . " Nevada stared at him for a minute . He felt the hard knot of anger tightening inside him . He was tired of this , of the runaround he 'd been getting ever since Pierce 's office . His voice went cold . " It 'll cost you five hundred dollars for me to take a horse off that cliff . " The director stared at him , then broke into a smile . " You must 've heard that every man in Hollywood turned that jump down . " Nevada did n't answer . " O.K. Five hundred it is , " the director said casually and turned back to the cameraman . Nevada stood near the horse 's head , feeding him an occasional lump of sugar . The horse nuzzled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good horse . The animal responded quickly and there was n't a frightened bone in his body . " We 're about ready , " the director said . " I 've got cameras covering you from every angle , so you do n't have to worry which way to look . You go when I give the signal . " Nevada nodded and mounted the horse . The director stood limned against the edge of the cliff , his hand raised in the air . Suddenly , his hand dropped and Nevada dug his spurs into the horse . The animal leaped forward in almost a full gallop . Nevada gave him his head and led him into the jump . Nevada took him high and the horse started down , his legs stiff , braced  | for a short fall . Nevada felt the great beast 's heart suddenly pound between his legs as his hoofs did n't meet the expected ground . The animal writhed in sudden panic as it began to tumble forward . Quickly Nevada kicked free of the stirrups and threw himself over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing up toward him and hoped he had jumped far enough so that the horse did n't land on top of him . He hit the water in a clean dive and let the momentum carry him deep . He felt an explosion in the water near him . That would be the horse . His lungs were burning but he stayed down as long as he could . At last , he had to come up . It seemed like forever till he broke the surface , gasping . He turned his head and saw the horse floating on its side , its head twisted in a peculiar manner . There was a look of great agony in its eyes . He turned and swam quickly toward the bank . Angrily he strode toward the director . The director was smiling . " That was great . The greatest shot ever made ! " it " That hoss 's back is probably broke ! " Nevada said . He turned and looked out at the horse again . The animal was struggling to keep its head above water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch ? " Nevada demanded . " We already sent for the wrangler to bring a rifle . He 's back on the other hill . " " That hoss 'll be drowned before he gets here , " Nevada snapped . 11 " Has n't anybody got a gun ? " " Sure , but nobody could hit him . A revolver 's no good at that distance . " Nevada stared at the director . " Give me a gun . " Nevada took the gun and hefted it in his hand . He spun the cylinder . " These are blanks , " he said . Someone gave him bullets . He reloaded the gun quickly and walked over to the side of the stream . He fired at a piece of wood in the water . The gun dragged a little to the left . He waited a moment until the horse raised its head again , then shot the animal between the eyes . Nevada walked back and gave the director the gun . Silently the big man took it and held out a pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match for him . Nevada let the smoke fill his lungs . A man came running up , gasping and short of breath . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Von Elster , " he said hoarsely . " I just ca n't locate that stunt man anywhere . But I 'll get you another one tomorrow . "  | " Did n't anybody tell you ? He showed up already , Pierce . We just made the shot . " Pierce stared at him . " How could he ? I just left him back at ? " The director stepped to one side , revealing Nevada . " Here he is . See for yourself . " Pierce looked at Nevada , then at the director . " That 's not the one . That 's Nevada Smith . He owns the Great Southwest Rodeo and WildWest Show . " He turned back to Nevada and stuck his hand out . " Good to see you , Nevada . " He smiled . " What brings you out here ? " Nevada glared at him . The anger bubbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce hit the ground in shocked surprise . He stared up at Nevada . " What 's got into you , Nevada ? " " What I want to know is how much the Cody show got into you ! " Von Elster stepped between them . " I 've been looking for someone like you a long time , Smith , " he said . " Sell your show and come to work for us . I 'll pay you two fifty a week to start . " Pierce 's voice came up from the ground . " Oh , no you do n't , Von Elster . A thousand a week or nothing ! " Nevada started to speak . " You shut up ! " Dan Pierce told him authoritatively . " I 'm your agent and do n't you forget it ! " He turned back to Von Elster . " This stunt will be all over Hollywood in an hour , " he said . " I could take him down the line to Universal or Warner 's . They 'd snap him up like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five hundred , " he snapped . " And that 's my last offer . " Pierce grabbed Nevada 's arm . " Come on , Nevada . We 'll go over to Warner 's . Every studio 's looking for somebody to give Tom Mix a little competition . " " Seven fifty , " Von Elster said . " For six months , then a thousand a week and corresponding increases semiannually thereafter . " " It 's a deal , " Von Elster said . He shook hands with Pierce and then turned to Nevada . He smiled and held out his hand . " What did you say your name was ? " " Smith , Nevada Smith . " They shook hands . " And how old are you , young fellow ? " Pierce answered before Nevada could speak . " He 's thirty , Mr. Von Elster . " Nevada started to open his mouth in protest but the pressure of Pierce 's hand on his arm kept him silent . " We 'll make that twenty-nine for publicity . " Von Elster smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down to the front office . I want to tell Norman we finally found the Sheriff of Peaceful Village ! " Nevada turned away to hide a smile . He wondered what the men down on the prison farm so many years ago would have said had they known he 'd finally turned up wearing a badge . Even if it was only in the movies . 9 " MY GOD ! " THE WARDEN HAD SAID WHEN THEY BROUGHT MAX into his office . " What do they think they 're doin ' down there ? This is a prison , not a reform school ! " " Do n't let his looks fool you none , Warden , " the tobacco-chewing deputy said , throwing the papers on the desk for the warden to sign . " He 's a mean one , all right . He killed a man down in New Orleans . " The warden picked up the papers . " What 's he up for ? Murder ? " " Nope , " the deputy replied . " Unlawful use of a weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go a wad into the spittoon . " This guy caught him in some fancy lady 's bedroom . " " I was the lady 's bodyguard , Warden , " Max said . The warden looked up at him shrewdly . " That did n't give you the right to kill a man . " " I had to , Warden , " Max said . " He was comin ' at me with a knife an ' I had to defend myself . I had no clothes on . " " That 's right , Warden . " The deputy cackled lewdly . " Naked as a jaybird he was . " " Sounds like a genuine case of self-defense to me , " the warden said . " How come they hang a bum one like this on him ? " " It was a cousin of the Darcys he croaked , " the deputy said quickly . " Oh , " the warden said . That explained everything . The Darcys were pretty important people in New Orleans . " In that case , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed the papers and pushed them across the desk . " Here y'are , Deputy . " The deputy picked up the papers and unlocked Max 's handcuffs . " So long , rooster . " The warden got to his feet heavily . " How old are you , boy ? " " ' Bout nineteen , I reckon , " Max answered .  | " That 's kinda young to be bodyguardin ' one of them fancy women down in New Orleans , " the warden said . " How 'd you come to that ? " " I needed a job when I got out of the Army , " Max answered . " An ' she wanted someone who was fast with a gun . I was fast enough , I reckon . " " Too fast , " the warden said . He walked around the desk . " I 'm a fair man but I do n't hold with no trouble-makers . You-all just get up every mornin ' , do your work like you 're tot ' an ' you 'll have no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Max said . The warden walked to the door of his office . " Mike ! " he roared . A giant Negro trusty stuck his head in the door . " Yassuh , Warden . " " Take this new man out and give him ten lashes . " The surprise showed on Max 's face . " There 's nothin ' personal in it , " the warden said quickly . " An ounce of prevention , I always say . It kinda sticks in your mind if you ever think about makin ' any trouble . " He walked back around his desk . " C'm on , boy , " the Negro said . The door closed behind them and they started down the corridor . The trusty 's voice was warm and comforting . " Don ' you worry none about them lashes , boy , " he said . " I knocks you out with the first one an ' you never feels the other nine ! " Max had reached New Orleans about Mardi Gras time early that year . The streets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmth of their mood . Something about the whole town got inside him and he decided to stay over a day or two before riding on to West Texas . He put his horse in a livery stable , checked into a small hotel and went down into the Latin Quarter , looking for excitement . Six hours later , he threw down a pair of tens to three sevens and that was that . He had lost his money , his horse , everything but the clothes on his back . He pushed his chair back and got to his feet . " That cleans me , gents , " he said . " I 'll go roun ' to the stable an ' fetch my hoss . " One of the gamblers looked up at him . " May I be so bold as to inquire , suh , what you intend to do after that ? " he asked in his soft Southern accent . Max shrugged and grinned . " I du n no . Get a job , I reckon . " " What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good with hosses . Punch cattle . Anything . " The gambler gestured at Max 's gun . " Any good with that ? " " Some . "  | The gambler got to his feet casually . " Lady Luck was n't very kind to you tonight . " " You did n't help her much , " Max said . The gambler 's hand streaked toward his coat . He froze , staring into the muzzle of Max 's gun . It had come out so fast that he had n't even sensed the motion . " A man can get killed doin ' foolish things like that , " Max said softly . The gambler 's face relaxed into a smile . " You are good , " he said respectfully . Max slipped his gun back into the holster . " I think I 've got a job for you , " the gambler said . " That is if you do n't mind working for a lady . " " A job 's a job , " Max said . " This ai n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , Max and the gambler sat in the parlor of the fanciest house in New Orleans . A Creole maid came into the room . " Miss Pluvier will see you now . " She curtsied . " If you will please follow me . " They followed her up a long , gracious staircase . The maid opened a door and curtsied as they walked through , then closed the door after them . Max took two steps into the room and stopped in his tracks , gawking . He had never seen a room like this . Everything was white . The silkcovered walls , the drapes at the windows , the woodwork , the furniture , the canopy of shimmering silk over the bed . Even the carpet that spread lushly over the floor was white . " Is this the young man ? " a soft voice asked . Max turned in the direction of the voice . The woman surprised him even more than the room . She was tall , almost as tall as he was , and her face was young , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else . It was long , almost to her waist , and white , blue-white like strands of glistening satin . The gambler spoke in a respectful voice . " Miss Pluvier , may I present Max Sand . " Miss Pluvier studied Max for a moment . " How do you do ? " Max nodded his head . " Ma'am . " Miss Pluvier walked around him , looking at him from all angles . " He seems rather young , " she said doubtfully . " He 's extremely capable , I assure you , " the gambler said . " He 's a veteran of the recent war with Spain . " She raised her hand carelessly , interrupting his speech . " I 'm sure his qualifications are satisfactory if you recommend him , " she said . " But he does seem rather dirty . "  | " I just rode in from Florida , ma'am , " Max said , finding his voice . " His figure is rather good , though . " She continued as if he had n't spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , almost no hips at all . He should wear clothes well . I think he 'll do . " She walked back to the dressing table where she had been standing . She turned to face them . " Young man , " she asked , " do you know what you 're supposed to do ? " Max shook his head . " No , ma'am . " " You 're to be my bodyguard , " she said matter-of-factly . " I have a rather large establishment here . Downstairs , we have several gaming rooms for gentlemen . Of course , we provide other discreet entertainments . Our house enjoys the highest reputation in the South and as a result , many people are envious of us . Sometimes , these people go to extremes in their desire to cause trouble . My friends have persuaded me to seek protection . " " I see , ma'am , " Max said . Her voice became more businesslike . " My hours will be your hours , " she said , " and you will live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . Twenty dollars a month will be deducted for room and board . And under no circumstances are you to have anything to do with any of the young ladies who reside here . " Max nodded . " Yes , ma'am . " Miss Pluvier smiled . She turned to the gambler . " Now , if you will be kind enough to take him to your tailor and have six suits made for him ? three white and three black  --  I think everything will be in order . " The gambler smiled . " I 'll attend to it right away . " Max followed him . At the door , he stopped and looked back . She was seated at the dressing table in front of the mirror , brushing her hair . Her eyes glanced up and caught his . " Thank you , ma'am , " he said . " Please call me Miss Pluvier , " she said coldly . It was after three o'clock one morning when Max came into the foyer from the gaming rooms on his nightly tour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downstairs rooms . He paused at the front door . " Everythin ' locked up , Jacob ? " he asked the tall Negro doorman . " Tighter'n a drum , Mistuh Sand . " " Good , " Max smiled as he started for the staircase , then stopped and looked back . " Did Mr. Darcy leave ? " " No , suh , " the Negro replied . " He spendin ' the night with Miss Eleanor . You don ' have to worry , though . I move ' em to the gol ' room . "  | Max nodded and started up the staircase . Darcy had been his only problem the last few months . The young man was determined not to be satisfied until he had spent a night with the mistress of the house . And tonight he had been rather unpleasant about it . Max stopped at the top of the stairway . He knocked at a door and went in . His employer was seated at her dressing table , a maid brushing her hair . Her eyes met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Pluvier , " he said . Her eyebrows raised questioningly . " Darcy ? " " In the gold room with Eleanor at the other end of the house . " " Bon . " She nodded . Max stood there looking at her , his face troubled . She saw his expression in the mirror and waved the maid from the room . " You are disturbed , cheri ? " He nodded . " It 's Darcy , " he admitted . " I do n't like the way he 's actin ' . I think we ought to bar him . " " La . " She laughed . " We ca n't do that . The family is too important . " She laughed again happily and came toward him . She placed her arms around his neck and kissed him . " My young Indien is jealous . " She smiled . " Do not worry about him . He will forget about it soon . All young men do . I have seen it happen before . " A little while later , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes delighting in the wonder of her lovely body . He felt her fingers stroking him gently , reawakening the fires inside him . He closed his eyes . He felt her soft lips brushing his flesh ; her whispering voice seemed to float upward to him . " Mon coeur , mon indien , mon cheri . " He heard the soft sounds of her pleasure as she raised her lips from him . Through his almost closed lids he could see the blurred sensuality of her face . " The weapon you carry has turned into a cannon , " she murmured , her fingers still stroking him gently . His hand reached out and stroked her hair . An expression of almost frightened ecstasy came into her face and he closed his eyes . He could feel the trembling begin deep inside him . How could a woman know so much ? From what deep spring could such a fountain of pleasure come ? He caught his breath . It was almost unbearable , this strange delight . It was like nothing he had ever known . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head slightly , wondering what it could be . Suddenly , the door burst open and Darcy was there in the room . He felt her roll away from him as he sat up ; then her voice from the foot of the bed : " Get out of here , you damned idiot ! "  | Darcy stared at her stupidly . He weaved slightly , his eyes bewildered . His hand came out of his pocket and a shower of bills fell to the floor . " See , I brought a thousand dollars with me , " he said drunkenly . She got out of the bed . She stormed toward him regally , unaware of her nudity . She raised a hand , pointing to the door . " Get out , I said ! " Darcy just stood there staring at her . " My God , " he mumbled huskily . " I want you . " Max finally found his voice . " You heard Miss Pluvier , " he said . " Get out . " For the first time , Darcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anger . " You , " he said thickly . " You ! All the time I was begging , pleading , it was you . You were laughing at me all the time ! " A knife appeared in his hand suddenly . He thrust quickly and Max rolled off the bed to the floor as the knife stabbed the satin sheets . Max snatched a pillow from the bed and held it in front of him as he backed toward the chair from which his gun hung . Darcy 's eyes were glazed with rage . " You were laughing all the time , " he mumbled . " Every time you did it you were laughing at me . " " You better get out of here before you get hurt , " Max said . Darcy shook his head . " And have you laugh at me some more ? Oh , no . This time I 'm going to do the laughing . " He lunged with the knife again . This time it caught in the pillow and he fell against Max , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a look of surprise came over Darcy 's face as he slumped to his knees , then sprawled out on the floor . The naked woman stared at Max . Quickly she knelt beside Darcy . She reached for his pulse , then dropped his hand . " You did n't have to kill him , you fool ! " she said angrily . Max looked at her . Her breasts heaved excitedly and there was a fine moisture in the valley between them . He had never seen her look so beautiful . " What was I supposed to do ? " he asked . " He was comin ' at me with a knife ! " " You could have knocked him out ! " she snapped . " What was I supposed to hit him with ? " he snapped back , feeling the anger rise in him . " My cannon ? " She stood very still for a moment , staring at him . Then she turned and walked to the door . She looked out into the hallway . The house was quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowly she closed the door and came back toward him . He stood there watching the blurred , sensual look come back into her face . She sank to her knees before him , and he felt her lips press against  | his thighs . " Do not be angry with Anne-Louise , my stalwart , wild stallion , " she whispered . " Make love to me . " He reached down to lift her to the bed . But she held his arms . " No , " she said , pulling him down to the floor beside her . " Here . " They made love for the last time on the floor , lying next to a dead man . In the morning , Anne-Louise Pluvier calmly turned him over to the police . 10 THE EAST , WEST AND SOUTH OF THE PRISON WAS BOUNDED BY A swamp , along which the cypresses rose high and spilled their leaves onto the murky surface of the water . The only way out was to the north , across the rice paddies tended by Cajun tenant farmers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison and it was here that most prisoners trying to escape were caught and brought back to the prison by the Cajuns for the ten-dollar bounty offered by the state . Those who were not caught were presumed dead in the swamp . There had been only two such cases reported in the prison 's twenty years of operation . One morning in May , after Max had been there a few months , the guard checking out his hut reported to one of the trusties the absence of a prisoner named Jim Reeves . The trusty looked around . " He ai n't here ? " " He ai n't out in the latrines , neither , " the guard said . " I looked . " " He 's gone , then , " the trusty said . " I reckon he went over the wall in the night . " " That Jim Reeves sure is a fool , " the guard said softly . He turned on his heel . " I better go tell the warden . " They were lined up in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw one of the guards ride out of the prison and start up the road toward the village . He sat down against the wall of one of the huts and watched the guard disappear up the road while he ate . Mike , the giant Negro trusty who had given him ten lashes the day he arrived , came over and sat down beside him . Max looked over at the trusty . " That all the fuss they make over a man gettin ' out ? "  | Mike nodded , his mouth filled with grits . " What you expec ' them to do ? " he asked . " They 'll git him back . You wait and see . " He was right . The next morning , while they were at breakfast again , Jim Reeves came back . He was sitting in a wagon between two Cajuns , who carried their long rifles in the crooks of their arms . The prisoners looked up at him silently as he rode by . When they came back from their work in the evening , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trusties led the prisoners to the compound , so that they could view the punishment before they had their meal . The warden stood there until all the prisoners were in line . " You men know the penalty for attempted escape  --  ten lashes and fifteen days in the cage for each day out . " He turned to Mike , standing next to him . " I do n't want him knocked out . He must be conscious so he can rue the folly of his action . " Mike nodded stolidly and stepped forward . The muscles along his back rippled and the long snake wrapped itself lightly around the prisoner . It seemed to caress him almost gently , but when Mike lifted it from the victim 's back , a long red welt of blood bubbled and rose to the surface . A moment later , the prisoner screamed . The snake rippled around him again . This time , his scream was pure agony . The prisoner fainted three times before the lashing was completed . Each time , the warden stepped forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revive him , then ordered the lashing continued . At the end , Jim Reeves hung there from the post , unconscious . Blood dripped down his back from his shoulders , across his buttocks and the top of his thighs . " Cut him down and put him in the cage , " the warden said . Silently the men broke ranks and formed a food line . Max looked at the cage as he got on the line . The cage was exactly that  --  steel bars forming a four-foot cubicle . There was room to neither walk , stand or even stretch out full length . There was only space enough to sit or crouch on all fours like an animal . There was no shelter from the sun or the elements . For the next thirty days , Jim Reeves would live there like an animal ? without clothing , without medical attention , with only bread and water for his food . He would live there in the midst of his pain and his excrement and there was no one who would speak to him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . Max took his plate of meat and beans around to the side of the hut , where he would not have to look at the cage . He sank to the ground and began to eat slowly .  | Mike sat down next to him . The big Negro 's face was sweating . He began to eat silently . Max looked at him and could n't eat any more . He pushed his plate away from him , rolled a cigarette and lit it . " You ai n't hungry , man ? " Mike asked . " I 'll eat that there food . " Max stared at him for a moment , then silently turned the plate over , spilling the contents on the ground . Mike stared at him in surprise . " What for you do that , man ? " he asked . " Now I know why you stay here as a trusty instead of leavin ' like you should , " Max said . " You 're evenin ' up with the whole world when you swing that snake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So that 's what you ' thinkin ' , " he said softly . " That 's what I 'm thinkin ' , " Max said coldly . The Negro looked into Max 's eyes . " You don ' know nothin ' , " he said slowly . " Years ago , when I first got here , I seen a man git a beatin ' like that . When they cut him down , he was all tore up , front an ' back . He died less'n two days after . Ai n't a man died since I took the rope . Tha 's more'n twelve years now . An ' if you looked close , you would have seen they ai n't a mark on the front of him , nor one lash laid over the other . I know they 's lots of things wrong about my job , but somebody 's got ta do it . An ' it mought as well be me , because I don ' like hurtin ' folks . Not even pricks like Jim Reeves . " Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just heard . A glimmer of understanding began to lighten the sourness in his stomach . Silently he pushed his sack of makings toward the trusty . Without speaking , Mike took it and rolled himself a cigarette . Quietly the two men leaned their heads back against the hut , smoking . Jim Reeves came into the hut . It was a month since he had been carried out of the cage , encrusted in his own filth , bent over , his eyes wild like an animal 's . Now his eyes searched the dark , then he came over to the bunk where Max lay stretched out and tapped him on the shoulder . Max sat up . " I got to get outa here , " he said . Max stared at him in the dark . " Do n't we all ? " " Do n't joke with me , Injun , " Reeves said harshly . " I mean it . " " I mean it , too , " Max said . " But ai n't nobody made it yet . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it takes two men to do it . That 's why I come to you . " " Why me ? " Max asked . " Why not one of the men on a long stretch ? " " Because most of them are city men , " Reeves said , " and we wouldn ' last two days in the swamp . "  | Max swung into a sitting position . " Now I know you 're crazy , " he said . " Nobody can get th'ough that swamp . It 's forty miles of quicksand , alligators , moccasins an ' razorbacks . The only way is north , past the village . " A bitter smile crossed Reeves 's face . " That 's what I thought , " he said . " It was easy , over the fence and up the road . Easy , I thought . They didn ' even call out the dogs . They didn ' have to . Every damn Cajun in the neighborhood was out lookin ' for me . " He knelt by the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " That 's the only way . I got it figured out . We get a boat an ' ? " " A boat ! " Max said . " Where in hell we goin ' to get a boat ? " " It 'll take time , " Reeves said cautiously . " But ricin ' time is comin ' up . Warden leases us out to the big planters then . Prison labor is cheap an ' the warden pockets the money . Them rice paddies is half filled with water . There 's always boats around . " " I do n't know , " Max said doubtfully . Reeves 's eyes were glowing like an animal 's . " You want to lose two whole years of your life in this prison , boy ? You got that much time just to throw away ? " " Let me think about it , " Max said hesitantly . " I 'll let you know . " Reeves slipped away in the dark as Mike came into the hut . The trusty made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to go th'ough the swamp with him ? " he asked . The surprise showed in Max 's voice . " How 'd you know ? " " He 's been at ev'ybody in the place an ' they all turned him down . I figgered he 'd be gettin ' to you soon . " " Oh , " Max said . " Don ' do it , boy , " the giant trusty said softly . " No matter how good it looks , don ' do it . Reeves is so full of hate , he don ' care who gets hurt so long as he gets out . " Max stretched out on the bunk . His eyes stared up into the dark . The only thing that made sense in what Reeves had said was the two years . Max did n't have two years to throw away . Why , in two years , he 'd be twenty-one .  | " MAN , THIS IS REAL FOOD , " MIKE SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY AS HE sat down beside Max , his plate piled high with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max looked over at him wearily . Stolidly he pushed the food into his mouth . It was better than the prison food , all right . They did n't see as much meat in a week as they had on their plates right now . But he was n't hungry . He was tired , bent-over tired from pulling at the rice all day . He did n't think he 'd ever straighten out . Reeves and another prisoner sat down on the other side of him . Reeves looked over his plate at him , his mouth working over the fat meat . " Picked yourself a gal yet , boy ? " Max shook his head . They were there all right . Cajun girls , young and strong , with their short skirts and muscular thighs and legs . Plenty of them , all over the fields , working side by side with the men , their hair flying and their teeth flashing and the female smell of them always in your nostrils . It did n't seem to matter to them that the men were prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enough of them to go around . " I 'm too tired , " Max said . He put his plate down and rubbed his ankle . It was sore from the leg iron and walking in the water all day . " I 'm not , " the prisoner next to Reeves said . " I been savin ' up my hump a whole year for this week . I 'm gon na it me enough to last me till nex ' yeah . " " Better not pass it up , Injun , " Reeves said . " There ai n't nothin ' in this world like Cajun girls . " " Man , that 's the truth , " the other prisoner said excitedly . " You got one picked out ? " Reeves asked across Max to Mike . His eyes were cold and baleful . Mike did n't answer . He just kept eating . Reeves 's face darkened . " I seen you out there on the field . Walkin ' up an ' down with that rifle in your hands . Showin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mike still did n't reply . He began to wipe up the gravy in his plate with pieces of bread .  | Reeves 's laugh was nasty . " There 's always some half-wit girl lookin ' for a big buck nigger with a cock as long as my arm . An ' I bet you just ca n't wait to stick it into some white girl . That 's all you niggers think of , stickin ' it in white women . " Mike stuck the last piece of bread into his mouth and swallowed it . Regretfully he looked down at the empty plate and got to his feet . " Man , that was sho ' good . " " I 'm talkin ' to you , nigger , " Reeves said . For the first time , Mike looked down at him . Almost lazily he bent over Max and with one hand picked Reeves up by the throat . He held him writhing in the air at the level of his head . " You talkin ' to me , jailbird ? " Reeves quaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake Reeves gently . " Remember one thing , jailbird , " he said . " I 'm a trusty an ' you ' jus ' a prisoner . You likes stayin ' healthy , you better learn to shut you ' mouth . " Reeves 's arms flailed helplessly in the air . His face was almost purple . Mike shook him a few more times , then casually flung him at the wall of the bunkhouse , about five feet away . Reeves crashed against the wall and slid down it to the floor . His eyes glared at Mike . His lips moved but no sound escaped them . Mike smiled at him . " You ' learnin ' , jailbird , " he said . " You ' learnin ' . " He picked up his empty plate . " I 'm goin ' see if I ca n't scrounge me some more of these eats . I swear if they ai n't the best I ever tasted . " Reeves struggled to his feet as the trusty walked away . " I 'll kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someday before I get out of here , I 'll kill that nigger ! " There was an air of expectancy in the bunkhouse that night . Max was stretched out on his bunk and the feeling was contagious . Suddenly , he was n't tired any more . He could n't sleep . The guard had come and checked the leg irons , fastening each man to the bed post . He had gone to the door and stood there for a moment . Then he laughed into the dark and went out . Almost immediately , Max heard the scratch of a match , then a faint glow spread through the darkness . Max turned toward the light . Somehow one of the men had got a candle . It burned almost gaily at the head of his bed . There was a subdued sound of laughter in the room . Max heard a voice say , " At leas ' this time we can see what they look like . " " I do n't care what they look like , " another voice answered quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still another voice said raucously , " Your pecker wo n't know what to do , it 's so used to yoh lily-white hand . " A soft laughter rippled through the room . About a half hour passed . Max could hear the sounds of restless movements , men twisting anxiously in their bunks. 11 , " You reckon maybe they wo n't show up ? " a voice asked nervously . " They 'll show up , all right , " another prisoner replied . " They been waitin ' for this as long as we have . " " Sweet Jesus . " An anguished voice came from the far end of the room . " I ca n't hold it no more . All day long I been thinkin ' about them women , about tonight ? " His voice trailed off in a hoarse moan . For a moment , the room filled with the sounds of the men turning restlessly in their bunks . Max felt the sweat come out on his forehead and his heart began to beat heavily . He rolled over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread into his loins . For a moment he writhed , caught in the fire of a wild desire , then angrily he forced himself to turn over . He rolled a cigarette with trembling fingers . He felt shreds of the tobacco fall around him but he finally lit it and dragged the smoke deep into his lungs . " They ai n't comin ' , " a voice cried , almost on the verge of tears . " They ai n't nothin ' but a bunch of cock-teasers ! " another voice said angrily . " T ' hell with them . " Max lay quietly in his bunk , letting the smoke trickle through his nostrils . The candle sputtered and flickered out and now the bunkhouse was pitch black . Mike 's voice came softly from the next bunk . " How you doin ' , boy ? " " All right . " " Gim me a drag of that there butt . " Their hands touched briefly as Max silently held the cigarette out . The cigarette glowed and cast a faint shine over Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' worry , boy . " His voice was soft and reassuring . " They 'll show up any moment now the candle 's out . What those damn fools ca n't seem to understan ' is them women don ' want to see ' em , anymore'n they want theyselves to be seen . " A moment later , the bunkhouse door opened and the women began to come in . They entered silently , their bare feet making the faintest whisper on the floor . Max turned in his bunk , hoping he could catch a glimpse of the one that would come to him . But all he could see were shadows that entered and then were lost in the dark . A hand touched his face . He started .  | " Are you young or old ? " a voice whispered . " Young , " he whispered back . Her hand found his and brought it to her cheek . For a moment , his fingers explored her face gently . Her skin was soft and warm . He felt her lips tremble beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " she whispered . " Yes . " Swiftly she came into the bunk beside him and he buried his head in the softness of her bosom . A great warmth and gentleness welled up inside him . As if from a great distance , he heard a man across the room begin to cry softly . " My darling , " he said , " my darling wife . You do n't know how I 've missed you . " Max turned his face up to the woman . As she bent to kiss his lips , he felt the tears rolling down her cheeks and he knew that she also had heard . He closed his eyes . How could he tell this woman he could n't even see what he felt ? How could he tell her she brought kindness and love into this room ? " Thank you , " he whispered gratefully . " Thank you , thank you , thank you . " On the fourth day at the rice fields , Reeves came over to him . " I been wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I had to wait until that damn nigger was n't around . I got a boat ! " " What ? " " Keep yer voice down , " Reeves said harshly . " It 's all arranged . It 'll be in that big clump of cypresses south of the prison the day after we get back . " " How d' you know ? " " I got it fixed with my girl , " Reeves said . " You sure she ai n't jobbin ' you ? " " I 'm sure , " Reeves answered quickly . " These Cajun girls all want the same thing . I told her I 'd take her to New Orleans with me if she helped me escape . The boat 'll be there . Her place is out in the middle of nowhere . It 'll be a perfect place to hide out until they stop lookin ' for us . " He glanced up quickly and began to move off . That evening , Mike sat down next to Max at chow . For a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spoons on plates . " You goin ' with Reeves now that he got his boat ? " Mike asked suddenly .  | Max stared at him . " You know that already ? " Mike smiled . " Ain ' no secrets in a place like this . " " I don ' know , " Max said . " Believe me , boy , " the Negro said sincerely , " thirty days in the cage is a lot longer than the year an ' a half you got to go . " " But maybe we 'll make it . " " You wo n't make it , " Mike said sadly . " Fust thing the warden does is get out the dogs . They don ' get you , the swamp will . " " How would he know we went by the swamp ? " Max asked quickly . " You wouldn ' tell him ? " The Negro 's eyes had a hurt expression . " You knows better'n that , boy . I may be a trusty , but I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself . One man always goes by the road . Two men always goes by the swamp . It 's like it was the rule . " Max was silent as he dragged on his cigarette . " Please don ' go , boy , " Mike said . " Don ' do nothin ' to make me have to hurt you . I want to be you ' friend . " Max looked at him , then smiled slowly . He reached out his hand and rested it on the big man 's shoulder . " No matter what , " he said seriously , " you 're my friend . " " You goin ' , " Mike said . " You ' mind 's made up . " Mike got to his feet and walked off slowly . Max looked after him , puzzled . How could Mike know what he himself did n't know ? He got to his feet and scraped off his plate . But it was n't until he was over the fence the next night and racing madly toward the clump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right Mike had been . Then Reeves was scrambling around at the foot of the cypresses , sunk half to his knees in the murky swamp water , swearing , " The bitch ! The no-good lying Cajun whore ! " There was no boat there .  | THEY PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE REEDS , SLOSHING IN THE water up to their waist , and up onto a hummock . They sank to their haunches , their chests heaving , their lungs gulping in great mouthfuls of air . From a great distance , they could hear the baying of a hound . Reeves slapped at the insects around his head . " They 're gaining on us , " he mumbled through swollen lips . Max looked at his companion . Reeves 's face was swollen and distorted from insect bites , his clothing torn . Reeves stared back at him balefully . " How do you know we ai n't been goin ' in circles ? Three days now and we ai n't seen nothing . " " That 's how I know . If we was goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ca n't keep this up much longer , " Reeves said . " I 'm goin ' crazy from bug bites . I 'm ready to let ' em take me . " " Maybe you are , " Max said , " but I ai n't . I ai n't got this far to go back an ' sit in a cage . " He got to his feet . " Come on . We rested enough . " Reeves looked over at him . " How come them bugs do n't bother you ? " he asked resentfully . " It mus ' be your Injun blood or somethin ' . " " Might be , " Max said . " Also might be that I do n't scratch at ' em . Come on . " Ca n't we stay here for the night ? " Reeves complained . " Uh-uh , " Max said . " We got another two hours of daylight . That 's another mile . Let 's go . " He pushed off into the water . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Reeves splash into the water behind him . It was almost dark when he found another hummock . Reeves sprawled flat on the ground . Max looked down at him . For a moment , he felt almost sorry for him , then he remembered the fierce hatreds that flamed in Reeves and he was n't sorry any more . He 'd known what he was doing . Max took out his knife and hacked swiftly at one of the long canes . He sharpened the end to a pointed spear . Then he sloshed out into the water . He stood there motionlessly for almost fifteen minutes , until he saw an indistinct shape swimming under the surface . He held his breath , waiting  | for it to come closer . It did and he moved swiftly . The spear flashed into the water . He felt the pull against his arms as he lifted the spear free of the water . A large , squirming catfish was impaled on the tip . " We got a good one this time , " he said , returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin the fish . Reeves sat up . " Start a fire , " he said . " We 'll cook this one . " Max was already chewing on a piece . He shook his head . " The smell of a fire carries for miles . " Reeves got to his feet angrily . " I do n't give a damn , " he snarled , his face flushing . " I ai n't no damn Injun like you . I 'm cookin ' my fish . " He scrambled around , gathering twigs . At last , he had enough to start a small fire . His hand groped in his pocket for matches . He found one and scraped it on a log . It did n't light . Angrily he scraped it again . He stared at the match . " They 're still wet , " he said . " Yeah , " Max answered , still chewing stolidly on the fish . It was rubbery and oily but he chewed it slowly , swallowing only a little at a time . " You c'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at him . " How ? " " Injun style , " Reeves said , " rubbin ' two sticks together . " Max laughed . " It wo n't work . The wood 's too damp . " He picked up a piece of the fish and held it up toward Reeves . " Here , eat it . It ai n't so bad if you chew it slow . " Reeves took the fish and squatted down beside Max , then began to chew on it . After a moment , he spat it out . " I ca n't eat it . " He was silent for a moment , his arms wrapped around himself . " It 's gettin ' damn cold out here , " he said , shivering slightly . Max looked at him . It was n't that cold . Faint beads of perspiration stood out on Reeves 's face and he was beginning to tremble . " Lay down , " Max said . " I 'll cover you with grass  --  that 'll keep you warm . " Reeves stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hot with fever . Max straightened up slowly and went to cut some more grass . It was a hell of a time for Reeves to come down with malaria . Reluctantly he took one of his matches from its oilskin wrapping and lighted a fire . Reeves continued to shake spastically beneath the blanket of swamp grass and moan through his chattering teeth . Max glanced up at the sky .  | The night was almost gone . Unconsciously he sighed . He wondered how long it would take for the warden to catch up with them now . He dozed , swaying slightly , as he sat . A strange sound hit his subconscious and suddenly he was awake . He reached for his fishing spear and crouched down . The sound came again . Whatever it was , it was large . He heard the sound again , closer this time . His legs drew up beneath him . He was set to lunge the spear . It was n't much but it was the only weapon he had . Then Mike was standing there casually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damn fool , boy , " he said . " Shoulda knowed better'n to light a fire out here . " Max got to his feet . He could feel fatigue spread over him now that it was over . He gestured to the sick man . " He got the fever . " Mike walked over to Reeves . " Sure ' nough , " he said , his voice marveling . " That warden , he was right . He figgered Reeves would get it after three days in the swamp . " Mike sat down next to the fire and warmed his hands . " Man but that fire sure do feel good , " he said . " You should'n'a waited aroun ' . " " What else could I do ? " " He would'n'a waited if it was you . " " But it wasn ' me , " Max said . The Negro looked down at the ground . " Maybe you better git goin ' now , boy . " Max stared at him . " What do you mean ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the rest of the posse ? " " They won ' catch up fo ' a couple of hours , " Mike said . " They be satisfied catchin ' Reeves . " Max stared at him , then looked off into the swamp . After a moment , he shook his head . " I ca n't do it , " he said . " You ' a bigger fool than I thought , boy , " Mike said heavily . " ' livas him , he 'd be off in the swamp now . " " We busted out together , " Max answered . " It 's only fittin ' we go back together . " " All right , boy , " Mike said in a resigned voice . He got to his feet . " Drown that fire . " Max kicked the fire into the water , where it sputtered and died . He glanced back and saw Mike pick up Reeves as if he were a baby and sling him over his shoulder . Max started back into the swamp toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mike 's voice came from behind him .  | Max turned around and stared . Mike pointed in the opposite direction . " The end o ' the swamp about twenty-fi ' miles that way . " Sudden comprehension came to Max . " You ca n't do it , Mike . You ai n't even officially a prisoner no more . " The big man 's head nodded . " You ' right , boy . I ai n't a prisoner . That means I kin go where I wants an ' if I do n't want to go back , they ca n't say nothin ' about it . " " But it 's different if they catch you helpin ' me . " " If they catch us , they catch us , " Mike said simply . " Anyway , I do n't wanta be the one who lays the snake on you . I ca n't do it . You see , we 's really frien 's . " Eight days later , they came out of the swamp . They stretched out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max raised his head . Far in the distance , he could see smoke rising on the horizon . " There 's a town there , " he said excitedly , scrambling to his feet . " We 'll be able to git some decent grub . " " Not so fast , " Reeves said , pulling him down . Reeves was still yellow from the fever but it had passed . " If it 's a town , there 's a general store . We 'll hit it tonight . No use takin ' any chances . They might be expectin ' us . Max looked over at Mike . The big Negro nodded . They hit the store at two in the morning . When they came out , they all wore fresh clothing , had guns tucked in their belt and almost eighteen dollars they had found in the till . Max wanted to steal three horses from the livery stable and ride out . " Ai n't that just like an Injun ? " Reeves said sarcastically . " They 'll trace horses faster'n us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then we 'll worry about horses . " Two days later , they had their horses . Four days later , they knocked off a bank in a small town and came out with eighteen hundred dollars . Ten minutes later , they were on their way to Texas .  | MAX CAME INTO FORT WORTH TO MEET THE TRAIN THAT WAS to bring Jim Reeves 's daughter from New Orleans . He sat in the barber chair and stared at himself in the mirror . The face that looked back was no longer the face of a boy . The trim black beard served to disguise the high cheekbones . He no longer looked like an Indian . Max got out of the chair . " How much do I owe you ? " " Fifty cents for the haircut , two bits for the beard trim . " Max threw him a silver dollar . Mike came off the side of the building against which he had been leaning and fell into step . " It 's about time fer the train to be comin ' in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well walk down to the station . " Three and a half years before , they had come into Fort Worth one night with seven thousand dollars in their saddlebags . Behind them they had left two empty banks and two dead men . But they had been lucky . Not one of them had been identified as other than an unknown person . " This looks like a good town , " Max had said enthusiastically . " I counted two banks comin ' in . " Reeves had looked up at him from a chair in the cheap hotel room . " We 're through with that , " he said . Max stared at him . " Why ? They look like setups . " Reeves shook his head . " That 's where I made my mistake last time . I did n't know when to quit . " He stuck a cigarette in his mouth . " What we goin ' to do , then ? " Max asked . Reeves lit the cigarette . " Look aroun ' for a good legitimate business . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Texas is growin ' . " Reeves found the business he was looking for in a little town sixty-five miles south of Fort Worth . A saloon and gambling hall . In less than two years , he had become the most important man in town . Then he started a bank in a corner of the gambling house and , a little time later , began to acquire land . There was even talk of electing him mayor . He bought a small ranch outside of town , fixed up the house and moved out of the rooms over the saloon . A little while after that , he moved the bank out of the saloon , which Max then operated , and ensconced it in a small building on the main street . In less than a year ,  | people began to forget that he had ever owned the saloon and began to think of him as the town banker . He began to grow quietly rich . He needed but one thing more to complete his guise of respectability . A family . He sent discreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was dead and his daughter was living with her mother 's relatives . He sent her a telegram and received one in return , saying that she would arrive at Fort Worth on the fifth of March . Max stood looking down the platform at the disembarking passengers . " You know what she looks like ? " Mike asked . " Just what Jim tol ' me and it 's been ten years since he saw her . " Little by little , the passengers walked away until the only one left was a young woman , surrounded by several valises and a small trunk . She kept looking up and down the platform . Mike looked at Max questioningly . " You reckon that might be her ? " Max shrugged his shoulders . They walked down to the young woman . Max took off his Stetson . " Miss Reeves ? " A smile of relief appeared on the young woman 's face . " I declare , I 'm glad to see you , " she said warmly . " I was beginnin ' to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " I 'm Max Sand , " he said . " Your father sent me to meet you . " A fleeting shadow crossed the girl 's face . " I half expected that , " she said . " Daddy 's been too busy to come home for ten years . " Max guessed that she did n't know her father had been in prison . " Come , " he said gently . " I 've got a room for you over at the Palace Hotel . You can clean up and sleep there tonight . We got a two-day trip home , so we wo n't start till morning . " By the time they reached the hotel , twenty minutes later , Max was in love for the first time in his life . Max tied his horse to the hitching post in front of the Reeves ranch house . He climbed up the steps and knocked at the door . When Reeves 's daughter opened it , her face looked tired and strained , as if she 'd been weeping . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " Come in . " He followed her into the parlor . He reached for her , suddenly concerned . " Betty , what 's wrong ? " She slipped away from his hands . " Why did n't you tell me you were an escaped convict ? " she asked , not looking at him . His face settled into cold lines . " Would it have made any diff'rence ? "  | She met his look honestly . " Yes , " she said . " I 'd never have let myself get this involved if I 'd known . " " Now that you do know , " he persisted . " Does it matter ? " " Yes , " she said again . " Oh , do n't ask me . I 'm so confused ! " " What else did your father tell you ? " She looked down at her hands . " He said I could n't marry you . Not only because of that but because you 're  --  you 're half Indian ! " " An ' just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared down at her twisting hands without answering . " I do n't know how I feel , " she said finally . He reached out and pulled her toward him . " Betty , Betty , " he said huskily . " Las ' night at the dance , you kissed me . You said you loved me . I have n't changed since then . " For a moment , she stood quietly , then pulled herself away from him . " Do n't touch me ! " she said quickly . Max stared at her curiously . " You don ' have to be afraid of me . " She shrank from his hand . " Do n't touch me , " she said , and this time the fear in her voice was much too familiar for Max not to recognize it . Without another word , he turned and left the room . He rode straight into town to the bank and walked into the back room that served Reeves as an office . Reeves looked up from the big roll-top desk . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " he demanded . Max stared at him . " Do n't try to bull-shit me , Reeves . You already done a good job on your daughter . " Reeves leaned back in his chair and laughed . " Is that all ? " he asked . " It 's enough , " Max said . " Las ' night she promised to marry me . " Reeves leaned forward . " I gave you credit for more brains'n that , Max . " " It do n't matter now , Reeves . I 'm movin ' on . " Reeves stared at him for a moment . " You mean that ? " Max nodded . " I mean it . " " You takin ' the nigger with you ? " " Yeah , " Max said . " When I get our share of the money . " Reeves swung his chair around and took some bills from the safe behind him . He threw them down on the desk in front of Max . " There it is . Max looked down at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counted it . " There 's only five hundred dollars here , " he said . " What did you expect ? " Reeves asked . " We came into Fort Worth with seven thousand . My share of that alone was twenty-three hundred an ' we ai n't been exactly losin ' money in the saloon . " Max took a ready-made from Reeves 's desk and lit it . " I figger Mike an ' me 's due at least five thousand . " Reeves shrugged . " I wo n't argue , " he said . " After all , we been through a lot together , you an ' me . If that 's what you figure , that 's what you get . " He counted the money out on the desk . Max picked it up and put it in his pocket . " I did n't think you 'd part with it so easy , " he said . He was halfway to the saloon when someone hailed him from the rear . He turned around slowly . The sheriff and two deputies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . " What 's up , Sheriff ? " Max asked .  | " Search him , " Reeves said excitedly . " You 'll find the money he stole right on him . " " Stole ? " Max said . " He 's crazy ! That money 's mine . He owed it to me . " " Keep your hand away from your gun , " the sheriff said , moving forward cautiously . He stuck his hand in Max 's pocket . It came out with a sheaf of bills . " See ! " Reeves yelled . " What did I tell you ? " " You son of a bitch ! " Max exploded . He flung himself toward Reeves . jBefore he could reach him , the sheriff brought his gun butt down along the side of Max 's head . It was just at that moment that Mike looked out the window of the room over the saloon . Reeves walked over to Max and looked down at him . " I shoulda known better than to trust a half-breed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tote him over to the jail , " the sheriff said . Iii " Better get over to the saloon and get his nigger friend , too , " Reeves said . " He was probably in on it . " Mike saw the sheriff look over at the saloon , then begin to walk toward it . He did n't wait any longer . He went down the back stairs and got the hell out of town . Reeves rode along the road to his ranch , half humming to himself . He was feeling good . For the first time , he was secure . Max would n't dare talk ; it would only make it worse for him . And the nigger was gone . Leave it to a nigger to run when things got rough . He was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he never heard the crack of the snake as it whipped out from behind the trees and dragged him down off his horse . He scrambled to his feet and reached for his gun but the next crack of  | the snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the big whip coiling slowly back up his arm . Reeves screamed in terror . The big snake cracked again and Reeves spun around and tumbled over backward into the dust . He got to his hands and knees and began to crawl , then scrambled to his feet and tried to run . The snake ran down the road after him and crept between his legs , throwing him to the ground . He turned his head and saw Mike 's arm go up into the air , the long black whip rising with it . He screamed as the snake tore into him again . Sometime early the next morning , the sheriff and his deputies came across a body lying at the side of the road . During the night , someone had torn the bars from the window of the jail 's only cell and Max had escaped . One of the deputies saw the body first . He wheeled his horse over beside it and looked down . The sheriff and the other deputy wheeled their horses . For a long while , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them took off his hat and wiped the cold , beaded sweat from his forehead . " That looks like Banker Reeves . " The sheriff turned and looked at him . " That was Banker Reeves , " he said . " He , too , took off his hat and wiped his face . " Funny , " he added . " The only thing I know of that can do that to a man is a Louisiana prison snake . " 14 THE NAME OF THE VILLAGE IN SPANISH WAS VERY LONG AND difficult for Americans to pronounce , so after a while they gave it their own name . Hideout . It was a place to go when there was nowhere else to turn , when the law was hot on your neck and you were tired of sleeping nights on the cold prairie and eating dry beef and cold beans from a can . It was expensive but it was worth it . Four miles over the border and the law could not reach you . And it was the only place in Mexico where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay four times the price for it . The alcalde sat at his table in the rear of the cantina and watched the  | two americanos come in . They sat down at the table near the door . The smaller one ordered tequila . The alcalde watched the two with interest . Soon they would be going away . It was always like that . When first they came , they 'd have nothing but the best . The finest whisky , the best rooms , the most expensive girls . Then their money would run short and they 'd begin to reduce their expenses . First , the room would be changed for a cheaper one ; next , the girls would go . Last , the whisky . When they got down to drinking tequila , it meant that before long , they 'd be moving on . He lifted his glass and drank his tequila quickly . That was the way of the world . He looked at the smaller man again . There was something about him that had caught his eye . He sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one : the Indian blood in the Jefe told him instinctively which ones were the warriors . He sighed again . Poor Juarez , he wanted so much for the people and got so little . He wondered if before the Jefe died , he had realized that the only reason for his failure was that the people did n't want as much for themselves as he had wanted for them . He stared at the americanos , remembering the first time he had seen them . It was almost three years ago . They had come into the cantina quietly , weary and covered with the dust of their travels . Then , as now , they had sat at the table near the door . The bottle and glasses were on the table when the big man at the bar had come over to them . He spoke to the smaller man , ignoring the other . " We do n't allow niggers in this here saloon . " The smaller man did n't even look up . He filled his friend 's glass first , then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass shattered against the floor and silence abruptly fell across the cantina . " Get your nigger outa here , " the big man said . He stared at them for a moment , then turned and strode back to the bar . The Negro started to rise but the smaller man stopped him with a gesture from his eyes . Slowly the Negro sank back into his chair . It was only when the smaller man left the table to go to the bar that the alcalde realized that he was n't as small as he had first thought . It was only by comparison to the Negro that he seemed small . " Who makes the rules here ? " he asked the bartender . The bartender gestured toward the rear . " The alcalde , senor . " The americano turned and came toward the table . His eyes surprised the alcalde ; they were a hard , dark blue . He spoke in Spanish , with a trace of Cuban accent . " Does the swine speak the truth , senor ? " " No , senor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here who have the money to pay their way . "  | The man nodded and returned to the bar . He stopped in front of the man who had come over to his table . " The alcalde tells me my friend can stay , " he said . The man turned to him angrily . " Who the hell cares what that greaser thinks ? Just because we 're across the border , does n't mean I have to drink with niggers ! " The smaller man 's voice was cold . " My friend eats with me , drinks with me , sleeps with me , and he 's not goin ' . " He turned his back calmly and went back to his table . He was just seating himself again when the angry americano started for him . " If you like niggers so much , nigger-lover , see how you like sleepin ' with a dead one ! " he shouted , pulling his gun . The smaller americano seemed scarcely to move but the gun was in his hand , smoke rising from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rafters of the cantina . And the loud-mouthed one lay dead on the floor in front of the bar . " I apologize for the disturbance we have made against the hospitality of your village , " he said in his strange Spanish . The alcalde looked down at the man on the floor , and shrugged . " De nada , " he said . " It is nothing . You were right . The swine had no grace . " Now , almost three years later , the alcalde sighed , remembering . The little one had grace , much grace  --  natural like a panther . And the gun . Caramba ! There had never been anything so fast . It seemed almost to have a life of its own . What a pistolera this one would have made . Juarez would have been proud of him . Several times each year , the two friends would quietly disappear from the village and as quietly reappear  --  several weeks , sometimes several months later . And each time they came back , they had money to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But each time , the alcalde could sense a deeper solitude in them , a greater aloneness . There were times he felt a strange kind of pity for them . They were not like the others that came to the village . This way of life held no pleasure for them . And now they were drinking tequila again . How many times before they would go out like this and never return ? Not only to this village but to nowhere on this earth . Max swallowed the tequila and bit into the lime . The tart juice burst into his throat , giving his mouth a clean , fresh feeling . He looked at Mike . " How much we got left ? " Mike thought for a moment . " Maybe three more weeks . "  | Max rolled a cigarette and lit it . " What we got ta do is make a big hit . Then maybe we could go up into California or Nevada or someplace where they don ' know us an ' git ourselves straightened out . Money shore don ' last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It sho ' don ' , " he agreed . " But that ain ' the answer . We got ta split up . They lookin ' for us together . When they see me , it 's like you carryin ' a big of sign with you ' name on it . " Max filled his glass again . " Tryin ' to get rid of me ? " He smiled , throwing the liquor down his throat and reaching for the lime . Mike said seriously , " Maybe ' thout me , you could settle down someplace an ' make a life fo ' yourself . You won ' have to run no mor ' . " Max spit out a lime seed . " We made us a deal to stick together . We get enough money this time , we 'll head for California . " The door opened and a tall , redheaded cowboy came in . He walked over to their table and dropped into an empty chair . " Dl ' Charlie Dobbs got here in the nick o ' time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tequila 'll eat the linin ' off your stomach sure as hell . Bartender , bring us a bottle of whisky . " The bartender put whisky and glasses on the table and walked away . Charlie filled the glasses and they drank . " What brings you back , Charlie ? " Max asked . " I thought you were headin ' up Reno way . " " I was . But I run into the biggest thing ever I saw . It was too good to pass up . " " What kinda job ? " Max asked , leaning across the table . Charlie lowered his voice . " A new bank . You remember I tol ' you I heard las ' year they were minin ' for oil up in Texas ? I decided to pay them diggin 's a visit on my way north . " He poured another drink and swallowed it quickly . " Well , they found it all right . It 's the craziest thing you ever saw . They sink a well down in the groun ' an ' instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off , barrel it an ' ship it east . There 's oil all over the place an ' that bank 's just bustin ' with money . " " Sounds good to me , " Max said . " What 's the deal ? " " A local man set up the job but he needs help . He wants two shares , we get one share each . " " Fair enough , " Max said . He turned to Mike . " What do you think ? " Mike nodded . " When we pull the job ? " he asked . Charlie looked at him . " Right after the new year . The bank is gettin ' in a lot of money then for new diggin ' . " He refilled all the glasses . " We 'll have to start tomorrow . It took me three weeks to ride down here . "  | MAX PUSHED HIS WAY INTO THE SALOON BEHIND CHARLIE Dobbs . It was crowded with oil-miners and cowboys and the dice table and faro layouts were working full blast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance at the games . " What 'd I tell you ? " Charlie chortled . " This is a real boom town all right . " He led the way down the bar to where a man was standing by himself . The man turned and looked at him . " You took long enough gettin ' here , " he said in a low voice . " It 's a long ride , Ed , " Charlie said . " Meet me outside , " Ed said , throwing a silver dollar on the bar and walking out . He glanced quickly at Max as he passed . Max caught a glimpse of pale gimlet eyes without expression . The man seemed to be in his late forties , with a long , sandy mustache trailing across his lip . There was something familiar about him but Max could n't place it . There was only the feeling that he had seen him before . The man was waiting outside the saloon for them . He walked ahead and they followed him into a dark alley . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , " he said angrily . " There 's another man , Ed , " Charlie said quickly . " He 's layin ' up just outside of town . " " All right . You got here just in time . Tomorrow night  --  that 's Friday night  --  the president and the cashier of the bank work late makin ' up the riggin ' crews ' payrolls for Saturday . They usually get through about ten o'clock . We get them as they come out the door an ' hustle them back inside . That way , they can open the safe for us ; we do n't have to blow it . " " All right with me , " Charlie said . " What do you think , Max ? " Max looked at Ed . " They carry guns ? " " I reckon . You afraid of gunplay ? " Max shook his head . " No . I jus ' like to know what to expect . " " How much you think we 'll get ? " Charlie interjected . " Fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty thousand ! " " You 'll drift over here one at a time . Quiet . I do n't want no one to be  | lookin ' at us . We 'll meet in back of the bank at nine thirty sharp . " Ed looked at them and they nodded again . He started to walk away , then came back . He peered at Max . " Ai n't I seen you someplace before ? " Max shrugged his shoulders . " Mebbe . I been aroun ' . You look familiar to me , too . " " Maybe it 'll come to me tomorrow night . " He started to walk down the alley . Max watched him until he turned into the street . He turned slowly to Charlie . " There 's somethin ' about that man . I got the feelin ' I should know who he is . " Charlie laughed . " Let 's go . Mike 'll be wonderin ' what happened to us . " " Set yourself ! " Ed whispered hoarsely . " They 're comin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . On the other side of the doorway , Ed and Charlie were waiting . He could hear the sound of two men 's voices as they approached the door inside the bank . They all moved at once as the door opened , pushing it inward with sudden force . " What the hell 's goin ' ? " a voice said from the darkness inside . It was followed by a thud , then the sound of a body falling . " You keep your mouth shet , mister , if you want to keep livin ' ! " There was a frightened gasp , then silence . " Git them into the back room . " Ed 's voice came harshly . Max bent swiftly and pulled the fallen man along the floor toward the back . There was the sound of a match behind him and then a lamp cast a tiny glow in the back room . He pulled the man into the room . He slumped and lay still when Max let him go . " Check the front door ! " Ed hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The street was quiet and deserted . " No one out there , " he said . " Good , " Ed said . " Let 's get to work . " He turned to the other of the two men . " Open the safe . " The man was in his late fifties . He was staring at the man on the floor with a horror-stricken look . " I  --  I ca n't , " he said . " Only Mr. Gordon can . He 's the president , the only one who knows the combination . " Ed turned to Max . " Wake him up . " Max knelt beside the man . He turned his face . The head looked peculiar , the jaw hung slack . Max looked up at Ed . " Ai n't nothin ' goin ' to wake him up . You caved his head in . " " My God ! " the other man said . He seemed almost ready to faint .  | Ed stepped around in front of him . " I reckon you 're goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " B  --  but I ca n't , " the bank clerk said . " I do n't know the combination . " Ed hit him viciously across the face . The man fell against a desk . " Well , learn it , then ! " " Honest , mister , " he sobbed . " I do n't know it . Mr. Gordon was the only one . He was ? " Ed hit him again . " Open that safe ! " " Look , mister , " the man begged . " There 's over four thousand dollars in that desk there ! Take it and do n't hit me any more , please . I do n't know the combination ? " Ed moved around the desk and opened the center drawer . He took out a package of bills and stuffed it into his jacket . He walked around the desk and stood in front of the kneeling bank clerk . " Now , open the safe ! " he said , hitting the man again . The man sprawled out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know ! " When Ed drew his foot back to kick him , Max touched his shoulder . " Maybe he 's tellin ' the truth . " Ed stared at him for a moment , then lowered his foot . " Maybe . I know how we can find out fast . " He gestured at Max . " Get back on the door . " Max walked back through the bank to the front door and looked out again . The street was still deserted . He stood there , quietly alert . Ed 's voice came to him from the back room . " Tie the bastard to the chair . " " What are you gon na do ? " the bank clerk protested in a weak voice . Max walked back and looked in the room . Ed was kneeling in front of the potbellied stove , stirring the poker in the live coals . Charlie straightened up from tying the clerk and looked at Ed curiously . " What 're you doin ' ? " " He 'll talk if this red-hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said grimly . " Wait a minute , " Charlie protested . " You think the guy is lyin ' , kill him . " Ed got to his feet and turned on Charlie angrily . " That 's the trouble with you young ones nowadays . You got no guts , you 're too squeamish . He ca n't open no safe if he 's dead ! " " He ca n't open it if he do n't know the combination , either ! " " You do n't like it , scram ! " Ed said savagely . " There 's fifty thousand bucks in that there safe . I 'm goin ' to git it ! " Max turned from the door and started back toward the front of the  | bank . He had taken about two steps when he was stopped by Ed 's voice , coming from the back room . " This 'll work , believe me , " Ed was saying . " ' Bout ten , twelve years back , Rusty Harris , Tom Dort an ' me gave the treatment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max felt his stomach heave and he reached for the wall to keep from falling . He closed his eyes for a moment and the scene in the cabin came back to him  --  his father hanging lifelessly , his mother crumpled on the floor , the orange glow of the fire against the night sky . His head began to clear . He shook it . A cold , dead feeling replaced the nausea . He turned toward the back room . Ed was still kneeling in front of the stove . Charlie stood across the room , his face white and sick . " The ol ' miser had gold stashed somewhere aroun ' the place . Everybody in Dodge knew it ? " Ed looked up and saw Max , who had crossed the room and was standing over him . " What 're you doin ' here ? I tol ' you to cover the door ! " Max looked down at him . His voice was hollow . " Did you ever git that gold ? " A puzzled look crossed Ed 's face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't any to start with . " Ed stared at him . " How do you know ? " " I know , " Max said slowly . " I 'm Max Sand . " Recognition leaped into Ed 's face . He went for his gun , rolling sideways away from Max . Max kicked the gun from his hand and Ed scrambled after it as Max pulled the white-hot poker from the fire . Ed turned , raising the gun toward Max , just as the poker lunged at his eyes . He screamed in agony as the white metal burned its way through his flesh . The gun went off , the bullet going wild into the ceiling above him , then it fell from his hand . Max stood there a moment , looking down . The stench of burned flesh reached up to his nostrils . It was over . Twelve years and it was over . He turned dully as Charlie pulled at his arm . " Let 's git outs here ! " Charlie shouted . " The whole town 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Max said slowly . He let the poker fall from his hand and started for the door . Mike was holding the horses and they leaped into the saddle . They rode out of town in a hail of bullets with a posse less than thirty minutes behind them . Three days later , they were holed up in a small cave in the foothills . Max came back from the entrance and looked down at his friend . " How you doin ' , Mike ? "  | " You go , Charlie . I 'm stayin ' here with Mike . " Mike pushed himself to a sitting position , his back against the wall of the cave . " Don ' be a fool , boy , " he said . Max shook his head . " I 'm stayin ' with you . " Mike smiled . His hand reached for Max 's and squeezed it gently . " We 's friends , boy , ai n't we ? Real friends ? " Max nodded . " An ' I never steered you bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' to die an ' they 's nothin ' you can do about it . " Max rolled a cigarette , lit it and stuck it in Mike 's mouth . " Shut up an ' rest . " " Open my belt . " Max leaned across his friend and pulled the buckle . Mike groaned as the belt slid off . " Tha 's better , " he said . " Now look inside that belt . " Max turned it over . There was a money pouch taped to the inner surface . Mike smiled . " They 's five thousand dollars in that pouch . I been holdin ' out for the right time  --  now . It was for the day we lef this business . " Max rolled another cigarette and lit it . He watched his friend silently . Mike coughed . " You was born thirty years too late for this business . They ai n't no mo ' room in this worl ' for a gun fighter . We come in at the tail end with nothin ' but the leavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mike 's face . " I 'm still not goin ' . " Mike looked up at him . " Don ' make me feel like I picked the wrong one back there in that prison , " he said . " Not now when I 'm a dyin ' man . " Max 's face broke into a sudden smile . " You 're full of shit , Mike . " Mike grinned up at him . " I kin hold the posse off all day . By then , you 'll be so far no'th , they 'll never catch up to you . " He started to laugh and suddenly stopped as he began to cough blood . He reached up a hand to Max . " He'p me to my feet , boy . " Max reached out and pulled Mike up . The big man leaned against him Mike 's usually shiny black face was drawn and gray . " Poorly , boy , poorly . " Max bent over and wiped his face . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " It don ' really matter , boy . I got it good this time . I 's th'ough travelin ' . " Charlie 's voice came from the back of the cave . " It 'll be dawn in ant other hour . We better git movin ' . "  | as they moved toward the mouth of the cave . They came out into the night and there was a small breeze just picking up at the edge of the cliffs . For a moment they stood there , savoring the physical closeness of each other , the small things of love that men can share , then slowly Max lowered his friend to the ground . Mike looked down the ridge . " I can hol ' them here forever , " he said . " Now , ' member what I said , boy . Go straight . No more thievin ' . No more gun fightin ' . I got you ' word , boy ? " " You got my word , Mike . " " If you breaks it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " the big man said . He turned his head away and looked down the ridge . " Now git , boy , " he said huskily . " Dawn is breakin ' . " He reached for the rifle at his side . Max turned and walked over to his horse . He mounted and sat there for a moment , looking back at Mike . The big colored man never turned to look back . Max dug his spurs into his horse and it leaped away . It was n't until an hour later , when the sun was bright and Max was on the next ridge , that he began to wonder about the quiet . By this time , there should have been the sound of gunfire behind him . He never knew that Mike had died the moment he was out of sight . He felt naked at first without his beard . Rubbing his fingers over his cleanly shaven face , he walked into the kitchen . Charlie looked up from the kitchen table . " My God , " he exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his wife , turned from the stove . She smiled suddenly . " You 're much younger than I thought . And handsomer , too . " Max felt a flush of color run up into his cheeks . Awkwardly he sat down . " I figgered it 's time for me to be movin ' on . " Charlie and his wife exchanged quick looks . " Why ? " Charlie asked . " You own half this spread . You just ca n't go off an ' leave it . " Max studied him . He rolled a cigarette and lit it . " We been here three months now . Let 's stop kiddin ' ourselves . This place ca n't carry the both of us . " They were silent . Max was right . Even though he had advanced the money to buy the ranch , there was n't enough in it yet for all of them . " What if somebody recognizes you ? " Martha asked . " Your poster 's in every sheriffs office in the southwest . " Max smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Not without the beard . "  | " You better think up a new name for yourself , " Charlie said . Max blew out a cloud of smoke . " Yeah . I reckon so . It 's time . Everything 's got ta change . " But the name had n't come to him until the day he stood in the hot Nevada sun looking up at old man Cord and young Jonas . Then it came easy . As if it had been his own all his life . Smith . Nevada Smith . It was a good name . It told nothing about him . He looked down at the little boy staring up at him with frightened eyes , then at the cold black gun in his other hand . He saw the child follow his eyes . He dropped the gun back into his holster . He smiled slowly . " Well , Junior , " he said . " You heard your pappy . " He turned to his horse and led it around to the bunkhouse , the boy trotting obediently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice piped up behind him . " Are you going to live here with Wong Toy ? " He smiled again . " I reckon so . " He picked out one of the bunks and spread his bedroll on it . Quickly he put his things away . When he turned around , the boy was still watching him with wide eyes . " You 're really goin ' to stay ? " the child asked . " Uh-huh . " " Really ? " the boy insisted . " Forever ? " His voice caught slightly . " You 're not goin ' to go away like the others ? Like Mommy did ? " Something in the child 's eyes caught inside him . He knelt beside the boy . " I 'll stay jest as long as you want me to . " Suddenly , the boy flung his arms around Nevada 's neck and pressed his cheek close to his face . His breath was soft and warm . " I 'm glad , " he said . " Now you can learn me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging to his legs . He walked outside and put the boy up on the saddle of his horse . He started to climb up behind him when suddenly the gun was heavy against his thigh . " I 'll be back in a minute , " he said , and went back into the bunkhouse . Quickly he pulled the tie strings and unbuckled the gun belt . He hung it on a nail over his bunk and went out again into the white sunlight . And he never strapped the gun on again .  | RINA STEPPED DOWN FROM THE TRAIN INTO THE BRIGHT , FLASHing shadows of afternoon sun lacing the platform . A tall uniformed chauffeur stepped forward and touched his hand to his cap . " Miss Marlowe ? " Rina nodded . " Mr. Smith sends his apologies for not being able to meet you , ma'am . He 's tied up at meetings at the studio . He says he 'll see you for cocktails . " " Thank you , " Rina said . She turned her face away for a moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chauffeur picked up her valises . " If you 'll follow me to the car , ma'am ? " Rina nodded again . She followed the tall uniform through the station to a shining black Pierce-Arrow limousine . Quickly the chauffeur stowed the bags up front and opened the door for her . The tiny gold insignia emblazoned over the handle shone up at her . N S She settled back and reached for a cigarette . The chauffeur 's voice through the speaker startled her . " You 'll find them in the container near your right hand , ma'am . " She caught a glimpse of the man 's quick smile in the rearview mirror as he started the big motor . She lit a cigarette and studied the interior of the car . The gold insignia was everywhere , even woven into the upholstery . She leaned her head back . She did n't know why she should be surprised . She had read enough in the newspapers about him . The forty-acre ranch , and the thirty-room mansion he had built right in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem real . She closed her eyes so she could remember how it had become a reality for her . It had been about five months after she 'd come back East . She 'd gone down to New York for a week of shopping and a banker friend of her father 's had asked her to attend the premiere of a motion picture produced by a company in which he had a substantial interest . " What 's it called ? " she had asked .  | " The Sheriff of Peaceful Village , " the banker had answered . " It 's a Norman picture . Bernie Norman says it 's the greatest Western ever made . " " Westerns bore me , " she 'd answered . " I had enough of that when I was out there myself . " " Norman says he has a new star in the man that 's playing the lead . Nevada Smith . He says he 'll be the biggest ? " " What was that name ? " she interrupted . She could n't have heard right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An odd name but these movie actors always have fancy names . " " I 'll go , " she had said quickly . She remembered walking into the theater  --  the crowds , the bright lights outside , the well-groomed men and bejeweled women . And then that world seemed to vanish with the magic of the image on the screen . It was near the end of the picture now and alone in a dreary room , the sheriff of Peaceful Village was putting on his gun , the gun he had sworn never to touch again . The camera moved in close to his face , so close that she could almost see the tiny pores in his skin , feel his warm breath . He raised the gun and looked at it . She could feel the weariness in him , see the torture of decision tighten his lips , set his square jaw , flatten the high , Indian-like cheekbones into the thin lines that etched their way into his cheeks . But his eyes were what held her . They were the eyes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . The eyes of a man who understood its futility , who felt its pain and sorrow . Slowly the sheriff walked to the door and stepped outside . The bright sunlight came down and hit his face . He pulled his dark hat down over his eyes to shield them from the glare and began to walk down the lonely street . Faces of the townspeople peeked out at him from behind shutters and windows and curtains . He did n't return their glances , just walked forward stolidly , his faded shirt beginning to show the sweat pouring from him in the heat , his patched jeans looking threadbare against his lean , slightly bowed legs . The bright metal of his badge shone on his breast . Death wore soft , expensive clothing . No dust marred the shine of his boots , the gleaming ivory handle of his gun . There was hatred in his face , the pleasurable lust to kill in his eyes , and his hand hovered like a rattlesnake above his holster . They looked deep into each other 's eyes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of combat . The sheriffs were weary with sadness . Death moved first , his hand speeding to his gun , but with a speed  | almost too quick for the eye to follow , the sheriff 's gun seemed to leap into his hand . Death was flung violently backward to the ground , his gun falling from his hand , his eyes already glazing . His body twitched as two more bullets tore in him , and then he lay still . The sheriff stood there for a moment , then slowly put his gun back into the holster . He turned his back on the dead man and began to walk down the street . People began to flock out of the buildings . They watched the sheriff , their faces bright with battle lust . He did not return their glances . The girl came out onto a porch . The sheriff stopped in front of her . The girl 's eyes were dim with tears . The sheriffs were wide and unblinking . An expression of contempt suddenly came into his face . Disgust with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who wanted nothing but their own form of sacrifice . f III ' His hand moved up to his shirt and tore off the badge . He flung it into the dirt at her feet and turned away . The girl looked down at the badge in shock , then up at the sheriffs retreating back . She started to move after him , then stopped . II Far down the street , the sheriff was mounting his horse . He turned it toward the hills . His shoulders slumping and head bowed , wearily he moved out of their lives and into the bright , glaring sunlight , as the screen began to fade . There was silence as the lights came up in the theater . Rina turned to the banker , who smiled embarrassedly at her and cleared his throat . " That 's the first time a movie ever did this to me . " Oddly enough , she felt a lump in her own throat . " Me , too , " she said huskily . He took her arm . " There 's Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulate him . " They pushed their way through a crowd of enthusiastic well-wishers . Norman was a heavy-set man with dark jowls ; his eyes were bright and elated . " How about that guy , Nevada Smith ? " he asked . " Did you ever see anything like it ? Still want me to get Tom Mix for a picture ? " The banker laughed and Rina looked up at him . He did n't laugh very often . " Tom Mix ? " He chortled . " Who 's he ? " Norman hit the banker on the back . " This picture will net two million , " he said happily . " And I got Nevada Smith starting another picture right away ! "  | The limousine turned into a driveway at the foot of the hill . It passed under an iron gateway over which the now familiar insignia was emblazoned and began to wind its way up the narrow roadway to the top of the hill . Rina looked out the window and saw the huge house , its white roof turning blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . What was she doing here ? This was n't the Nevada she knew . Suddenly , frantically , she opened her purse and began to search through it for Nevada 's cablegram . Then it was in her hand and she felt calmer as she read it . She remembered sending him a wire from Switzerland last month . It had been three years since she had heard from him . Three years in which she had kept on running . The first six months she spent in Boston , then boredom set in . New York was next , then London , Paris , Rome , Madrid , Constantinople , Berlin . There were the parties , the hungers , the fierce affairs , the passionate men , the voracious women . And the more she ran , the more frightened and alone she became . And then came the morning in Zurich when she awoke with the sun shining in her eyes . She lay naked in bed , a white sheet thrown over her . Her mouth was dry and parched ; she felt as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She reached for the carafe on the night table and when it was n't there , she first realized she was n't in her own room . She sat up in a room that was furnished in expensive European fashion but was n't familiar at all . She looked around for her robe but there was n't a single item of her clothing anywhere . Vaguely she wondered where she was . There were cigarettes and matches on the night table and she lit one . The acrid smoke bit into her lungs as the door opened . An attractive dark-haired woman came into the room . She paused when she saw Rina sitting up in bed . A smile came to her lips . She came over to the bed . " Ah , you are awake , ma cherie , " she said softly , bending and kissing Rina on the mouth . Rina stared up at her , her eyes wide . " Who are you ? " " Ah , my love , you do not remember me ? " Rina shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the woman said , dropping her gown and pressing Rina 's head to her naked full bosom . " There now , do you remember how much we loved each other ? " Her hand caressed Rina 's face . Angrily Rina pushed it away . The door opened again and a man came in . He held a bottle of champagne in one hand and was completely nude . He smiled at them . " Ah , " he said . " We are all awake once again . The party was getting dull . " He crossed the room and held the champagne bottle out to Rina.  | " Have some wine , darling , " he said . " The trouble is  --  one wakes up with such a terrible thirst , no ? " Rina held her hands to her temples . She felt the throbbing pulse beneath her fingers . It was a nightmare . This was n't real . It could n't be . The man stroked her head solicitously . " A headache , no ? I will bring some aspirin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the woman . " Please , " she begged . " I think I 'm going out of my mind . Where are we ? " " In Zurich , of course , at Philippe 's place . " " In Zurich ? " Rina questioned . " Philippe ? " She looked up at the woman . " Was that Philippe ? " " Mais non , of course not . That was Karl , my husband . Do n't you re-member ? " Rina shook her head . " I do n't remember anything . " " We met at the races three weeks ago in Paris , " the woman said . " You were alone in the box next to Philippe 's . Your friend could not come , remember ? " Rina closed her eyes . She was beginning to remember . She had placed a bet on the beautiful red roan and the man in the adjoining box had leaned over . " A very wise choice , " he had said . " That is my horse . I am Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next box ! " Rina exclaimed . The woman nodded . She smiled again . " You remember , " she said in a pleased voice . " The party began in Paris but it was too warm there , so we drove here to Philippe 's chalet . That was almost two weeks ago . " " Two weeks ? " The woman nodded . " It has been a wonderful party , " she said . She sat down on the bed next to Rina . " You 're a very beautiful girl . " Rina stared at her , speechless . The door opened again and Karl came in , a bottle of aspirin in one hand , the champagne in the other . A tall blond man wearing a dressing robe followed him . He threw some photographs down on the bed . " How do you like them , Rina ? " She stared down at the pictures . A sick feeling began to come up into her throat . This could not be her . Not like this . Nude . With that woman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The count was smiling . " I should have done better , " he said apologetically . " But I think there was something the matter with the timer . " The woman picked them up . " I think you did well enough , Philippe . " She laughed . " It was so funny . Making love with that little bulb in your hand so you could take the picture . " Rina was still silent .  | Karl bent over her . " Our little Americaine is still sick , " he said gently . He held out two aspirins to her . " Here , take these . You will feel better . " Rina stared up at the three of them . " I 'd like to get dressed , please , " she said in a weak voice . The woman nodded . " But of course , " she said . " Your clothes are in the closet . " They turned and left the room . Rina got out of bed and washed her face quickly . She debated over taking a bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hurry to leave . She dressed and walked out into the other room . The woman was still in her peignoir , but the men had changed to soft shirts and white flannels . She started to walk out without looking at them . The man named Karl called , " Mrs. Cord , you forgot your purse . " Silently she turned to take it from him , her eyes avoiding his face . " I put in a set of the photographs as a memento of our party . " She opened the bag . The pictures stared obscenely up at her . " I do n't want them , " she said , holding them out . He waved them aside . " Keep them . We can always make more copies from the negatives . " Slowly she lifted her eyes to his face . He was smiling . " Perhaps you would like a cup of coffee while we talk business ? " he asked politely . The negatives cost her ten thousand dollars and she burned them in an ash tray before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hotel , as soon as she had checked in . I 'M LONELY AND MORE FRIGHTENED THAN I EVER WAS BEFORE . ARE YOU STILL MY FRIEND ? His reply reached her the next day , with a credit for five thousand dollars and confirmed reservations from Zurich through to California . She crinkled the cablegram in her fingers as she read it once more while the limousine climbed to the top of the hill . The cable was typical of the Nevada she remembered . But it did n't seem at all like the Nevada she was coming to see . I AM STILL YOUR FRIEND . It was signed " Nevada . "  | NEVADA LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED AROUND THE large office . An aura of tension had crept into the room . Dan Pierce 's face was bland and smiling . " It is n't the money this time , Bernie , " he said . " It 's just that we feel the time is right . Let 's do a picture about the West as it really was and skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Norman looked down at his desk for a moment , his hand toying with the blue-covered script . He assumed an earnest expression . " It is n't the script , believe me , Dan , " he said , turning to Von Elster for assurance . " We think it 's great , do n't we ? " The lanky , bald director nodded . " It 's one of the greatest I ever read . " " Then why the balk ? " the agent asked . Norman shook his head . " The time is n't right . The industry is too upset . Warner 's has a talking picture coming out soon . The Lights of New York . Some people think that when it comes out , silent movies will be finished . " Dan Pierce laughed . " Malarkey ! Movies are movies . If you want to hear actors talk , go to the theater , that 's where talk belongs . " Norman turned to Nevada , his voice taking on a fatherly tone . " Look , Nevada , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first came here , we 've treated you right . If it 's a question of money , that 's no problem . Just name the figure . " Nevada smiled at him . " It is n't the money , Bernie . You know that . Ten thousand a week is enough for any man , even if income taxes have gone up to seven per cent . It 's this script . It 's the first real story I 've ever read out here . " Norman reached for a cigar . Nevada leaned back in his chair . He remembered when he had first heard of the script . It was last year , when he was making Gunfire at Sundown . One of the writers , a young man with glasses and a very pale skin , had come over to him . " Mr. Smith , " he asked diffidently . " Can I trouble you for a minute ? " Nevada turned from the make-up man . " Why , sure ? " He hesitated . " Mark Weiss , " the writer said quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do for you ? "  | " I 've got a script I 'd like you to read , " Weiss said quickly . " I spent two years researching it . It 's about one of the last gun fighters in the Southwest . I think it 's different from anything that 's ever been made . " " I 'd be glad to read it . " That was one of the hazards of being a star . Everyone had a script they wanted you to read and each was the greatest ever written . " What 's it called ? " " The Renegade . " He held out a blue-covered script . The script felt heavy in his hand . He opened it to the last page and looked at the writer doubtfully . The script was three times standard length . " Pretty long , is n't it ? " Weiss nodded . " It is long but there was no way I could see to cut it . Everything in there is true . I spent the last two years checking old newspaper files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the make-up man , the script still in his hand . " What happened to him ? " he asked over his shoulder . " Nobody seems to know . One day he just disappeared and nothing was ever heard about him again . There was a posse after him , and they think he died there in the mountains . " " A new story 's always good , " Nevada said . " People are getting tired of the same old heroes . What do you call this guy ? " The writer 's voice seemed to hang in the air . " Sand , " he said . " Max Sand . " The script slipped from Nevada 's fingers . He felt the blood rush from his face . " What did you say ? " he asked hollowly . Weiss stared at him . " Max Sand . We can change it but that was his real name . " Nevada shook his head and looked down at the script . It lay there in the dust . Weiss knelt swiftly and picked it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked in a concerned voice . Nevada took a deep breath . He felt his self-control returning . He took the script from the outstretched hand and forced a smile . A look of relief came into Weiss 's face . " Thanks , Mr. Smith , " he said gratefully . " I really appreciate this . Thanks very much . " For a week , Nevada could n't bring himself to read it . In some strange way , he felt that if he did , he 'd be exposing himself . Then one evening , he came into the library after dinner , where Von Elster was waiting , and found him deeply engrossed in this script . " How long have you been sitting on this ? " the director asked . Nevada shrugged . " About a week . You know how it is . These writers are always coming up with scripts . Is it any good ? "  | Von Elster put it down slowly . " It 's more than good . It 's great . I want to be the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp still burning near his bed , Nevada realized what the director meant . Weiss had given depth and purpose to his portrait of a man who lived alone and developed a philosophy born of pain and sadness . There was no glamour in his crimes , only the desperate struggle for survival . Nevada knew as he read it that the picture would be made . The script was too good to be passed up . For his own self-protection , he had to make the picture . If it escaped into someone else 's hands , there was no telling how much further they 'd delve into the life of Max Sand . He bought the script from Weiss the next morning for one thousand dollars . Nevada returned to the present suddenly . " Let 's hold it for a year , " Bernie Norman was saying . " By then , we 'll know which way to jump . " Dan Pierce looked across at him . Nevada knew the look . It meant that Pierce felt he 'd gone as far as he could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Artists , " Nevada said . " I guess that 's the only way a star can be sure of making the pictures he wants . " Norman 's eyes changed subtly . " They have n't had a good year since , " he said . " They 've dropped a bundle . " " Mebbe , " Nevada said . " Only time will tell . It 's still a new company . " Norman looked at Pierce for a moment , then back to Nevada . " O.K. , " he said . " I 'll make a deal with you . We 'll put up a half million toward the picture , you guarantee all the negative cost over that . " " That 's a million and a half more ! " Pierce answered . " Where 's Nevada going to get that kind of money ? " Norman smiled . " The same place we do . At the bank . He wo n't have any trouble . I 'll arrange it . You 'll own the picture one hundred per cent . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a better deal than United Artists can give . That shows you how much we want to go along with you , Nevada . Fair enough ? " Nevada had no illusions . If the picture did n't make it , his name would be on the notes at the bank , not Norman 's . He 'd lose everything he had and more . He looked down at the blue-covered script . A resolution began to harden inside him . Jonas ' father had said to him once that it was n't any satisfaction to win or lose if it was n't your own money , and you 'd never make it big playing  | for table stakes . This picture just could n't miss . He knew it . He could feel it inside him . He looked up at Norman again . " O.K. , Bernie , " he said . " It 's a deal . " When they came out into the fading sunlight in front of Norman 's bungalow office , Nevada looked at the agent . Pierce 's face was glum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he muttered . " We got a lot of talking to do . " " It can keep till tomorrow , " Nevada said . " I got company from the East waitin ' for me at home . " " You just bit off a big nut , " the agent said . They started toward their cars . " I reckon it 's about time , " Nevada said confidently . " The only way to make real money is to gamble big money . " " You can also lose big that way , " Pierce said dourly . Nevada paused beside his white Stutz Bearcat . He put his hand affectionately on the door , much in the same manner he did with his horses . " We wo n't lose . " The agent squinted at him . " I hope you know what you 're doing . I just do n't like it when Norman comes in so fast and promises us all the profits . There 's a monkey somewhere . " Nevada smiled . " The trouble with you , Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious . Bernie came in because he had to . He did n't want to take any chances on losin ' me . " He opened the door and got into the car . " I 'll be down at your office at ten tomorrow morning . " " O.K. , " the agent said . He started toward his own car , then stopped and came back . " This talking-picture business bothers me . A couple of other companies have announced they 're going to make talkies . " " Let ' em , " Nevada said . " It 's their headache . " He turned the key , pressed the starter and the big motor sprang into life with a roar . " It 's a novelty , " he shouted to the agent over the noise . " By the time our picture comes out people will have forgotten all about talkies . " The telephone on the small table near the bed rang softly . Rina walked over and picked it up . It was one of those new French telephones , the first she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now familiar insignia was in the center of the dial , where the number usually was printed . " Hello . " Nevada 's familiar voice was in her ear . " Howdy , friend . You all settled in ? " " Nevada ! " she exclaimed . " You got other friends ? " She laughed . " I 'm unpacked , " she said . " And amazed .

" When will it be ready ? " " Two , maybe three years , " he answered . " That 's the next step . " " Yeah , " I said . " But we ca n't afford to wait for Ford . It could take five years before something practical came from them . We got ta be ready in two years . " Buzz stared at me . " Tbvo years ? How are we gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at him . " How many mail planes are we flying now ? " " About thirty-four , " he said . " And if we get the new mail contract ? " " Double , maybe triple that many , " he said . He looked at me shrewdly . " What 're you gettin ' at ? " " The manufacturers of those planes are making more out of our mail contracts than we are , " I said . " If you 're talkin ' about buildin ' our own planes , you 're nuts ! " Buzz said . " It would take us two years just to set up a factory . " " Not if we bought one that was already in business , " I answered . He thought for a moment . " Lockheed , Martin , Curtiss-Wright , they 're all too busy . They would n't sell . The only one who might is Winthrop . They 're layin ' off since they lost that Army contract . " I smiled at him . " You 're thinkin ' good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim light . " Oh , no . I worked for old man Winthrop . He swore he 'd never ? " We were over Burbank airport now . I swung wide to the south end of the field where the Winthrop plant stood . I banked the plane so Buzz could see from his side . " Look down there . " Up through the darkness , illuminated by two searchlights , rose the giant white letters painted on the black tarred roof . CORD AIRCRAFT , INC . The reporters clustered around us as soon as we hit the ground . Their flash bulbs kept hitting my eyes and I blinked . " You tired , Mr. Cord ? " one of them yelled . I rubbed my unshaven cheeks and grinned . " Fresh as a daisy , " I said . A stone on the field cut into my foot . I turned back to the plane and yelled up to Buzz . " Hey , throw me my shoes , will you ? " He laughed and threw them down and the reporters made a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Buzz climbed down beside me . They took some more pictures and we  | started to walk toward the hangar . " How does it feel to be home ? " another reporter yelled . " Good . " " Real good , " Buzz added . We meant it . Five days ago , we took off from Le Bourget in Paris . Newfoundland , New York , Chicago , Los Angeles  --  five days . A reporter came running up , waving a sheet of paper . " You just broke the Chicago-to-L.A. record ! " he said . " That makes five records you broke on this flight ! " " One for each day . " I grinned . " That 's nothin ' to complain about . " " Does that mean you 'll get the mail contract ? " a reporter asked . Behind them , at the entrance to the hangar , I could see McAllister waving frantically . " That 's the business end , " I said . " I leave that to my partner , Buzz . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from them quickly , leaving them to surround Buzz while I walked over to McAllister . His face wore a harassed expression . " I thought you 'd never get here on time . " " I said I 'd be in by nine o'clock . " He took my arm . " I 've got a car waiting , " he said . " We 'll go right to the bank from here . I told them I 'd bring you down . " " Wait a minute , " I said , shaking my arm free . " Told who ? " " The syndication group that agreed to meet your price for the sublicensing of the high-speed injection mold . Even Du Pont 's coming in with them now . " He took my arm again and began to hurry me to the car . I pulled free again . " Wait a minute , " I said . " I have n't been near a bed for five days and I 'm beat . I 'll see them tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't give a damn , " I said . " Let ' em wait . " " But they 're giving you ten million dollars ! " " They 're giving me nothing , " I said . " They had the same chance to buy that patent we did . They were all in Europe that year but they were too tight . Now they need it , they can wait until tomorrow . " I got into the car . " The Beverly Hills Hotel . " McAllister climbed in beside me . He looked distraught . " Tomorrow ? " he said . " They do n't want to wait . " The chauffeur started the car . I looked over at McAllister and grinned . I began to feel a little sorry for him . I knew it had n't been an easy deal to swing . " Tell you what , " I said gently . " Let me get six hours ' shut-eye and then we can meet . "  | " That will be three o'clock in the morning ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my suite in the hotel . I 'll be ready for them then . " Monica Winthrop was waiting in the suite . She got up from the couch and put out her cigarette as I came in . She ran over and kissed me . " Oh , what a beard ! " she exclaimed in mock surprise . " What 're you doin ' here ? " I asked . " I was looking for you at the airport . " " I would have been there but I was afraid Daddy would show up , " she said quickly . She was right . Amos Winthrop was too much of a heller not to recognize the symptoms . The trouble was he could n't divide his time properly . He let women interfere with his work and work interfere with his women . But Monica was his only daughter and , like all rakes , he thought of her as something special . Which she was . But not in the way he thought . " Mix me a drink , " I said , walking past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip into a hot tub . I smell so loud I can hear myself . " She picked up a tumbler filled with bourbon and ice and followed me into the bedroom . " I had your drink ready , " she said . " And the tub is full . " I took the drink from her hand . " How 'd you know when I got here ? " She smiled again . " I heard it on the radio . " I sipped at the drink as she came over to me . " You do n't have to take a bath on my account , " she said . " That smell is kind of exciting . " I put the drink down and walked into the bathroom , taking off my shirt . When I turned to close the door , she was right behind me . " Do n't get into ii the tub yet , " she said . " It 's a shame to waste all that musky maleness . " She put her arms around my neck and pressed her body against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face away and buried it in my shoulder . I felt her take a deep , shuddering breath . She moaned softly and the heat came out of her body like steam from an oven . I turned her face up to me with my hand . Her eyes were almost closed . She moaned again , her body writhing . I tugged at my belt and my trousers fell to the floor . I kicked them aside and backed her toward the vanity table along the wall . Her eyes were still closed as she leaped up on me like a monkey climbing a coconut tree . " Breathe slow , baby , " I said as she began to scream in a tortured half whisper . " I may not smell as good as this for years . "  | The water was soft and hot , and weariness washed in and out as it rippled against me . I reached behind me , trying to get to my back with the soap . I could n't make it . " Let me do that , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washcloth from my hand and began to rub my back . The slow , circular motion was soothing and I leaned forward and closed my eyes . " Do n't stop , " I said . " That feels good . " " You 're just like a baby . You need someone to take care of you . " I opened my eyes and looked up at her again . " I been thinkin ' that , too , " I said . " I think I 'll get a Jap houseboy . " " A Jap houseboy wo n't do this , " she said . I felt her tap my shoulder . " Lean back . I want to rinse the soap off . " I leaned back in the water , my eyes still closed . She moved the washcloth over my chest and then down . I opened my eyes . She was staring down at me . " It looks so small and helpless , " she whispered . " That was n't what you said a little while ago . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foggy look coming back into her eyes . I knew the look . I reached up and put my arm around her neck and pulled her down on the edge of the tub . I felt her hand go down and cover me with the washcloth as we kissed . " You 're growing strong , " she whispered , her mouth moving against mine . I laughed and just then the telephone rang . We turned quickly , startled , and the water spashed up and drenched the front of her dress . Silently she took the phone from the vanity and gave it to me . " Yes ? " I growled into it . It was McAllister . He was down in the lobby . " I said three o'clock , " I snapped . " It is three o'clock , " he answered . " Can we come up ? Winthrop 's with us , too . He said he has to see you . " I looked over at Monica . That was all I needed . To have her father come up and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quickly . " I 'm still in the tub . Take ' em into the bar and buy ' em a drink . " " The bars are all closed . " " O.K. , then , I 'll meet you in the lobby , " I said . " The lobby 's no place to close this deal . There 's no privacy . They wo n't like it at all . I do n't understand why we ca n't come up . " " Because I got a broad up here . " " So what ? " he answered . " They 're all broad-minded . " He laughed at his pun .  | " The girl 's Monica Winthrop . " There was silence on the other end of the telephone . Then I heard him sigh wearily . " Christ ! " he said . " Your father was right . You just never stop , do you ? " " Time enough for me to stop when I 'm your age . " " I do n't know , " he said wearily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby . " " If it 's privacy they want , " I said , " I know just the place . " " Where ? " " The men 's room , just off the elevators . I 'll meet you there in five minutes . That 'll be private enough ! " I put down the phone and got to my feet . I looked at Monica . " Hand me a towel , " I said . " I got ta go downstairs and see your father . " 2 I CAME INTO THE MEN 'S ROOM , RUBBING MY CHEEK . I STILL HAD the five-day beard . I had n't had time to shave . I grinned at the sight of them , all engrossed in their duties , not even looking around as I entered . " The meeting will come to order , gentlemen , " I said . They looked over their shoulders at me , a startled expression on their faces . I heard one of them mutter a faint damn under his breath and wondered what minor tragedy brought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say , Jonas , " he said rather pompously . " You have a rather peculiar choice of meeting place . " I stared at him . I knew he was talking for the benefit of the others , so I did n't really mind . I looked down at his trousers . " Aw , Mac , " I said . " Button your fly before you start talking . " His face grew red and his hand dropped quickly to his trouser front . I laughed and turned to the others . " I 'm sorry to put you to this inconvenience , gentlemen , " I said . " But I have a space problem up in my room . I 've got a box up there that takes up almost the whole place . " The only one who got it was Amos Winthrop . I saw a knowing grin appear on his face . I wondered what his expression would be if he knew it was his daughter I was talking about . By this time , Mac had recovered his aplomb and stepped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we got down to  | business . As Mac explained to me , the three big chemical corporations had set up a separate company to sublicense from me . It was this company which would make the first payment and guarantee the royalties . I had only one question to ask . " Who guarantees the money ? " Mac indicated one of the men . " Sheffield here , " he said . " Mr. Sheffield is one of the partners of George Stewart , Inc . " I looked at Sheffield . Stewart , Morgan , Lehman were all good names down on the Street . I could n't ask for better people financially . There was something about the man 's face that seemed familiar . I searched my memory . Then I had it . F. Martin Sheffield . New York , Boston , Southampton , Palm Beach . Harvard School of Business , summa cum laude , before the war . Major , U.S. Army , 1917-18 . Three decorations for bravery under fire . Ten-goal polo-player . Society . Age now  --  from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remembered he 'd come to visit my father about ten years ago . He 'd wanted then to float a public issue for the company . My father had turned him down . " No matter how good they make it sound , Junior , " my father had said , " never let ' em get their hooks into you . Because then they run your business , not you . All they can give you is money when the only thing that counts is power . And that they always keep for themselves . " I stared at Sheffield . " How 're you goin ' to guarantee the payments ? " His dark , deep-set eyes glittered behind the pince-nez bifocals . " We 're on the contract with the others , Mr. Cord , " he said . His voice was surprisingly deep for a slight man . And very sure of itself . It was as if he did not deign to answer my question , as if everybody knew that Stewart 's name on a contract was guarantee enough . Maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't answer my question , Mr. Sheffield , " I said politely . " I asked how the money was to be guaranteed . I 'm not a banker or a Wall Street man , I 'm just a poor boy who had to leave school and go to work because his pappy died . I do n't understand these things . I know when I go into a bank and they ask me to guarantee something , I have to put up collateral  --  like land , mortgages , bonds , something of value  --  before they give me anything . That 's what I mean . " A faintly cold smile came to his thin lips . " Surely , Mr. Cord , you do n't mean to imply that all these companies might not be good for the amount promised ? " I kept my voice bland . " I did n't mean anything like that , Mr. Sheffield . It 's just that men who have had more experience than I , men who are  | older and know more , tell me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks are failing all over the country . There 's no telling what might happen next . I 'd like to know how I 'm goin ' to be paid , that 's all . " " Your money will be guaranteed out of income that the new company will earn , " Sheffield said , still patiently explaining . " I see , " I said , nodding my head . " You mean I 'll be paid out of money you earn if I grant you the license ? " " That 's about it , " he said . I took a cigarette from my pocket and lit it . " I still do n't understand . Why ca n't they pay me all at once ? " " Ten million dollars is a large amount of cash , even for these companies , " he said . " They have many demands on their capital . That 's why we 're in the picture . " " Oh , " I said , still playing it dumb . " You mean you 're going to advance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quickly . " That 's not it at all . We 're simply underwriting the stock , providing the organizational capital to make the new company possible . That alone will come to several million dollars . " " Including your brokerage fees ? " " Of course , " he answered . " That 's quite customary . " " Of course . " He shot a shrewd look at me . " Mr. Cord , you object to our position ? " I shrugged my shoulders . " Not at all . Why should I ? It 's not my place to tell other people how to run their business . I have enough trouble with my own . " " But you do seem to have some doubts about our proposition . " " I do , " I said . " I was under the impression I was to receive ten million dollars for these rights . Now I find I 'm only guaranteed ten million dollars . There 's a difference between the two . In one case , I 'm paid outright , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture , subject to the same risks that you are but with a limitation put upon the extent of my participation . " " Do you object to that kind of deal ? " " Not at all . It 's just that I like to know where I stand . " " Good . Then we can get down to signing the papers . " Sheffield smiled in relief . " Not yet , " I said and his smile vanished as quickly as it had come . " I 'm willing to become a participant in the manner suggested but if I 'm to take that risk , I feel I should be guaranteed fifteen million , not ten . "  | For a moment , there was a shocked silence , then everybody began to talk at once . " But you already agreed to ten ! " Sheffield protested . I stared at him . " No , I did n't . This is the first time we met . " Mac was blowing a gasket . " Wait a minute , Jonas . You led me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars ! " " Well , I listened . " For the first time , I saw his lawyer 's calm ruffled . " I acted in good faith on your behalf . I wo n't be a party to this kind of underhanded negotiation . If this deal does n't go through as agreed , I 'm through ! I 'm re-signing ! " I stared at him impassively . " Suit yourself . " Mac raged . " Your trouble is you 're getting too big for your breeches ! I remember when you were still wet behind the ears ? " I was angry now ; my voice went icy cold . " The trouble is you 're just the lawyer and it 's my property you 're dealing with . I 'll make the decision as to what I do with it  --  sell it or give it away , whatever I want to do . It 's mine , I own it and you work for me . Remember that ! " Mac 's face went white . I could see it all working around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paying him . The bonus participation in profits . The house he lived in . The schools his kids were going to . His position in society . I wondered if at that moment he was n't regretting the sixty-thousand-a-year practice he 'd given up to come to me . But I could n't bring myself to feel sorry for him . He knew what he was doing . He even wrote his own contract , on his own terms . He wanted money and he got it . It was too late now for him to start complaining . I looked at the others . They were staring at us . I knew then , sorry for Mac or not , I had to give him a leg up . " Aw , come off it , Mac , " I said , making my voice warm and friendly . " We 're too close to let a stupid thing like this come between us . Forget it . There 'll be other deals . The important thing to do is to get your new contract signed so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you away from me . " I saw the look of relief flood into his face . " Sure , Jonas , " he said . He hesitated . " I guess we 're both a little bit overtired . Me with the negotiation , you with that record-breaking flight . I guess I just misunderstood what you told me . " He turned to the others . " I 'm sorry , gentlemen , " he said smoothly , himself once more . " It 's my fault . I did n't mean to mislead you but I misunderstood Mr. Cord . My apologies . " An awkward silence fell in the room . For a moment nobody spoke , then I grinned and walked over to the urinal . " This is just so we do n't have to write this meeting off as a total loss , " I said over my shoulder .  | It was Sheffield who made the first break . I heard him whispering hurriedly to the others . When I turned around , he looked at me . " Split it with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted it real bad if they came up that quickly . At first , I shook my head , then I had an idea . " I heard a great deal about you from my father , " I said . " He said you were a real sportsman , that you 'd gamble on anything . " A smile appeared on his thin lips . " I 've been known to wager a bit at times , " he admitted . " For two and a half million dollars , I 'll bet you ca n't pee into that far urinal from where you 're standing , " I said , pointing to the one about four feet from him . " If you do , the deal is yours for twelve five . If you do n't , I get fifteen . " His mouth hung open , his eyes staring behind their glasses . " Mr. Cord ! " he sputtered . " You can call me Jonas , " I said . " Remember it 's for two and a half million dollars . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then at me . Finally the Mahlon Chemical man spoke up . " It 's two and a half million dollars , Martin . I 'd take a shot at it for that kind of money ! " Sheffield hesitated a moment . He looked at Mac but Mac would n't meet his gaze . Then he turned toward the urinal , his hand going to his fly . He looked at me . I nodded . Nothing happened . Nothing at all . He just stood there , a red flush creeping up his collar into his face . A moment passed , another moment . His face was red now . I broke the silence . " All right , Mr. Sheffield , " I said with a straight face . " I concede . You win the bet . The deal is for twelve five . " He stared at me , trying to read my mind . I kept my expression blank . I held out my hand toward him . He hesitated a moment , then took it . " May I call you Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile appearing on his thin lips . " Please do . " I shook his hand . " Martin , " I said solemnly . " Your fly is open ! "  | MCALLISTER MADE THE NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTS and we signed them right there . It was after four thirty when we came out into the lobby . I started for the elevator when Amos Winthrop tapped me on the shoulder . I did n't want to talk to him . " Can it keep until morning , Amos ? " I asked . " I got ta get some sleep . " His face crinkled in a knowing smile . He hit me on the shoulder jovially . " I know the kind of sleepin ' you want to do , boy , but this is important . " " Nothing can be that important . " The elevator door opened and I stepped into it . Amos was right beside me . The operator started to close the doors . " Just a minute , " I said . The doors rolled open again and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " What is it ? " We walked over to a couch and sat down . " I need another ten thousand , " he said . I stared at him . No wonder he was always broke . He spent it faster than they could print it . " What happened to all the cash you got for your stock ? " An embarrassed expression crossed his face . " It 's gone , " he said . " You know how much I owed . " I knew . He owed everybody . By the time he got through with his creditors and his ex-wives , I could see where the fifty grand had gone . I was beginning to feel sorry I 'd included him in the deal but I 'd thought he 'd be able to contribute something to the company . At one time , he was one of the best designers of aircraft in the country . " Your contract does n't provide for advances like that , " I said . " I know , " he answered . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise . It 's for Monica . " " Monica ? " I looked at him . This was going to be good . " What about her ? " He shook his head . " I want to send her to her mother in England . She 's too much for me . I ca n't control her any more . She 's seeing some guy on  | the sly and I have a feeling if she is n't balling him already , she soon will be . " For a moment , I stared at him . I wondered if this was n't a gentle form of blackmail . It could be that he already knew and was taking this way of letting me know . " Do you know the guy ? " He shook his head . " If I did , I 'd kill him , " he said vehemently . " A nice sweet innocent kid like her . " I kept my face impassive . Love is blind but parents are blinder . Even a cheater like Amos , with all his knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You talk to her ? " He shook his head again . " I tried but she wo n't listen . You know how kids are nowadays . They learn everything in school ; you ca n't teach them anything . When she was sixteen , I found a package of Merry Widows in her pocketbook . " He should have stopped her then . He was about three years too late . She was nineteen now and carried her own brass ring . " Guys like you never learn . " " What was I supposed to do ? " he asked truculently . " Keep her locked in her room ? " I shook my head . " You could have tried being her father . " " What makes you such an expert ? " he snapped . " You wo n't talk like that after you have kids of your own . " I could have told him . I had a father who was too busy with his own life , too . But I was tired . I got to my feet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked anxiously . " I 'll give it to you , " I said . A feeling of disgust suddenly came up in me . What did I need guys like this around me for ? They were like leeches . Once they got into you , they never let go . " As a matter of fact , I 'll give you twenty-five thousand . " An expression of surprised relief flooded across his face . " You will , Jonas ? " I nodded . " On one condition . " For the first time , caution came into his eyes . " What do you mean ? " " I want your resignation . " " From Winthrop Aircraft ? " His voice was incredulous . " From Cord Aircraft , " I said pointedly . The color began to drain from his face . " But  --  but I started the company . I know everything about it . I was just planning a new plane that the Armt will sure as hell go for ? " " Take the money , Amos , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started for  | the elevator . I stepped inside and the boy closed the doors in his face . " Going up , Mr. Cord ? " he asked . I stared at him . That was a stupid question . What other way was there to go ? " All the way , " I said wearily . Monica was lying across the bed in the tops of my pajamas , half asleep . She opened her eyes and looked at me . " Everything go all right ? " I nodded . She watched me as I threw my shirt across a chair . " What did Daddy want ? " I stepped out of my trousers and caught the pajama bottoms she threw at me . " He just turned in his resignation , " I said , kicking off my shorts and getting into the pajamas . She sat up in bed , her brown eyes widening in surprise . " He did ? " I nodded . " I wonder why ? " I looked at her . " He said it had something to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father . " She stared at me for a moment , then began to laugh . " Well , I 'll be damned , " she said . " All my life I wanted him to pay some kind of attention to me and now , when I do n't need him any more , he suddenly wants to play daddy . " " Do n't need him any more ? " She nodded . " Not any more . Ever , " she said slowly . She came off the bed and laid her head against my chest . Her voice was a childlike whisper of confidence . " Not now that I have you . You 're everything to me ? father , brother , lover . " I stroked her soft brown hair slowly . Suddenly , a surge of sympathy came up inside me . I knew how alone you could be when you were nineteen . Her eyes were closed and there were faintly blue weary hollows in the soft white flesh beneath them . I pressed my lips lightly to her forehead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's almost morning . " She was asleep in a moment , her head resting on my shoulder , her neck in the crook of my arm . For a long time , I could n't fall asleep . I lay there looking down at her quiet face as the sun came up and light spilled into the room . Damn Amos Winthrop ! Damn Jonas Cord ! I cursed all men who were too busy and self-centered to be fathers to their children . I began to feel weariness seep through me . Half asleep , I felt her move  | beside me and the warmth of her long , graceful body flowed down along my side . Then sleep came . The dark , starless night of wonderful sleep . We were married the next evening at the Little Chapel in Reno . 4 I SAW THE GLEAMING PHOSPHORESCENCE MOVING IN THE WATER and flicked the fly gaily across the stream just over the trout . The instinct came up in me . I knew I had him . Everything was right . The water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle-blue , green and red tail of the fly at the end of my line . Another moment and the bastard would strike . I set myself when I heard Monica 's voice from the bank behind me . " Jonas ! " Her voice shattered the stillness and the trout dived for the bottom of the stream . The fly began to drag and before I turned around , I knew the honeymoon was over . " What is it ? " I growled . She stood there in a pair of shorts , her knees red and her nose peeling . " There 's a telephone call for you . From Los Angeles . " " Who ? " " I do n't know , " she answered . " It 's a woman . She did n't give her name . " I looked back at the stream . There were no lights in the water . The fish were gone . That was the end of it . The fishing was over for the day . I started toward the bank . " Tell her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up there in a minute . " She nodded and started back to the cabin . I began to reel in the line . I wondered who could be calling me . , Not many people knew about the cabin in the hills . When I was a kid , I used to come up here with Nevada . My father always intended to come along but he never did make it . I came out of the stream and trudged up the path . It was late in the afternoon and the evening sounds were just beginning . Through the trees I could hear the crickets beginning their song . I laid the rod alongside the outside wall of the cabin and went inside .  | Monica was sitting in a chair near the telephone , turning the pages of a magazine . I picked up the phone . " Hello . " " Mr. Cord ? " " Yes . " " Just a moment , " the operator sang . " Los Angeles , your party is on the wire . " I heard a click , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rina ? " " Yes , " she said . " I 've been trying to get you for three days . Nobody would tell me where you were , then I thought of the cabin . " " Great , " I said , looking over the telephone at Monica . She was looking down at the magazine but I knew she was listening . " By the way , " Rina said in that low , husky voice . " Congratulations . I hope you 'll be very happy . Your bride 's a very pretty girl . " " You know her ? " " No , " Rina answered quickly . " I saw the pictures in the papers . " " Oh , " I said . " Thanks . But that is n't why you called . " " No , it 's not , " she said with her usual directness . " I need your help . " " If it 's another ten you need , I can always let you have it . " " It 's for more money than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Two million dollars . " " What ? " I all but yelled . " What the hell do you need that much money for ? " " It 's not for myself , " she said . Her voice sounded very upset . " It 's for Nevada . He 's in a bind . He 's about to lose everything he 's got . " " But I thought he was doing great . The papers say he 's making a half million dollars a year . " " He is , " Rina said . " But ? " " But what ? " I pulled out a cigarette and fished around for a match . I knew Monica saw me but she kept her nose buried in the magazine . " I 'm listening , " I said , dragging on the cigarette . " Nevada 's hocked everything he has to make a picture . He 's been working on it for over a year and now everything 's gone wrong and they do n't want to release it . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " she said quickly . " It 's not that . It 's great . But only talking pictures are going . That 's all the theaters will play . " " Why did n't he make a talking picture to start with ? " I asked . " He started it more than a year ago . Nobody expected talkies to come in the way they did , " she answered . " Now the bank 's calling his loan and  | Norman wo n't advance any more money . He claims he 's stuck with his own pictures . " " I see , " I said . " You 've got to help him , Jonas . His whole life is wrapped up in this picture . If he loses it , he 'll never get over it . " " Nevada never cared that much about money , " I said . " It is n't the money , " she said quickly . " It 's the way he feels about this picture . He believes in it . For once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really like . " " Nobody gives a damn what the West was really like . " " Did you ever see one of his pictures ? " she asked . " No . " A shade of disbelief crept into her voice . " Were n't you curious to see what he looked like on the screen ? " " Why should I be ? " I asked . " I know what he looks like . " Her voice went flat . " Are you going to help ? " " That 's a lot of dough , " I said . " Why should I ? " " I remember when you wanted something real bad and he gave it to you . " I knew what she was talking about . Nevada 's stock interest in Cord Explosives . " It did n't cost him two million bucks , " I said . " It did n't ? " she asked . " What 's it worth now ? " That stopped me for a moment . Maybe it was n't yet , but in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that much of a jam , " I said , " why did n't he call me himself ? " " Nevada 's a proud man , " she said . " You know that . " " How come you 're so interested ? " " Because he 's my friend , " she said quickly . " When I needed help , he did n't ask any questions . " " I 'm not promising anything , " I said . " But I 'll fly down to L.A. tonight . Where can I reach you ? " " I 'm staying at Nevada 's , " she said . " But you better let me meet you someplace . I do n't want him to know I called you . " " O.K. , " I said . " I 'll be at the Beverly Hills Hotel about midnight . " I put down the telephone . " Who was that ? " Monica asked . " My father 's widow , " I said , walking past her toward the bedroom . " Pack your bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to go down to L.A. on business tonight . " " But it 's only been five days , " she said . " You promised we 'd have a two-week honeymoon . "  | " This is an emergency . " She followed me into the bedroom as I sat down on the bed and pulled off my waders . " What will people think if we come back from our honeymoon after only five days ? " she said . I stared up at her . " What the hell do I care what they think ? " She began to cry . " I wo n't go , " she said , stamping her foot . I got to my feet and started out . " Then stay ! " I said angrily . " I 'm going down the hill to get the car . If you 're not ready when I get back , I 'm leaving without you ! " What was it with dames , anyway ? You stood in front of some two-bit preacher for five lousy minutes and when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were married , it was great . You were the king . She stood there with one hand on your cock to let you know she wanted it , and with the other , tried to light your cigarette , wash your back , feed your face and smooth your pillow all at the same time . Then come the magic words and you got to beg for it . You got to go by the book . Play with it , warm it up , treat it gentle . You got to rest on your elbows and light her cigarettes and carry her wrap and open doors . You even have to thank her when she lets you have it , the same piece she 9 could n't stop offering you before . I pulled the car up in front of the cabin and tooted the horn . Monica came out carrying a small bag and stood there waiting for me to open the car door . After a moment , she opened the door and got in with a grieved expression . And she wore the same expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ranch . It was nine o'clock when I pulled up in front of the house . As usual , Robair was at the door . His expression did n't change when I stayed in the car after he took out Monica 's valise . His eyes flicked across my face as he turned and bowed to Monica . " Evenin ' , Miz Cord , " he said . " Ah have you ' room all tidied up an ' ready for you . " Robair looked at me again and turned and went back up the steps . When Monica spoke , her voice was low and taut as a bowstring . " How long will you be gone ? " I shrugged . " As long as it takes for me to finish my business . " Then I felt a softening inside me . What the hell , after all we 'd only been married for five days . " I 'll get back as quick as I can . " " Do n't hurry back ! " she said and stalked up the steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily and threw the car into gear , then started up the road to  | the plant . I kept the old Waco in the field behind it . I was still angry when I climbed into the cockpit and I did n't begin to feel better until I was twenty-five hundred feet up and heading toward Los Angeles . I LOOKED DOWN AT THE BLUE-COVERED SCRIPT IN MY HAND , then back up at Rina . Time had n't taken anything away from her . She was still slim and strong and her breasts jutted like rocks at the canyon edge and I knew they would be just as hard to the touch . The only things that had changed were her eyes . There was a sureness in them that had n't been there before . " I 'm not much for reading , " I said . " I thought that was what you 'd say , " she said . " So I arranged with the studio to screen the picture for you . They 're waiting down there right now . " " How long you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . Ever since I came back from Europe . " " Staying at Nevada 's all this time ? " She nodded . " You sleeping with him ? " She did n't evade . " Yes . He 's very good for me . " " Are you good for him ? " I asked . Her eyes were still on mine . " I hope so , " she said quietly . " But that does n't really matter . You do n't give a damn whether I am or I 'm not . " " I was just curious , " I said , getting to my feet and dropping the script on the chair . " I was just wondering what it takes to keep you . " " It 's not what you think , " she said quickly . " What is it , then ? " I shot back . " Money ? " " No . " She shook her head . " A man . A real man . I never could make it with boys . " That touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " You just got married five days ago . " I stared at her for a moment . I could feel all the old familiar excitement climbing up in me . " Let 's go , " I said tersely . " I have n't got all night . " I sat in the darkened projection room with Rina on one side of me and Von Elster , the director , on the other .  | Rina had n't lied . The picture was great , but for only one reason . Nevada . He held the picture together with an innate core of strength that somehow illuminated the screen . It was the strength I had always felt in him but up there it was larger , more purposeful , and no one could escape it . He started out on that screen as a sixteen-year-old boy and rode off into the hills in the end as a twenty-five-year-old man . Not once during the whole picture was I ever aware of his real age . I leaned back in my chair with a sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , still feeling the excitement of the screen . I lit the cigarette and dragged on it . The surging reached down into my loins . There was still something missing , I felt vaguely . Then I felt the heat in my thighs and I knew what it was . I looked at Von Elster . " Outside of that small bit about the madam in New Orleans and the convict 's daughter in the cow town , there are n't any women in the picture . " Von Elster smiled . " There are some things you do n't do in a Western . Women is one of them . " " Why ? " " Because the industry feels that the image of the clean , strong man must be preserved . The hero can be guilty of any crime but fornication . " I laughed and got to my feet . " Forgive the question , " I said . " But why ca n't you just add voices the way you did the music ? Why make the whole thing over ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the projection speed of silent film is different from sound film . Talking film is projected at the speed of speech , while silent film moves much faster , depending on dialogue cards and broader action to carry the story . " I nodded . Mechanically , what he said made sense . Like everything else in this world , there was a technology to this business and it was beginning to interest me . Without mechanics , the whole thing would be impossible . " Come back to the hotel with me . I 'd like to talk some more about this . " I saw a sudden look of caution come into Rina 's eyes . She glanced at Von Elster , then turned to me . " It 's almost four o'clock , " she said quickly . " And I think we 've gone about as far as we can without Nevada . " " O.K. , " I said easily . " You bring him up to the hotel in the morning . Eight o'clock , all right ? " " Eight o'clock will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hotel , Mr. Cord , " Von Elster said eagerly .  | I glanced at Rina . She shook her head imperceptibly . " Thanks , " I said . " Ring can drop me on her way home . " Rina did n't speak until the car pulled to a stop in front of the hotel . " Von Elster is on the make , " she said . " He 's worried . He 's never made a talking picture before and he wants to do this one . It 's a big picture and if it comes off , he 'll be in solid again . " " You mean he 's shaky ? " I asked . " Everybody in Hollywood is . From Garbo and Gilbert on down . No one is sure just what talking pictures are going to do to their career . I hear John Gilbert 's voice is so bad that MGM wo n't even pencil him in for another picture . " " What about Nevada 's voice ? " " It 's good , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " " Well , that 's one less thing to worry about . " " Are you going to do it ? " she asked . " What 's in it for me if I do ? " I countered . " You could make a lot of money , " she said . " I do n't need it , " I said . " I 'll make a lot of money , anyway . " Her eyes turned to me , her voice was cold . " You have n't changed , have you ? " I shook my head . " No . Why should I ? Does anybody ? Did you ? " I reached for her hand . It was cold as ice . " Just how much are you willing to give to bail Nevada out ? " Her eyes were steady on mine . " I 'd give everything I 've got if it would help . " I felt a kind of sadness creeping into me . I wondered how many people would say that for me . Right then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hand and got out of the car . She leaned toward me . " Well , Jonas , have you made up your mind ? " " Not yet , " I said slowly . " There 's a lot more I have to know about . " " Oh . " She leaned back disappointedly . " But do n't you worry , " I said . " If I do it , you 'll be the first one I come to for payment . " She signaled the chauffeur . He put the car into gear . " Knowing you , " she said quietly , " I never expected anything else . " The limousine rolled away and I turned and walked into the hotel . I went up to my room and opened up the script . It took about an hour and a half to go through it . It was almost six o'clock before I closed my eyes .  | THE TELEPHONE KEPT BANGING AWAY AT MY HEAD . I SHOOK MY head to clear it and looked at my watch . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . " Mr. Cord ? Von Elster here . I 'm sorry to bother you so early , but I 'm down in the lobby with Mr. Norman . It 's very important we see you before you meet with Nevada . " " Who 's Norman ? " I asked , still trying to clear my head . " Bernard B. Norman of Norman Pictures . That 's the company releasing the picture . Mr. Norman feels he can be of help to you in making the right kind of deal with Nevada . " " Why should I need any help ? " I asked . " I 've known Nevada all my life . " His voice grew confidential . " Nevada 's all right , Mr. Cord . But his agent , Dan Pierce , is a very sharp man . Mr. Norman just wants to give you a few pointers before you tangle with him . " I reached for a cigarette . Von Elster had n't lost any time . He 'd run right back to his boss the minute he smelled my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was damn sure it boded no good for Nevada . " Wait down there until I can get dressed . I 'll call you . " I put down the phone and finished lighting the cigarette . The blue cover of the script caught my eye . I picked up the telephone again . I gave the operator Tony Moroni 's home number out in the valley . " Sorry to wake you up , Tony , " I said . " This is Jonas . " His soft voice chuckled over the phone . " That 's all right , Jonas . I get up early , anyway . By the way , congratulations on your marriage . " " Thanks , " I said automatically , suddenly remembering I had n't even thought about Monica since I came to town . " Did you bank Nevada Smith 's new picture ? " " The Renegade ? " " Yeah . " " Yes , we did , " he answered . " What 's the story on it ? " I asked . " It 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better chance if it were a talkie , but it 's a good picture . "  | " If you think it 's good , why are you calling your loan ? " " Let me ask a question first , Jonas , " he said . " Exactly what is your interest ? " " I do n't know yet , " I said frankly . " Nevada 's my friend . I want to find out what 's happening . Why are you calling the loan ? " " You know how we work , " he explained . " We made the loan to Smith on his collateral plus the guarantee of the Norman Pictures Company . Now Bernie Norman needs credit to remake some of his own pictures , so he 's withdrawing his guarantee . Automatically , that means we have to call in the loan . " No wonder Von Elster and Bernie Norman were down in the lobby waiting to see me . They did n't want anybody to interfere with their fingering Nevada . " Exactly what happens to Nevada ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan , we foreclose on the picture , then all his collateral goes into an escrow account . Then we liquidate until we recover . " " What do you do with the picture then ? " I asked . " Junk it ? " " Oh , no . " He laughed softly . " Then we turn it over to Norman to release . That gives Bernie a chance to get his money out . He has about four hundred thousand in it . After he recovers , the overage is paid to us . When our loan is paid off , we turn over what 's left to Smith . " The whole thing was beginning to make sense . By the time any money got to Nevada , he 'd have had it . " What 's the chances on any overage ? " I asked . " Not very good , " Tony answered . " Under the present deal , the distribution fees are very low and Nevada Smith 's money comes out first . When we take over , the fees will triple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets the fees  --  the bank ? " He laughed again . " Of course not . Bernie does . He 's the distributor . " Now I had it . The boys downstairs were going to make it real big . Screw Nevada . That way , they could grab themselves off a big one for practically nothing . I wondered just how smart Nevada 's agent could be if he let him stick his head into a trap like that . " One more question , Tony , " I said , " and I 'll stop bothering you . How much more money should it take to make The Renegade over as a talkie ? " He was silent for a moment . " Let 's see , " he said . " The sets are still standing , they have all the costumes . That 's about half the cost . Maybe another million ; less , if they 're lucky . " " Is it worth it ? "  | He hesitated . " I usually do n't venture opinions on pictures . Too many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I need an opinion from somebody who has n't any ax to grind . " " From every report I 've had , it could be a very good gamble . " " Thanks , " I said . " Now do me a favor . Hold off any action on the loan until I talk to you later in the day . Maybe I 'll come in on the guarantee in place of Norman . " " You 'll still need another million after that . " " I know , " I answered . " But my writing hand 's still good . I can always sign another note . " Moroni laughed pleasantly as we said our good-bys . He was n't worried . He knew I could cover the money easily out of the advance I got from the syndicate that leased the patents on my plastic mold . Bankers always were ready to lend you as much money as you wanted , so long as you could put up collateral . I looked down at my watch as I put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt fuzzy . I started to pick up the phone , then changed my mind . The hell with them . Let them wait if they wanted to see me . I turned and went into the bathroom to take a shower . The telephone rang three different times while I was under the shower . I stood there letting the hot water soak into my skin and wash away the weariness . It was almost eight o'clock when I came out of the bathroom and the telephone began ringing again . It was Von Elster again . His voice was low and conspiratorial . " Nevada , his agent and Rina are on their way up , " he whispered . " They did n't see us . " Good , " I said . " But how are we going to meet ? " " I guess it 's too late now , " I said easily . " I 'll just have to take my chances with Nevada 's agent , I guess . Tell your Mr. Norman I appreciate his offer , though . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard his gasp of shock as I hung up . I laughed and wondered how he was going to explain that to his boss . I climbed into my trousers and was reaching for a shirt when a knock came at the door . " Come in , " I yelled from the bedroom . I heard the door open and finished buttoning up my shirt . I looked for my shoes but they were over on the other side of the bed . It was n't worth walking over to get them so I came out in my bare feet . Rina was already seated on the big couch . Nevada and another man  | were standing in the middle of the room . A slow smile came over Nevada 's face . He held out his hand . " Jonas , " he said warmly . I took his hand awkwardly . It seemed funny to shake hands with him as one would with a stranger . " Nevada . " There were faint lines of strain in the corners of his eyes , but for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're lookin ' more like your pappy every day , son . " " You 're lookin ' pretty good yourself . Where 'd you get them duds ? " A faint tinge of sheepishness came into his face . " That 's part of the act , " he said . " I got to wear ' em . The kids expect it . " He fished in his pocket with that familiar gesture and came up with a package of makin 's . He began to roll a cigarette . " I been readin ' a lot about you in the papers . Flyin ' from Paris to Los Angeles , gettin ' married an ' all . Your wife with you ? " I shook my head . He glanced at me shrewdly . In that moment , I knew he knew how it was with Monica and me . He could read me like a book . I could never hide anything from him . " Too bad , " he said . " I 'd like to have met her . " I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught himself quickly . " Oh , this is Dan Pierce , my agent . " We shook hands and I came right to the point . " I saw your picture last night , " I said . " I liked it . Tbo bad you have to make it over . " " I thought talking pictures would n't last , " Nevada said . " That 's not the whole story , Nevada , " Pierce broke in angrily . He turned to me . " Nevada wanted the picture silent , sure , but by the time 111 we 'd started shooting , he saw he was wrong . We tried then to turn it into a talkie but we could n't . " " Norman would n't let us , " Pierce said . " He only had one sound stage at that time and he was using it for one of his own pictures . He insisted we start shooting right away or he 'd withdraw his guarantee . " The picture was clear now . The whole thing had been a sucker play from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand it . He was a better poker player than that . Nevada read me again . " I know what you 're thinkin ' , boy , " he said quickly . " But I wanted to make this picture . It said something that none of the other phonies I 'd been in even came close to . " " What about Norman ? " I asked . " How come they wo n't advance you the money to shoot it over ? " " They 've run out of credit , " Nevada said . " That 's why the bank is calling the loan . "  | " That 's a lot of crap ! " Pierce exploded again . " We 're caught in a squeeze play . Bernie Norman makes the bank call our loan and the bank turns the picture back to him . He gets it for peanuts  --  about a third what it would have cost him to make it . " " How much would it take to make the picture over ? " I asked . Nevada looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus the loan the bank is calling , " Pierce added quickly . I turned to him . " Would you still have Norman release the picture ? " He nodded . " Sure . They 've got ten thousand contracts on it an ' if it 's a talkie , not a theater will cancel out . " " If it 's silent ? " " We 'll be lucky to get fifteen hundred , " he said . " They all want talkies . " " What do you think I should do ? " Nevada hesitated a moment , then his eyes came squarely on mine . " I would n't do it if I was you , " he said frankly . " You could blow the whole bundle . " I saw the look that Pierce threw him . It was filled with anger but also with a peculiar sort of respect . To Pierce I was just another sucker . But to his credit , he recognized that I was something more to Nevada . I stared at him for a moment , then turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was impassive . Only her eyes were pleading . I turned back to Nevada . " I 'll take the shot , " I said . " But only on one condition . I 'll buy you out and it will be my picture . And when we make it again , we 'll make it the way I want it . There 'll be no arguments ; everybody will do as they 're told . You included . If I 'm going to lose the hand , at least I want to deal the cards . " Nevada nodded . He 'd heard my father say the same words often enough . And he 'd been the one who taught me always to reach for the deal when the stakes were high . " But what do you know about making pictures ? " Pierce asked . " Nothing , " I said . " But how many people do you know who have made a talking picture ? " That stopped him . I could see the comprehension come into his eyes . What I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no veterans any more . I turned back to Nevada . " Well ? " " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " I 'm lettin ' you take the whole risk . I ca n't lose anything . " " You 're wrong ! " Pierce said quickly . " If it 's a stinker , your career is shot ! "  | Nevada smiled at him . " I got along pretty good before , " he said . " I 'm a little old to worry about anything I fell into by accident . " " Well , Nevada ? " He stuck out his hand and the worry lines around his eyes lifted suddenly and he was young again . " It 's a deal , Junior . " I took his hand and then went over to the telephone . I called Moroni at the bank . " Make arrangements to transfer the loan to Cord Explosives , " I said . " Good luck , Jonas , " he said with a chuckle . " I had the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew more than I did . " " That 's what makes a good banker , " he said . I hung up and turned back to the others . " Now , the first thing I do is fire Von Elster . " Nevada 's face was shocked . " But Von is one of the best in the business , " he protested . " He 's directed every picture I ever made . He discovered me . " " He 's a lousy little shit , " I said . " The minute he thought you were in trouble , he tried to sell you out . He had Bernie Norman up here at seven o'clock this morning . They wanted to give me some free advice . I did n't talk to them . " " Now maybe you 'll believe me when I say Bernie was behind the squeeze , " Pierce said . " Like it or not , Nevada , " I said , " we made a deal . It 's my picture and what I say goes . " He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce to arrange for me to see as many of the talkies as possible in the next three days . Then , next weekend , I 'll fly you all to New York . We 're goin ' to spend three or four days goin ' to the theater . We might even pick up a stage director while we 're there . We 'll see . " I paused to light a cigarette and saw a sudden look come over Nevada 's face . " What are you smiling at ? " " Like I said , you 're gettin ' more like your pappy every day . " I grinned back at him . Just then , the waiter came in with breakfast . Nevada and Pierce went into the bathroom to wash up and Rina and I were left alone . There was a gentle look on her face . " If you 'd only let yourself go , Jonas , " she said softly , " I think you might become a human being . " I looked into her eyes . " Do n't try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why I did it . You and I made our deal last night . "  | The gentle look faded from her face . " Do you want me to blow you right now ? " she asked . I knew I had hit her from the way she spoke . I smiled . " I can wait . " " So can I , " she replied . " Forever , if I have to . " Just then the telephone rang . " Get it , " I said . Rina picked it up and I heard a voice crackle for a moment , then she handed the phone to me . " Your wife . " " Hello , Monica . " Her voice was filled with anger . " Business ! " she shrieked . " And when I call you up , some cheap whore answers . I suppose you 're going to tell me it 's your stepmother ! " " That 's right ! " There was an angry click and the phone went dead in my hands . I looked down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was so right . And so wrong . I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AT THE FIELD . THERE WERE SEVeral planes warming up on the line , the red , white and blue ICA gleaming in the circle along their sides and under their wings . I looked down at the planning board , then up at the designer . Morrissey was young , even younger than I. He had graduated from M.I.T. , where he 'd majored in aeronautical engineering and design . He was n't a flier ; he was of a new generation that walked on the sky . What he proposed was radical . A single-wing , two-motor plane that would outlift anything in the air . He set his glasses lower on his nose . " The way I see it , Mr. Cord , " he said in his precise manner , " is that by deepening the wings , we get all the lift we need and also increase our fuel capacity . Plus which , we have the added advantage of keeping our pilot in direct visual control . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " If my calculations are correct , " Morrissey said , " we should be able to carry twenty passengers in addition to the pilot and copilot at a cruising speed of about two fifty . It should fly for about six hours before refuel-  | " You mean we could fly from here to New York with only one stopover in Chicago ? " Buzz asked skeptically . " I do n't believe it ! " " That 's what my calculations show , Mr. Dalton , " Morrissey said politely . Buzz looked at me . " You can throw away your money on fool schemes like this , " he said , " but not me . I 've been through too many of these pipe dreams . " " About how much would it take to build the first one ? " I asked Morrissey . " Four hundred , maybe five hundred thousand . After we get rid of the bugs , we can produce them for about a quarter of a million . " Dalton laughed raucously . " A half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll never get our money out . " First-class passage coast to coast by train was over four hundred dollars . It took almost four full days . Plus meals , it came to more than five hundred bucks per passenger . A plane like this would have a payload of seven grand a trip , plus the mail franchise , which would bring it up to about eighty-five hundred dollars . Flying five trips a week , in less than twenty weeks we could get all our costs back , plus operating expenses . From there on in , it would be gravy . Why , we could even afford to throw in free meals on the flight . I looked down at my watch . It was almost nine o'clock . I got to my feet . " I have to get down to the studio . They 're shooting the first scene today . " Dalton 's face turned red with anger . " Come off it , Jonas . Get down to business . For the past month and a half , all you been doin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're jerkin ' off with that lousy picture , we got to find ourselves a plane to build . If we do n't , the whole industry will get ahead of us . " I stared at him , unsmiling . " As far as I 'm concerned , " I said , " we have one . " " You 're not ? " he said incredulously , " you do n't mean you 're goin ' to take a chance with this ? " I nodded , then turned to Morrissey . " You can start building the plane right away . " " Wait a minute , " Dalton snapped . " If you think ICA is going to foot the bill , you 're crazy . Do n't forget I own half of the stock . " " And Cord Explosives owns the other half , " I said . " Cord Explosives also holds over half a million dollars of mortgages on ICA planes , most of which are past due right now . If I foreclosed on them , I 'd wind up owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily for a moment , then his face relaxed into a grin .  | " I shoulda known better , Jonas . I shoulda learned my lesson when I lost that Waco to you in the poker game . " I smiled back . " You 're a great flier , Buzz . You stick to flying and leave the business end to me . I 'll make a rich man out of you yet . " He reached for a cigarette . " O.K. , " he said easily . " But I still think you 're nuts to build this plane . We could lose our shirt on it . " I did n't answer as we walked out to my car . There was no use explaining to Buzz the simple rules of credit . ICA would order twenty of these planes from Cord Aircraft . The two companies would then give chattel mortgages on them to Cord Explosives . And Cord Explosives would discount those mortgages at the banks , even before the planes were built . The worst that could happen , if the plane was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a whopping tax deduction . I got into the car . " Good luck with the picture ! " Buzz yelled after me as I pulled away . I turned into the main gate at the Norman studios . The guard looked out and waved me on . " Good morning , Mr. Cord , " he called . " Good luck , sir . " I smiled and drove toward the parking lot . There was a small marker with my name on it . MR . CORD . They did n't miss a trick when it came to sucking ass . There was a reserved table with my name on it in the executive dining room . I also had a private bungalow with a suite of offices and two secretaries , a liquor cabinet stocked to the brim , an electric refrigerator , a private can and shower , a dressing room , a conference room and two secretarial offices in addition to my own . I went through the back door of my bungalow and directly into my office . I was n't at the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . She stood in front of the desk , looking very efficient with her notebook and pencil . " Good morning , Mr. Cord , " she said brightly . " Any dictation ? " I shook my head . You 'd think by this time she 'd know better . For the past five weeks , this had been going on every morning . I never write anything  --  messages , memos , instructions . If I want anything written , I call McAllister . That 's what lawyers are for . The telephone on my desk buzzed . She picked it up . " Mr. Cord 's office . " She listened a moment , then turned to me . " They 've completed rehearsal on Stage Nine . And they 're ready for their first take . They want to know if you 'd like to come down . " I got up . " Tell them I 'm on my way . " Stage Nine was at the far end of the lot . We built the New Orleans set  | there because we figured it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming across from the other stages . I began to hurry along the brick paths , cursing the distance , until I saw a messenger 's bicycle leaning against one of the executive bungalows . A moment later , I was pedaling like mad down the path . I heard the messenger start yelling behind me . I pulled around in front of Stage Nine and almost crashed into a man opening the door . He stood there and looked at me in shocked surprise . It was Bernie Norman . " Why , Mr. Cord , " he said . " You did n't have to do that . You could have called for a car to bring you down here . " I leaned the bike against the wall . " I did n't have time , Mr. Norman , " I said . " They said they were ready to start . It 's my money and my time they 're spending in there . " They were ready to play the first scene , the one where Max , as a young man , is having his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was n't the opening of the picture , but that 's the way they shoot them . They make all the interior scenes first , then the exteriors . When it 's all finished , an editor splices it together in its proper sequence . The actress playing the madam was Cynthia Randall , Norman 's biggest female star . She was supposed to be the sexiest thing in the movies . Personally , she did n't do a thing for me . I like my women with tits . Pwo make-up men and a hairdresser were hovering over her as she sat in front of the dressing table that was part of the set . Nevada was standing over in the other corner , his back to me , talking to Rina . He turned around as I came up and a chill ran through me as memory dragged up a picture of him from my childhood . He looked even younger than he did when I first saw him . I do n't know how he did it ; even his eyes were the eyes of a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we go . " I nodded , still staring at him . " Yeah , " I said . " Here we go . " Somebody yelled , " Places , everybody ! " " I guess that means me , " Nevada said . Rina 's face was turned toward the set , a rapt expression in her eyes . A man pushed past carrying a cable . I turned away from him and almost bumped into another man . I decided to get out of the way before I did any damage . I wound up near the sound booth . From there I could see and hear everything . Now I knew why pictures cost so much money . We were on our eleventh take of that same scene when I noticed the sound man in the booth . He was bent over the control board , his earphones tight to his  | head , twisting the dials crazily . Every other moment , I could see his lips move in silent curses , then he would spin the dials again . " Something wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . I could tell from his look he did n't know who I was . " There 's nothing wrong with the machine , " he said . " Something 's bothering you ? " " Look , buddy , " he said . " We both need our jobs , right ? " I nodded . " When the boss tells yuh to make somebody look good , yuh do what he says  --  yuh do n't ask no questions . Right ? " " Right . , " I said . " Well , I 'm doin ' my best . But I ai n't God . I ca n't change the sound of voices " I stared at him , a kind of dismay creeping over me . I had only Rina 's word that Nevada 's voice test had been O.K. " You mean Nevada Smith ? " He shook his head . " Naah , " he said contemptuously . " He 's O.K. It 's the dame . She comes over so nasal it sounds like her voice is coming out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . I reached over and snatched the earphones off his head . He turned angrily . " What the hell 's the idea ? " But I had them on by then and there was nothing he could do but stand there . Nevada was speaking . His voice came through fine  --  there was a good sound to it . Then Cynthia Randall began to speak and I did n't know whether to believe my eyes or my ears . Her voice had all the irritating qualities of a cat wailing on the back fence , with none of the sexual implications . It shivered its way down my spine . A voice like that could put an end to sex , even in the fanciest house in New Orleans . I ripped the earphones from my head and thrust them into the sound man 's astonished hands . I started out on the set . A man grabbed at me but I angrily pushed him aside . A voice yelled , " Cut ! " and a sudden silence fell over the set . Everyone was staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I knew was that someone had played me for a patsy and I did n't like it . I think the girl knew why I was there . A look of caution appeared in her eyes , even as she tried to bring a smile to her lips . Bernie Norman hurried onto the set . A flicker of relief showed in her face and I knew the whole story . She reached for Bernie 's arm as he turned toward me . " Mr. Cord , " he asked , " is anything wrong ? " " Yeah , " I said grimly . " Her . Get her off the set . She 's fired ! "  | " You just ca n't do that , Mr. Cord ! " he exclaimed . " She has a contract for this picture ! " " Maybe she has , " I admitted , " but not with me . It was n't my pen she squeezed the last drop of ink out of . " Bernie stared at me , the pale coming up underneath his tan . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly irregular , " he protested . " Miss Randall is a very important star . " " I do n't care if she 's the Mother of God , " I interrupted . I held out my wrist and looked down at the watch and then back up at him . " You 've got exactly five minutes to get her off this set or I 'll close down this picture and hit you with the biggest lawsuit you ever had ! " I sat down on the canvas chair with my name on it and looked around the now deserted set . Only a few people hovered about , moving like disembodied ghosts at a banquet . I looked over at the sound man hunched over his control board , his earphones still glued to his head . I closed my eyes wearily . It was after ten o'clock at night . I heard footsteps approaching and opened my eyes . It was Dan Pierce . He 'd been on the phone trying to borrow a star from one of the other studios . " Well ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dice . MGM would n't lend us Garbo . They 're planning a talking picture for her themselves . " " What about Marion Davies ? " " I just hung up on her . She loves the part but it is n't the kind of thing she feels she can do . Maybe we should 've stuck with Cynthia Randall . It 's costing you thirty grand a day to sit around like this . " I lit the cigarette and stared up at him . " I 'd rather drop it now than be laughed out of the theater and lose it all later . " " Maybe we could bring an actress in from New York ? " " We have n't the time , " I said . " Ten days , three hundred grand . " Just then , Rina came up with some sandwiches . " I thought you 'd be hungry , " she said , " so I sent out for these . " I took one and bit into it somberly . She turned and gave one to the second man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome , " she said and walked back to where she 'd been sitting with Nevada . " Too bad you ca n't find one that sounds like her , " the sound man mumbled through a mouthful of sandwich . I looked at him . " What do you mean ? " " She 's got somethin ' in her voice that gets yuh , " he said . " If it came  | through on the sound track like that , you 'd have them falling out of the balconies . " I stared at him now . " You mean Rina ? " He nodded and swallowed his mouthful . " Yeah . " A slow , meaningful grin came to his lips . " An ' if I ai n't crazy , she 'd photograph like a roll in the hay , too . She 's all woman . " I turned to Dan . " What do you think ? " " It 's possible , " he admitted cautiously . " Then , let 's go , " I said , getting to my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " Rina took it as a big joke when I asked her to speak a few of the lines into the microphone . She still did n't think I meant it when I called the crew back for a full-scale screen test . I do n't think she took me seriously at all until we sat in the screening room at two that morning and watched her and Nevada play one scene . I 'd never seen anything like her on the screen before . Whatever it was she had , it was twice as strong up there on the screen . She just plain made your mouth water . I turned to her . " Go home and go to bed . I want you in wardrobe at six o'clock tomorrow morning . We start shooting at nine . " She shook her head . " Uh-uh , Jonas . The joke 's gone far enough . I wo n't have any part of it . " " You be on that set ready to shoot at nine ! " I said grimly . " You 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at Nevada . There was a puzzled expression on his face . And something about the clear innocence in his eyes hit me wrong . " And you better see to it that she shows up ! " I said angrily . I turned and stormed out of the projection room , leaving them staring after me with shocked faces . 8 I OPENED ONE EYE SLOWLY AND PEERED AT MY WRIST WATCH . Tivo o'clock ! I sat up quickly and the pain almost split my skull . I groaned out loud and the door opened . It was Dan , already dressed in cream-colored slacks and a loud sports  | shirt . He held a glass of what looked like tomato juice . " Here , " he said . " Drink it down , pal . It 'll wash the fuzz away . " I lifted the glass to my lips . It tasted awful going down but he was right . A moment later , my head began to clear . I looked around the bedroom . It was a shambles . " Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off an ' sent them home . " " Good . " I got to my feet woozily . " I got ta get down to the studio . They were going to start shooting at nine . " Dan smiled . " I called and told them you were tied up but would get down there this afternoon . I figured it was better if you got some sleep . That was a hectic night . " I grinned at him . It sure was . Dan and I had really tied one on the night before . I 'd met him coming off the set and offered to give him a lift downtown . But on the way we 'd decided to stop and eat . I was wound up tighter than a dollar watch and he 'd offered to help me unwind . Steaks at a spot he knew , which ought to have been closed but was n't , along with bourbon and later the works . The works came out of his little black book , which all agents seem to carry . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be able to wind me up again . His Jap houseboy had shirred eggs and sausages ready when I came out of the shower . I was starved . I ate six eggs and about a dozen of the little bangers . When I put down my fourth cup of coffee Dan smiled and asked , " How are yuh feeling now ? " I grinned back at him . " I never felt better in my life . " It was true . For once I felt relaxed and loose . There was n't the usual tightening in my gut as I thought about the day . " You said something about getting down to business ? " We 'd talked the night before , more than I usually did with a stranger . But Dan Pierce was different . He was a type I had n't encountered before and he fascinated me . He was tough , shrewd and knew what he wanted . I was in over my head and I knew it . I would n't be for long , but until I got the hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sold my agency this morning to MCA . " " What for ? " " Because I 'm coming in with you . " " Are n't you jumping the gun a little ? " I asked . " I 'm only in for this one picture . What 'll you do after that ? " Dan smiled . " That 's what you say . It even might be what you really believe , right now . But I know different . You got a feel for this business ?  | a natural feel for it that not many people have . And there 's a challenge that you ca n't resist . You just found another gambling game . You 'll stick . " I sipped at the coffee . It was strong and black , just the way I liked it . " And just how do you figure you can help ? " I asked . " Because I know all the angles in this business , all the dirty tricks it would take you a long time to find out about . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got . I would n't be worth half as much if motion pictures were your only business . But it 's not . And it never will be . It 's just another game of craps . " I stared at him . " Give me a free sample . " " For one thing , " he said quickly , " I would n't have started the picture until I 'd had a sound test on everyone . " " That 's something I already learned . I want a sample of what I do n't know . " He reached around behind him for a blue-covered script . " If Rina comes off on the screen like that test indicates , we can make a few changes in this and save ourselves four hundred thousand dollars . " " How ? " " By building up her story and confining more of the picture to the New Orleans episode . It 'll save five weeks of exteriors and nobody knows yet how good those microphones work outside . " I reached for a cigarette . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to Nevada ? His part would be cut way down . " Dan 's eyes met mine steadily . " Nevada 's not my problem any more , he 's MCA 's . I 'm workin ' for you now an ' I figure you already used up all the sentiment you 're entitled to on this picture . This is just like any other kind of business . The big thing is to make money . " I dragged on the butt and sipped at the coffee . For the first time since Rina called , I was back to normal . For a while , she 'd had me spinning like a top . I did n't know whether I was coming or going . I felt different now . " What kind of deal do you have in mind ? " " No salary . Just a ten-per-cent piece of the action and an expense account . " I laughed . " I thought you said you sold your agency . " " That 's the only way I can figure my compensation without adding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " You 'd be living off the expense account . " " Sure I will . But even with a salary , I would . How do you expect me to do a job for you if I ca n't spend money ? Money is the only thing in this town nobody talks back to . "  | " I 'll give you a ten-per-cent participation in profits . But no stock interest . " He studied me for a moment . " What about the expense account ? " " That 's O.K. " He stuck out his hand . " It 's a deal . " It was after three o'clock when we walked onto Stage Nine . The place was jumping , a mumble of buzzing , efficient noise , as they got ready for the next take . Nevada was standing on the edge of the set ; Rina was n't anywhere in sight . I stopped near the sound man . " How 's it coming ? " He looked up at me and grinned . " Sounds great , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Nevada . He was talking to the director and they both turned as I came up . s she doing ? " The new director shrugged . " She was a little nervous at first but she 's settling down . She 'll be O.K. " " She 'll be great , " Nevada said warmly . " I never figured all the times ii , she cued me on the script that it would come in handy for her too . " One of the assistant directors hurried up . " We 're ready now , Mr. Carpi ! rol. , , The director nodded and the assistant turned around and yelled , " Places , everybody ! " III 1 The director walked over to the camera as Nevada moved out on the set . I turned and saw Rina entering from the side . I stared , unable to believe my eyes . Her long , white-blond hair was tied up on top of her head and they 'd bound her breasts so tight she looked like a boy . Her mouth was painted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin , unnatural line . She was no longer a woman  --  she was a caricature of every ad in Vanity Fair . Dan 's face was impassive . He stared at me , his eyes unrevealing . " They did a good job , " he said . " She 's right in the image . " 1 I " She do n't look like a woman . " " That 's what they go for . " " I do n't give a damn what they go for ! I do n't like it . Broads that look like that are a dime a dozen in this town . " A faint smile came into Dan 's eyes . " You do n't like it , change it , " he said . " You 're the boss . It 's your picture . " I stared at him for a moment . I felt like walking out onto the set and blowing a fuse . But instinct held me back . I knew one more display like yesterday 's would demoralize the whole crew . " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dan .  | He nodded approvingly . " Smart , " he said . " That 's the right way to do it . You may need me even less than I thought ! " He walked over to the director . A moment later , the director called a ten-minute break . He came over to me and I could see he was nervous . " What seems to be the trouble , Mr. Cord ? " " Who O.K. 'd that make-up and costume ? " The director looked at me , then over his shoulder at Rina . " I 'm sure it was approved by wardrobe and make-up , " he said . " Nevada told them to give her the full treatment . " " Nevada ? " He nodded . I looked at Dan . " I want everybody concerned in my office in ten minutes , " I said . " Right , Jonas . " I turned and walked out of the building . 9 I LOOKED AROUND THE OFFICE . I GUESS THE STUDIO KNEW WHAT they were doing after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Dan sat in an easy chair to the left of my desk , Carrol , the new director , beside him . Rina and Nevada were on the couch , and across the room from them was the cameraman . On the other side of the room were the make-up man and the head of the wardrobe department , a slim woman of indeterminate age , with a young face and prematurely-gray hair , wearing a simple tailored dress . Finally , my secretary was on my right , with the inevitable pencil poised over her pad . I lit a cigarette . " All of you saw that test last night , " I said . " It was great . How come that girl was n't on the set this afternoon ? " Nobody answered . " Rina , stand up . " Silently she got to her feet and stood there looking at me . I glanced around the room again . " What 's her name ? " The director coughed and laughed nervously . " Mr. Cord , everybody knows her name . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlowe . " " Then why do n't she look like Rina Marlowe instead of an ass-end  | combination of Clara Bow , Marion Davies and Cynthia Randall ? She sure as hell does n't look like Rina Marlowe ! " " I 'm afraid you do n't understand , Mr. Cord . " I looked around . " What 's your name ? " She stared right back at me . " I 'm Ilene Gaillard , " she said . " I 'm the costume designer . " " All right , Miss Gaillard . Suppose you tell me what I do n't understand . " " Miss Marlowe has to be dressed in the very forefront of fashion , " she said calmly . " You see , Mr. Cord , though we make certain concessions to the period in which the picture takes place , the fundamental design must carry forward the latest in high fashion . That 's what most women go to the movies to see . Motion pictures set the style . " I squinted at her . " Style or no style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl should have to look like a boy to be in fashion . No man in his right mind could be interested in a figure like that . " " Do n't blame Miss Gaillard , Jonas . I told her to do it . " I turned to Nevada . " You told her ? " He nodded . Sooner or later , it was bound to happen . I let my voice grow cold . " It 's my money that 's on the line now and the deal was that I 'm the boss . So from now on , you worry about your acting . Everything else is my headache . " Nevada 's lips tightened and deep in his eyes I could see the hurt . I turned away so that I would n't have to see it . Rina was watching with a curious kind of detachment . " Rina ! " She turned to me , an impassive mask dropping quickly over her eyes . " Go into the bathroom and wash all that muck off your face . Put on your usual make-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back behind my desk and sat down . Nobody said a word until she came back into the room , her mouth wide again , her lips full and her eyebrows flowing into the natural curve of her brow . Her hair spilled like white shimmering gold down to her shoulders . But there was still something  --  wrong . Underneath the negligee , her body was still a straight line . " Go back in there and get out of that harness you 're wearing . " Still silent , she did as I told her . And this time when she came out , she moved . Nobody could miss the fact that there was a woman underneath that negligee . " That 's more like it , " I said . " We 'll shoot those scenes again now . "  | Rina nodded and turned away . Miss Gaillard 's voice stopped her . " We ca n't photograph her like that . " I looked at the designer . " What did you say ? " Miss Gaillard stood up . " We ca n't shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " What 's the matter with that ? Tits should bounce . " " Of course , " the designer said quickly . " But on the screen everything is exaggerated . " She looked at the cameraman . " Is n't that right , Lee ? " The cameraman nodded . " That 's right , Mr. Cord . They wo n't look natural at all . " " We 'll have to put some kind of brassiere on her , " Miss Gaillard said . " O.K. Go see what you can do . " A moment later , Rina and the designer came out of the bathroom . They walked toward me . It was better than the original harness but they did n't look as good as they did without restraint . It just did n't look right to me . I got up from the desk and walked over to Rina . " Let me see . " Rina looked at me , her eyes deliberately distant . Impassively she dropped the negligee from her shoulders , holding it to her by the crook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Now left . " I stepped back and looked at Rina . I knew what it was now . Whenever she turned , the brassiere pulled and flattened , which was what gave her breasts that unnatural look . I looked at the designer . " Maybe if we took off the shoulder straps ? " Ilene Gaillard shrugged . " We can try . " She reached over and pushed down the straps . Rina stood there , her eyes fixed on some distant point over my shoulder . " Now turn . " The brassiere still cut into her breasts . " Unhh-unhh , " I said . " I still do n't like it . " " There 's one other thing I can try . " " O.K. , " I said . A few minutes later , they came out again . Rina wore a wire-ribbed contraption almost like a small corset , except it did n't come down over her hips . And when she moved , her breasts did n't . You could see them all right , but they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . I looked at the designer . " Is n't there some way we can cut out some of those wires ? " " I think that looks fine , Mr. Cord . Anyway , I do n't see why you 're so worried about her bustline . Her legs are good and you 'll see plenty of them . " " Miss Gaillard , since you 're not a man , I do n't expect you to under-  | stand what I 'm getting at . I can see all the legs I want to see just walking down the street . Just answer my question , please . " " No , we ca n't cut the wires , Mr. Cord , " she replied , equally polite . " If we do , she might as well be wearing nothing . There would n't be enough rigidity to support her . " " Maybe if I show you what I want , you can do it . Take it off , Rina , " I said , walking over to her . Impassively Rina turned aside for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraption was in one hand and with the other she held the top of the negligee closed . I took it and tossed in onto my desk . I put my hands to the top of Rina 's negligee and pushed it down until it formed a square across her breast just above the nipples . Her breasts rose like twin white moons against my dark , clenched fists . I looked back at the designer . " See what I mean ? " Maybe she did n't but there was n't a man in the room whose eyes were n't popping out of his head . " What you want is impossible , Mr. Cord . Rina 's a big girl . Thirty-eight C. There is n't a brassiere made that could support her bust like that . I 'm a designer , Mr. Cord , not a structural engineer . " I let go of Rina 's negligee and turned to Miss Gaillard . " Thank you , " I said , going over to the telephone . " That 's the first constructive idea I 've heard since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twenty minutes . " I 've got a little problem , Morrissey . I need your help . " His nervousness disappeared slightly and he looked around shyly . " Anything I can do , Mr. Cord . " " Stand up , Rina , " I said . Slowly she got to her feet and walked around us . Morrissey 's eyes widened behind his glasses . I was glad to see that other things could occupy his mind besides airplanes . " There is n't a brassiere made that can keep them from jiggling , " I said . " And still look natural . I want you to design one that will . " He turned back to me , an expression of shock on his face . " You 're joking , Mr. Cord ! " " I was never more serious in my life . " " But  --  but I do n't know anything about brassieres . I 'm an aeronautical engineer , " he stammered , blushing a bright pink . " That 's why I called you , " I said calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to withstand thousands of pounds of stress you ought to be able to come up with something that would hold up a little thing like a  | pair of tits . " I turned to the costume designer . " Fill him in on what he needs to know . " Miss Gaillard looked at me , then at Morrissey . " Perhaps it would be better if we worked in my office in Wardrobe . I have everything there you might need . " Morrissey had been staring at Rina 's breasts while the designer spoke . For a moment , I thought he was paralyzed , then he turned around . " I think I might be able to do something . " " I knew you could , " I said , smiling . " I 'm not promising anything , of course . But it 's a very intriguing problem . " I kept a straight face . " Very , " I said solemnly . Morrissey turned to the designer . " Do you happen to have a pair of calipers ? " " Calipers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her in amazement . " How else would we be able to measure the depth and the circumference ? " She stared at him blankly for a moment , then , taking his arm , began to walk him toward the door . " I 'm sure we can get a pair from Engineering . You 'd better come with us , Rina . " Morrissey was back in a little over an hour . He came in waving a sheet of paper . " I think we 've got it ! It was really very simple once we found the point of stress . The weight of each breast pulls to either side . That means the origin of stress falls between them , right in the center of the cleavage . " I stared at him . His language was a curious mixture of engineering and wardrobe design . But he was too wrapped up in his explanation to pay attention to my look . " The whole thing then became a problem of compensation . We had to find a way to utilize the stress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cleavage using the suspension principle . Understand ? " I shook my head . " You went way past me . " " You know the principle used in a suspension bridge ? " " Vaguely , " I said . " Under that principle , the more pressure the mass exerts against itself , the more pressure is created to hold it in place . " I nodded . I still did n't understand it completely . But I had all I needed for now . What I wanted to know was would it work ? I did n't have long to wait for the answer . Rina came into the office shortly after that with Ilene Gaillard . Deliberately she let the wrap fall to the floor and stood there in the repaired negligee.  | " Walk toward Mr. Cord , " the designer said . Slowly Rina walked toward me . I could n't take my eyes from her . The sweetest pair of knockers a man ever put his head down on . She stopped in front of my desk and looked down at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well ? " I was conscious of the effort it took to raise my eyes and look up into her face . Her eyes were cold and calculating . The bitch was always exactly aware of the effect she had on me . She started to turn away . " One more thing , Miss Gaillard , " I said . " Tomorrow when we start shooting . I want her in a black negligee , instead of that white one . I want everybody to know she 's a whore , not a virgin bride . " " Yes , Mr. Cord . " Ilene came up to my desk , her eyes shining . " I really think we 're going to set a new style with Miss Marlowe . Unless I 'm completely mistaken , women all over the world will be trying for her style once this picture comes out . " I grinned at her . " We did n't set the fashion , Miss Gaillard , " I said . " Women looked like women long before either of us was born . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . The meeting was over and everybody was getting stiffly to his feet . Nevada was the last one out and I called him back . He came back to my desk . I turned and looked at my secretary . She was still sitting there , her book filled with shorthand notes . " What 've you got there ? " I asked . " The minutes of the meeting . " " What for ? " " It 's a company rule , " she said . " Minutes of all executive meetings are recorded and copies circulated . " " Give me that book . " I held it over the wastebasket and set a match to it . When the flame caught , I dropped it into the basket and looked up at her . She was staring at me with an expression of horror . " Now trot your fat little ass out of here , " I said . " And if I ever hear of any minutes of meetings in this office ever showing up outside these walls , you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned back to him . " I 'm sorry I had to speak the way I did , Nevada . " " That 's all right , Junior . I should n't have shot my mouth off . " " There 's a lot of people in this town think I 'm a sucker and that I got conned into a bum deal . You and I know that 's not true but I have to stop that kind of talk . I ca n't afford it . "  | " I understand , Junior . Your pappy was the same way . There was only one boss when he was around . " Suddenly , I realized how far apart we 'd grown . For a moment , I had a wave of nostalgia for my childhood , when I could always reach out to Nevada for assurance . It was n't that way any more . It was exactly the opposite . Nevada was leaning on me . " Thanks , Nevada , " I said , forcing a smile to my lips . " And do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned and I watched him walk out of the office . Shortly after he left Dan Pierce came into the office . I reached for a cigarette and lit it . " About what you said this morning . I think we ought to change the script . You better send for the writers right away . " He grinned knowingly . " I already did . " 10 WE COMPLETED THE PICTURE IN FOUR WEEKS . NEVADA KNEW what was happening but he never said a word . Tivo weeks after that , we held the first sneak preview at a theater out in the valley . I got there late and the studio publicity man let me in . " There are only a few seats left on the side , Mr. Cord , " he apologized . I looked down at the orchestra . There was a section roped off in the center for studio guests . It was jammed . Everybody at the studio from Norman on down was there . They were all waiting for me to fall on my ass . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the picture came on . I found my way in the dark to a seat in the middle of a bunch of youngsters and looked up at the screen . My name looked funny up there . JONAS CORD PRESENTS But the feeling left when the credits were over and the picture began . After ten minutes had passed I started to sense a restlessness in the kids around me . " Aw , shit , " I heard one of them whisper . " I thought this was gon na be somethin ' different . It 's just another friggin ' Western . " Then Rina came on screen . Five minutes later , when I looked around me , the kids ' faces were staring up at the screen , their mouths partly  | open , their expressions rapt . There was n't a sound except their breathing . Next to me sat a boy holding a girl 's hand tightly in his lap . When Rina finally pulled Nevada down onto the bed with her , I could feel the kid squirm . He whispered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile . Nobody had to tell me this picture was box office . When I came down into the lobby after it was over , Nevada was standing in the corner surrounded by kids and signing autographs . I looked for Rina . She was at the other end of the lobby surrounded by reporters . Bernie Norman was hovering over her like a proud father . Dan was standing in the center of a circle of men . He looked up as I came over . " You were right , Jonas , " he cried jubilantly . " She creamed ' em . We 'll gross ten million dollars ! " I gestured and he followed me out to my car . " When this is over , " I said , " bring Rina to my hotel . " He stared at me . " It 's still eating yuh , is n't it ? " " Do n't lecture me , just do as I say ! " " What if she wo n't come ? " " She 'll come , " I said grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was one o'clock in the morning and I was halfway through a bottle of bourbon when the knock came on the door . I went over and opened it . Rina walked into the room and I closed the door . She turned to face me . " Well ? " I gestured toward the bedroom . She looked at me for a moment , then shrugged her shoulders and nonchalantly started for the bedroom . " I told Nevada I was coming here , " she said over her shoulder . I spun her around violently . " What the hell did you do a damnfool thing like that for ? " Her eyes appraised me calmly . " Nevada and I are going to get married . I told him I wanted to be the first to tell you . " I could n't believe my ears . " No ! " I shouted hoarsely . " You ca n't . I wo n't let you . He 's an old man , he 's through . You 'll be the biggest star in the business when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If you know , then why ? You do n't need him . You do n't need anybody . " " Because when I needed him , he helped me , " she said evenly . " Now it 's my turn . He needs me . " " He needs you ? Why ? Because he was too proud to do his own crawl-ing ? " " That 's not true and you know it ! "  | " Making you a star was my idea ! " " I did n't ask you for it , " Rina said angrily . " I did n't even want it . Do n't think I did n't see what you were doing . Cutting down his part in his own picture , building me up as a monument to your own ego while you were ruining him ! " " I did n't see you trying to stop me , " I said . " We both know he 's on the way out . There 's a new kind of cowboy over at one of the studios . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun ! " " You know everything , do n't you ! " Her hand slashed angrily out at my face . I could feel its sting even as she spoke . " That 's why he needs me more than ever ! " I exploded and grabbed her by the shoulders , shaking her violently . " What about me ? Why do you think I went into this ? Not for Nevada . For you ! Did you ever stop to think that when I came rushing up here to see you , that maybe I needed you ? " She stared into my eyes angrily . " You 'll never need anybody , Jonas , only yourself . Otherwise , you would n't have left your wife down there all by herself . If you had any feelings at all , even pity , you 'd have gone down there , or had her come up here . " " You leave my wife out of this ! " She turned to pull away and the front of her dress tore down to her waist . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel the fever climb up in me . " Rina ! " I crushed my mouth down on hers . " Rina , please . " Her mouth moved for a moment as she struggled to get away from me , then she was pressing herself closer and closer , her arms around my neck . That 's the way we were when the door behind me opened . " Get outa here ! " I said hoarsely , without bothering to turn around . " Not this time , Jonas ! " I gave Rina a shove toward the bedroom , then turned around slowly to face my father-in-law and another man . Behind them was Monica , standing in the doorway . I stared at her . She had a belly way out to here . The hollow echo of triumph was in Amos Winthrop 's voice as he spoke . " Ten grand was too much to give me to send her away before . " He chuckled quietly . " How much do you think it 'll cost you to get rid of her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curse myself silently . No wonder Amos Winthrop could laugh . I 'd known Monica for less than a month before we got married . Even to my untrained eyes , she was at least five  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | zine again , riffled through the pages , then threw it back on the coverlet . " I wish to hell they 'd let me out of here ! " Ilene was out of the chair now . She looked down at Rina from the side of the bed . " Do n't fret , " she said quickly . " You 'll be out soon enough . Then you 'll wish you were still here . I heard that the studio 's just waiting for you to get out so they can put you to work in Madame Pompadour " Rina sighed . " Not that old chestnut again . Every time they get stuck for a picture , they take that one down off the shelf and dust it off . Then they make a big announcement and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can , back it goes on the shelf . " " Not this time , " Ilene said earnestly . " I spoke to Bernie Norman in New York yesterday . He has a new writer on it and said the script was shaping up great . He says it 's got social significance now . " Rina smiled . " Social significance ? Who 's writing it  --  Eugene O'Neill ? " Ilene stared at her . " You knew all the time . " Rina shook her head . " No , I did n't . It was just a wild guess . Has Bernie really got O'Neill ? " Ilene nodded . " He expects to have a copy of the script sent over to you as soon as O'Neill is finished . " Despite herself , Rina was impressed . Maybe this time , Bernie really meant it . She felt a surge of excitement flow into her . O'Neill was a writer , not an ordinary Hollywood hack . He could make something of the story . Then the excitement drained out of her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything that was done these days bore the tag . Ever since Roosevelt took office . " What time is it ? " " Ten after three , " Ilene answered . Rina leaned back against the pillow . " Why do n't you go out and get a cup of coffee ? " Ilene smiled . " I 'm all right . " " You 've been here all day . " " I want to be here , " Ilene answered . " You go . " Rina closed her eyes . " I think I 'll take a little nap before the doctor comes . " Ilene stood there for a moment , until she heard the soft , shallow breath of rest . Then gently she straightened the covers and looked into Rina 's face . The large eyes were closed , the cheeks thin and drawn tightly across the high cheekbones . There was a faintly blue pallor beneath the California tan . She reached down and brushed the white-blond hair back from Rina 's forehead , then quickly kissed the tired mouth and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room looked up . " I 'm going down for a cup of coffee , " Ilene said . " She 's sleeping . " The nurse smiled with professional assurance . " Do n't worry , Miss Gaillard , " she said . " Sleep is the best thing for her . " Ilene nodded and went out into the corridor . She felt the tightness in her chest , the mist that constantly had pressed against her eyes these last few weeks . She came out of the elevator and started for the coffee shop . Still lost in her thoughts , she did n't hear the doctor until her hand was on the door . " Miss Gaillard ? " For a moment , she had no voice . She could only nod dumbly . " Mind if I join you ? " " Not at all , " she said . He smiled and held the door open for her . They went inside to a corner table . The doctor waved his hand and two cups of coffee appeared before them . " How about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you could use a little food . " He laughed in his professional manner . " There 's no sense in having another patient just now . " " No , thank you , " she said . " The coffee will do fine . " The doctor put down his coffee cup . " Good coffee . " She nodded . " Rina is sleeping . " She said the first thing that came into her mind . " Good . " The doctor nodded , looking at her . His dark eyes shone brightly through the bifocals . " Does Miss Marlowe have any relatives out here ? " " No , " Ilene answered quickly . Then the implication hit her . She stared at him . " You mean . . . " Her voice trailed off . " I do n't mean anything , " the doctor said . " It 's just that in cases like this , we like to know the names of the next of kin in case something does happen . " " Rina has no relatives that I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about her husband ? " " Who ? " Ilene 's voice was puzzled . " Is n't she married to Nevada Smith ? " the doctor asked . " She was , " Ilene answered . " But they were divorced three years ago . She 's been married since then to Claude Dunbar , the director . " " That ended in divorce , too ? " " No , " Ilene answered tersely . Her lips tightened . " He committed suicide , after they 'd been married a little over a year . " " Oh , " the doctor said . " I 'm sorry . I guess I have n't had much time these last few years to keep up with things . " " If there 's anything special that needs to be done , I guess I 'm the one  | who could do it , " she said . " I 'm her closest friend . She gave me power of attorney . " The doctor stared at her silently . She could read what was in his mind behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did it matter what he thought ? What did it matter what anyone thought now ? " Did you get the results from the blood tests ? " The doctor nodded . She tried to keep her voice from shaking . " Is it leukemia ? " " No , " he said . He could see the hope spring up in her eyes . Quickly he spoke to avoid the pain of disappointment . " It was what we thought . Encephalitis . " He noted her puzzled expression . " Sometimes it 's called sleeping sickness . " The hope in Ilene refused to die . " Then she has a chance ? " " A very small one , " the doctor said , still watching her carefully . " But if she lives , there 's no telling what she 'll be like . " " What do you mean ? " Ilene asked harshly . " Encephalitis is a virus that settles in the brain , " he explained slowly . " For the next four or five days , as the virus builds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high fevers . During these fevers , the virus will attack the brain . It is only after the fever breaks that we 'll be able to tell how much damage she has sustained . " " You mean her mind will be gone ? " Ilene 's eyes were large with horror . " I do n't know , " the doctor said . " The damage can take many forms . Her mind ; perhaps she 'll be paralyzed or partly so ; she may know her own name , she may not . The residual effects are similar to a stroke . It depends on what part of the brain has been damaged . " The sick fear came up inside her . Quickly she caught her breath against it , her face paling . " Breathe deeply and sip a little water , " the doctor said . She did as he commanded and the color flooded back into her face . " Is there anything we can do ? Anything at all ? " " We 're doing everything we can . We know so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its more common form , in tropical countries , it 's supposed to be carried by insects and transmitted by their bite . But many cases , in the United States and elsewhere , just appear , with no apparent causation at all . " " We just got back from Africa three months ago , " Ilene said . " We made a picture there . " " I know , " the doctor said . " Miss Marlowe told me about it . That was what first made me suspicious . "  | " But no one else is sick , " Ilene said . " And we were all out there for three months , living exactly the same way , in the same places . " The doctor shrugged . " As I said , we are n't really sure what causes it . " Ilene stared at him . A note of bewilderment crept into her voice . " Why could n't it be me ? " she asked . " She has so much to live for . " The doctor reached across the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she no longer resented him , as she did most men . " How many times in my life have I heard that question ? And I 'm no closer to the answer now than when I first began to practice . " She looked at him gratefully . " Do you think we should say anything to her ? " His dark eyes grew large behind his glasses . " What purpose would it serve ? " he asked . " Let her have her dreams . " Rina heard the dim voices outside the door . She was tired , weary and tired , and everything was a soft , blurred haze . Vaguely she wondered if the dream would come again . The thin edges of it poked at her mind . Good . It was coming . Softly , comfortably now , she let herself slip down into it . Further and further she felt herself dropping into the dream . She smiled unconsciously and turned her face against the pillow . Now she was surrounded by her dream . The dream of death she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT WAS COOL IN THE YARD BENEATH THE SHADE OF THE GIANT old apple trees . Rina sat in the grass and arranged the dolls around the small wooden plank that served as a table . " Now , Susie , " she said to the little dark-haired doll . " You must not gulp your food . " The black eyes of the doll stared unwinkingly back at her . " Oh , Susie ! " she said in imaginary concern . " You spilled it all over your dress ! Now I 'll have to change you again . " She picked up the doll and undressed it quickly . She washed the clothes in an imaginary tub , then ironed them . " Now you stay clean , " she exclaimed in pretended anger .  | She turned to the other doll . " Are you enjoying your breakfast , Mary ? " She smiled . " Eat it all up . It 'll make you big and strong . " Occasionally , she would glance toward the big house . She was happy to be left alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually , one or the other of the servants would be calling her to come back in . Then her mother would scold her and tell her that she was not to play in the yard , that she must stay near the kitchen door at the far side of the house . But she did n't like it there . It was hot and there was no grass , only dirt . Besides , it was near the stables and the smell of the horses . She did n't understand why her mother always made such a fuss . Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe never said anything when they found her there . Once , Mr. Marlowe even had picked her up and swung her high over his head , tickling her with his mustache until she almost burst with hysterical laughter . But when she 'd come inside , her mother had been angry and had spanked her bottom and made her go up to their room and stay there all afternoon . That was the worst punishment of all . She loved to be in the kitchen while her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody always said her mother was the best cook the Marlowes had ever had . She heard footsteps and looked up . Ronald Marlowe threw himself to the ground beside her . She looked down again and finished feeding Susie , then said in a matter-of-fact voice , " Would you like some dinner , Lad-die ? " He sniffed disdainfully from the superiority of his lofty eight years . " I do n't see anything to eat . " She turned toward him . " You 're not looking , " she said . She forced a doll 's plate into his hand . " Eat it . It 's very good for you . " Reluctantly he pretended to eat . After a moment , he was bored and got to his feet . " I 'm hungry , " he said . " I 'm going in and get some real food . " " You wo n't get any , " she said . " Why not ? " " Because my mommy 's still sick and nobody cooked . " " I 'll get something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned back to her dolls . It was turning dusk when Molly , the upstairs maid , came out looking for her . The girl 's face was red from crying . " Come , macushla , " she said , sweeping Rina up in her arms . " It 's your mither that wants to set eyes on ye again . " Peters , the coachman , was there , as was Mary , the downstairs maid , and Annie , the scullery helper . They were standing around her mother 's bed and they made way for her as she came over . There was also a man in a black suit , holding a cross in his hand .  | She stood very still near the bed , looking at her mother solemnly . Her mother looked beautiful , her face so white and calm , her white-blond hair brushed back softly from her forehead . Rina moved closer to the bed . Her mother 's lips moved but Rina could n't hear what she was saying . The man in the black suit picked her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Obediently Rina kissed her mother 's cheek . It was cool to her lips . Her mother smiled again and closed her eyes , then suddenly opened them and looked upward unseeingly . Quickly the man shifted Rina to his other arm . He reached down and closed her mother 's eyes . Molly held out her arms and the man gave Rina to her . Rina looked back at her mother . She was sleeping now . She looked beautiful , just as she did in the early mornings when Rina would awaken and stare at her over the edge of the bed . Rina looked around the room at the others . The girls were crying , and even Peters , the coachman , had tears in his eyes . She looked up into Molly 's face . " Why are you crying ? " she asked solemnly . " Is my mommy dead ? " The tears came afresh in the girl 's eyes . She hugged Rina closely to her . " Hush , child , " she whispered . " We 're crying because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with Rina in her arms . The door closed behind them and Rina looked up into her face . " Will Mommy be up in time to make breakfast tomorrow ? " Molly stared at her in sudden understanding . Then she sank to her knees in the hallway at the top of the back stairs . She rocked back and forth with the child in her arms . " Oh , my poor little child , my poor little orphan child , " she cried . Rina looked up at her and after a moment , the tears became contagious and she , too , began to cry . But she did n't quite know why . Peters came into the kitchen while the servants were eating supper . Rina looked up at him and smiled . " Look , Mr. Peters . " She laughed happily . " I had three desserts ! " Molly looked down at her . " Hush , child , " she said quickly , the tears coming again to her eyes . " Finish your ice cream . " Rina stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could n't understand why the girls began to cry every time they spoke to her . The home-made vanilla ice cream tasted cool and sweet . She took another spoonful . " I just spoke to the master , " Peters said . " He said it would be all right if we laid her out in my room over the stable . And Father Nolan said we could bury her from St. Thomas ' . "  | " But how can we ? " Molly cried , " when we do n't even know if she was a Catholic ? Not once in the three years she 's been here did she go to Mass . " " What difference does that make ? " Peters asked angrily . " Did she not make her confession to Father Nolan ? Did she not receive the last rites from him and take the Holy Sacraments ? Father Nolan is satisfied that she was a Catholic . " Mary , the downstairs maid , who was the oldest of the three girls , nodded her head in agreement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe she 'd done something and was afraid to go to Mass , but the important thing was that she came back to the church in the end . " Peters nodded his head emphatically . " It 's settled , then , " he said , starting for the door . He stopped and looked back at them . " Molly , take the child to sleep with you tonight . I 'm goin ' down to the saloon and get sivral of the boys to help me move her tonight . Father Nolan said he 'd send Mr. Collins over to fix her up . He told me the church would pay for it . " " Oh , the good Father , " Mary said . " Bless him , " Annie said , crossing herself . " Can I have some more ice cream ? " Rina asked . There was a knock at the door and Molly opened it quickly . " Oh , it 's you , mum , " she exclaimed in a whisper . " I came to see if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl stepped back . " Wo n't you come in , mum ? " Mrs. Marlowe looked over at the bed . Rina was sleeping soundly , her dolls , Susie and Mary , on either side of her . Her white-blond hair hung in tiny ringlets around her head . " How is she ? " " Fine , mum . " The girl bobbed her head . " The poor darlin ' was so exhausted with the excitement , she dropped off like that . Mercifully she does n't understand . She 's too young . " Geraldine Marlowe looked at the child again . For a moment , she thought of how it would be if she were the one to go , leaving her Laddie alone and motherless . Though , in a way , that was different , for Laddie would still have his father . She remembered the day she had hired Rina 's mother . Her references were very good although she had not worked for several years . " I have a child , ma'am , " she 'd said in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years old . " " What about your husband , Mrs. Osterlaag ? " " He went down with his ship . He and the child never saw each other . " She 'd looked down at the floor for a moment . " We had the child late in  | life , ma'am . We Finns do n't marry young ; we wait until we can afford it . I lived on our savings as long as I could . I must go back to work . " Mrs. Marlowe had hesitated . A two-year-old child might turn out to be an annoyance . " Rina would be no problem , ma'am . She 's a good child and very quiet . She can sleep in my room and I 'd be willing to have you take out of my wages for her board . " Mrs. Marlowe had always wanted a little girl but after Laddie was born , the doctor had told her there would be no more children . It would be good for Laddie to have someone to play with . He was getting entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no deduction from your wages , Mrs. Osterlaag . After all , how much can a little girl eat ? " That had been almost three years ago . And Rina 's mother had been right . Rina had been no trouble at all . " What will happen to the child , mum ? " Molly whispered . Mrs. Marlowe turned to the servant girl . " I do n't know , " she said , thinking about it for the first time . " Mr. Marlowe is going to inquire in town tomorrow about her relatives . " The servant girl shook her head . " He wo n't find any , mum , " she said positively . " I often heard the mither say there was no family at all . " Her eyes began to fill with tears . " Oh , the poor , poor darlin ' . Now she 'll have to go to the county home . " Mrs. Marlowe felt a lump come up in her throat . She looked down at Rina , sleeping peacefully in the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stop your crying , Molly , " she said sharply . " I 'm sure she wo n't have to go to the county home . Mr. Marlowe will locate her family . " " But what if he does n't ? " " Then we 'll think of something , " she said . She crossed the room and stepped quickly out into the narrow hallway . There was a scuffling sound behind her . She turned around . " Aisy now , boys ! " She heard Peters ' voice . Then he appeared , backing through the doorway across the hall . She pressed herself back to let them pass . " Beggin ' your pardon , mum , " he said , his face flushed with exertion . " A sad , sad thing . " They went past with their shrouded burden , impregnating the still , warm air with a faint but unmistakable odor of beer . She wondered if she had done the right thing when she 'd persuaded her husband to allow  | them to use the apartment over the stables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard their heavy footsteps on the stairs as they carried Bertha Osterlaag , born in a small fishing village in Finland , down to her eventual funeral in a strange church , and her grave in a strange land . 3 HARRISON MARLOWE COULD SEE HIS WIFE 'S HEAD BENT OVER her embroidery from the doorway . He crossed the room quietly , and bending over the back of her chair , quickly kissed her cheek . His wife 's voice held the usual delightful shock . " Oh , Harry ! What if the servants are watching ? " " Not tonight . " He laughed . " They 're all thinking about their party . I see Mary 's all dressed up . " A tone of reproach came into his wife 's voice . " You know it 's not a party they 're having . " He crossed in front of her , still smiling . " That 's not what they call it , " he said . " But leave it to the Irish to make a party out of anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sherry before dinner ? " " I think I 'd like a Martini tonight , if you do n't mind , dear , " Geraldine said hesitantly . He turned in half surprise . When they had been in Europe on their honeymoon a bartender in Paris had introduced them to the new drink and ever since , it had served as a sort of signal between them . " Of course , my dear , " he said . He pulled at the bell rope . Mary appeared in the doorway . " Some cracked ice , please , Mary . " The girl curtseyed and disappeared . He turned back to the sideboard and took down a bottle of gin , the French , vermouth and a tiny bottle of orange bitters . Using a measuring jigger , he carefully poured three jiggers of gin into the cocktail shaker and one of vermouth . Then ceremoniously he allowed four drops of bitters to trickle into the shaker . By this time , the ice was already on the sideboard beside him and he filled the shaker to the brim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaker and began to shake vigorously . At last , the drink was cold enough . He unscrewed the cap and carefully  | poured the contents into glasses . The shaker empty , he dropped a green olive into each glass , then stood back and surveyed them with approval . Each glass was filled to the brim  --  one more drop and it would overflow , one drop less and it would not be full . Geraldine Marlowe lifted hers to her lips . She wrinkled her nose in approval . " It 's delicious . " " Thank you , " he said , lifting his own glass . " Your good health , my dear . " He put his glass down wonderingly and looked at his wife . Perhaps what he had heard was true  --  that women did n't really bloom until they were older , and then their desire increased . He calculated swiftly . He was thirty-four ; that made Geraldine thirty-one . They had been married seven years and with the exception of their honeymoon , their life had assumed a pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Perhaps it was true . If it was , it was all right with him . He loved his wife . That was the only reason he went down to that house on South Street . To spare her the humiliation of having to endure him more than she wanted . He lifted his drink again . " Did you find out anything about Bertha 's family today ? " she asked . Harrison Marlowe shook his head . " There 's no family anywhere . Perhaps in Europe , but we do n't even know what town she came from . " Geraldine looked down at her drink . Its pale golden color glowed in the glass . " How terrible , " she said quietly . " What will happen to the child now ? " Harrison shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't know . I suppose I 'll have to notify the authorities . She 'll probably go to the county orphanage . " " We ca n't let that happen ! " The words burst from Geraldine 's lips involuntarily . Harrison stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " I do n't see what else we can do . " " Why ca n't we just keep her ? " " You just ca n't , " he said . " There are certain legalities involved . An orphaned child is n't like a chattel . You ca n't keep her because she hap pens to be left at your house . " " You can speak to the authorities , " Geraldine said . " I 'm sure they would prefer to leave her with us rather than have her become a public charge . " " I do n't know , " Harrison said . " They might want us to adopt her to make sure that she does n't become a charge . "  | " Harry , what a wonderful idea ! " Geraldine smiled and got out of her chair , then walked to her husband . " Now , why did n't I think of that ? " " Think of what ? " " Adopting Rina , " Geraldine said . " I 'm so proud of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " He stared at her speechlessly . She placed her arms around his neck . " But then you always wanted a little girl around the house , did n't you ? And Laddie would be so happy to have a little sister . " He felt the soft press of her body against him and the answering surge of warmth well up inside him . She kissed him quickly on the lips , then , as quickly , turned her face away from him almost shyly as she felt his immediate response . " Suddenly , I 'm so excited , " she whispered meaningfully , her face half hidden against his shoulder . " Do you think it would be all right if we had another Martini ? " Dandy Jim Callahan stood in the middle of his office , looking at them . He rubbed his chin thoughtfully . " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " It 's a difficult thing you ask . " " But , surely , Mr. Mayor , " Geraldine Marlowe said quickly , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not so easy as you think , my dear lady . You forget the church has something to say about this , too . After all , the mother was Catholic and you just ca n't take a Catholic child and turn it over to a Protestant family . At least , not in Boston . They 'd never stand for , p . Geraldine turned away , the disappointment showing clearly in her face . It was then for the first time that she saw her husband as something other than the nice young Harvard boy she had married . He stepped forward and there appeared in his voice a quality of strength that she had never heard before . " The church would like it even less if I were to prove that the mother was never a Catholic . They 'd look pretty foolish then , would n't they ? " The mayor turned to him . " You have srich proof ? " " I have , " Marlowe said . He took a sheet of paper out of his pocket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both clearly state they were Protestant . " Dandy Jim took the papers from him and studied them . " If you had these , why did n't you stop them ? " " How could I ? " Marlowe asked . " I did n't receive them until today . The it . "  | servants and Father Nolan made all the arrangements last night . Besides , what difference does it make to the poor woman ? She 's getting a Christian burial . " Dandy Jim nodded and gave the papers back . " This will be very embarrassing to Father Nolan , " he said . " A young priest with his first church making a mistake like that . The Bishop wo n't like it at all . " " The Bishop need never know , " Marlowe said . Dandy Jim stared at him thoughtfully but did n't speak . Marlowe pressed . " There 's an election coming up next year . " Dandy Jim nodded , " There 's always an election . " " That 's true , " Marlowe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A candidate needs contributions almost as much as he needs votes . " Dandy Jim smiled . " Did I ever tell you I met your father ? " Marlowe smiled back . " No , you did n't . But my father often mentioned it . He told me many times how he threw you out of his office . " Dandy Jim nodded . " That 's true . Your father has a wild temper . One would almost take him for an Irishman . And all I did was ask him for a small campaign contribution . That was about twenty years ago . I was running for City Council then . Do you know what he said to me then ? " Marlowe shook his head . " He swore that if ever I was so much as elected to the post of dogcatcher , he 'd take his family and move out . " Dandy Jim was smiling . " He wo n't like it when he hears you 've contributed to my campaign fund . " Marlowe stood his ground . " My father is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " but what I do with my money and my politics is my concern , not his . " " You have other children ? " Dandy Jim asked . " A boy , " Geraldine answered quickly . " Laddie is eight . " Dandy Jim smiled . " I do n't know , " he said . " Someday women will have the vote and if that little girl is brought up on the hill , that 's one vote I may never get . " " I promise you this , Mr. Mayor , " Geraldine said quickly . " If that day ever comes , the women of my household will always vote for you ! " Dandy Jim 's smile grew broader . He made a courtly bow . " It is a weakness of politicians to always be making deals . " The next day , Timothy Kelly , the mayor 's secretary , appeared at Marlowe 's office in the bank and picked up a check for five hundred dollars . He suggested that Marlowe talk to a certain judge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Quickly , quietly and legally . When  | Marlowe departed the judge 's chambers , he left with the judge a birth certificate for one white female child named Katrina Osterlaag . In his pocket was a birth certificate in the name of his daughter , Rina Marlowe . 4 UNDERNEATH THE OVERSIZED UMBRELLA PLANTED IN THE SAND , Geraldine Marlowe sat in a canvas chair , her parasol at her side . Slowly she moved her fan back and forth . " I ca n't remember a summer as hot as this , " she said breathlessly . " It must be over ninety here in the shade . " Her husband grunted from the chair next to hers , his head still immersed in the Boston newspaper , which arrived on the Cape one day late . " What did you say , Harry ? " He folded his paper and looked at his wife . " That Wilson 's a damn fool ! " Geraldine was still looking at the ocean . " What makes you say that , dear ? " He tapped the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says he 's going to Europe and see to it that peace is insured . " Geraldine looked at him . " I think that 's a wonderful idea , " she said mildly . " After all , we were lucky this time . Laddie was too young to go . The next time , it may be different . " He snorted again . " There wo n't be a next time . Germany is through forever . Besides , what can they do to us ? They 're on the other side of the ocean . We can just sit back and let them kill each other off if they want to start another war . " Geraldine shrugged her shoulders . " You better move in closer under the umbrella , dear , " she said . " You know how red you get in the sun . " Harrison Marlowe got up and moved his chair farther under the umbrella . He settled back in the chair with a sigh and buried himself in the newspaper once more . Rina appeared suddenly in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had lunch , Mother , " she said . " Can I go into the water now ? " " May I , " Geraldine corrected automatically . She looked at Rina . She had grown up this summer . It was hard to believe she was only thirteen .  | She was tall for her age , almost five three , only one inch shorter than Laddie , who was three years older . Her hair was bleached completely white from the sun and her skin was deeply tanned , so dark that her almond-shaped eyes seemed light by comparison . Her legs were long and graceful , her hips just beginning to round a little and her breasts came full and round against her little girl 's bathing suit , more like a sixteen-yearold 's . " May I , Mother ? " Rina asked . " You may , " Geraldine nodded . " But be careful , dear , do n't swim too far out . I do n't want you to tire yourself . " But Rina was already gone . Geraldine Marlowe half smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like none of the other girls Geraldine knew . Rina did n't play like a girl . She could swim and outrun any of the boys that Laddie played with and they knew it . She did n't pretend to be afraid of the water or hide from the sun . She just did n't care whether her skin was soft and white . Harrison Marlowe looked up from his paper . " I have to go up to the city tomorrow . We 're closing the Standish loan . " " Yes , dear . " The faint , shrill voices of the children floated lazily back toward them . " We 'll have to do something about Rina , " she said thoughtfully . " Rina ? " he questioned . " What about Rina ? " She turned to him . " Have n't you noticed ? Our little girl 's growing up . " He cleared his throat . " Umm  --  yes . But she 's still a baby . " Geraldine Marlowe smiled . It was true what they said about fathers . They spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters . " She 's become a woman in the past year , " she said . His face flushed and he looked down at his paper . In a vague way , he had realized it , but this was the first time they had spoken about it openly . He looked toward the water , trying to find Rina in the screaming , splashing crowd . " Do n't you think we ought to call her back ? It 's dangerous for her to be so far out in the deep water . " Geraldine smiled at him . Poor Harrison . She could read him like a book . It was n't the water he was afraid of , it was the boys . She shook her head . " No . She 's perfectly safe out there . She can swim like a fish . " His embarrassed gaze met her own . " Do n't you think you ought to have a little talk with her ? Maybe explain some things to her . You know , like I did with Laddie two years ago ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her husband , who was usually so sure of himself , positive about his tiniest conviction , flounder around like this . " Do n't be silly , Harry . " She laughed . " There 's  | nothing I have to explain to her now . When a thing like that happens , it 's just natural to tell her everything she should know . " " Oh , " he said in a relieved voice . She turned thoughtful again . " I think Rina 's going to be one of those lucky children who make the transition from adolescence without any of the embarrassing stages , " she said . " There 's not the slightest trace of gawkiness about her and her skin is as clear as a bell . Not a sign of a blemish or a pimple . Not like Laddie at all . " She turned back toward the ocean . " Just the same , I think we 'd better do something about Rina . I 'd better get her some brassieres . " Marlowe did n't speak . She turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as large as mine already . I do hope it does n't get too big . She 's going to be a very beautiful girl . " He smiled slowly . " Why should n't she be ? " She reached for his hand , quietly returning his smile . They both knew what he meant . Neither of them ever thought of Rina as anything but their own natural child . " Would you mind very much if I came into town with you tonight ? " she asked softly . " It would be nice to stay in a hotel for one evening . " He pressed her hand . " I think it would be very nice . " " Molly could look after the children , " she said . " And I 'd have time to do a little shopping tomorrow before we return . " , He looked at her and grinned . " I agree with you , " he said in a mocksolemn voice . " The cottage down here is a little crowded . I 'll call the hotel and make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment we arrive . " She dropped his hand . " You lecher ! " she exclaimed , laughing . Rina swam with easy , purposeful strokes , her eyes fixed on the diving raft out past the rolling surf . Laddie should be out there with his friend Tommy Randall . She came up out of the water almost at their feet . The boys were stretched out on their backs , faces up to the sun , and they sat up as Rina began to climb the ladder . Laddie 's face showed his annoyance at her invasion of their sanctum . " Why do n't you stay back there with the girls ? " " I 've got as much right out here as you have , " she retorted , after catching her breath , straightening the shoulder straps of her too-small bathing suit . " Aw , go on , " Tommy said , looking up . " Let her stay . " Rina glanced at him swiftly from the corners of her eyes and saw his  | gaze fixed on her partly revealed breasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn into a woman . Now even Laddie was staring at her with a curious look she had never before noticed in his eyes . Instinctively she let her hands fall to her sides . If that was all it took to make them accept her , let them look . She sat down opposite them , still feeling their gaze on her . A dull ache began to throb in her breasts and she looked down at r. herself . Her nipples were clearly limned against the black jersey of her bathing suit . She looked up again at the boys . They were staring at her quite openly now . " What are you looking at ? " The two boys exchanged quick , embarrassed glances and immediately looked away . Tommy fixed his eyes out over the water and Laddie looked down at the raft . She stared at Laddie . " Well ? " The red flush crept up from Laddie 's throat . " I saw you . You both were looking at my chest ! " she said accusingly . The boys again exchanged quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Tommy , " he said . " It 's getting too crowded out here ! " He dove from the raft and a moment later , his friend followed . Rina watched them swimming toward the shore for a moment , then stretched back on the raft and stared up into the bright sky . Boys were strange creatures , she thought . The tight bathing suit cut into her breasts . She shrugged her shoulders and her breasts leaped free of the encumbering suit . She looked down at herself . They were white against the dark tan of her arms and throat and the nipples were flushed and pink and fuller than she had ever seen them before . Tentatively she touched them with her fingertips . They were hard as tiny pebbles and a warm , pleasant kind of pain flashed through them . The warmth of the sun began to fill them with a sweet , gentle ache . Slowly she began to massage the ache away and gradually the warmth spilled from her breasts down into her body . She felt herself go hazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RINA STOOD IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND ADJUSTED THE straps on the brassiere . She took a deep breath . She turned to her mother , sitting on the bed behind her . " There , Mother , " she said proudly . " How does it look ? " Geraldine looked at her daughter doubtfully . " Perhaps if you moved it to the last hook , " she said hesitantly and delicately . " I tried , Mother , " Rina answered . " But I ca n't wear it like that . It cuts into me . " Geraldine nodded . Next time , she would get a larger size but who ever would have thought a thirty-four would be so tight on such a slender frame ? Rina turned back to the mirror and looked at herself with satisfaction . Now she was beginning to look outside more like she felt inside . She noticed her mother watching her in the mirror . " Do you think I could get some new bathing suits too , Mother ? " she asked . " The ones I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just thinking that , " her mother answered . " And some new dresses , too . Maybe Daddy will drive us down to Hyannis Port after breakfast . " Rina flashed a happy grin and ran to her mother . She threw her arms around her . " Oh , thank you , Mother ! " she cried happily . Geraldine drew Rina 's head down to her breast . She kissed the top of the white-blond head and turned the child 's tanned face up to hers . She looked down into Rina 's eyes , her fingers lightly stroking her daughter 's cheek . " What is happening to my little girl ? " she asked almost sadly . Rina caught her mother 's hand and kissed her open palm . " Nothing , Mother , " she said with the sureness and confidence that was to become an integral part of her . " Nothing but what you told me . I 'm growing up . " Geraldine looked down into her daughter 's face . A sudden mist came into her eyes . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , " she said , pressing Rina 's head closely to her bosom . " We have too few years for childhood . " But Rina scarcely heard her . And if she had , it was doubtful that the words would carry any meaning . For they were only words and words  | were as futile against the strong forces awakening inside her as the waves breaking fruitlessly against the shore outside the window . Laddie turned and swiftly threw the ball to first base . The runner spun and slid back toward safety , his heels kicking up a fine spray of dust . When the dust cleared , they could hear the umpire call , " Yer out ! " and the game was over . The boys clustered about him , pounding his back happily . " Swell game , Laddie ! " " Good pitching ! " Then they dispersed and he and Tommy were alone , threading their way back to the beach . " What yuh Join ' this afternoon ? " Tommy asked . Laddie shrugged his shoulders . " Nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mahoney hit for a home run . He should never have let the ball get away from him like that . He had to do better if he wanted to make the varsity team at Barrington the next spring . He made up his mind to spend an hour every afternoon pitching into a barrel . They said that was how Walter Johnson had developed his control . " The Bijou 's got a new Hoot Gibson picture , " Tommy said . " I saw it back in Boston . " Laddie looked at his friend . " When 's Joan coming down again ? " " My cousin ? " Tommy asked . " Yuh know anyone else by that name ? " Laddie asked sarcastically . " Maybe this weekend , " Tommy answered . " Then maybe we 'll take her to the movies , " Laddie said . " Big deal ! " Tommy snorted . " It 's O.K. for you but what about me ? It 's no fun sitting next to you and watching you cop feels . Who 'm I goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Laddie answered . Tommy walked along for a moment , then snapped his fingers . " I got it ! " he said excitedly . " Who ? " " Your sister . Rina . " " Rina ? " Laddie said . " She 's just a kid . " Tommy laughed . " She ai n't such a kid . They 're really poppin ' out on her . They look even bigger lately than when we seen ' em on the raft a couple weeks ago . " " But she 's only thirteen , " Laddie said . " My cousin Joan 's only fourteen now . She was thirteen last summer when you were nuzzlin ' her on the back porch . " Laddie looked at him . Maybe Tommy was right . Rina was growing up .  | He shrugged his shoulders . " O.K. , " he said finally . " You ask her . It wo n't do any good , though . I do n't think my mother will let her go . " " She will if you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' in to shower an ' put on my suit , " Laddie said . " I 'll meet yuh on the beach . " " O.K. , " Tommy answered . " See yuh . " The cottage was cool and silent after the heat and noise at the game . Slowly Laddie walked through to the kitchen . " Molly ? " he called . There was no answer and he remembered it was Thursday , Molly 's day off . He heard a noise upstairs and walked over to the staircase . " Mother ? " Rina 's voice came down to him . " They drove down to Hyannis Port to have dinner with some people . " " Oh , " he said . He went back into the kitchen and opened the icebox . He took out a bottle of milk and a piece of chocolate cake and put them on the table . He drank the milk from the bottle and ate the cake with his fingers . It was n't until after he had finished that he remembered he 'd promised himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin would clear up . He sat there in a kind of lethargy . He heard the bathroom door slam and footsteps leading back to Rina 's room . Idly he wondered what she was doing home at this time of the afternoon . Usually she was down at the beach already with her giggling bunch of silly girl friends . Maybe Tommy was right . She was growing up . Certainly the way she brazenly sat there on the raft with her boobs half hanging out and letting them goggle at her did n't make her seem like a kid . Tommy was right about one thing , though . They were bigger than his cousin 's . A picture of Rina sitting on the raft flashed through his mind : the way she looked at them while they looked at her ; her hair falling wet and straight to her shoulders , her lower lip pouting and kind of heavy . He felt a familiar heat surge through him . He half groaned aloud . Oh , no , not again . He 'd promised himself after the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet abruptly . He would n't do it this time . He picked up the empty plate and put it in the sink , then walked out of the kitchen and started up the stairs . He 'd grab a cold shower and then beat it out to the beach . Rina 's room was opposite the head of the staircase and the door was partly open . He was almost halfway up when the light spilling from her room caught his eye . There was a movement inside the room and he stopped on the staircase , his heart pounding . Slowly he sank to his knees so that only his eyes were above the top of the landing . Rina had just crossed the room and was standing in front of the mirror ,  | her back to the door , clad only in a brassiere and a pair of bloomers . While he watched she reached behind her and unfastened the brassiere , then , half turning , stepped out of the bloomers . Holding them in her hand , she crossed the room and came back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in front of the mirror and stepped into the suit . Slowly she pulled it up over her breasts and straightened the shoulder straps . He felt faint beads of perspiration across his forehead . This was the first time he had ever seen a grown-up girl completely naked . He had never thought they could be so beautiful and exciting . Walking quietly , he passed her room and went into his own . He closed the door and sank , still trembling , to the bed . For a long moment , he sat there , the pain of the heat surging inside him bending him almost double . Slowly he reasoned with himself . No . He must n't . Not again . If he gave in to it now , he would always give in to it . At last , he began to feel better . He wiped his forehead with his arm and got to his feet . All you needed was a little self-control and determination . He began to feel proud of himself . What he had to do was remove himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the French pictures he had bought from the candy store down in Lobstertown . Quickly he opened a dresser drawer and burrowing underneath a broken slat , came out with the pictures . He placed them on the dresser drawer face down . He would n't even look at them one last time . He 'd flush them down the toilet when he went in to take his shower . He undressed rapidly and put on his bathrobe . He walked back to the dresser and caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror . It was filled with a noble resolve . It was amazing how quickly resolution could reflect itself . He turned and left the room , forgetting the pictures that lay on the dresser . He was drying himself in front of the mirror when he heard her footsteps turn down the hall to his room . Suddenly , he froze as he remembered . The pictures were still on the dresser . He grabbed for the bathrobe on the door behind him . It was too late . When he got to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand . She looked up at him in surprise . " Laddie , where did you get these pictures ? " she asked , a curious excitement in her voice . " Give them to me ! " he demanded , walking toward her . " I will not ! " she retorted , turning her back to him . " I have n't finished looking at them yet . " Lithely she spun away from his outstretched hand , across the room to  | the far side of the bed . " Let me finish , " she said calmly . " Then you can have them back . " " No ! " he shouted hoarsely , flinging himself across the bed at her . She turned to avoid his grasp but his hand caught her shoulder . The pictures flew from her hand as she fell to the bed beside him . She reached for the pictures . His hand caught at her shoulder strap to keep her from getting them , and the strap broke in his hand . He froze suddenly , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You broke my strap , " she said quietly , making no move to cover herself , her eyes watching his face . He did n't answer . She smiled slowly and raised her hand to her breast , rubbing her palm gently across the nipple . " I 'm just as pretty as any of the girls in those pictures , are n't I ? " He was fascinated , unable to speak , his eyes following the deliberate movement of her hand . " Are n't I ? " she asked again . " You can tell me . I wo n't tell anyone . Why do you think I let you watch while I was undress-ing ? " " You knew I was watching ? " he asked in surprise . She laughed . " Of course , stupid . I could see you in the mirror . I almost burst out laughing . I thought your eyes would pop out of your head . " He could feel the tension begin to build up inside him . " I do n't think that 's funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I like you to look at me . I wish everybody could . " " That 's not right , " he said . " Why is n't it ? " she demanded . " What 's wrong with it ? I like to look at you , why should n't you look at me ? " " But you never did , " he said quickly . A secret smile came to her lips . " Oh , yes I did . " " You did ? When ? " " The other afternoon when you came back from the beach . There was no one home and I watched you through the bathroom window . I saw everything you did . " " Everything ? " The word escaped from him in a groan of dismay . " Everything , " she said smugly . " You were exercising your muscle . " Her eyes looked into his . " I never knew it could get so big . I always thought it was little and kind of droopy like it was when you were a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hardly speak . He began to get up from the bed . " I think you better get out of here , " he said hoarsely.  | She looked up at him , still smiling . " Would you like to look at me again ? " He did n't answer . Her hand reached up and took down the other shoulder strap . She wriggled out of her bathing suit . He stared down at her naked body , feeling his legs begin to tremble . He saw her eyes move down over him . His bathrobe hung open . He looked at her again . " Now take off your bathrobe and let me see all of you , " she said . As if in a daze , he let the bathrobe slip to the floor . With a groan , he sank to his knees beside the bed , holding himself . Quickly she rolled across the bed and looked down at him . A faint sound of triumph came into her voice . " Now , " she said , " you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch her breast . She let it rest there for a moment , then suddenly moved away from him . " No ! " she said sharply . " Do n't touch me ! " He stared at her dumbly , the agony pouring through him in waves . Her heavy-lidded eyes watched him . " Do it for me , " she said in a husky voice . " And I 'll do it for you . But do n't touch me ! " 6 ALL THROUGH THE MOVIE , LADDIE COULD HEAR THEM GIGGLING and whispering . He could imagine what they were doing in the darkened theater , even though he could n't see . His mind flamed with visions . Now Tommy was offering Rina a gumdrop . He could see him casually holding the bag toward her , the back of his hand seemingly accidentally pressing against her breast . Laddie shifted restlessly in his seat , trying to pierce the dark out of the corner of his eye , but it was a waste of time . He could n't see anything . " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the darkness . " What ? " he asked , startled for a moment . " Yeah . Sure . " He held the bag toward her . She turned as she helped herself from the bag and he felt the soft press of her breasts . But it served only to remind him of Rina . He sank back into his seat unhappily .  | They stopped in front of Tommy 's cottage on the way home . " How about some pop ? " Joan asked . " We 've got a big bottle in the icebox . " Laddie shook his head . " No , thanks , " he said quickly . " It 's almost eight o'clock and I promised Mother we 'd be home before dark . " Rina did n't say anything . " Maybe you could come over later ? " Joan asked . " After you 've taken Rina home ? " Rina looked at him . He flushed . " I do n't think so , " he answered . " I 'm pretty tired . I wanted to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , then silently turned and walked into the cottage . There was an awkward moment until Tommy spoke . " Well , good night , then , " he said . " See yuh on the beach tomorrow . " They walked the rest of the way home in silence . It was already dark when they climbed up the steps to the porch . He opened the screen door and held it for her . She started to enter the house , then stopped when she saw he made no move to follow her . " Are n't you coming in ? " He shook his head . " Not right now . I think I 'll stay out for a little while . " " I think I will , too , " she said quickly , stepping back onto the porch . He let the screen door swing shut . Its clatter echoed through the house . " Is that you , children ? " Geraldine Marlowe called . " Yes , Mother , " Rina answered . She glanced quickly at Laddie . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's so hot tonight . " " All right . But only for half an hour , Rina . I want you in bed by eight thirty . " " O.K. , Mother . " Laddie crossed the porch and sat down on the large wicker chaise . Rina followed and sat down beside him . " Why did Joan want you to come back ? " she asked suddenly . He did n't look at her . " I du n no . " " Did she want you to do it for her ? " " Of course not ! " he said indignantly . " I do n't like Joan , " she said suddenly . " She 's a  --  she 's a hyp  --  a hypo ? " " A hypocrite . " He supplied the word for her , surprised by the unexpected depth of her perception . " What makes you say that ? " " Tommy wanted me to touch him in the movies , but when I would n't , he took Joan 's hand and she did . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right . The little bitch was a hypocrite.  | " And she never even looked at him once , " Rina continued . " She was always looking at the screen and once she even asked you for some candy . " He stared at her wonderingly . " I wonder if they 're doing it now , " she said thoughtfully . A picture of Joan and Tommy flashed through his mind . He began to get excited . " I 'm not a hypocrite , am I ? " she asked . A slow smile came to her lips . She moved and he felt her fingers brush across his thigh . She looked into his face . " Would you like to do it now ? " she whispered . " Now ? " he said in a stunned voice . He glanced over his shoulder back to the house . " They wo n't come out , " she said quietly . " Father is reading his newspaper and Mother is knitting . I saw them through the doorway . " " But ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , her fingers taking the handkerchief from his breast pocket . Geraldine looked up at the mantel clock . It was just eight thirty . She heard the screen door slam and Rina came into the room . Her daughter 's eyes were bright and shining and her face wore a happy smile . The smile was infectious and Geraldine smiled back at her . " Did you have a goodtime at the movies , dear ? " Rina nodded . " A wonderful time , Mother , " she said excitedly . " It was such fun . You do n't know how great it is to be able to see a picture without all those brats squalling and running up and down the aisles like they do in the afternoons . " Geraldine laughed . " It was only yesterday that you were one of those brats . " Rina 's face suddenly turned serious . " But I 'm not any more , am I , Mother ? " Geraldine nodded her head gently . " No , darling . You 're quite grown up now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , " she said gaily . " I 'm quite grown up now . " Geraldine laughed . " Now up to bed with you , young lady . You still need your rest . " " O.K. , Mother . " Rina bent over her and quickly kissed her cheek . " Good night . " She crossed the room and kissed her father 's cheek . " Good night , Father . "  | She ran out of the room and they could hear her feet running up the stairs . Harrison Marlowe lowered his paper . " She seems quite happy . " " Why should n't she be ? " Geraldine said . " Her first date . Every girl is excited after her first date . " He put down the paper . " What do you say we go out on the porch for a bit of air ? " 11 They came out into the night . " Laddie ? " she called . " Over here , Mother . " She turned and saw him rising from the chaise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he said shortly . " Rina was n't any bother , was she ? " " No . " " You do n't sound happy about having to take her with you . " " It was O.K. , Mother , " he said tensely . " Sometimes , son , " his father said , " we have to do things even if we do n't like it . One of them is looking after your sister . That 's a brother 's job . " " I said it was all right , Father , " he snapped . " Laddie ! " his mother exclaimed in surprise . Laddie looked down at the floor . " I 'm sorry , Father , " he said in a low voice . She moved over and looked into his face . " Are you feeling all right , Laddie ? " she asked with concern . " You look flushed and warm to me and your face is all perspired . Here , let me wipe it for you . " Her hand sought his breast-pocket handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief ? I saw it in your pocket when you left . " For a moment there was something in his eyes that reminded her of a stricken animal , then it was gone . " I  --  I guess I lost it , " he stammered . She touched his forehead . " Are you sure you have n't a fever ? " " I think you 'd better go up to bed , son , " his father said . " Yes , Father . " He turned to his mother and kissed her . " Good night , " he said and went quickly into the house . " I wonder what 's the matter with him ? " ' Harrison Marlowe snorted . " I know what 's the matter with him . " " You do ? " He nodded . " He 's spoiled , that 's what . He 's so used to having everything the way he wants it , he sulks when he has to do a little thing like chaperon his sister . He 's angry because he could n't sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cousin Joan . " " Harry , you 're being horrid ! "  | " No I 'm not , " he said . " Take it from me . I know boys . What he needs is a little discipline . " He began to pack his pipe . " And you 're doing the same with Rina . Giving her everything she wants . She 'll be spoiled soon , too . " " I know what 's bothering you , " she said . " You just do n't like the idea of them growing up . You 'd like to keep them children forever . " " No . But you have to admit they are spoiled . " " Maybe they are a little , " she admitted . He smiled . " Well , anyway , it 's a good thing they 'll be going back to school next month . Barrington 's good for Laddie . " " Yes , " she agreed . " And I 'm glad Rina 's been accepted at Jane Vincent 's school . They 'll make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a summer of pain and torture , of wild physical sensation and excruciating , conscience-stricken agonies . He could n't sleep , he could n't eat , he was afraid to look at her in the mornings and then , when he saw her , he could n't bear to let her out of his sight . Jealous tortures flamed inside him when he saw her smiling or talking to other boys . Visions born of his knowledge of her would fill his mind and he could see them with her the way he had been . An uneasy , frightened contentment would steal through him when they were together . And lurking all the while in the deep recesses of his mind was the fear ? the fear of discovery , the fear of seeing the hurt and shock and loathing come to the faces of his parents once they knew . But when she looked at him , smiled at him , touched him , all that was suddenly gone and he would do anything in the world to please her . He abased himself , groveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the fear would return . Because there was no escaping the fact . She was his sister . It was wrong . It was with a feeling of relief that he saw the crazy summer come to an end . It was over , he thought . Away from her , he would be able to find himself again , to control the fevers that she set raging in his blood . When they would come again to the beach next summer , it would be different . He would be different , she would be different . No more , he would say to her . No more . It 's wrong . That was what he believed when he returned to school at the end of that summer .  | " I 'M PREGNANT , " SHE SAID . " I 'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY . " Laddie felt a dull ache spread over him . Somehow , this was the way he 'd always known it would turn out . Ever since that first summer two years ago . He looked up at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know ? " She spoke quietly , as if she were just talking about the weather . " I 'm late , " she said simply . " I 've never been late before . " He looked down at his hands . They were sun-darkened against the white sand . " What are you going to do ? " " I do n't know , " she answered . Her white-blond hair glittered in the sunlight as she turned and looked out at the ocean . " If nothing happens by tomorrow , I guess I 'll have to tell Mother . " " Will you  --  will you tell her about us ? " " No , " she said swiftly , in a low voice . She picked the next question from his lips . " I 'll tell her it was Tommy , or Bill , or Joe , " she answered , still not looking at him . Despite himself , he felt a twinge of jealousy . " Did you  --  with all of them ? " he asked hesitantly . Her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said emphatically . " Of course not . Only with you . " " What if she talks to them ? Then she 'll know you 're lying . " " She wo n't , " Rina said positively . " Especially when I tell her I do n't know which one it was . " He stared at her . In so many ways , she was older than he . " What do you think she 'll do ? " Rina shrugged her shoulders . " I do n't know . There 's not very much she can do , I guess . " He watched her walk down the beach to meet some friends , then rolled over in the sand and placed his head on his arms . He groaned aloud . It had happened . Somewhere in the back of his mind he had always known it would . He remembered the night just a few short weeks ago . 11 They had come down to the beach that summer as they did every year . But this time , it was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he had told her , too .  | " No more , " he said . " It 's stupid , it 's kid stuff . You stick to your friends and I 'll stick to mine . We 'll only get in trouble if we keep it up . " She had agreed . Even promised . And he had to admit she had kept her word . It was he who had broken his vow . And all because of that damned bottle of orange pop . It had been a rainy afternoon and they were alone in the cottage . It was hot and humid and the air clung heavily to his body , sheathing it in an invisible choking blanket . His shirt and trousers were wringing with perspiration when he went into the kitchen . He opened the icebox but the usual bottle of orange pop he kept there was gone . He closed the icebox door angrily . He went upstairs and past her open door before his mind absorbed what his eyes had seen . He walked back and stood in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclining , the bottle of orange pop in her hand . She was staring at it intently . He felt the pulse begin to hammer in his head , the perspiration break out anew beneath his clothing . " What are you doing with my orange pop ? " he asked . He knew he sounded stupid , even as he spoke . She moved her head slightly on the pillow and looked at him . Her eyes were heavy-lidded and hazy . " Drinking it , " she answered huskily , putting it to her mouth . " What do you think ? " The soda overflowed her mouth and ran in orange driblets down her cheeks , across her breasts to the convex of her belly and onto the white sheet . She smiled at him and held out the bottle . " Want some ? " As if he were someone else , he saw himself cross the room and lift the bottle to his lips . It was warm from her touch . He felt the sweetness of the liquid spill into his mouth . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're excited , " she said softly . " And you said you would n't be any more . But you are . " Some of the orange soda spilled down across his shirt as he suddenly realized he had betrayed himself . He turned to go but her hand caught him around the thigh . He almost screamed with the sudden inflaming agony of her touch . " Just this once more , " she whispered . " And then never again . " He stood frozen , afraid to move , afraid he would stumble and fall because of the trembling within him . " No , " he said hoarsely . " Please , " she whispered , her fingers opening , searching . He stood there as if paralyzed . An anguished moan came from deep within him . There would be no more of this , no more humiliation , no more groveling before her . This time she would learn to leave him alone . With one hand , he seized her wrists and bent her back to the bed . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him . Suddenly , he pressed his lips to hers . Her mouth was warm and moist and still tasted of the orange soda . Then he moved his head and his lips were traveling down her body , across her throat , over her breasts . It was then she began to fight him . " No ! " she whispered , writhing away from him . " No ! Do n't touch me ! " But he did n't even hear her . He could feel the red rage pumping in his temples ; there was a congestion in his chest . He felt her hand pull loose and rake his chest , leaving a clean , hot path of pain in its wake . Bewildered , he looked down at himself and saw the bloody traces of her fingernails on his flesh . A terrible anger rose up in him . " You cock-teaser ! " he yelled , swinging his free hand . The blow caught her on the side of her face , knocking her back against the bed . She stared up at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , tearing his belt from his trousers . He raised her arms over her head and lashed her wrists to the iron bedpost . He picked up the half-empty bottle from the bed where it had fallen . " Still thirsty ? " She shook her head . He tilted the bottle and began to laugh as the orange soda ran down over her . " Drink ! " he said . " Drink all you can ! " The bottle flew from his hands as she kicked it away . He caught at her legs and pinned them against the bed with his knees . He laughed wildly . " Now , my darling little sister , there 'll be no more games . " " No more games , " she gasped , staring up into his eyes . His face came down and his mouth covered hers . She felt herself begin to relax . Then the fierce , sharp pain penetrated her body . She screamed . His hand came down heavily over her mouth , as again and again the pain ripped through her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , screaming silently in the confines of her throat , and the ugliness and horror of his body on her own . Laddie rolled over on the sand . It was all over now . Tomorrow his mother would know . And it would be his fault . They would blame him and they would be right . No matter what , he should n't have let it happen . A shadow fell across him and he looked up . Rina was standing there . She dropped to the sand beside him . " What are we going to do ? " " I do n't know , " he said dully . She reached a hand out to his . " I should n't have let you do it , " she whispered .  | " You could n't have stopped me , " he said . " I must have been crazy . " He looked at her . " If we were anybody else , we could run away and get married . " " I know . " His voice turned bitter . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only they had n't adopted ? " " But they did , " Rina said quickly , and with a sure knowledge . " Besides , we ca n't blame it on them . It was n't their fault . " She felt the tears come into her eyes . She sat there silently as they rolled down her cheeks . " Do n't cry . " " I  --  I ca n't help it , " she whispered . " I 'm scared . " " I am , too , " he said . " But crying wo n't help . " The tears kept rolling silently down her cheeks . After a moment , she heard his voice . She looked at him . His lips moved awkwardly . " Even if you are my sister , you know that I love you ? " She did n't answer . " I 've always loved you , I guess . I could n't help it . Somehow , the other girls were nothing when I compared them with you . " " I guess the reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls you went with , " she confessed . " I did n't want them to have you . That 's why I did what I did . I could n't let any other boy touch me . I could n't stand them . " His hand tightened on her fingers . " Maybe it 'll turn out all right yet , " he said , trying for reassurance . " Maybe , " she said , a dull hopelessness in her voice . Then they ran out of language and they turned and watched the surf run away with their childhood . Laddie sat at the helm of his small sailboat and watched his mother in the bow . He felt a gust of wind take the sail and automatically he compensated for the drift while scanning the sky . There were squall clouds coming up ahead . Time to head for the dock . Slowly he began to come about . " ' Riming back ? " he heard his mother call . " Yes , Mother , " he replied . It seemed strange to have her aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as if she had sensed there was something troubling him . " You 've been pretty quiet this morning , " she said . He did n't meet her gaze . " I have to concentrate on the boat , Mother . " " I do n't know what 's the matter with you children , " she said . " You 're both so moody lately . "  | He did n't answer . He kept his eyes on the squall clouds up ahead . He thought about Rina . Then himself . Then his parents . A sorrow began to well up inside him . He felt his eyes begin to burn and smart . His mother 's voice was shocked . " Why , Laddie , you 're crying ! " Then the dam broke and the sobs racked his chest . He felt his mother 's hand draw his head down to her breast as she had done so often when he was a baby . " What 's the matter , Laddie ? What 's wrong ? " she asked softly . " Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing . " She stroked his head gently . " Something is wrong , " she said softly . " I know there is . You can tell me , Laddie . Whatever it is , you can tell me . I 'll understand and try to help . " " There 's nothing you can do , " he cried . " Nothing anybody can do now ! " " Try me and see . " He did n't speak , his eyes searching her face for something , she did n't know what . A curious dread came into her . " Has it ? is it something to do with Rina ? " It was as if the muscles that held his face together all dissolved at once . " Yes , yes ! " he cried . " She 's going to have a baby ! My baby , Mother , " he added through tight lips . " I raped her , she 's going to have my baby ! " " Oh , no ! " " Yes , Mother , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her eyes and she covered her face with her hands . This could n't happen to her children . Not her children . She had wanted everything for them , given them everything . After a moment , she regained control of herself . " I think we 'd better turn back , " she managed to say quietly . " We are , Mother , " he said . He looked down at his hands on the tiller . The words slipped from him now . " I do n't know what got into me , Mother . " He stared at her with agonized eyes , his voice strained and tense . " But growing up is n't what it 's cracked up to be , it 's not what it says in books . Growing up 's such a crock of shit ! " He stopped in shock at his own language . " I 'm sorry , Mother . " " It 's all right , son . " They were silent for a moment and the waves slapped wildly against the hull of the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , raising his voice . " She 's only a kid . Whatever happened was my fault . " She looked up at her son . A glimmer of intuition pierced the gray veil that seemed to have fallen in front of her eyes . " Rina 's a very beautiful girl , Laddie , " she said . " I think anyone would find it difficult not to love your sister . "  | Laddie met his mother 's eyes . " I love her , Mother , " he said quietly . " And she really is n't my sister . " Geraldine did n't speak . " Is it terribly wrong to say that , Mother ? " he asked . " I do n't love her like a sister . I love her " ? he searched for a word ? " different . " Different , Geraldine thought . It was as good a word as any . " Is it terribly wrong , Mother ? " Laddie asked again . She looked at her son , feeling a sorrow for him that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said quietly . " It 's just one of those things that ca n't be helped . " He took a deep breath , beginning to feel better . At least she understood , she had n't condemned him . " What are we going to do , Mother ? " he asked . She looked into his eyes . " The first thing we have to do is let Rina know we understand . The poor child must be frightened out of her mind . " He reached forward and took his mother 's hand , pressing it to his lips . " You 're so good to us , Mother , " he whispered , looking gratefully into her eyes . They were the last words he ever spoke . For just at that moment , the squall came roaring in from the starboard side and capsized the boat . Rina watched stolidly as the lobstermen brought the pitifully small bodies to the shore and laid them on the beach . She looked down at them . Laddie and Mother . A vague spinning began to roar inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled over , sinking to her knees in the sand beside the still figures . She closed her eyes , weeping as a terrible moisture began to seep from her . 8 MARGARET BRADLEY LOOKED DOWN WEARILY AT THE PAPERS on her desk . They were covered with the hen-tracked hieroglyphics of the girls who trooped through her science classes . Abruptly she pushed them to one side and got to her feet . She walked over to the window and looked out restlessly . She was bored , tired of the never-ending , day-in , day-out routine .  | Looking out into the gray dusk of evening , she wondered why Sally 's letter had n't arrived yet . It had been more than two weeks since she 'd heard from her and usually letters came regularly twice a week . Could it be that Sally had found someone else ? Another friend with whom she 1 II could share those intimate whispered secrets ? There was a hesitant knock at the door and she turned toward it . " Yes ? " " A special-delivery letter for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , the porter . Quickly she opened the door and took the letter . " Thank you very much , Thomas , " she said , closing the door . She leaned against it , looking down at the letter in her hand . She began II ' to feel brighter . It was Sally 's handwriting . She crossed to her desk and rapidly tore open the envelope . Dear Peggy , Yesterday I was married . The knock at the door was so low that at first she did not hear it . It came again , a little louder this time . She raised her head from the desk . " Who is it ? " she called in her husky voice . " Rina Marlowe , Miss Bradley . May I see you for a moment ? " Wearily the teacher got to her feet . " Just a moment , " she called . She walked into the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror . Her eyes were red-rimmed and swollen , her lipstick slightly smeared . She looked older than her twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-up from her face with a washcloth . She stared at herself . For ten years , she and Sally had been inseparable . Now it was over . She replaced the washcloth on the rack and walked out to the door . " Come in , " she said , opening it . Rina looked into the teacher 's face . Miss Bradley looked as if she had been crying . " I 'm sorry if I disturbed you , " she said . " I can come back later if you like . " The teacher shook her head . " No , that 's all right , " she answered . She crossed to the small desk and sat down behind it . " What is it ? " Rina shut the door behind her slowly . " I was wondering if I could be excused from the dance Saturday night ? " Margaret Bradley stared at her . For a moment , she could n't believe her ears . Missing the monthly dance was considered the ultimate punishment . The girls would do anything rather than lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allowed within the confines of the school . " I do n't understand , " she said . Rina looked down at the floor . " I just do n't want to go , that 's all . " It was n't because the boys did n't like her . The teacher knew it was quite the opposite . The slim , blond sixteen-year-old standing before her was surrounded by boys at every dance . She came from a good family . The Marlowes were well known in Boston . Her father was a banker , a widower . " That 's a rather strange request , " she said . " You must have a reason . " Rina still looked down at the floor . She did n't answer . Margaret Bradley forced a smile to her lips . " Come now , " she said in a friendly voice . " You can talk to me . I 'm not that much older than you that I would n't understand . " Rina looked up at her and she was surprised by the deep revelation of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she looked down at the floor again . The teacher got up and walked around the desk . She took Rina 's hand and led ' her to a seat . " You 're afraid of something , " she said gently . " I ca n't stand them touching me , " she whispered . " Them ? " Margaret Bradley asked , her voice puzzled . " Who ? " " Boys . They all want to touch me and my skin creeps . " Rina looked up suddenly . " It would be all right if they just wanted to dance or to talk but they 're always trying to get you alone someplace . " " What boys ? " The teacher 's voice was suddenly harsh . " We 'll soon put a stop to their coming here . " Rina got up suddenly . " I 'd better go , " she said nervously . " I did n't think it would work , anyway . " She started for the door . " Wait a minute ! " Margaret Bradley 's voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did any of them do more than  --  than just touch you ? " Rina shook her head . " How old are you ? " " Sixteen , " Rina answered . " I guess by now you know that boys are always like that . " Rina nodded . " I felt the same way when I was your age . " " You did ? " Rina asked . A note of relief came into her voice . " I thought I was the only one . None of the other girls feel the way I do . " " They 're fools ! " The teacher 's voice was full of a harsh anger , but she checked herself sharply . There was no sense in allowing her bitterness to  | expose her . " I was just going to make myself a cup of tea , " she said . " Would you care to join me ? " Rina hesitated . " If it would n't be too much trouble . " " It wo n't be any trouble at all , " Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make yourself comfortable . I 'll have the tea ready in a minute . " She went into the small kitchenette . To her surprise , she found herself humming as she turned on the burner beneath the teakettle . " I think a summer in Europe between now and the time she goes to Smith in the fall would be of great benefit to her , " Margaret Bradley said . Harrison Marlowe leaned back in his chair and looked at the teacher across the white expanse of the dinner table , then at Rina , seated opposite her . What he saw inspired a kind of confidence in him . A plain , not unattractive young woman in her late twenties , he imagined . She wore simple , tailored clothes , almost mannish in their effect , that seemed to proclaim her profession . She had none of the foolish mannerisms that so many of the young women had today . There was nothing of the flapper about her . She was very serious and businesslike . " Her mother and I often spoke about Rina going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl is considered quite finished if she has n't spent some time there , " the teacher said assuredly . Marlowe nodded slowly . It was a great responsibility bringing up a daughter . Somehow he had never realized it until several months ago , when he had come into the parlor and found Rina there . She was wearing a dark-blue dress that somehow made her seem older than her years . Her white-blond hair shone in the semidimness . " Hello , Father . " " Rina ! " he exclaimed . " What are you doing home ? " " I got to thinking how awful it must be for you to come into this great big empty house and find yourself all alone , " she said , " so I thought I 'd take a few days off from school . " " But  --  but what about your studies ? " he asked . " I can make them up easily enough . " " But ? " " Are n't you glad to see me , Father ? " she asked , interrupting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then why do n't you kiss me ? " She turned her cheek toward him . He kissed her cheek . As he straightened up , she held him with her arm . " Now I 'll kiss you . "  | She kissed him on the mouth and her lips were warm . Then she laughed suddenly . " Your mustache tickles ! " He smiled down at her . " You always said that , " he said fondly . " Ever since you were a little girl . " " But I 'm not a little girl any longer , am I , Father ? " He looked at her , beautiful , almost a woman in her dark-blue dress . " I guess not , " he said . She turned to the sideboard . " I thought you might like a drink before dinner . " The bottles of liquor were all ready for him . He walked over to the sideboard . She even had cracked ice in the bucket . " What 's for dinner ? " he asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes . " " Good , " he said , reaching for a bottle of whisky . Her voice stopped his hand . " Would n't you like a Martini ? You have n't had one for a long time . " He hesitated a moment , then reached for the bottle of gin . It was n't until he turned around that he realized there were two cocktails in his h  --  nd . Habit was a strange commander . He turned to put one of them back on the sideboard . " May I , Father ? I 'm past sixteen . There are many girls at school whose parents allow them a cocktail at dinner . " He stared at her , then poured half of one drink back into the shaker . He gave her the half-filled glass . He raised his glass in a toast . She smiled , sipping delicately at her glass . " This is delicious , " she said , in exactly the same words and tone of voice he had so often heard his wife use . He felt the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly so that she would not see . Her hand caught at his sleeve and he turned back to her . Her eyes were deep with sympathy . He let her draw him down slowly to the couch beside her . And then , for a moment , he was n't her father . He was just a lonely man weeping against the breast of his mother , his wife , his daughter . He felt her young , strong arms around his shoulders , her fingers lightly brushing his hair . He heard the rumble of her whispered voice within her chest . " Poor Daddy , poor Daddy . " As suddenly as it had come , the moment was gone and he was aware only of the firm , taut breasts against his cheek . Self-consciously he raised his head . " I guess I made a fool of myself , " he said awkwardly . " No , Father , " she said quietly . " For the first time in my life , I did n't feel like a child any more . I felt grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile to his lips . " There 's time enough for you to grow up . " Later that night , after dinner , she came over and sat on the arm of his chair . " I 'm not going back to school any more , " she said . " I 'm going to stay home and keep house for you . " He smiled . " You 'd get bored with that quickly enough , " he said . " You 'd miss the excitement of school , of boy friends ? " " Boys ! " she said scornfully . " I can do without them . They 're a bunch of grubby little animals always mooning after you . I ca n't stand them . " " You ca n't , eh ? " he said quizzically . " Just what kind of man would please your majesty ? " She looked down at him seriously . " I think an older man , " she said . " Someone like you , maybe . Someone who makes me feel safe and secure and needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that they 're stronger , more important . " He laughed . " That 's only because they 're young . " " I know , " she answered , still serious . " That 's why they frighten me . They 're only interested in what they want ; they do n't care about me . " She leaned over and kissed the top of his head . " Your hair is so nice with that touch of gray in it . " A note of regret came into her voice . " Too bad I ca n't marry you . I love you , Father . " " No ! " he said sharply , so sharply that he surprised even himself with the inexplicable violence of his reaction . " No what , Father ? " she asked , startled . He got to his feet and stared down at her . " No , you 're not staying home . You 're going back to school tomorrow . I 'll have Peters drive you up . " She stared up at him and her eyes began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl again . " Do n't you love me , Father ? " she cried . " Do n't you want me to stay with you ? " He stared at her for a moment , then compassion filled him . " Of course I love you , darling , " he said quietly . " But do n't you see , we ca n't put ourselves in a shell to protect ourselves from the world around us . " " But all I want is to be with you , Daddy ! " " No , child , no , " he said patiently . " I know that 's the way you feel now but someday , when you 're older , and maybe married with children of your own , you 'll understand . " She tore herself from his arms and faced him angrily . " No ! " she stormed . " I 'll never get married ! I 'll never have children ! I 'll never let some boy get his dirty hands on me ! " " Rina ! " he exclaimed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then her face dissolved into tears again . " Oh , Father ! " she cried in a hurt , broken voice . " Ca n't you see ? It 's not I , it 's you who do n't understand ! " " Rina , darling , " he said , reaching for her . But she had already fled the room . He heard her running footsteps on the staircase , then her door slammed . He came back to the present slowly , looking down the long dining table at the teacher , then at Rina . Her eyes were shining , brightly expectant . " I am sure that if Rina 's mother were alive , Miss Bradley , " Marlowe said in his oddly formal manner , " she would be as happy as I am to entrust our daughter to your very capable hands . " Margaret Bradley looked quickly down at her soup , so that he could not see the sudden triumph in her eyes . " Thank you , Mr. Marlowe , " she said demurely . 9 THEY STAYED ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis Island , until the water was a bottle green beneath the ship and they could no longer see the shore . " Excited ? " Margaret Bradley asked . Rina 's eyes were sparkling . " It 's like a dream . " Margaret smiled . " It will get better and better . Right now we 'd best go down to our cabin and rest up a bit before dinner . " " But I 'm not the least bit tired , " Rina protested . " You will be , " Margaret said firmly but pleasantly . " We 'll be aboard the Leviathan for six days . You 'll have plenty of time to see everything . " She nodded in silent approval as they entered their cabin . Harrison Marlowe was n't cheap when he did something for his daughter . It was a first-class cabin , with twin beds and private bath . He had n't hesitated , either , when she 'd suggested that Rina would need a new wardrobe . Instead , he 'd simply written a check for a thousand dollars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should let him know . They had got only a few things in New York ; the rest they would get in Paris . But without saying anything to Rina , she had ordered several things  | and had them sent directly to the ship . She could n't wait to see the expression on Rina 's face when she saw them . The boxes were on the bed but she did not call attention to them . She wanted the moment to be just right . She took off her light spring coat and sank into a deep , comfortable chair . Opening her purse , she took out a package of cigarettes . It was n't until after she had lit one that she became aware that Rina was staring at her . Then she realized that Rina had never seen her smoke . She held out the package . " Have one ? " Rina hesitated . " Go ahead , " she urged . " It 's all right . You 'll find most European women smoke ; they 're not so provincial as we are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she coughed . " Do n't swallow the smoke . " Rina held the smoke in her mouth and let it out slowly . " How 's that ? " Margaret smiled . " Fine . " " This is fun , Miss Bradley . " Margaret looked at her . " Now that we 're really on our way , I think we can dispense with formalities . From now on , you may call me Peggy . " She got to her feet . " Would you like to bathe first , Rina ? " Rina shook her head . " No , Miss Bradley , you can go first if you like . " Margaret shook her head , smiling . " Peggy . " " I mean Peggy . " " That 's better , " Margaret said . She looked up as Rina came out of the bathroom , tying the belt of her robe . Her long blond hair fell to her shoulders , looking even more silvery against her dark tan . There was a low knock at the door . Rina looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " It 's good for your appetite the first day at sea . I find it helps prevent mal de mer . " She took the tray from the steward and gave one glass to Rina . " Cheers , " she said , smiling and sipping the wine slowly . " It 's nice , " Rina said . " I 'm glad you like it . " Rina put the glass down . " Shall I wear my new blue suit tonight ? " Margaret assumed a shocked expression . " First-class dining is formal , Rina . " " I have a few of my party dresses , " Rina said . " I can wear one of them . " " Not those horrible dresses they wear at the school dances ? "  | A hurt expression appeared on Rina 's face . " I thought they were very pretty . " Margaret laughed . " For children , perhaps . But not for a young lady going to Europe . " " I do n't know what to wear , then , " Rina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those boxes on the bed are yours , " she said casually . " I think you might find something to wear in one of them . " The expression on Rina 's face as she opened the boxes was all that Margaret had hoped for . Rina put on a stark black cocktail gown that clung to her figure , revealing her naked shoulders . As they walked into the dining salon , an hour later , every male eye followed them . Possessively Margaret reached across the table and patted Rina 's hand . " You look lovely , my dear . " Margaret put down the towel and turned to look at herself in the fulllength mirror . Pleased with her reflection , she ran her hands down along her sides , then stretched luxuriously . Her small breasts with their tiny nipples were no larger than many men 's , and her hips were flat and her legs straight . She slipped into the silk pajamas , quickly buttoning the fly front of the long , man-tailored trousers , then fastening the tightly fitting bolero jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once more , she glanced at the mirror . At a quick glance , few could tell her from a male . Pleased , she left the bathroom and entered the stateroom . " You can go in now , Rina . " Rina stared at her in amazement . " Miss Bradley  --  Peggy , I mean ? those pajamas ! " Margaret smiled at her . " Like them ? " Rina nodded . Margaret was pleased . " They 're made of genuine Chinese brocade . A friend sent me the material from San Francisco . I designed them myself . " One thing she could always say for Sally  --  she had good taste . Of all the things she had ever given her , these pajamas were her favorite . Rina got out of her chair and took a cotton nightgown from the bureau . She started for the bathroom . " Wait a minute , " Margaret said . She went to her bureau and took out a small box . " While I was at it , " she said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rina 's face as she opened the box . " They 're real silk ! " " I was afraid that all you had were those horrible school shifts . "  | Rina looked down at the box . " There 's a different color for every night in the week , " she said . " They 're all so beautiful , I do n't know which to wear first . " Margaret smiled again . " Why do n't you wear the white one tonight ? " " O.K. , " Rina said . She picked it up and started again for the bathroom . She stopped at the door . " I do n't know how to thank you , Peggy , " she said gratefully . " You make everything seem so wonderful . " Margaret laughed happily . " That 's just the way I want it to be for you , " she said . She looked at Rina as if the idea had just come to her . " What do you say we celebrate tonight ? While you 're changing , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little party all by ourselves . " " That would be fun . " Rina smiled . " I always wanted to drink champagne but Father would never let me . " " Well , this will be a secret between us . " Margaret laughed , reaching for the telephone . " I promise I wo n't tell him . " Rina put down her glass and began to giggle . Margaret leaned back in her chair , still holding hers by its fragile stem . " What 's funny ? " " My nightgown crinkles and gives off tiny sparks when I move . " " That 's static electricity , " Margaret said . " Silk is a very good conductor . " " I know , " Rina answered quickly . " I remember that from your class . " She ran her hand down along the gown . " It gives off tiny blue sparks . Can you see them ? " " No . " Rina leaped to her feet . " I 'll turn off the lights , " she said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned off the lights and stood in front of Margaret . " Watch , " she said . She ran her hands down the sides of her gown . There was a faint crackling and tiny sparks appeared at her fingertips . Rina picked up her glass and emptied it . She held the glass toward Margaret . " May I have some more , Peggy ? " " Of course , " Margaret answered , refilling her glass . Rina held it to her lips and sipped . " Champagne is nothing but pop made from wine , " she said seriously . " But it tastes better . It 's not as sweet . " " It 's getting warmer in here , do n't you think ? " " It is getting warmer , " Rina answered . " Do you want me to turn on the fan ? "  | " Oh , no , " Margaret said quickly . " We 'd only catch cold in the draft . I 'll just slip off my jacket . " She felt Rina 's eyes on her small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you mind ? " Rina shook her head . She lifted her glass and took another sip . " Do you hear music ? " Margaret nodded . " It 's the orchestra from the ballroom . They 're playing a waltz . " Rina got to her feet . She swayed in time to the music . " I love to dance , " she said . She glided lightly around the room , the white gown flaring out as she turned , showing her long , tanned legs . Margaret felt a weakness in the pit of her stomach as she got to her feet . " I love to dance , too , " she said , making a mock bow . " May I have this dance , Miss Marlowe ? " Rina looked at her , smiling . " Just this one . All the others are taken , Miss Bradley . " Margaret shook a reproachful finger at Rina . " Mr. Bradley , if you please . " Rina laughed . " Of course . Just this one , Mr. Bradley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both laughed as the tiny blue sparks crackled from Rina 's gown . Margaret felt her legs tremble as the warmth from Rina 's breasts came through the gown . Holding the young girl firmly , she led her into the dance . They spun furiously in a circle as the music reached a crescendo , then abruptly halted . Rina looked up into her face . Margaret smiled at her . " We 'd better have some more champagne . " She poured Rina a glass and picked up her own . " You 're a very good dancer , Rina . " " Thank you . You lead better than any of the boys that ever came to the school dances . You do everything so well . " Rina swayed slightly . " The dancing made me dizzy . " " Perhaps you 'd better lie down on your bed for a moment . " Rina shook her head . " And break up our party ? " " Lie down for a minute . You wo n't break up the party . I 'll come and sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She walked over to the bed and put her glass on the night table , then stretched out on the white sheet . Margaret sat down beside her . " Feel better ? " " The room is still spinning , " Rina said . Margaret bent over her and stroked her forehead lightly . " Close your eyes for a moment . " Obediently Rina closed her eyes . They were silent for a moment while  | Margaret continued to stroke her forehead . " That 's better , " Rina said softly . " The spinning has gone . " Margaret did n't answer , but kept stroking her head lightly . Rina opened her eyes and looked at her . Margaret reached for her glass . " A little more champagne ? " Rina nodded . She sipped and handed it back to Margaret , who smiled at her , then put the glass down . " I 'm glad we 're going to Europe together , " Rina said suddenly . " I 've never really had a close girl friend before . The girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about boys . " " They 're nothing but silly children , most of them , " Margaret said . " That 's why I liked you the moment you came into my room that night . I knew you were different , more mature . " " Ever since Laddie died , I could n't stand boys , " Rina said . " Laddie ? " " My brother , " Rina explained . " He and my father are the only two men that I ever really liked . " " He must have been very nice , " Margaret said . " He was . " Rina turned her head away . " I think I was in love with him . " " That 's nothing , " Margaret said quickly . " All girls love their brothers . " " He really was n't my brother , you know . I was adopted . " " How do you know you loved him ? " Margaret asked , faint jealousy stirring within her . " I know , " Rina answered . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " Margaret asked , the jealousy stronger . " Did he  --  did you ? " Rina looked away . " I never spoke to anyone about it before . " " You can talk to me , " Margaret said . " I 'm your friend . We have no secrets between us . " " You wo n't be angry with me ? " " I wo n't be angry with you , " Margaret said almost sharply . " Tell me ! " Rina 's voice was muffled by the pillow . " I would n't let him touch me because I was afraid of what would happen . Then one day , he came into my room and tied my hands to the bed with his belt and he did it to me . He hurt me so bad ! " " He could n't have loved you so much if he hurt you . " " But he did ! " Rina said wildly . " Do n't you see , Peggy ? I wanted him to . All the time I kept daring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But he went out in the boat with Mother and they died . " She began to sob . " It was my fault because I wanted him to . Ca n't you see that I was the one who was supposed to die , not Mother ? She took my place in the dream . Now I do n't even dream the dream any more . "  | " You 'll dream your dreams again , " Margaret said slowly , holding Rina 's head against her bosom . " No , I wo n't ! " " Yes , you will , " Margaret said firmly . " Tell me about it and I 'll help you. , , Rina stopped sobbing . " Do you think you could ? " she asked , her eyes searching Margaret 's face . " Tell me and we 'll see . " Rina took a deep breath . " I dreamed that I was dead and everybody was around my bed , crying . I could feel how much they loved me and wanted me because they kept begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it . I was dead . " Margaret felt a cold shiver of excitement tremble through her . Slowly she got to her feet . " Close your eyes , Rina , " she said quietly , " and we 'll act out your dream . Whom do you want me to be ? " Rina looked up at her shyly . " Will you be Laddie ? " " I 'll be Laddie , " Margaret answered . " Now you close your eyes . " Margaret looked down at the girl . Suddenly her eyes began to fill with tears . A sudden fear began to tear through her . Rina was dead . Rina was really dead . " Rina ! " she cried hoarsely . " Please do n't die ! Please ! " Rina did not move and Margaret fell to her knees beside the bed . " Please , Rina . I ca n't live without you . " She leaned over the bed and covered Rina 's face with kisses . Rina opened her eyes suddenly , a small , proud smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , her fingers touching Margaret 's cheek . She closed her eyes again contentedly . Slowly Margaret slipped the nightgown off . " You 're beautiful , " she whispered . " You 're the most beautiful woman in the world . You 're much too beautiful to die . " Rina looked up at her . " Do you really think I 'm beautiful ? " Margaret nodded . She ripped off her pajama bottoms and let them fall to the floor . " All you have to do is look at me to see how beautiful you really are . " She caught Rina 's hand and pressed it to her breasts , then down across her stomach to her thighs . " Feel how flat I am , just like a man ? " Slowly she sank down onto the bed beside Rina , gently caressing her breasts , pressing her lips to the soft , cool cheeks . " I feel so safe with you , so good , " Rina whispered . " You 're not like the other boys , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . But I 'm not afraid of you . "  | With a cry of agony , Margaret rolled , her knees forcing Rina 's legs apart . " I love you , Rina ! Please do n't die ! " She pressed her mouth against Rina 's . For a moment , she felt the fire of her tongue and then she heard Rina 's voice whispering huskily . " Laddie , fuck me , fuck me ! I love you , Laddie ! " 10 RINA LOOKED DOWN AT HER WATCH . IT WAS HALF PAST TWO . " I really must be going , " she said . " To hurry after such a lunch ? " Jacques Deschamps spread his hands . " It is sacrilege . You must have a liqueur before you go . " Rina smiled at the slim , graying avocat . " But  --  I ? " " You have been in Paris for more than a year , " Jacques interrupted , " and you still have not learned that one does not hurry after a meal . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a passing waiter . " Psst ! " The waiter stopped and bowed respectfully . " Monsieur ? " Rina sank back into her chair . Jacques looked at her questioningly . " Pernod . Over ice . " He shuddered . " Over ice , " he repeated to the waiter . " You heard mademoiselle . " The waiter looked at her quickly with that glance of appraisal that all Frenchmen seemed to share . " Over ice , monsieur , " he said . " The usual for you ? " Jacques nodded and the waiter left . He turned back to Rina . " And how does the painting go ? " he asked . " You are making progress ? " Rina laughed . " You know better than that . I 'm afraid I 'll never be a painter . " " But you are having fun ? " She turned and looked out at the street . The faint smell of May that came only to Paris was in the air . The truck drivers were already in their shirt sleeves and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black winter coats . " You do not answer , " he said . She turned back to him as the waiter came with their drinks . " I 'm having fun , " she said , picking up her drink . " You are not sure ? " he persisted .  | She smiled suddenly . ; Of course I 'm sure . " He lifted his glass . " A votre sante . " " A votre sante , " she echoed . He put his glass down . " And your friend ? " he asked . " How is she ? " " Peggy 's fine , " Rina said automatically . She looked at him steadily . " Peggy is very good to me . I do n't know what I 'd do without her . " " How do you know ? " he said quickly . " You have never tried . You could be many things . You are young , beautiful . You could marry , have children , you could even ? " " Be your mistress ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even be my mistress . That is not the worst thing that could happen . But you remember my terms . " She looked into his face . " You 're a very kind man , Jacques , " she said , remembering the afternoon she had first heard them . She and Peggy had been in Paris a few months and had just found their apartment , after her father had given his permission for her to stay in Paris for a year . Peggy had taken her to a party given by a professor at the University , where she had just begun to work . Rina felt very alone at the party . Her French was not good enough to let her mix easily and she had retreated to a corner . She was leafing through a magazine when she heard a voice . " Miss Americaine ? " She looked up . A slim , dark man with a touch of gray at his temples was standing there . He was smiling gently . " Non park fran ? " " I speak English , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty girl like you doing all alone with a magazine ? " he asked . " Who is fool enough to bring you to a party like this and then ? " He gestured expressively . " My friend brought me , " Rina said , indicating Peggy . " She has just got a job at the University . " Peggy was talking animatedly with one of the professors . She looked very attractive in her slim , tailored suit . " Oh , " he said , a strangely quizzical look on his face . " And whom did you bring ? " " No one . " He shrugged . " Actually . I came in the hopes of meeting you . " She glanced at his hands and saw that he wore a wedding ring , as so many Frenchmen did . " You do n't expect me to believe that ? " she said . " What would your wife say ? " He smiled and laughed with her . " My wife would be very understand-  | ing . She could not come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held his arms out in an exaggerated circle in front of him . She laughed again and just then , Peggy 's voice came over her shoulder . " Having fun , darling ? " Some weeks later , she was alone in the apartment one afternoon when the telephone rang . It was Jacques and she met him for lunch . And several times after that . Then one afternoon  --  it had been a day just like this one  --  they sat dawdling over their liqueurs . " Why are you so afraid of men ? " he asked her suddenly . She felt the red fire creep up into her throat and over her face . " What makes you say that ? " " I have the feeling , " he said . " Inside . I know . " She looked down at her drink . She did n't speak . " Your friend is not the answer , " he said . She looked up at him . " Peggy has nothing to do with it . She 's a good friend , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , remember ? There is nothing wrong , we understand such things . But I do not understand you . You are not the usual kind who lives like that . " She could feel her face flaming now . " I do n't think that 's very nice of you . " He laughed . " It is not , " he admitted frankly . " But I do not like to see you waste yourself . " " You 'd like it better if I went to sleep with some clumsy fool who knows nothing and cares less about the way I feel ? " she said angrily . He shook his head . " No . I would not like that at all . I would like you to come to bed with me . " " What makes you think it would be any different with you ? " He looked into her eyes . " Because I am a man , not a boy . Because I would want to please you . Boys are like bulls ; they think only of themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do not think that it is only women who know how to make love . There are men also who are aware of the sensitivities . " " Like yourself ? " she asked sarcastically . " Like myself . Do you think I see you again and again only because I have a purely intellectual interest in you ? " She laughed suddenly . " At least you are honest . " " I am a great believer in the truth . "  | A few months later , on a rainy afternoon , she went to his apartment and it was just as he said . He was kind and gentle and she did not hurt at all . And all the while , she felt the power in her , the power to bring him to a point of ecstasy from which he would never return , a power that could never turn into terror for her because she could always control it or him . She watched him buttoning his shirt in front of the mirror . " Jacques . " He turned . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms to him . " Come here , Jacques . " He came over to the bed . He bent swiftly and kissed her naked breast . " When you make love , my darling , " he said , " your nipples are full like bursting purple plums . Now they are like little pink poppies . " " It was like you said it would be , Jacques . " " I am glad . " She took his strong brown hands in her own and looked down at them . His gold wedding ring shone up at her . She looked up into his face . " I think I would like to be your mistress , " she said softly . " Bon , " he said . " I had hoped you would say that . That is why I took this little apartment . You can move in tonight . " She was surprised . " Move in here ? " He nodded . " If you do not like this place , I will get another . " " But I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her ? " He shrugged . " It is fini . " " Ca n't we just go on like this ? I 'll meet you here whenever you like . " " You mean you will not move in ? " She shook her head . " I ca n't . What would Peggy do ? She needs my help to keep the apartment . Besides , if my father ever found out , he 'd kill me . " " But he does not worry about your living with that  --  that lesbienne ? " he said bitterly . " You do n't know my father . Back in Boston , they do n't ever think about things like that . " " What does he think she is ? " " What she has always been , " she answered . " My teacher , my companion . " He laughed shortly . " She has been your teacher , yes . " " Oh , Jacques , " she said in a hurt voice . " Do n't spoil everything now . Why ca n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then you wo n't move in here ? " " I ca n't , " she said . " Do n't you understand , I ca n't . " He got to his feet , and walked back to the dresser . He finished buttoning his shirt and picked up his tie .  | " I do n't see what difference it would make . After all , you 're married . How much time do you think you could spend here , anyway ? " He studied her . " That is different , " he said coldly . " Different ? " she shouted in anger . " Why is it different for you and not for me ? " He stared at her . " A man may be unfaithful to his wife , as she may to him if she is so minded . But a man is never unfaithful to his mistress , nor is a woman unfaithful to her lover . " " But Peggy is not a man ! " " No , she is not , " he said grimly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rina looked at him for a moment . She drew her head up proudly . " Those are your terms ? " she asked quietly . She sat there proudly , her back straight , her naked breasts magnificent over her deep chest . He could see the outlines of her ribs against her flesh as they rose and fell with her breath . Never in my life have I known so much beauty , he thought . Aloud he said , " If that 's the way you put it , those are my terms . " She did n't answer . " I just do n't understand , " she said . She looked up at him . " You had better hand me my dress . " That had been many months ago and oddly enough , they still remained friends . She raised the Pernod to her lips and emptied her glass . " And now I really must go , " she said . " I promised Pavan I would be at his studio by three o'clock . " He raised an eyebrow . " Pavan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . " No , I 'm modeling for him . " Jacques knew how Pavan worked . He used many models for just one statue . He was always trying to create the ideal . He would never succeed . She felt his quizzical gaze sweep down to her breasts . She laughed . " No , it 's not what you think . " " No ? " he asked . " Why not ? " " He says they 're too large . " " He is mad , " Jacques said quickly . " But then , all artists are mad . What is it , then ? " She got to her feet . " My pubis , " she said . For the first time since she had known him , he was speechless . She laughed . He found his voice . " But why ? " " Because it 's the highest mountain any man will ever climb , he says , and more men will die trying to climb it than ever fell from Mount  | Everest . " She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him that you survived the ascent , will we , Jacques ? " She kissed his cheek quickly and turned and walked out onto the sidewalk . He watched her until she was lost in the crowded street , then turned back to the waiter . " Psst ! " he said . " I think I will have another drink ! " 11 SHE HURRIED PAST THE POLITE GREETING OF THE CONCIERGE , UP the three narrow flights of the staircase . She 'd stayed at the studio later than she thought . There would be just enough time to prepare dinner before Peggy got home . Rina went through the tiny living room into the kitchen . Swiftly she lit the gas under the hot-water heater for the tub and with the same match , the oven , leaving the flame low . She took the small , browned chicken she 'd just purchased , already cooked , at the corner rotisserie and put it into a pan and into the oven to keep warm . Rapidly she sliced bread from a long loaf , arranged it next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . In a few minutes , she was finished . She looked down at her watch . There would even be time enough for a bath if the water was hot enough . She walked over and felt the tank . It was lukewarm . There would be enough if she did n't fill the tub more than half full . She walked back into the living room on her way to the bathroom , her fingers already busy with the buttons of her blouse . The door opened and she turned toward it . " You 're early , " she said . Peggy looked at her coldly and without answering , she closed the door behind her . Rina shrugged her shoulders . Peggy had these moods . One moment , she 'd be bright , warm and gay , the next cold , even sullen . It would pass . " There 's some wine and cheese on the table if you 'd like something before dinner , " she said , starting for the bathroom again . Peggy 's hand spun her around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Rina stared at her . So that was it . Someone must have seen them at the restaurant and told Peggy . Strange that of all the men they knew , Peggy was jealous of none except Jacques . The younger men never upset her ,  | but Jacques , with his curious , confident smile and the bright-gray hair at his temples , always managed to upset her . " I just ran into him and he invited me to lunch , " she said . It was n't that she was afraid of Peggy 's jealous rages but she did n't feel like having a quarrel . " I just could n't be rude . " " Then where were you all afternoon ? " Peggy demanded . " You were n't at art school , you were n't home . I kept calling both places until I became frantic with worry . " " I did n't feel like going to school , " she said . Peggy 's eyes squinted at her . " You did n't walk over to his apartment , by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I did n't . " " He was seen entering his apartment with a blonde about four o'clock . " Rina raised an eyebrow . Jacques had n't wasted any time . " I 'm not the only blonde in Paris , " she said . " He did n't answer his phone , " Peggy said accusingly . Rina smiled . " I ca n't say that I blame him , do you ? " Peggy 's hand slashed across Rina 's face . " You 're lying ! " Rina 's hand flew to her cheek . She stared at Peggy . The other side of her face flamed as Peggy slapped her again . She grabbed Rina 's shoulders and began to shake her . " Now I want the truth ! " " I told you the truth ! " Rina screamed . She struck out at Peggy wildly . Peggy fell back in surprise at the sudden onslaught . A hurt expression came over her face . " Why do you do these things to me when you know I love you so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , a feeling of revulsion swept over her . First for Peggy , then for herself . Almost instantly , Peggy threw herself to her knees , her arms clasped around Rina 's thighs . " Please , please , darling , do n't look at me like that . Do n't be angry with me . I 'm sorry . I was crazy jealous . " Rina 's face ached where it had been slapped . Suddenly , she was tired . " Do n't do that again  --  ever , " she said wearily . " I wo n't , I wo n't , " Peggy promised wildly . " It 's just that I ca n't bear to think of that lecher getting his filthy hands on you again . " " He 's not a lecher , he 's a man , " Rina said . She looked down at Peggy . A faint note of contempt came into her voice . " A real man . Not an imitation ! " " I have shown you more than you would learn from all the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rina  --  the first faint revelation of selftruth . A cold fright ran through her . She looked down at the dark-brown head pressed against the front of her skirt . " That 's what 's wrong . You 're so anxious to show me love , to teach me love . But it 's all from the outside in . Why ca n't you teach me to feel love , to give love ? " Slowly she pushed Peggy away from her . And then , for the lack of a better place to do it , she dropped to her knees and turned her face into Peggy 's bosom and began to cry . " Cry , lover , cry , " Peggy whispered . " Cry it all out . I 'll always take care of you . That 's what love is for . " It was early when Amru Singh arrived at the party that Pavan was giving to celebrate the unveiling of his master statue . It was about six o'clock when Amru Singh made his obeisance to his host , politely refused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty room . As was his habit , he took off his shirt and folded it neatly and placed it on the floor . Then he took off his shoes  --  he wore no socks  --  and placed them next to the shirt . He took a very deep breath and placing his back against the wall , slid down until he was seated squarely on the shirt with his legs crossed beneath him . It was thus that he could observe , without turning his head , the actions of every person in the room . It was also from this position that he could most easily fill his mind . He thought about many things , but mostly about the vanities and ambitions of man . Amru Singh was seeking a man whose vanities and ambitions transcended the personal , aspiring only to the glory that had been buried by the centuries deep in the human spirit . That he had not yet found such a man did not discourage him . He felt his muscles lock in the familiar tension which was at the same time relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallower . He closed off a corner of his mind for a few minutes , though his eyes remained open and alert . It could be any night , perhaps tonight , that his search would be ended . But he could already feel the evil spirit of the goddess Kali unleashed in the room . With an inward shrug of his shoulders , he cast from him the feeling of disappointment . There were so many little people in the room . On the floor , in the corner behind the big sofa , a man and a woman were committing an act of fornication , hidden , or so they thought , from the others . He thought of the positions of obscenity carved high into the walls of the temple of the goddess and felt a distaste seep through him . This ugly copulation , which he could observe through the space between  | the high Regency legs of the couch , was not justified by even a holy worship of the evil one . In a niche near the door , with a single light shining down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedestal . It stood there very still , like a corpse in a shroud , and did not even stir when the door opened for two newly entered guests . Without moving his eyes , Amru knew them . The blond American girl and her friend , the dark woman . He closed his mind to them as the clock began to toll the hour and Pavan began his speech . It was nothing but a repetition of what he had been saying all evening , and many times before , but at its finish , he suddenly began to weep . He was very drunk and he almost fell as , with a quick gesture , he tore the covering from the statue . There was a silence in the room as all looked at the cold marble form of the statue . It was scaled to two-thirds life size and carved from a roseblush Italian marble that took on a soft hue of warm life from the light in the room . The figure stood poised on tiptoe , the hands held over her upturned face , reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broken as all at once began to comment and congratulate the sculptor . That is all except one . He was Leocadia , the art dealer . A small , gray man with the thin , pursed lips of the moneychanger . In the end , no matter what anyone said , his was the final judgment . It was he who determined its value . It did not matter that the price he set might forever prohibit a sale ; his evaluation was the recognition of art . Pavan approached him anxiously . " Well , monsieur ? " he asked . " What do you think ? " Leocadia did not look at Pavan . He never looked at anyone while he spoke to him . The artists claimed that he could not meet their gaze because he was a parasite living better from the proceeds of their life 's blood than they themselves did . " The market for sculpture is very weak , " he said . " Bah ! " Pavan snorted . " I do not ask about the market . I ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the dealer said evasively . Pavan turned and gestured , his arm outflung toward the silent statue . " Look at those breasts . I took them from different girls to achieve the symmetry that nature did not provide . And the face . Flawless ! Notice the brow , the eyes , the cheekbones , the nose ! " He was suddenly silent , staring up at the statue . " The nose , " he said , almost whispering . He turned toward the models , huddling against the wall . " Bring mon-  | sieur a bottle of wine ! The nose , monsieur , " he said accusingly . " Why did you not tell me about the nose ? " Leocadia was silent . This was no time to tell Pavan he had found nothing at fault with the nose . He had a reputation to maintain . " My chisel ! " Pavan roared . He climbed upon a chair and positioned the chisel delicately . He scraped the stone slightly , then polished the surface with his sleeve . The marble shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he screamed in frustrated agony . " It 's wrong ! " he cried . " It 's all wrong ! Why did n't you tell me , monsieur ? Why did you let me make a fool of myself ? " Leocadia still did not speak . Pavan stared dumbly at the dealer , tears coming to his eyes , then he turned and violently swung the mallet at the statue 's head . The marble cracked and the head fell into fragments on the floor . Pavan began to swing wildly at the rest of the statue . The arms fell , then a shoulder ; a crack appeared across the bust and that , too , shattered . The statue rocked crazily on its pedestal , then crashed forward . Pavan knelt over the pieces , swinging his mallet like a man possessed . " I loved you ! " he screamed , tears streaming down his cheeks . " I loved you and you betrayed me ! " At last , he sank exhausted to the floor , amidst the debris . As suddenly as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the pieces of shattered marble . At last , he found what he sought . He got to his feet . Holding the fragment in his hand , he weaved unsteadily toward the art dealer . Cupping the marble in his hands , he held it out . " I see now where I went wrong , monsieur , " he said . " Do you ? " Leocadia looked at the piece of stone . He did n't even know what it was intended to be . But again , this was no time for him to speak . He nodded cautiously . " Thank God ! " Pavan cried . " Thank the good Lord that I did not destroy the sole thing of beauty in the stupidity of my disappointment ! " The crowd pushed forward to see what Pavan held in his hand . It seemed to be only a piece of broken marble . " What is it ? " one of them whispered to another . " You stupid fools ! Do you not recognize where you come from ? The soul itself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to his feet and stared at them balefully . " This is fit only for the gods themselves to lie upon ! " He looked down at the stone in his hands and a tender look came over his face .  | " Now I see my error , " he said . " It is around this tiny core that I will carve into stone the perfect Woman ! " He looked around at them dramatically . Leocadia looked at the piece of marble again . So that was what it was . Almost immediately , he thought of the fat young Egyptian prince who had come into the gallery . This was something he would appreciate . " A thousand francs , " he said . Pavan looked at the dealer , his confidence suddenly restored . " A thousand francs ! " he said scornfully . " Fifteen hundred , then , " Leocadia murmured . Pavan was caught up now in the never-ending struggle between artist and dealer . He turned to his fellow artists . " Only fifteen hundred francs he offers me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centime less than twenty-five hundred and a commission to do the sculpture of the woman from whom this was taken ! " he shouted . Leocadia looked down at the floor . " How can I undertake such a commission when I do not know the model ? " Pavan spun around . The models looked at each other curiously , wondering which of them had posed for that particular portion of the statue . But it was none of them . Suddenly , Pavan 's arm shot out . " You ! " he shouted , pointing . " Come here ! " They turned and followed his pointing finger . Rina stood frozen to the spot . Her face began to flame , then hands pulled her forward , propelling her toward the sculptor . Pavan seized her hand and turned toward the dealer . For once , Leocadia looked . Almost immediately , he looked away again . " Agreed ! " he murmured . A deep bellow of triumph arose from the sculptor 's throat . He lifted Rina into his arms and kissed her excitedly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely one ! " he cried proudly . " I will carve your beauty into the stone for all eternity to worship ! " Rina began to laugh . It was crazy . They were all crazy . Pavan began to sing lustily , dragging her with him in an erratic dance . He lifted her up onto the pedestal where the statue formerly stood . She felt hands tugging at her dress , at her clothing . She reached out her arms to brace herself , to keep from falling . Then she was completely nude on the pedestal . A strange hush fell over the room . It was Pavan himself who led her down . He threw a cloth around her as she started to walk toward the bathroom . One of the models handed her  | her torn clothing . Rina took it and closed the door behind her . A moment later , she reappeared . Peggy was waiting for her . She half led , half dragged Rina toward the door . The door slammed behind them . Suddenly , one of the curtains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden partition behind his head , he could hear dim voices . " Are you crazy ? " " It was n't that important , Peggy . " " What if it gets into the papers ? The next thing you know , it will be picked up and spread all over the front pages in Boston ! " Rina 's laughter echoed gaily . " I can just see the headline now , " she said . " Boston girl chosen as most beautiful cunt in Paris ! " " You sound as if you 're proud of it . " " Why should n't I be ? It 's the only thing I 've ever done for myself . " " Once it gets around , every man in Paris will be after you . I suppose you 'd like that . " " Maybe I would . It 's time I began to grow up , stopped taking your word for everything . " There was the sound of a vicious slap , then an angry voice . " You 're a whore , a cheap whore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a moment 's silence . " I told you never to do that again ! " He heard the sound of another slap . " Whore , bitch ! That 's the only language you understand ! " There was a pause , then " Rina ! " The hidden sound of fear was in the voice . Amru Singh thought it sounded much like the trainer of the tiger who steps into the cage only to find his kitten has become a full-grown cat . " What are you doing ? Put down that shoe ! " Then there was a half-pitched scream and the sound of a body falling , tumbling erratically down the long , steep stair well . And for the first time in the memory of anyone there , Amru Singh left a party before the last guest had departed . Rina was standing at the railing , her face ashen , looking down the stair well . Her sharp-pointed high-heeled shoe was still in her hand . He took the shoe from her fingers and bending down , slipped it on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , " Amru Singh said quietly . She collapsed suddenly against him . He could feel the wild , frightened beating of her heart against his chest . " She slipped and fell over the railing ! " " Do n't say anything to anyone ! " he whispered commandingly . " Leave the talking to me ! "  | Then the door behind them opened and two departing guests came out into the hall . Amru Singh turned toward them , his hand pressing Rina 's face against his chest so that she could scarcely breathe , let alone speak . " There 's been an accident , " he said calmly . " Call a doctor . " He felt Rina begin to cry against his shoulder . He looked down at the shining blond head . A strange satisfied look came into his dark , deep-set eyes . His portent had come true . The evil goddess , Kali , had struck . But this time , she was not to receive the innocent as a further sacrifice to her power , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RINA WAS STANDING ON HER HEAD , THE LENGTH OF HER BODY against the wall , when Jacques entered the apartment . He stood there for a moment , looking at her slim body , sheathed in the tight black leotard , her hair shining as it spilled over on the floor . " What are you doing ? " he asked politely . She smiled an upside-down smile at him . " Standing on my head . " " I can see that , " he answered . " But why ? " " Amru Singh says it is very good for the brain . The blood washes the brain and a new perspective is given to the world . He is right , too . You just do n't know how different everything looks upside down . " " Did Amru Singh also tell you how one goes about kissing a girl who is standing on her head ? " he asked with a smile . " No , " she answered . A mischievous smile came over her face . " I thought of that myself ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed aloud . There was no mistaking the invitation of the Y she made against the wall . He bent forward quickly , placing his head between her outstretched legs , and kissed her . She collapsed on the floor in laughter . " It is good to hear you laugh , " he said . " You did not laugh much at first . " " I was n't happy at first . " " And you are happy now ? " he asked . The laughter was still in her eyes as she looked up at him . " Very happy . " She was a very different person from the dazed girl he had seen  | that night several months ago . He remembered the telephone ringing beside his bed . " Monsieur Deschamps ? " a deep , quiet voice had asked . " Oui ? " he replied , still half asleep . " My apologies for disturbing your rest , " the voice continued , in French with a peculiar British and yet not quite British accent . " My name is Amru Singh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rina Marlowe . She needs your help . " He was awake now . " Is it serious ? " " Quite serious , " Amru Singh replied . " Mademoiselle Bradley had an accident . She was killed in a fall and the police are being very difficult . " " Let me speak with Mademoiselle Marlowe . " " Unfortunately , she is in no position to come to the telephone . She is in a state of complete shock . " " Where are you ? " " At the studio of Monsieur Pavan , the sculptor . You know the place ? " " Yes , " Jacques answered quickly . " I will be there in half an hour . In the meanwhile , do not let her talk to anyone . " " I have already seen to that , " Amru Singh said . " She will not speak with anyone until you arrive . " Jacques did not quite understand what Amru Singh had meant until he saw Rina 's ashen face and the blank look in her eyes . The police had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . " Your friend seems to be in a very bad state of shock , monsieur , " the Inspector said when Jacques introduced himself . " I have sent for a doctor . " Jacques bowed . " You are very kind , Inspector . Perhaps you can tell me what happened ? I just arrived , in response to a telephone call from a mutual friend . " The Inspector gestured broadly . " It is nothing but routine , Monsieur . Mademoiselle Bradley fell down the stairs . We require only a statement from Mademoiselle Marlowe , who was the only person with her at the time . " Jacques nodded . There must be more to it than that , he thought . Or why would Amru Singh have sent for him ? " May I go into the dressing room ? " The Inspector bowed . " Of course , monsieur . " Jacques entered the small room . Rina was seated on a small chair , half hidden behind a tall man wearing a turban . " Monsieur Deschamps ? "  | Jacques bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glanced at Rina . She did n't seem to see him . When Amru Singh spoke , his voice was soft , as if he were speaking to a child . " Your friend Monsieur Deschamps is here , mademoiselle . " Rina looked up , her eyes blank , unrecognizing . Jacques looked at Amru Singh questioningly . The man 's dark eyes were inscrutable . " I was at the scene of the accident , Monsieur Deschamps . She was very upset and seemed under a compulsion to accept blame for her friend 's accident . " " Did she have anything to do with it ? " Jacques asked . " As I already explained to the police , " Amru Singh said blandly , " nothing I saw led me to think so . " " What did she say to them ? " " I thought it best that she not speak with them , " Amru Singh replied . " Are you a doctor ? " " I am a student , monsieur , " Amru Singh replied . Jacques looked up at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from speaking to the police ? " Amru Singh 's face was impassive . " I told her not to . " " And she obeyed ? " Jacques asked . Amru Singh nodded . " There was little else she could do . " " May I speak to her ? " " If you wish , " Amru Singh answered . " But I suggest someplace other than here . They would perhaps misconstrue what she might say . " " But the police have already sent for a doctor , " Jacques said . " Will he not ? " Amru Singh smiled . " The doctor will merely confirm that she is in shock . " Which was exactly what the doctor did . Jacques turned to the Inspector . " If you will permit me , Inspector , I shall escort Mademoiselle Marlowe to her home . I will bring her down to your office tomorrow afternoon , after her own physician has attended her , to make a statement . " The Inspector bowed . In the taxi , Jacques leaned forward and gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better if Mademoiselle Marlowe were not to go to her own apartment , " Amru Singh said quickly . " There is much there to remind her of her late friend . " Jacques thought for a moment , then gave the driver his other address . Amru Singh walked into the apartment and Rina followed him docilely . Jacques closed the door behind them . Amru Singh led her to a chair . He gestured and she sat down . " I have taken away my shoulder , " he said  | " Amru Singh is mt friend , " Rina said hesitantlystep . Jacques looked a her , then at the Indian . He ped forward quickly , his hand outstretched . " If he is your friend , " he said , " then he is my friend , also . " The Indian 's white teeth flashed in a smile as their hands met in a warm clasp . From that time until now , the three of them had dinner together at least once a week . Jacques turned the key in the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her into the bedroom . As soon as she entered , she kicked off her shoes . She sat down on the edge of the bed , rubbing her feet . " Ah , that feels good . " He knelt in front of her and massaged her foot . He smiled up at her . " You were very beautiful tonight . " She looked at him mischievously . " Monsieur le Ministre thought so , " she teased . " He said if I should ever consider another liaison , to keep him in mind . " " The old lecher ! " Jacques swore . " He must be all of eighty years old ? and at the Opera , too ! " She got up from the bed and took her dress off , then seated herself , yoga fashion , on the floor . Her legs were crossed under her , her arms formed a square in front of her chest . " What are you doing ? " he asked in surprise . " Preparing for meditation , " she answered . " Amru Singh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak for you . You must speak now for yourself . " Rina raised her head slowly . Her eyes were blinking as if she were awakening from a deep sleep . Then she saw him . Instantly , the tears rushed to her eyes . She flung herself into his arms . " Jacques ! Jacques ! " she cried . " I knew you would come ! " She began to sob , her body trembling against him . The words kept tumbling from her lips in wild , disjointed sentences . " Shh , " he whispered soothingly , holding her . " Do n't be afraid . Everything will be all right . " He heard the door open and close behind him . He turned his head slightly . Amru Singh was gone . The following day , they went to the Inspector 's office . From there , they went to her flat and moved her things to his apartment . ' IWo nights later , when he had come into the apartment unexpectedly , Amru Singh rose from a chair .  | minutes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of all its tensions . " He removed the studs from his shirt and placed them on the dresser . He watched her in the mirror . " It would be very easy for me to become jealous of Amru Singh . " " That would make me very unhappy , " she said seriously . " For then I would have to stop seeing Amru . " " You would do that for me ? " " Of course , " she said . " I love you . He is only my friend , my teacher . " " He is my friend , too , " he said , as seriously . " I would be very unhappy if you let a jesting remark disturb that relationship . " She smiled . He smiled back at her and turned back to the dresser . He began to take off his shirt . " And what have you learned from our friend today ? " " There is a good possibility that I may soon be free of the death wish that has governed many of my actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good , " Jacques said . " And how is this to come about ? " " He is teaching me the yoga exercises for childbearing . It will give me control over my entire body . " " I do n't see how that will help . The exercises are important only when having a child . " " I know , " she said . Something in her voice made him look at her in the mirror . Her face was impassive as she held the position of meditation . " What brought that subject up ? " he asked . Her eyes flicked up at him . " You , " she said . " Doctor Fornay says that you have made me enceinte . " Suddenly , he was on the floor beside her , holding her in his arms and kissing her , talking of divorcing his wife so that the child would be born at the family villa in the south of France . She placed a finger on his lips . It seemed to him as if she had suddenly become older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently . " You are acting like an American , with stupid , provincial ideas . We both know that a divorce would ruin your career , so speak no more about it . I will have the child and we will go on as we are . " " But what if your father finds out ? " She smiled . " There is no need for him to know . When I go home for a visit , I will merely say I made an unfortunate marriage and no one will be the wiser . " She laughed and pushed him toward the bathroom . " Now go . Take  | your bath . You have had enough excitement for one day . Did you get the Boston papers for me ? " " They 're in my brief case . " He sank into the tub . The water was warm and relaxing and gradually he could feel the excited tempo of his heart return to something that approximated normal . Slowly and with a feeling of great strength and luxury , he began to lather himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rina was n't in the bedroom and he walked through into the living room . Something in the way she was sitting at the table , staring down at the newspaper , sent a frightened chill racing through his body . " Rina ! " She turned toward him . Slowly her eyes lifted . He had never seen such depths of torture in his life . It was as if she had lost all hope of redemption . " I ca n't have the baby , Jacques , " she whispered in an empty voice . His voice grated in his throat . " What ? " The tears were beginning to well into her eyes . " I must go home , " she whispered . " Why ? " he cried , the hurt already beginning . She gestured to the paper , and he walked over and looked down over her shoulder . A banner headline streamed across the entire page : HARRISON MARLOWE INDICTED FIFTH-GENERATION BOSTON BANKER CRIMINALLY IMPLICATED IN FAILURE OF FAMILY BANK Below was a three-column picture of Harrison Marlowe . He caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He could barely hear her whispered , " And I wanted this baby so . " He knew better than to argue with her . One thing he understood as a Frenchman  --  filial duty . " We 'll have another baby , " he said . " When this is over , you 'll return to France . " He could feel her move within the circle of his arms . " No , " she cried , " Doctor Fornay told me there will never be another child ! "  | THE LARGE OVERHEAD FAN DRONED ON AND THE AUGUST HEAT lay heavy and humid in the Governor 's office . The slightly built , nervous male secretary showed Rina to a chair in front of the massive desk . She sat down and watched the young man , standing nervously next to the Governor , pick up sheet after sheet of paper as the Governor signed each one . At last he was finished and the secretary picked up the last sheet of paper and hurried out , closing the door behind him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a cigar from a humidor . For a moment , she caught a glimpse of piercing dark eyes , set deep in a handsome face . His voice was slightly husky . " Do you mind if I smoke , Miss Marlowe ? " She shook her head . He smiled , taking a small knife and carefully trimming the end of the cigar . He placed it in his mouth and struck a match . The flame burned brightly yellow , large and small , with his breath as he drew on the cigar . She was conscious of the faintly pleasant smell of Havana leaf as he dropped the match into an ash tray . He smiled again . " One of the few pleasures my physician still allows me , " he said . He had a simple yet extraordinary clear voice that easily filled the room , though he spoke quietly , like an actor trained to have his whispers heard in the far reaches of the second balcony . He leaned across the desk , his voice lowering to a confidential whisper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and twenty-five and even my physician thinks I might make it if I cut down on my smoking . " She felt the convincing warmth and intensity flow toward her and for the moment , she believed it , too . " I 'm sure you will , Governor . " He leaned back in his chair , a faintly pleased look on his face . " Just between us , I do n't really care whether I live that long or not , " he said . " It 's just that when I die , I do n't want to leave any enemies , and I figure the only way I 'll ever do that is to outlive them all . " He laughed and she joined him , for the moment forgetting her reason for being there . There was something incredibly young and vital about him that belied the already liberal sprinkling of gray in his thick , lustrous black hair .  | He looked across the massive desk at her , feeling once again the rushing of time against him . He drew on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he saw . None of this modern nonsense about dieting and boyish bobs for her . Her hair fell long and full to her shoulders . He looked up and suddenly met her eyes . Almost instantly , he knew that she had been aware that he was studying her . He smiled without embarrassment . " You were a child when I approved your adoption papers . " Her words put him at ease . " My mother and father often told me how kind you were and how you made it possible for them to adopt me . " He nodded slowly . It was smart of them to tell her the truth . Sooner or later , she 'd have found out , anyway . " You 're eighteen now ? " " Nineteen next month , " she said quickly . " You 've grown a little since I saw you . " Then his face turned serious as he placed the cigar carefully in the ash tray . " I know why you 've come to see me , " he said in his resonant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for the predicament your father is in . " " Have you studied the charges that are being made against him ? " Rina asked quickly . " I 've looked over the papers , " he admitted . " Do you think he 's guilty ? " The Governor looked at her . " Banking is like politics , " he said . " There are many things which are morally right and legally wrong . That they may be one and the same thing does n't matter . Judgment is rendered only on the end result . " " You mean , " she said quickly , " the trick is  --  not to get caught ! " He felt a glow of satisfaction . He liked quick , bright people , he liked the free exchange of ideas that came from them . Too bad that politics attracted so few of that kind . " I would n't be cynical , " he said quietly . " It is n't as simple as that . The law is not an inflexible thing . It is alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why laws are so often changed or amended . In the long run , we trust that eventually the legal and the moral will come together like parallel lines which meet in infinity . " Infinity is a long time for a man my father 's age to wait , " she said . " No one has that much time . Not even you if you live to the hundred and twenty-five . " " Unfortunately , decision will always remain the greatest hazard of leadership , " he answered . " Your father assumed that hazard when he authorized those loans . He justified it to himself because without them , certain mills might be forced to close , throwing many people out of work ,  | and causing others to lose their investment or principal means of support . So your father was completely right morally in what he did . " But legally , it 's another story . A bank 's principal obligation is to its depositors . The law takes this into account and the state has rules governing such loans . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they were inadequately collateralized . Of course , if the mills had n't closed and the loans had been repaid , he 'd have been called a public benefactor , a farseeing businessman . But the opposite happened and now these same people who might have praised him are screaming for his head . " " Does n't it make any difference that he lost his entire fortune trying to save the bank ? " Rina asked . The Governor shook his head . " Unfortunately , no . " " Then , is there nothing you can do for him ? " she asked desperately . " A good politician does n't go against the tide of public opinion , " he said slowly . " And right now the public is yelling for a scapegoat . If your father puts up a defense , he 'll lose and get ten to fifteen years . In that case , I 'd be long out of office before he was eligible for parole . " He picked up the cigar from the ash tray and rolled it gently between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father to plead guilty and waive jury trial , I 'll arrange for a judge to give him one to three years . In fifteen months , I 'll grant him a pardon . " She stared at him . " But what if something happens to you ? " He smiled . " I 'm going to live to be a hundred and twenty-five , remember ? But even if I were n't around , your father could n't lose . He 'd still be eligible for parole in twenty months . " Rina got to her feet and held out her hand . " Thank you very much for seeing me , " she said , meeting his eyes squarely . " No matter what happens , I hope you live to be a hundred and twenty-five . " From her side of the wire partition , she watched her father walk toward her . His eyes were dull , his hair had gone gray , even his face seemed to have taken on a grayish hue that blended softly into the drab gray prison uniform . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the chair opposite her . He forced a smile . " Hello , Rina . " " Is it all right , Father ? " she asked anxiously . " Are they ? " " They 're treating me fine , " he said quickly . " I have a job in the library . I 'm in charge of setting up a new inventory control . They have been losing too many books . "  | She glanced at him . Surely he was joking . An awkward silence came over them . " I received a letter from Stan White , " he said finally . " They have an offer of sixty thousand dollars for the house . " Stan White was her father 's lawyer . " That 's good , " she said . " From what they told me , I did n't think we 'd get that much . Big houses are a glut on the market . " " Some Jews want it , " he said without rancor . " That 's why they 'll pay that much . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live there when you come home , anyway . " He looked at her . " There wo n't be very much left . Perhaps ten thousand after we take care of the creditors and Stan . " " We wo n't need very much , " she said . " We 'll manage until you 're active again . " This time his voice was bitter . " Who would take a chance on me ? I 'm not a banker any more , I 'm a convict . " " Do n't talk like that ! " she said sharply . " Everyone knows that what happened was n't your fault . They know you took nothing for yourself . " " That makes it even worse , " he said wryly . " It 's one thing to be condemned for a thief , quite another for being a fool . " " I should n't have gone to Europe . I should have stayed at home with you . Then perhaps none of this would have happened . " " It was I who failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Father . " " I 've had a lot of time to think up here . I lay awake nights wondering what you 're going to do now . " " I 'll manage , Father , " she said . " I 'll get a job . " " Doing what ? " " I do n't know , " she replied quickly . " I 'll find something . " " It 's not as easy as that . You 're not trained for anything . " He looked down at his hands . " I 've even spoiled your chances for a good marriage . " She laughed . " I was n't thinking of getting married . All the young men in Boston are just that  --  young men . They seem like boys to me ; I have n't the patience for them . When I get married , it will be to a mature man , like you . " " What you need is a vacation , " he said . " You look tired and drawn . " " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " We 'll go to Europe . I know a place on the Riviera where we could live a whole year on less than two thousand dollars . " " That 's still a long way off , " he said . " You need a vacation now . "  | " What are you getting at , Father ? " she asked . " I wrote to my cousin Foster , " he said . " He and his wife , Betty , want you to come out and stay with them . They say it 's beautiful out there and you could stay with them until I could come out to join you . " " But then I would n't be able to visit you , " she said quickly , reaching for his hands in the narrow space beneath the bars . He pressed her fingers . " It will be better that way . Both of us will have less painful things to remember . " " But , Father ? " she began to protest . The guard started over and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given Stan White instructions , " he said . " Now , you do as I say and go out there . " He turned away and she watched him walk off through eyes that were beginning to mist over with tears . She did n't see him again until many months later , when she was on her way to Europe again on her honeymoon . She brought her husband out to the prison . " Father , " she said , almost shyly , " this is Jonas Cord . " What Harrison Marlowe saw was a man his own age , perhaps even older , but with a height and youthful vitality that seemed characteristic of the Westerner . " Is there anything we can get you , Father ? " she asked . " Anything we can do at all , Mr. Marlowe ? " Jonas Cord added . " No , No , thank you . " Cord looked at him and Harrison Marlowe caught a glimpse of deepRina smiled . " I told you I 'd marry a mature man , Father . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My business is expanding , Mr. Marlowe , " he said . " Before you make any plans after leaving here , I 'd appreciate your speaking with me . I need a man with just your experience to help me in refinancing my expansion . " " You 're very kind , Mr. Cord . " Jonas Cord turned to Rina . " If you 'll excuse me , " he said , " I know you want some time alone with your father . I 'll be waiting outside . " Rina nodded and the two men said good-by . For a short time , father and daughter looked at each other , then Rina spoke . " What do you think of him , Father ? " " Why , he 's as old as I am ! " " But  --  but ? " her father stammered . " You 're a young woman . You have your whole life ahead of you . Why did you marry him ? " Rina smiled gently . " He 's an extremely wealthy man , Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " You mean you married him for that ? " Then suddenly he understood the reason for her husband 's offer . " Or so he could take care of me ? " he asked . " No , Father , " she said quickly . " That is n't why I married him at all . " " Then why ? " he asked . " Why ? " " To take care of me , Father , " she said simply . " But , Rina ? " he began to protest . She cut him off quickly . " After all , Father , " she said , " you yourself said there was n't anything I could do to take care of myself . Was n't that why you sent me out there ? " He did n't answer . There was n't anything left for him to say . After a few more awkward moments , they parted . He stretched out on the narrow cot in his cell and stared up at the ceiling . He felt a cold chill creeping through him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs . How had he failed her ? Where had he gone wrong ? He turned his face into the hard straw pillow and the hot tears began to course down his cheeks . He began to shiver as the chill grew deeper within him . Later that night , they came and took him to the prison hospital , with a fever of a hundred and two . He died of bronchial pneumonia three days later , while Rina and Jonas Cord were still on the high seas . 14 THE PAIN BEGAN TO ECHO IN HER TEMPLES , CUTTING LIKE A sharp knife into the dream . She felt it begin to slip away from her , and then the terrible loneliness of awakening . She stirred restlessly . Everyone was fading away , everyone except her . She held her breath for a moment , fighting the return to reality . But it was no use . The last warm traces of the dream were gone . She was awake . She opened her eyes and stared unrecognizingly for a moment around the hospital room , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dresser opposite the foot of the bed . They must have brought them in while she slept . She moved her head slowly . Ilene was dozing in the big easy chair near the window . It was night outside . She must have dozed the afternoon away .  | " Never mind , I 'll call her , " Rina said quickly . She started to raise her hand to the call button over her head . But she could n't lift her arm . She looked down at it . It was strapped to the side of the bed . There was a needle inserted into a vein on her forearm , attached to a long tube which led up to an inverted bottle suspended from a stand . " What 's that for ? " " The doctor thought it would be better if they did n't disturb your rest to feed you , " Ilene said quickly . She leaned across the bed and pressed the buzzer . The nurse appeared almost instantly in the doorway . She walked quickly to the bed and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we awake ? " she asked with professional brightness . Rina smiled slowly . " We 're awake , " she said faintly . " You 're a new one , are n't you ? I do n't remember you . " The nurse flashed a quick look at Ilene . She had been on duty ever since Rina was checked into the hospital . " I 'm the night nurse , " she answered calmly . " I 've just come on . " " I always get a headache when I sleep in the afternoon , " Rina said . " I was wondering if I could have some aspirin ? " " I 'll call the doctor , " the nurse said . Rina turned her head . " You must be exhausted , " she said to Ilene . " Why do n't you go home and get some rest ? You 've been here all day . " " I 'm really not tired . I grabbed forty winks myself this afternoon . " The doctor came into the room just then and Rina turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his shining glasses . " Good evening , Miss Marlowe . Did you have a good rest ? " Rina smiled . " Too much , doctor . It 's left me with a headache . " Her brows knit . " It 's a peculiar kind of a headache , though . " He came over to the side of the bed and put his fingers on her wrist , finding her pulse . " Peculiar ? " he asked , looking down at his watch . " How do you mean peculiar ? " " It seems to hurt most when I try to remember names . I know you and " I have a terrible headache , " she whispered softly . " May I have some aspirin , please ? " Ilene 's head snapped forward . She looked at Rina questioningly . Rina smiled . " I 've slept away the whole afternoon . " " The whole afternoon ? " It was the first time in almost a week that Rina had been conscious . " The whole afternoon , " Ilene repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rina said . " And I always get a headache when I nap during the day . I 'd like some aspirin . " " I 'll call the nurse . "  | I know my friend here " ? she gestured to Ilene ? " but when I try to say your name , the headache comes and I ca n't remember . " The doctor laughed as he let go of her wrist . " That 's not at all unusual . There are some types of migraine headaches which make people forget their own name . Yours is n't that bad , is it ? " " No , it 's not , " Rina answered . The doctor took an ophthalmoscope from his pocket and leaned over . " I 'm going to look into your eyes with this , " he said . " This makes it possible for me to see behind them and we may find out that your headache is due to nothing but simple eyestrain . Do n't be frightened . " " I 'm not frightened , doctor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me with one of those . He thought I was in shock . But I was n't . I was only hypnotized . " He placed his thumb in a corner of her eye and raised the eyelid . He pressed a button on the instrument and a bright light reflected through the pin-point hole . " What 's your name ? " he asked casually . " Katrina Osterlaag , " she answered quickly . Then she laughed . " See , doctor , I told you my headache was n't that bad . I still know my name . " " What 's your father 's name ? " he asked , moving the instrument to the other eye . " Harrison Marlowe . See , I know that , too . " " What 's your name ? " he asked again , the light making a half circle in the upper corner of her eye . " Rina Marlowe , " she answered . She laughed aloud . " You ca n't trick me , doctor . " He turned off the light and straightened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , smiling down at her . There was a movement at the door and two attendants wheeled in a large , square machine . They pushed it over to the side of the bed next to the doctor . " This is an electroencephalograph , " the doctor explained quietly . " It 's used to measure the electrical impulses emanating from the brain . It 's very helpful sometimes in locating the source of headaches so we can treat them . " " It looks very complicated , " Rina said . " It 's not , " he answered . " It 's very simple , really . I 'll explain it to you as we go along . " " And I thought all you had to do was take a few aspirins for a headache . " He laughed with her . " Well , you know how we doctors are , " he said .
