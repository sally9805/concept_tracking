OURSELVES TO KNOW ( 408 pp. ) - John O'Hara-Random House ( $4.95 ) . <P> Perhaps irked by critics who have patronized him for his ability to write flawless ( and endless ) dialogue , John O'Hara has lately turned to a more inward sort of conversation-the colloquy a lonely man carries on with himself . The protagonist of his new novel is a rich and solitary Pennsylvania landowner who , past 50 , marries an 18-year-old girl and eventually murders her . Why did he do it ? For a long time , the reader is not told , while the narrator sifts the aging murderer 's memories for the quirks of mind and the twists of fate that led to the crisis . The surface answer to this whydunit is that the young wife had an insatiable appetite for men , and that her husband killed her in cold , obsessional jealousy . But it is finally clear that the victim whom Robert Millhouser really loathed and destroyed was Robert Millhouser himself . <P> Consistent but Shallow . With his usual sharp and overly detailed sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets the scene . The events are dramatic enough-the murder itself , a near lynching , and several seductions ( not nearly as many , though , as in recent O'Hara novels ) . But the real drama , revealed piecemeal and with a strange detachment , takes place in Millhouser 's own soul . He was born in the 1850s , idolized his father , and never really recovered from the father 's death shortly after the Civil War . His mother , a strong but withdrawn woman , could not make up the loss . When Millhouser leaves for college he is starved for love , and he finds a substitute in an absorbing friendship with a brilliant young man a few years his senior . Innocence in the 1870s is hardly more surprising than blue eyes , and it is not until they have traveled through Europe together for several months that Millhouser discovers his friend to be a homosexual . He returns in dismay to Pennsylvania and takes up a quiet life in his mother 's house . <P> <P> The author has picked a difficult sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , has left him unnaturally sensitive but permanently exhausted . Millhouser has been made thoroughly credible ; his character is consistent as far as the reader is able to peer into it . But the view , not deep enough , is too often dull . <P> Understanding but Awkward . The trouble may be that Novelist O'Hara has hedged his commitment to interior dialogue . He strains Millhouser 's musings through a narrator , a young man who begins to talk with the murderer out of curiosity and continues the conversations because he hopes to write his master 's thesis in form of a novel . The device is awkward , and the frequent asides to the reader are irritating . A scene in which the young man fancies he js in communication with the shade of Millhouser 's mother is as embarrassing as any in recent fiction . <P> The author 's point is presumably that the narrator arrives at the beginning of self-knowledge as he participates in Millhouser 's own attempts to understand himself . But the young man with a master 's thesis in mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ectoplasmic to be a real character . Neither of this world nor decently out of it , he hurts what should have been a good novel .
