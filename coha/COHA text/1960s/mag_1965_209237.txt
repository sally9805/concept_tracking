The menu was Cantonese at its most exquisite : four steaming courses of spiced , minced , roasted and boiled puppy . The foreign journalists treated to this hirsute hospitality in Peking last week were well aware that dog meat is a delicacy in China ; what seemed curious was that Red China 's chilly over lords had suddenly grown so expansive . <P> There was Liao Cheng-chih , spokesman for the Red Chinese " United Front , " jovially granting private interviews to Japanese newsmen ; raucous Foreign Minister Chen Yi , the scourge of Western chancelleries , suddenly wreathed in benevolent smiles at a mass press conference ; there was the forbidding Gate of Heavenly Peace transformed before their eyes into a carnival of fluttering doves and soaring balloons . <P> Failures &; Debacles . Nominally , the occasion was the 16th anniversary of Red China 's " independence , " but Peking 's play for world headlines over the past three weeks had a subtler purpose than mere celebration . Peking , which early this year seemed to have every thing going its own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of the world . A series of ham-handed debacles in Peking 's militant foreign policy has set Chinese propagandists to a frantic bit of image polishing abroad . <P> Latest of the troubles to tarnish Red China 's reputation : the abortive coup in Indonesia . Whether or not the men of Peking called the shots , many African and Asian leaders were all too willing to believe that they had . The Indonesian flare-up came hard on the heels of Red China 's backdown over the Sikkim " ultimatum " to India ( TIME , Sept. 24 ) . By failing to follow through on their martial threats , Peking 's leaders lost credibility , just as they have over Viet Nam . After all , fully 14 months have passed since Peking first promised that she would " not stand idly by " while U.S. warplanes struck at North Viet Nam . <P> Gaffes &; Circuses . And there was a worse side . Failures to fulfill martial boasts can be forgiven by peace-loving " nonaligned " nations ; welshing on foreign-aid promises can not . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African states , but little of that money has yet come through . Guinea has seen only a quarter of the $20 million promised since 1960 ; Mali has got only half of a similar amount . Recently , when Chen Yi swung through Africa trying to line up anti-American support for next month 's Afro-Asian conference , he was coolly received at nearly every stop . Money was not the only reason : African leaders were shocked last June at the unseemly swiftness with which Red China recognized the Boumedienne regime in Algiers . The fact that Boumedienne later proved more pro-Western than his predecessor did n't help Peking 's reputation for savvy . That gaffe coincided neatly with another made by Premier Chou Enlai , who just before the Algiers coup pronounced Africa " ripe for revolution , " thus throwing a scare into African leaders who consider themselves revolutionary enough . As a result , Chen has had to admit publicly that Peking 's former African allies could no longer be counted on to deliver the hard , anti-U.S . line expected of them .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
