txt ARGENTINE fANKS FIGHT REBELLION B NAV YAL FORCES Uprising Against Regime of Guido Appears to Fade After Sharp Clashes AIR FORCE STAYS LOYAL Jets Play Crucial Role in Combating Attacks by Anti-Peronist Group By EDWARD C. BURKS Special to The New York Times BUENOS AIRES , Wednesday , April ** anti-Peronist military uprising against President Jos ? Maria Guido 's Government yesterday brought a fierce twohour battle between rebel navy planes and loyal tank columns before the revolt appeared to fade . There were widely scattered skirmishes when the Government sent a powerful tank and armored-car column of 60 vehicles to crush the rebel forces , which were concentrated in an area near La Plata , 35 miles southeast of Buenos Aires . The rebellion appeared to be limited to certain naval units , including the naval air corps , and to a group of retired army and air force officers , who led the uprising . The attitude of the air force , ' which has 50 to 60 jet fighters in use , seemed to have been decisive . The air force combat units remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to have 22 Panther jets and World War II Corsairs. 38 Tanks Attacked Navy jets and other fighters attacked 38 Sherman tanks of World War II vintage in a wooded area near a big tank base at Magdalena , 65 miles southeast of Buenos Aires . Unofficial casualty totals were one dead and 12 wounded among the tank men . It was also reported that three tanks were knocked out of action . The object of the rebellion was to smash the Government 's plan for a national election in June in which a Peronist party is scheduled to participate , During the day navy marines occupied downtown Buenos Aires twice , clearing the streets of pedestrians and forming street barricades with parked cars and buses . But after nightfall they pulled out of the downtown area and withdrew from the port area . They embarked , possibly with the rebel generals , on a navy icebreaker and sailed down the coast . It was believed they were going to assist rebel forces under attack near La Plata and to // protect the naval air base at Punta Indio adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Aires . Yesterday , navy marines held the Government huilding  --  at La Plata ; the provincial capital on the coast 35 miles southeast of here . The marines also took Mar , Del Plata ? the ' Atlantic resort . They were also believed to control a large section of Bahia Blanca , the big Atlantic grain port . ? But the marines pulled out of La Plata as , an armored column : of tanks , supply trucks and anti-aircraft battery arrived after , a long . trek . This column came from Campo de Mayo , the army 's major base on the northwest side ofAuenos Aires . It detoured around Buenos Aires* to the ' La *Plata area about 45 miles away . The column was . commanded by Gen. Alejandro Lanusse , commander of Argentina 's only armored division . Ironically , General Lanusse has been a leading figure in expressing discontent in the past few days with the Government 's plan to The New York Times April 3. 1983 The main Argentine clashes took place near the capital and Magdalena ( cross ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The general 's column set up headquarters at La Plata and was within 30 miles'of the country 's other main tank forces at Magdalena . Navy planes , which had attacked the Magdalena tanks with rocllet fire and bombs during the day , also flew over the tank colummearly this morning , firing machine-gun blasts . The column replied with 60 salvoes from antiaircraft batteries . General Lanusse apparently was getting into position to strike at Rio - Santiago or the naval air base at Punta Indio . Extra Security precautions were taken at Government House , but most government leaders were on hand there or in near-by buildings . The Navy Secretary , Carlos A. Garzonl , announced his resignation . The attitude of the air force was somewhat puzzling . Although its commander in chief , Brig. , Carlos Armanini , announced full loyalty to the , Government , the air force appeared to be taking little part in the effort to smash the navy rebels . Assailant Shoots General A rebel proclamation declared that the uprising was directed against a fraudulent and undemocratic government that it said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rebels were not seeking power for themselves but aimed at returning Argentina to the " path of honor . " Three tanks were reported knocked out of action in the battle near the armored force base at Magdalena . An Argentine newsman who saw the fighting reported that seven Navy planes attacked 38 tanks that were drawn up in a wooded area . He said nine tank men were wounded . Earlier , Gen. Carlos Osiris Villegas , a prominent supporter of the Government , was wounded by an assailant who fired from a passing car . The rebel tortes seized several radio stations early yesterday , including the national radio . They broadcast proclamations accusing the Government of corruption , of betraying the Argentine people and of allowing Communist gains . The announced leaders of the rebellion were a retired general , Benjamin Menendez , aged 75 , and a fiery younger general , Federico Toranzo Montero . General Menendez led an unsuccessful revolt against the dictator Juan D. Peron in 1951 , four years before Mr. Peron was finally toppled . General Toranzo Montero was a prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military forces for power last year . The latest in a series . of Argentine uprisings is led by military groups known as the " Colorados . " They are understood to advocate installation of a " democratic dictatorship " under military auspices for several years to wipe out the resurgent Peronist movements here . They obviously hope to attract help from members of an opposing military group , known as " the Blues . " The Blues are pledged to support the national elections scheduled in June .
