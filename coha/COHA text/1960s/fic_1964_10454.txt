) V CANDYas though under water , by Lee Konitz . The curtain scene is not too bad . It shows Hall leaning against the window , trying to shoot some dope into the vein of his temple . There is a scuffling noise in the background ; he drops his spike and turns . It 's Bambi , holding out her arms and walking slowly toward him . There is a smile on her face as she says , ' Look , Doctor , I can . . . COME ! ' " Aunt Livia sat quietly when she had finished her reading , frowning down at the paper as though it were something not wholly satisfactory . " Of course , it wants more work , " she said , " a few wrinkles to be ironed out , some tightening up , brightening up , et cetera , but the first question is capital  --  how about it , Eddie , can I put you down for a few thousand ? " " I think we had better be going , " said Mrs. Kingsley in a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . Mr. Kingsley was more ambivalent . He ( lid not seem to think much of the project 's chances , and was quick to say so , in so many words , but on the other hand he was somewhat excited by the beauty of the girls  --  Aunt I , ivia and Candy  --  and the fact that one of them was involved the arts in any way at all did intrigue him . " " There 's a question here , " he said , fumbling momentarilyfor the right word , " . . . of . . . of taste , and I find myself wondering if . . . if . . " Mrs. Kingsley rose to her feet abruptly . " You may remain here and be made a fool of , if you wish , Edward , " she said , " that is your affair . For my part , I am leaving immediately ! " But before she left , she indicated Candy with a nod and said to Aunt Livia , with genuine feeling : C ) 1 " CANDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults is unfortunate , but that this lovely child should be exposed . . . to the eruptions of a . . . a sick mind . . . is not simply distasteful  --  it is criminal ! " Whereupon Aunt Livia stuck out her tongue at the lady , and said : " Not so distasteful , I daresay , as your fat clit ! " And Mrs. Kingsley shuddered visibly and strode away . " I 'm afraid you 'll have to excuse me , " said her husband , scrambling to his feet , making a quick bow to those at the table and hurrying out the door after Mrs. Kingsley . Uncle Jack sighed deeply , shaking his head . " Well , I ca n't help but feel that was a mistake , Liv , " he said gloomily , " after all , they are n't in arts , you can hardly expect them to share your  --  " " Perhaps , " said Livia , putting her papers away , " perhaps not . It may have quite excited Mrs. Kingsley though , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taking place in her mind . Certain images may remain , and  --  oh , I do n't think old Kingsley will sink any money into it , if that 's what you mean . No , if my guess is any good , he 's more interested in getting into my pants , or our little niece 's here , because  --  " " That is not my meaning at all , Liv ! " said Uncle Jack tersely . " Must you always mistake my meaning ? What I mean to say is , quite simply , that you most probably have spoiled my chance with the Kingsleys for renewal of the Allerton contract ! As I 've told you time and time again , Mr. Kingsley is their representative in the matter , and the question has come up recently about  --  " " Oh dear , really , " protested Aunt Liv , " must you talk shop twenty-four hours a day ! Good Lord ! " She looked62 P CANDYaway haughtily , and it was quite clear that she was annoyed . " If you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our guest  --  spare her the boredom of such affairs ! " " Yes , of course , " said Uncle Jack , turning his attention to Candy , " I 'm afraid we 've been neglecting you , my dear . " He gave her slender hand a little pat . " What about another drink ? " " Oh no , " said Candy , a bit dazed by it all , " I simply could n't . I think I 'd better get back to the hospital and see if Daddy needs anything . " " Right , " said Uncle Jack . " Well , one for the road , and were off . " In the car , it was decided that they would drop Aunt Livia at home  --  since she insisted she had " several affairs " to tend  --  and then Uncle Jack would drive Candy back to the hospital . When they reached the hospital , Jack said : " I 'll jest come up with you for a minute to see how he 's getting along . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I mean , wo n't she be waiting for you at home ? " Uncle Jack did n't answer at once . " I imagine you find Liv rather trying at times , do n't you , my clear ? " he said instead . " Well , I do n't know how you can bear it sometimes , " admittedCandy . " She does n't seem to understand you at all .. . your needs , and . . . and . . . " " Quite right , " said Jack , reaching into the glove compartmentand taking out a flask . " I could do with a bracer before seeing your father , " he said . " Here , you 'd better have one yourself . " 63 OP ' CANDY " Oh no , " said Candy , " I could n't . " " Right , " said Uncle Jack , having another . " Good girl ! " He gave her a little kiss on the cheek . This pleased Candy , for they had not been very affectionate together since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little jealous . " Well , I 'll just take this flask along in case , " he added , "  --  better safe than sorry , I 've always said . " It was quite dark when they reached Mr. Christian 's room , but they found him just as they had left him , half sitting up , staring straight ahead . There was only one chair in the room , so Candy sat on that and her Uncle Jack sat on the floor , leaning on one elbow , taking occasional sips from his flask . They sat without speaking for a long time , but finally Uncle Jack put his head down on the floor and dozed off . When Candy noticed , she came down beside him and tried to wake him up , gently , saying : " Uncle Jack . . . Uncle Jack . You must n't go to sleep here , on the floor , you 'll take cold . " He stirred , reaching out to her with one arm . " Oh , let me just be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets me sleep . " " Be here with me , sweetheart , " he added imploringly . It was the first time he had used the old name he had always called her before his marriage , and it almost brought tears to Candy 's eyes . " Oh you poor darling , " she murmured , pressing close to him . " Yes , give me your warmth , " he said in hushed urgency , " how I need your warmth ! Liv is so cold . " 64 CANDY " Oh my poor darling , " said Candy as he nestled his head between her breasts and pressed her closer . " Give me your true warmth , " he said , raising her sweater and her brassiere and taking her breast in his mouth . In the lamplight her Uncle Jack 's face was exactly like that of her father 's , a fact which could hardly have escaped Candy as she watched him , nursing , stroking his head and sighing , " Oh my poor darling , oh my poor baby . " Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found their way beneath her skirt and along her legs into the sweetening damp . " Give me all your true warmth , " he said , one hand fondlingher tiny clitoris , the other pulling down her white panties . " All  - -  - y true warmth , " breathed Candy , " oh how you need n-y warmth , my baby , " and she lay very still while he undressed her and then himself ; but when he thrust himself into her , forgetting her taut hymen , the girl cried out , and apparently this was overheard by the nurse in the corridor  --  because she rushed in at that moment , flinging the door open wide and shrieking in horror at the sight of these two , stark naked , hunching wildly half beneath the sickbed . " Great God ! " she screamed . " Have you no shame ! Have you no shame ! " A husky woman , quite six feet tall and heavily built , the nurse threw herself against the pair who were writhing in oblivion . " Great God ! " she kept shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength and the tumultuous abandon65 . ' P ' CANDYof the lovers , the bed overturned , and all four  --  the fourth being Mr. Christian himself  --  were sprawling together in a heap . " Good Grief ! " cried Candy , in genuine alarm . " It 's Daddy ! " The confusion was compounded by the fact that the bedclothesand mattress had tumbled on top of the group  --  all , that is , except Mr. Christian , who had scrambled clear at the last instant . He stood , smiling benevolently , and stared at the mattress as it heaved and bumped about wildly , with now a foot , now a muffled exclamation escaping from beneath .. . It would be difficult to determine what he thought of this unusual spectacle ; but surely some idea formed in his disabled mind for , after a few seconds , he went and gathered up the clothes of Uncle Jack , which lay strewn about the room , and then opened the door and disappeared into the corridor . A moment later Candy herself emerged , panting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to run , to fly from this ignominious situation before it continued a secondlonger . . She had her skirt and sweater on in a jiffy . Never ! she thought , slipping out the doorway . No , never ! . . . It could n't . . . it simply never could have happened ! The mattress went on plunging up and down for a time  --  and then , propelled by a particularly severe jolt , it flew off to the side . Beneath the sheets and blankets though , the struggle continued as furiously as ever . The reason for this was that Uncle Jack , half-buried in the bedding , had some-66 AP . CANDYhow fastened on to the nurse , thinking she was Candy . " Your warmth ! " he cried , unaware of his fatal error . " Give me your warmth ! " Gripped tightly between his legs he held the nurse 's upper arm which , because of its corpulence , he took to be Candy 's thigh . " Now ! Now give me all your WARMTH ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ecstasy . Powerful as she was , the big woman could not dislodge her arm from that viselike clamp . She did , however , manage to c at:ch hold of a metallic object which was on the floor ( a brass bedpan ) with her free arm and , by dint of crashing it repeatedly and hysterically on the head of her ravisher she finally succeeded  --  the straining muscles of Unclelack 's legs suddenly went slack and let her go . Once she had gotten to her feet the nurse quickly regainedher professional efficiency . She righted the bed , replacedthe mattress and bedding , and then , with a lusty heave , she lifted Uncle Jack  --  not doubting for a moment that he was Mr. Christian  --  set him in it and put his nightgownback on him . Ilaving tidied up and satisfied her sense of order , she paused and looked about the room . She was not at all certainwhat had happened . . . surely there had been a girl fornicat ing with  --  with the patient . . . but where was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was bleeding and would have to be dressed immediately . She sighed heavily and gave a last , brief glance to her assailant before going to get the gauze and antiseptic . Though unconscious , the patient 's smile  --  the same sweet smile as before  --  fashioned his mouth and illumined his face , rather angelically . SIX6Next morning Candy stepped out of the shower 's biting embrace , now feeling fresh and restored after a sound sleep ; she slipped on her bathrobe and hurried down to get breakfast . Before starting her toast and coffee , she turned on The Sunrise Symphony , a morning program of recorded music . Soon she heard the disquieting chords of Bartok 's MiraculousMandarin Suite . " Darn ! " she said , realizing she 'd missed the **28;5643;TOOLONG and the hideously discordant section where the elderly sex pervert is murdered by gangsters . The orchestra was just finishing the formless waltz of the syphilitic prostitute as Candy was putting bread in the toaster , and it was about to begin the anguished cacophoniesof the scene where the old mandarin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Hello ? " ( It was Aunt Livia 's voice . ) " Is Uncle Jack there ? " 70 gl ' CANDY " Oh ! " Candy said , feeling very confused and embarrassed . She had succeeded in putting the previous day 's events out of mind and now , at the sound of Livia 's voice , it spilled back in untidily  --  all of it  --  the scene at Halfway House with the Kingsleys , the visit to the hospital . . . Oh , why had she done it ! . . . But Uncle Jack 's need of her had been so great , so  --  so aching . . . . " Would you mind putting your Uncle Jack on the phone ! " said Livia . " Why , Aunt Livia , whatever are you talking about ? " Candy asked in real , almost relieved , bewilderment . " Well , I just happened to notice that my husband did n't come home last night , " said Aunt Livia with heavy sarcasm , " and for some strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Jack ? Do you mean Uncle Jack ? " ' " That 's right . Uncle Jack ! " With a loud click the golden slices sprang up in the toaster , one of them jumping right out and tumbling on the floor . " But  --  but what makes you think he 's here ? " Candy said , nervously picking the toast up from the floor . " Put him on the phone ! " Aunt Livia demanded . " Now , Aunt Livia , there 's no need to  --  " " Cut the crap ! " she thundered . " But Uncle Jack is n't here I tell you ! He is n't here ! " For a few seconds there was silence , as if Aunt Livia was digesting this information . Finally she replied with tremendousauthority : " Put that rat-bastard on the phone ! " " But Aunt Livia  --  " 71 . ' CANDY " Cut the crap , you little tight-puss bitch ! " Candy summoned all her dignity . " I 'm sorry , Aunt Livia , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to like that by anyone . Furthermore , I simply do n't know what you 're talking about . Good-bye ! " With that she replaced the phone firmly in its cradle and stood up to brush off her bathrobe , for she 'd been unconsciouslycrumbling the piece of toast she 'd picked up and her lap now was completely covered with it . She was quite certain that she had done the right thing . ' Really , there were limits to  --  to how much vulgarity one could permitandThe phone rang again , cutting short this train of thought . " Where do you suppose he is then ? " Livia asked in a quite normal tone of voice , just as if the conversation had not been interrupted . " I 've no idea , " Candy replied . " Have you tried phoning his office ? " " His office ? No , I have n't tried that . That 's not a bad idea . I 'll do that right now . . . . I 'll catch up with that rat-ass and believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up . Candy sat silently for a second , her eyes fixed on the telephone . She was waiting for it to ring again , and for that raucous , unladylike voice to complete its demolition of the lovely summer morning . As for the Miraculous Mandarin Suite , it had come to an end and the radio was now delivering an extremely nasal rendition of " The WabashCannonball . " Candy bit her full lower lip in'annoyance , and had just72 ge . CANDYbegun to pour herself a cup of espresso coffee when the bell rang again . She placed the half-filled cup on the table with a little crash of exasperation and picked up the phone . There was no answer  --  and yet , the bell kept ringing . Then she realized that it was the front door ; she had absurdly confused it with the phone . Ordinarily she would have thought of such an error as no more than amusing ; but not this morning . Coming after the stormy events of the past few days , this little stumble that her mind had made struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had about as much as they can stand , she thought as she went to answer the door . In the doorway stood a very thin old man dressed in a messenger boy 's uniform . " Telegram for Miss Christian , " he said . He was blinking violently . Candy noticed how slender and delicate his wrist was when she took the envelope . She looked at him again . He seemed to be on the verge of tears . " Is there anything wrong ? I mean are you feeling ill , or  --  " " Something in my eye , " he explained . " Something in your eye ! Well , for goodness sake do n't rub it like that ! " ( He had taken out a handkerchief and was patting at his eye . ) Candy had to stoop down to look into his eye  --  he was quite short . As she did so her bathrobe opened considerablyand , since this took place a few inches before his face , 73 CANDYhe found himself staring at her bare throat and splendid young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she ordered , " look up ! " " Boy ! " he muttered enthusiastically , squinting as best he could with his watery and twitching eye at Candy 's luscious chest . Even if he had looked up it would n't have been much good  --  he was standing in the doorway with the light behind him and it was impossible to see the speck in his eye . Impulsively , the young girl took him by the lapels of his jacket and drew him into the room where she turned him this way and that trying to get the proper light . After a few minutes of this she ended up sitting on a sofa with the elderly messenger boy stretched out beside her and his head in her lap . He had yielded limply when she had bent him down backward and now , as she leaned over him , her left breast became almost entirely disengaged from the bathrobe and loomed above his face . He snapped at it weakly , missing it by a few inches . While Candy 's attention was wholly engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly messenger boy continued to regard her breast peevishly , and now and again lunged feebly , like a sick seal , at it . Finally , he paused , his mouth watering profusely as Candy stared at the red , winking eye . " I 'll have it out in a jiffy ! " she announcedcheerfully , then ordered : " Hold still ! " And , as she twisted to and fro , the flimsily attached bathrobe really opened and both her pert , inquisitive young breasts appeared . " Do n't move ! " she admonished . " I think I see it ! " The aged fellow held still as requested , but an instant74 gr . CANDYlater , when Candy leaned forward abruptly , bringing her fantastic breasts to within an inch of his face , he lost all semblance of control and dived desperately into the open bathrobe . Candy was so taken aback that she sat stock-still at first , and for a few seconds the thin old man rooted and wallowedbetween her breasts , rubbing them with his nose and muttering wildly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , suddenly realizing what was up . " What in the world are you doing ! " and she pushed him firmly from her lap . I le fell immediately to the floor and lay there on his back with his frail limbs waving slowly like a beetle 's . Then lie managed to stagger to his feet and shuffle to the open door . . . . " Good-bye , darling , " he gulped , pausing there and blinking rapidly four or five times . Candy waited till she was sure he was gone before she crossed the room and shut the door . " Well ! " she said to herself . " I wonder what the messenger-service people would think if they knew that one of their messengers  --  " She stopped , noticing the telegram which she 'd all but forgotten in the confusion . She stooped and got it from the floor , opened it and read : EXPECTING YOU HOSPITAL 10:30 A.M.DR . J. DUNLAP . Good Grief , I 'll barely have time to dress , she thought and shuddered slightly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as she read the message , and she could n't shake it off .. . . By taking a taxi she managed to arrive at the Racine County Hospital at 10:30 on the dot . She hurried into the first door she saw , which did n't happen to be the main entrance , and found herself standing in a gleaming long corridor flanked by spotless white doors . She started walkingtentatively , looking for an office of some kind where she could state her business . Each door seemed very much like the next and she finally opened one at random , and went in , hoping to find a nurse or someone who would be able to tell her where to find Dr. Dunlap . She saw at once that she was in one of the sickrooms . There was a disheveled bed , and squatting on the floor for some reason was the occupant . It was a woman in her seventies with very long gray hair and wearing a white nightgown . " Git out ! " she said in a cranky voice . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sorry , " and she carefully shut the door . After this she was more prudent , but when she came to a door with a bronze plaque on it on which was engraved OSPHRESIOLAGNIA , she paused . From inside she could hear the clicking of a typewriter . It stopped when she knocked and a deep masculine voice said : " Come in . " Seated behind a desk was a dark good-looking young man . His deep brown eyes were the most sensitive and the most intelligent that Candy felt she had ever seen , and his nose was thin , with a fine aristocratic curve . Her heart gave a little jump in that first instant of their76 CANDYmeeting , and she even had time to think : Perhaps all the rest of my life I shall recall this moment  --  and then the silence was broken by his sonorous voice , as he cleared his throat and leaned forward slightly , placing his hands gracefully , almost protectingly , on the typewriter . " Are you here for masturbation ? " he inquired briskly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just possible , she thought , that she had n't heard right . The young man held his fist up and agitated it meaningfully , yet with such a disinterested air that his gesture  --  ordinarily such a smutty one  --  seemed quite abstract and inoffensive . " You know  --  onanism  --  ' beating your meat , ' " he explained. " 011 no ! " Candy declared , quite taken aback . " I 'm not sure why I 'm here . . . but it certainly could n't be forthat ! " " You said ' that ' in a peculiar sort of way  --  as if you thought there were something wrong with the subject , " observed the young man behind the desk , his eyes flashing belligerently . " Well I  --  I said , er  --  I did n't mean to make a value judgment , " she stammered , terribly flustered . " I see , " he said coldly . " But is n't it unhealthy ? I mean , masturbation is bad for the complexion , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detachment and said nothing . What she had just uttered sounded idiotic to her and she tried frantically to think of some way to repair the damage , but nothing came to mind . She stood , blushing crimson for an unbearable few seconds , then , unable to77 4 ' CANDYstand the tension any longer , she wheeled and bolted  --  dashing out the door so precipitously that she collided with a nurse who was coming down the hall . The nurse  --  a small stocky brunette  --  stepped back , clenched her fist and prepared to punch Candy in the jaw . ( You had to be ready for trouble every moment in a hospital ; and anyone who came flying violently out of that door could quite easily be psychotic . ) Candy excused herself as best she could and asked the nurse where the administration office was . " Well , it 's not in there , " the nurse replied warily , indicating the room Candy had just rushed out of . ( She still was n't sure she might not be dealing with some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candy said dryly , " I found that out . . . . But whose office is that ? I mean there was a young man in there who . . . " " Dr. Irving Krankeit , " the nurse cut in . " Dr. Irving Krankeit , " Candy repeated musingly . " And he 's  --  ? " " He 's our staff psychiatrist . " " Oh , I see ! I was just wondering because some of the things he said were  --  Well , I understand of course , if he 's a psychiatrist . . . " The nurse nodded sympathetically , then growing secretive , she suddenly grasped Candy 's elbow and drew her several paces down the hall . " Dr. Krankeit 's theories are unconventional , " she confided in a low voice . " Very un-conventional . " " Oh ? " The nurse grew even more conspiring . Her voice78 4 1.1threatening to descend to a whisper , she said : " Yes , he believes that the way to clear up our mental problems , and to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  " She broke off , regarding the young girl uncertainly . " Yes ? " said Candy , eager to learn. . . to  --  well , you 've heard the title of his book , have n't you ? " " I 'm afraid I have n't , " said Candy . " It 's called . . . Masturbation Now ! " the nurse said , forming each syllable slowly with her lips and making almostno sound . Then she sucked in her cheeks appraisingly . " That certainly is an unconventional idea , " Candy admitted . " Ile claims that normal sex relations , " the nurse went on , " cause all these mental disorders so many people have , and he says that his way would stop War ! " Candy thought of Dr. Krankeit 's earnest young face , the evident sincerity of his dark beseeching eyes . . . . Surely he was honest ! . . . and dedicated too , and  --  and sweet and kind . . . . " Well , " she said philosophically , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make men stop fighting with each other . " " Your guess is as good as mine , " the squat little nurse said shrugging , and with that she turned on her heel and started to walk away . " ' Reception ' is down that way , " she called back , " turn right at the end of the corridor , " and she pointed to the way from which she herself had come . Candy followed these instructions and soon found herself in a waiting room for visitors and " out-patients . " The several people sitting about all put down their magazines and ceased their whispered conversations to79 CANDYstare at the newcomer ; and Candy , feeling quite self-conscious , went straight to the reception desk and presented to the woman there the telegram she 'd received . The receptionistwas a small , birdlike woman whose name , according to a sign on the desk , was Mrs. Prippet . " Have a seat , " she said , having scarcely glanced at the telegram and regarding Candy fixedly as if there were something extremely curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . " This came this morning , " she said , indicating the telegram . She paused , and Mrs. Prippet and the people seated about looked at her expectantly . " I wonder if you could tell me . . . " her voice trailed off uncertainly  --  everyone in the room was listening with great interest and she was especially intimidated by the receptionist , Mrs. Prippet , who was looking at her with a pained expression as if Candy were speaking some sort of grotesquelybroken English . " You are Candy Christian ? " " Why yes , I  --  " " Then please sit down , " Mrs. Prippet said icily . " Dr. Dunlap will see you as soon as he 's free . " Candy turned only to face a barrage of silent eyes . Not until she had found a seat did they leave off and , with a rustle of pages and dry whispers , go back to their previous occupations . And now that she was safely ensconced , Candy , in turn , began to look at them , stealing furtive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clashed with her own . . . . Sitting opposite was a fat girl about her own age , and her throat was horribly distended with goiter . Candy8o CANDYlooked at it for five seconds in fascination before realizing that she was " staring . " She turned then , angry with herself . For heaven 's sake , she thought , a thing like that is merely an accidental glandular condition ; it has nothing whatsoeverto do with what the girl 's really like . She might be someone with a great awareness of Beauty . . . a sculptress perhaps , or a magnificent contralto . . . well no , not a contralto . . She continued taking inventory . There were two nuns ; one old , one young , but both pale and wearing eyeglasses wit 1h silver rims . From time to time the younger one hissed something to her companion who would give no sign of having heard anything . Near them a young couple , the woman pregnant , whispered together . And finally , a man wearing Bermuda shorts and a sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a copy of National Geographicin front of it . Candy 's gaze lingered on the man 's knees and calves , which were a bit plump she thought , and then she realized with a start that he was looking at her  --  peeping , that is , through the fingers that held the magazine , and , presumably , watching her reaction to his plump knees . . . . She looked hastily away and her eyes were drawn to the goiter again ; but this time its owner caught her in the act , and stared fiercely back at her . Candy did n't know which way to turn and was considering just shutting her eyes when a man with snow-white hair and a goatee strode into the waiting room . There was a disinct elegance about this man , Candy thought , something chivalric  --  a natural grace in the way his body bent from the waist almost as if he were bowing . H1 SP . CANDYSuddenly he straightened bolt upright and stared at her , at Candy ! Then he bent down quickly again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her too now and was nodding " yes " with her head . .. . " Miss Christian , " she called . Candy sprang up and came to the desk . Once again all eyes focused on her , and a warm blush welled up , darkeningher pretty face . It was like being the point of interest in a stadium , she thought , as she gracefully took her positionbefore the man with the snowy hair . Mrs. Prippet cleared her throat , and said , in a whisper everyone in the room could hear , " Dr. Dunlap would like to ask you a few questions , Miss Christian , " and then added ominously , " Dr. Dunlap is the Director of out hospital . " Candy expected that the courtly gentleman would invite her to his office at this point , but such an idea did n't seem to occur to him . He was staring at her in an extraordinarily blunt fashion . " Yes , " he said in a rasping whisper , spacing each word slowly and distinctly , " I most certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' " Needless to say , his vehemence discomforted Candy still further . There followed a pause now , during which the **27;5673;TOOLONG glared sternly at Candy as if to see whether she dared say anything . The suspense increasedby the second ; everyone in the waiting room leaned forward , hardly breathing , and shamelessly attentive . . . . This would have been a good moment for Candy herself to suggest that they retire to Dr. Dunlap 's private office , 82 e ' CANDYbut she discovered she was incapable of speaking . Helplesslyshe glanced about at the audience with their bulging eyes , then , mutely entreating , she turned again to the director . . . . Either I ) r . Dunlap did n't understand this plea , or else he simply did n't care . He held his hands clasped behind his back and stood with his feet spaced well apart , and now , just before he addressed her , he rose up and down on his toes several times in a terrifying imitation of Charles Laughton in Mutiny on the Bounty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper , " your father was admitted to this hospital two nights ago with an extremely grave head injury , suffering from shock , loss of blood , and possible concussion . . . . He had been dealt a violent blow to the frontal lobe of his brain  --  a blow , which , if by some miracle does not prove fatal , will nevertheless probably leave him mentally impaired for the rest of his lifel " Dr. Dunlap paused , carefully breathed three times , rising up and down on his toes as he did , then went on even more slowly and pompously than before . " Last night , Miss Christian , at a time when your father was hovering so closely to death that the slightest disturbance might have sealed his fate , one of our nurses , hearing a noise , entered the room and found you . . . stark naked , writhing , wallowing and  --  and  --  and  --  COPULATING ON THE FLOOR OF THAT SICKROOM ! " A gasp of triumph  --  almost of relief  --  burst from the crowd at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the thigh as if she had somehow guessed what was coming all along . Dr. Dunlap had actually shouted the last few words of83 $ CANDYhis terrible accusation and now stood with his jowls trembling from the intensity of his emotions . Mrs. Prippet , the receptionist , smiled proudly , and as for poor Candy , her knees suddenly sagged and she felt as though she were going to swoon . " No , " she moaned . " No . . . no . . . " " What ! " the director demanded indignantly . " I say that you were seen , you and some man , having wanton intercourseon the floor under your father 's bed ! Seen  --  do you hear me ? Seen going at it like a pair of HOT WART HOGS ! ! ! " ( He had begun to shout again , carried away like a holy-roller preacher . ) " HORSING ON THE FLOOR ! HUMPING UNDER THE BED !

" the pregnant woman exclaimed . " She could have killed her own father  --  doing a thing like that right there under his nose , " interjected the man in the Bermuda shorts . " I 'll have you know that this is a hospital , and not a . . . house of ill-repute ! " Dr. Dunlap proclaimed . " This is no place for a common young harlot to  --  " " Oh !

" She ca n't see , " she explained , intingthe old nun who was straining forward in her r and trying to look around the others , but who was ently too weak to stand up. he plump girl did not sit down , but rather stepped to side , considerately looking back to ascertain that she onger obstructed the view. ) r Candy , overwhelmed with embarrassment , it hap-d with the economy and the faultless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back . . . moving her ike arm out of the way . . . and finally , the toothless nun revealed , leaning forward with visible relish to k in what she 'd been missing . . . . iood Grief ! " Candy said aloud . " This is worse than a tmare ! " hen she fainted. seven7As Candy fell , a dark-haired young man who had been standing in the doorway entered the room and hurried to her side . It was Dr. Krankeit , who , hearing the sound of raised and angry voices , had stepped out of his office and come to the waiting room to investigate . He had just time to understand that the girl , object and brunt of Dr. Dunlap 's awful accusations , was the daughter of the recently admitted Mr. Christian  --  one of his patients  --  andthen Candy slumped to the floor . . . . In a moment he was on his knees next to her , taking her pulse and making sure that this collapse was not of a grave nature . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunlap thoughtfully . Ordinarily , Krankeit had such consummate control of his feelings that he often appeared to his patients and colleagues as emotionless ; but now there was an angry glint in his expressive brown eyes when he addressed the director : 8788 $P CANDY " Really , J. D. , this is . . . " he paused , shaking his head incredulously as he sought to encompass the magnitude of it all , " . . . I mean were you trying to get this girl to faint ? It 's  --  it 's simply astonishing ! " Suddenly Mrs. Prippet hurried from her desk and knelt beside him . " Here , dear , " she said to Candy , whose eyes were fluttering open , " breathe in deeply  --  this will bring you round in a jiffy , " and she held a small bottle under Candy 's nose . Candy inhaled obediently several times beforeher eyes closed once more and her head slumped limply against Krankeit 's shoulder . He regarded her for a moment , then snatched the flask from Mrs. Prippet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you imbecile , " he hissed , thrusting the bottle at her , " it 's ether ! " 1 ) r . Dunlap was quite silent now  --  as were all the others in the room  --  and visibly taken aback by what had occurred . It was not so much concern for Candy 's welfare that distressed him as it was his embarrassment before the onlookers  --  theincident had taken an unfortunate turn and was clearly showing an aptitude for becoming a small scandal . Worst of all , Krankeit had witnessed the thing , and might utilize it to undermine his ( Dunlap 's ) position at the hospital . " You 're quite right , Krankeit , " he muttered suddenly , " I completely lost my head and behaved like an idiot  --  here , give me a hand . Let 's get her into my office . She can lie on the couch till she comes around . " " No . Let 's take her to my office . There are some questionsI 'd like to ask her , " Krankeit said. 89 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his jaw stiffened . " About her father , " explained Krankeit . " And I 'd like to have her come with me when I examine him . That is , " he added sarcastically , " if she 's in any condition to do so . " Dr. Dunlap acquiesced . The sooner this whole affair could be transported behind a closed door the better . He took Candy under the arms and Krankeit took her legs and together they lifted her . At a frown from Dr. Krankeit , Dr. Dunlap shifted his grip  --  he had clasped his hands over Candy 's shapely breasts  --  and held her by the armpits , which was much more awkward . Then they carried her off . When they had laid her on the couch in Krankeit 's office , Dunlap straightened up and stood morosely silent , not sure what to do next . Arranging Candy 's skirt , which had climbed high on her thighs , Krankeit said : " Perhaps it would be wiser if Miss Christian did n't see you first thing when she regains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Dr. Dunlap 's watery gaze  --  " she might blow her stack , " he said , and blew out a faint jet of well-inhaled cigarette smoke . Dr. Dunlap slumped as if he 'd been dealt a stiff body punch . " Right , " he said nodding limply , " but . . . but , Krankeit. . . there 's something I 'd like to ask . . . I mean about what happened here just now , I , eh . . . I trust you 're not . . . I mean I realize the thing must have looked shocking to you , but it 's a closed issue now and I hope  --  " " Do n't sob ! " Krankeit snapped with contempt. 90 gt CANDY 91 VP ' CANDY " Do n't sob ? " exclaimed the older man , his voice cracking , and , as if Krankeit 's admonition were a signal , he immediately began to sniff and wring his hands like a little girl . " It 's all very well for you to sit there and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out and tell me not to sob . . . You 're a young man , your career 's just beginningnow and you have n't got a care in the world . You 're not sixty-one years old . You have n't been connected with this hospital for twenty-two years ! You do n't have dismissalstaring you in the face , " he blubbered , " and with just a few more months to go before retirement . . . . Eyes bulging , and gasping for breath , he paused . Then , with a horrible contortion of his mouth which was meant to be a smile , he said : " You know , Krankeit , I 'm not such a bad sort of guy  --  oh , I know we do n't always see eye to eye about everything  --  the latest techniques , the way the hospital should be run . I know you must think I 'm conservative , not up-to-date ; perhaps a  --  a  --  " "  --  a senile horse 's ass ? " Dr. Krankeit suggested callously . Dr. Dunlap winced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment as if he might lose his head completelyand begin squealing like an insane ape , but suddenly he regained his composure , and when he spoke again he did so softly and not without dignity . " You may not believe this , " he said , " but I was very much like you are now  --  when I was a young man . Hotheaded. . . outspoken . . . I was pretty impatient with the older men too , and I did n't give two hoots if they heard me saying so either . Just the way you are . I suppose that explains why  --  even though we 've occasionally been at loggerheads since you 've come here  --  I , er  --  er  --  well , thatsecretly , I liked you all the time . Sometimes , as a matter of fact , I almost feel as if I might be your Dad . " ( Dr. Dunlap became a bit choked up again as he made this surprising revelation . ) " Mrs. Dunlap and I do n't have any children , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think I 'd want him to be something like you . I do n't know why I should be telling you all this ; especially after everything that 's been  --  " He stopped speaking brusquely and gaped at Candy . The precious girl lay on her back moaning faintly , like some sleeper beset by an ugly dream . In her new position , though she was still unconscious , she had drawn her legs up , and , once again , the pleated black skirt had slipped up her legs , affording a breath-taking view of her marvelous bare limbs and the milk-white V the panties made , concealingher honeypot from the prying eyes of Dr. Dunlap  --  for that was exactly where his stare was focused . When Krankeit noticed this he leaned over and arrangedthe skirt properly . He moved expertly and with assurance , as if these exposed legs belonged to him . " Now , now , " he said , returning his attention to Dunlap , " try to be a good boy . As you say , you 've got just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunlap blanched at this latest thrust , and his lips fairly jangled with distress . He said nothing though , and , after a moment , there came into his eyes a saintly look of sadness . Something about this expression intrigued Krankeit very much . He recognized it , yet could n't think of what it reminded him . Great Scott ! he thought suddenly . It was true ! Dunlap actually was behaving as if he were his father ! 92 CANDYThere was no mistaking it  --  that look of patient suffering  --  he had seen it before on the face of his own father . And now thinking about his father ( who had disappearedwhen Krankeit was still a boy ) he felt a jab of remorse . " Do you think it 's nice , " Dunlap sniffled , " to have your every action pounced on by somebody and wrenched asun-der ? " Krankeit crushed his cigarette out in an ashtray and said : " It 's not you , it 's the damned shell you 're imprisoned in that I 'm trying to jack off  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean by that ? " Dunlap asked in a hurt tone . " Just this : you 've an ocean of drowned impulses to jack off ! All your life something 's been preventing you  --  first your mother , then you yourself . You come from the last ' primitive ' generation before Freud discovered copulation ; you have a veneer of high moral virtue , but deep down you 're a veritable sewer of bestiality and lust ! " This analysis of his character seemed to please Dr. Dunlapsnore than anything else , and he perked up a bit . Krankeit was , at least , taking a serious interest in him as a personality , which was a clear improvement over his former , uniformly vitriolic attitude . " I 'm taking advantage of the fact that you symbolically adopted me as your son a little while ago , to speak frankly  --  in ' family intimacy '  --  to you about this thing , " Krankeit said . At the words " adopted me as your son , " and again , at the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANDYhappiness , and his spine began to straighten in sturdy little jerks  --  Exactly like an erection ! thought Krankeit , taking a step forward , his hands cupped and raised as a ready catalyst for the process , before he checked himself . " You know , my boy , " said Dunlap , " there 's a great deal of good sense in what you 've said about me . I have been holding myself in all my life . As you say , I was brought up to look on sex as an evil and forbidden subject , and I suppose that 's why I 've always been fascinated by its symbols  --  the body of this young woman , for instance . But how about you ? " " What about me ? " " Well , how do you feel when you look at her  --  you who are from a younger generation , and who have made a deliberate effort to rid yourself of old-fashioned notions ? " Krankeit looked at Candy blankly . " She 'd look like Marilyn Monroe in that calendar picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have any clothes on . " " If you 'd read my book , you 'd understand how I feel about these things , " Krankeit said . " In the fifth chapter of Masturbation Now ! I state expressly that heterosexual lovemakingis the root of all neuroses , a shabby illusion which misleads the ego , that we must endeavor to keep it in its true place  --  as an aid , and adjunct to masturbation , which is the only sex-mode that permits complete fulfillment and mental health . " Dr. Dunlap listened with utmost seriousness . " It certainly was a courageous book , " he said , looking at Krankeit with paternal admiration . " In it you defy all the conventionalsex mores . " 94 ' CANDYKrankeit smiled complacently and said : " Of course , for someone like you , who has n't got any sex-orientation , heterosexuality is the logical starting place  --  it 's certainly better than nothing . Theoretically , there 's nothing wrong at all with that impulse you have to look at this girl 's body  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up nerve to do it . " Nervily , Dunlap turned and looked at Candy as she lay stretched out on her side on the couch . Just then she sighed , and rolled on her back as before . Her sweet knees lifted and her skirt slid back so that the white frilled V of her panties showed again . The righteousness quickly drained from Dunlap 's eyes and was replaced by a hard , corrupted glint . " Of course , " Krankeit went on , " for myself , I 've never had much time for those things  --  too busy with my work . " Dunlap said nothing . He was keeping his eyes trained on the scalloped V , beneath which pulsed Candy 's precious little lamb-pit . " Yes , first there was med school , and then my research and writing . . . I 've had little time for anything else .. . no romance , no family life ... I 've missed that though  --  the family life . " " Is that so ? " said Dunlap , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had just been said . " Yes , it is . When you spoke about feeling like my Dad a little while ago , I could n't help being a bit touched . You see  --  I never knew my own father . " A slight huskiness came into Krankeit 's voice as he said this. 95 '  --  ' CANDYDunlap said nothing . He was stooping over slightly in Candy 's direction and staring at her intently . " To get back to what I was saying , " continued Krankeit , " you 're terribly jammed up . This mechanism you 've contrived to keep your sexual lust a secret from the world , and from you yourself , is causing you more trouble than you realize . That 's why I decided it was all right for you to look at Miss Christian 's legs  --  it 's exactly what you need . " " Exactly what I need , " echoed Dr. Dunlap like a zombie , and moved a few inches closer to the luscious form on the couch with his fingertips twitching spasmodically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort of desire , than to fight it down and have it haunt your Unconscious for years to come , " said Krankeit persuasively . " Dunlap . . . I say , DUNLAP ! ! " Dr. Dunlap had quickly stepped to Candy and he was wrestling off her panties in a veritable frenzy . " I thought you said it was exactly what I needed , ' " he mumbled , confounded now . " Ah yes , but only up to the point where it does n't interfere with some other party . That 's an important dis-tinction . " Dr. Dunlap finished pulling Candy 's panties over her shoes and flung them over his shoulder , where they settled like a silken butterfly on Krankeit 's typewriter . Candy was now delightfully nude from the waist down and lying on her back . Unhesitatingly , the hospital director put his hands on her legs and drew them apart . . . " DUNLAP ! ! " Dr. Dunlap hastily placed his hand on the pulsing jelly-96 ' AP ' CANDYbox he 'd exposed , with the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide the evidence . " All right , " he said peevishly , after a moment during which Krankeit merely glared at him , " I 'll put them back on . " By " them , " he obviously meant Candy 's panties , yet he made no step to retrieve them . He stood , his knees slightly bent , forthrightly facing Krankeit ; and his hand resting politely on Candy 's golden V.Krankcit 's expressive brown eyes flashed impatiently . " Well , what are you waiting for ? " he said . " All right , all right , " exclaimed Dunlap , " how many times ( 10 you want me to say it ? " I ) r . Dunlap behaved as if there were nothing in the situation of an emergency nature  --  certainly nothing for Kr:uikcit to lose his head over and raise his voice . . . . " DUN LAM ! " ( Krankeit had just noticed that Dr. Dunlap appeared to have only four fingers on the hand in question  --  that his little finger had treacherously sneaked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no need to shout , " Dr. Dunlap said , " we 're not in the ghetto you know . " Dr. Krankeit pretended to ignore this racial allusion , but when he next spoke the volume of his voice had lessened considerably and was rife with Princetonian modulations . Nevertheless it was very firm . " If you do n't take your finger out of Miss Christian this very instant , and replace her undergarment , I shall report what you 're doing in detail to the board of trustees . " This turned the trick ; Dunlap let go and went to retrievethe precious little garment , wagging his hand incredulouslythe while to an imaginary  --  and sympathetic  --  97 CANDYonlooker in the corner . " Krankeit , the great rebel , the man who had the guts to jack of in the face of a Supreme Court decision , is shocked , " he said . He slipped the panties over Candy 's shoes and pulled them up into place . This was a bit complicated  --  he was n't in the habit of putting underwearon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got caught inside and remained there . " Good Lord ! " said Krankeit , exasperated . " If you 're going to poke your finger into that girl every three minutes you could at least put a p.c. on . " ( p.c. , standing for pinky cheater , was hospital slang for the rubber fingers gynecologistswear during digital examinations . ) Dunlap fumbled ineptly for a little while before finally freeing his trapped hand . " After all , " he said , looking abused , " I was only followingyour advice  --  trying not to suppress something and have it haunt my Unconscious . " " It gets a little more complicated when you begin to ' involve another party . I did n't say that you could just walk up to a strange woman in the street and interfere with her genitals , you know . " " But that 's just it ! " Dunlap exclaimed . " This one is unconscious ; she does n't know what 's happening . . . and , since it does me such a lot of good and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Just what do you want to do ? " Krankeit asked , narrowinghis eyes . Dr. Dunlap fingered his goatee in meditation . " Let 's examineher , " he said brightly . Krankeit , with revulsion , pictured the two of them por-98 gt CANDYing over the naked girl like a couple of scholars with a rare manuscript . " What the hell , she 's only a shicker , " Dunlap said with a conniving wink . " Only a what ? " " A shicksy ? I 'm not sure I 'm pronouncing it right  --  it 's Jewish , means a Gentile girl . . . " " I would n't know , " said Krankeit coldly . Dunlap 's vernacularism  --  intended to invoke a hot gush of friendship  --  had the contrary result . And there had been that remark about the ghetto , Krankeit thought . Dunlap was beginning to harp on the subject . Subject was hardly the word to describe Krankeit 's feelings about his Jewmanship  --  a muscle with the outer skin flayed off , twitching violently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to say something to him  --  as Dunlap had just done  --  which referred in any way to Jewishness , was like poking a finger in his eye . This time it had come in mirthful form , which was the most familiar pattern  --  the Gentile , in a mood of alcoholic joviality , shows off the Jewish term ( usually vulgar ) which he has learned . To his mind , this ought to please and flatter the Jew , witnessing as it does his knowledge and appreciation of the latter 's culture . Instead , the Jew  --  jumpy as an eyeball  --  feels such a remark is patronizing and disrespectful . At any rate , that was how Krankeit himself reacted . The idea , so touching in itself , of Dunlap 's spiritual paternity was summarily dismissed from his mind . The director becamelike some unknown figure passed in the street -- a stranger , and therefore , an enemy. 99 V ' CANDYKrankeit retreated into the depths of the room and sat behind his desk . Fussing with a packet of papers , he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor . I 've got some work here I 'd like to wrench off . " He kept his eyes fixed on the surface of his desk all the time that Dunlap stood hesitating and clearing his throat ... and for several minutes after the door had clicked shut . Then he got up , moving like a serpent , and quickly crossed the room. eight8Candy was coming to . Before her eyes reality swirled effulgently , then resolved itself into a sharp , pricking sensation in her backside . She was half lying , half standingagainst some sort of board or table , and her wrists were attached to it . She could n't see very well what was going on behind her , but in the next instant she felt again as if someone were sticking a pin into her buttocks . " Hey ! " she said . " Stop that ! " " Ah , " said a rich masculine voice behind her . " Good .. . it worked ! " Straining her neck , she turned and found herself staring into the tragic brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled earlier that afternoon . " I was just using a bit of acupuncture , the ancient Chinese pin-therapy , to see if I could n't bring you back to consciousness , " he said . " Now just hold still while I take them out . " 103104 gIg ' CANDYCandy looked over her shoulder and was startled to see a number of silver pins projecting from her marvelously round derriere . Surpisingly , she hardly felt them , but a dark blush colored her face at the idea that this young man , sitting inches behind her , was extracting pins from her bare bottom. . . you were out for quite a while , " he was saying , chatting calmly , " . . . partly an accident . . . someone gave you ether to inhale by mistake . . . so I decided to try the pins . . . . I was n't sure I was getting the ' points ' correctly . " " ' Points ? ' " Candy said . She was still quite dazed and could n't think what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It would n't do to stick them in any old place , you know . There are important neural points in the body - 418 in all  --  and by placing the pins in certain combinationsof the points it 's possible to speed up , or slow down , the functioning of the various internal organs . " Candy wondered whether all the points were located in such incongruous areas , but she said nothing , being much too absorbed in a rapid inspection of the room to locate her skirt and panties . Krankeit had detached her hands from the metal rings that held them  --  she had been on some sort of tilted operatingtable  --  and now , as she crossed the room to retrieve her clothes , she suppressed an impulse to cover her adorable pubes . But , she thought , after all he was a doctor , and accustomed to seeing naked women  --  might n't it look terriblybete for her to try and hide herself like that ? 105 CANDY " Was I unconscious for very long ? " she asked , trying to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But are you feeling all right now ? Because I 'd like you to assist me . I 'm about to examineyour father , and your presence could be very helpful . He has n't been able to recall his identity yet and , when he sees you , perhaps it will aid him to overcome his am-nesia . " " Do you  --  do you think my father 's mind has been permanentlyimpaired ? " Candy asked , half afraid to hear what the answer would be . " It 's hard to say . I do n't know yet which of his mental faculties have been affected , or how severely . That 's the purpose of this examination . We 'll do our very best , of course , but only time will reveal the full extent of his injury . But are you sure you 're feeling well enough to assist at the examination ? It may be upsetting , you know . " " Yes , I know , " said Candy , slipping into her panties and skirt  --  and she very nearly added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed again , but she could see that such matters were of no concern to him . There was a moment of silence during which she looked deeply into Krankeit 's troubled brown eyes , and thought crossly to herself , Good heavens , it 's Daddy 's condition we 're concerned with  --  not mine ! And making a final adjustment to her sweet little blouse , Candy spoke decisively : " I 'm ready , Dr. Krankeit. " nine9Lengthening her pace to accord with his , Candy stole a glance at Krankeit as he strode determinedly through the white halls , bent slightly forward , and with his hawklike nose cleaving the air before him like the cone of a mediumrangeguided missile . She wondered , could n't this striding along together of theirs be a symbol of all that was to come ? In the bright triumphs of his medical career , and also in the moments of anguish and doubt when it seemed to him that all his efforts were to end in ignominious failure  --  she would be at his side , marching along , as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lending him the soft assuringwarmth of her femininity . Candy Krankeit , she thought with a bittersweet thrill  --  so that was how it was to be ! All those dreamy-girl hours spent wondering whom her fate would bring . . . what the forceful male presence would be like that would pro-109110 CANDY 111 CANDYvide her with the key to fling open the gates of her womanhood  --  andthen , on a day like the others , she opened a door and there was the man that put an end to all her games of reverie . As simple as that . And this meant that she , in turn , must be the instrument of his release , though he had n't as yet sensed it of course . This fact , that Krankeit was still unaware of their looming , destined love , only endeared him to her the more . The poor darling ninny , she thought , little did he realize the stark , aching need he had for her . She almost laughed aloud thinking of this obtuseness of his  --  so like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thoughts of his work , never dreaming what his heart held in store for him . She felt like pinching him , or playfully giving him a push , just to break through his absurd masculine numbness ; but it was too soon , she knew , and it would n't do to disconcert him just now when he needed all his calmness and lucidity for the examination of her father . Poor Daddy , she thought , and it 's all my fault too ! Well , I 'll make it up to him somehow . I'llJust then Krankeit turned sharply and entered a short , vaulted hallway , and Candy 's speculations were broken off as sharply by what she saw there . . . . The hall they were in terminated in a flight of stairs leadingdown , and , halfway to the stairs , was a middle-aged , brick-shaped woman lying on her stomach on the floor . Hearing Candy and Krankeit approaching , she raised herself heavily to her knees and began to scrub the floor with a wet and soapy brush . Evidently she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had entered the hall . Then , as they got closer , the woman looked up at Candywith an expression of such fierce hostility that the girl almoststopped in her tracks . But Krankeit kept on walking and even said , " Good afternoon , Audrey , " to the scrubwoman , who lowered her head , as if refusing to answer or even look at them , and muttered angrily under her breath as they passed . She did not stop her scrubbing to let them by and Candy actually had to step over her arm . But , a secondafter they had passed , the thickset woman impulsively tipped a bucket of soapy water she was using , and sent a good-size puddle of it flowing swiftly under Candy 's high heels .. . Candy was looking at Krankeit at that moment , trying to determine what his reaction was to this disagreeable person . She had just the time to see that he seemed completelyoblivious  --  and then the treacherous liquid reached her feet and she began to slip . She realized with horror that she was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very close now , and , in that instant , the silence of the hospital corridor was shattered by a bloodcurdling roar of laughter ! Startled from his bemusement , Krankeit finally saw what was happening and managed to grab Candy 's arm just as she was about to launch into space ; then , having steadied her , he glanced back with a long look of revulsion at " Audrey , " the scrubwoman , who was making no attempt to conceal her joy at the near-accident , or to still the laughter that echoed so diabolically in the hall . " Gosh ! " said Candy , when they had descended the stairs and were out of earshot of the husky scrubwoman . " Who was that ? " 112 PCANDY " Hmm ? " Krankeit seemed to have already forgotten the incident . " That woman  --  the woman who was washing the floor . Who was she ? " " Who was she ? Why , she was a woman washing the floor . " He said this in the soothing manner of a psychoanalystaddressing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audrey . ' " " Well , why should n't I have ? It 's her name , you see , " said Krankeit a bit brusquely . " That 's what I mean . You seemed to know her .. . know about her , that is . She seemed so strange , so  --  " " I fail to see anything remarkable about her , or about the fact that I know her name : I happen to know the names of many people who work in the hospital . " Ile seemed to be getting a little angry and Candy diplomaticallydropped the subject . Cranky old darling , she thought , but it was easy to see how the enormous strain of his work had gotten him on edge . Uncle Jack , his head and a good bit of his face swathed in bandages , sat propped against pillows like an Oriental pasha and regarded his young visitors with a gentle smile . " I 've brought Candy to visit you , " the young man had said . " Candy ? I knew a girl named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this girl too . . . Could be her twin sister . " Just before coming in , Krankeit had explained the patient'scondition to Candy , pointing out that he had becomea more or less " disembodied intelligence , " and couldbe expected to lack the most elementary knowledge about himself or even the ordinary details of existence . His id and his ego  --  both so central to rational conduct  --  had suffered near obliteration ; and consequently , though he might be quite conscious of what was going on about him , it was like the awareness of a camera or a microphone , for he had practically no feeling of self . Despite this briefing , Candy could n't restrain a sigh of distress when Uncle Jack told her she reminded him of herself . " But Daddy , " she said , fighting hard to keep her voice steady , " it 's me , it 's Candy ! " Apparently Uncle Jack did n't feel this statement was intended for him , for he looked at Krankeit smilingly as if expecting him to answer . Krankeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the words " agonic id . " He too was smiling , but in a different way than the patient . He was happy because this was his work , his element ; he was like an expert operator seated before some fantastically complex switchboard , and he was about to determine which of its circuits were clear and which had been interrupted . Silently , he took Uncle Jack 's hand and placed it , fingers spread apart , on the blanket . " Where is your thumb ? " he asked . Uncle Jack 's angelic smile slowly froze on his face . " Which one of your fingers is your thumb ? " the young doctor repeated patiently . Uncle Jack looked at his hand , perplexed . After a while , the middle finger raised up . " Which is the middle finger then ? " This time the little finger lifted hesitantly. 114 . ' CANDY " Ring finger ? " Nothing happened . " Little finger ? " Uncle Jack 's middle finger bobbed up again . Krankeit reached over and lifted Uncle Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired . Uncle Jack smiled with relief . " You knew it all the time , " he said admiringly . Krankeit took hold of the little finger and held it up . " Which is that ? " " Pinky ! " the patient said delightedly . " I 'm pretty sure , pretty sure of that . " Candy was barely able to suppress a sob at this . Oh , poor dear Daddy , she thought , and it 's all my fault , every last bit of it . . . . " Which is your right hand ? " Krankeit said , continuing his examination . " I 'll have to guess on that one . I get all mixed up , " Uncle Jack explained , presenting his left hand . " Which is your left hand ? " Uncle Jack looked intently at his hand , but said nothing . " Which is your left foot ? " He presented his left little finger . " Are you sure that 's your left foot ? " He offered his right little finger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all mixed up , " said Uncle Jack , pointing to his left hand , then to his right hand , then to Krankeit 's left foot . " I 'm kind of mixed up on them , " he confessed . " I never could get them straight . " 115 g CANDYKrankeit now took a number of heterogeneous objects from his pockets , humming cheerfully the while , and placed them on the patient 's night table . Then he pointed to each one and carefully named it . Uncle Jack 's attention was apparently focused on this procedure : however , when asked to pick up the matches he picked up a pencil ; asked to pick up the lighter he picked up a penknife ; asked to pick up the chewing gum he did so and hurriedly chewed it ; asked to pick up the pencil he picked up the gum again . . . . " Is my arm up or down ? " asked Krankeit , holding his left hand up and jotting busily on his pad with his right hand . " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . " " Where is the ceiling ? " Uncle Jack looked up at the ceiling . " Is it up ? " Krankeit prompted . " I 'm gon na say up . " " Where is the floor ? " " It 's down there . " " Is it up or down ? " Uncle Jack was silent for a few seconds , and then he said , " I 'm gon na give up . " Krankeit pursed his lips reflectively as he framed the proper reply to bring the patient back into a more responsivesyndrome , but before he could speak , the door sprang open and a chubby little man , followed by two women , entered the room . Candy stood up from her chair in astonishment  --  it was Aunt Ida and her husband Luther , and with than , gaily waving a bunch of tulips , was Livia herself ! 116 14 CANDY " Greetings , Gates ! " Livia screamed merrily , laying the flowers on Uncle Jack 's chest and friskily pinching his cheek . " We 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Luther , obviously wishing to disassociate themselves from this riotous entrance , hung back decorously at first , then stepped forward . " Everything all right , Sidney ? " asked Luther . " Not too bad ? " Aunt Ida , pale and gaunt , and grimly dressed in black , stared silently at her brother , her eyes glistening lugubriously . Uncle Jack smiled sweetly in greeting . Not a bit of resistancefrom him if people wanted to call him " Sidney " or " Daddy , " or anything else . And since in their minds he was " Sidney " and " Daddy , " and since the real Sidney Christian was in a lost state similar to his own and in no condition to dispute the title , " Uncle Jack " became " Sidney " and " Daddy , " and that was the end of it . Livia had turned to wave hello to Candy , and now , for the first time , noticed the silent Krankeit . " Ah ! " she said . " Dr. Livingstone , I presume . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignoring Livia 's brashness , he glanced quickly at his watch . " I have a consultation now , " he informed Candy in a low voice . " I 'll try and stop back here when I 'm finished . " Then , with a last look at Uncle Jack , he murmured , " Pity . . . We did n't even get to sounds and colors . " " Who 's that Hebe doctor ? " Livia said loudly before Krankeit was well out the door . " Good Grief , Aunt Livia ! " Candy flared . " Ca n't you ever . . . keep still ? " 117 CANDY " Keep still ? " Livia asked in genuine puzzlement . " Candy 's right , " said Luther . " That was a tactless remark , and he could n't possibly not have heard it . Could n't you have waited till he was out of the room ? " " Oh my God ! " Livia snorted in exasperation . " You 've got to watch every damn little word with you people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid , if we all sit around like that mopey Hebe doctor and do n't say any-thing ? " Aunt Ida , who was arranging the tulips in a vase , sighed and exchanged looks of patient resignation with Candy and her husband  --  since Jack 's disappearance , Livia had become worse than ever . . . . " Poor old Sid , " Livia went on . " Nothing to do but lie in bed and look at the four walls . He must be bored stiff . " She was fumbling with a Pan American Airways satchel which she 'd brought . " Well , we 'll see if we ca n't cheer him up a little bit . " The others looked on in disapproval at the telltale sound of bottles clinking together in the satchel , but Uncle Jack , who had been supine in his bed , sat up with interest . " I could do with a drop of bourbon , " he observed earnestly . " Not bourbon , old boy , " Livia corrected , extracting two bottles from her satchel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 'll juice you to the gills ! " " Now Livia , that 's a darn silly idea to have brought that here , " said Luther , puffing anxiously . " Nonsense ! " Livia snapped . " Just the thing for a hangover . Matter of fact , we could all probably stand a quick one . How about it . Ida ? Neat or on the rocks ? How about118 CANDYit , Can ? Think you can scare up some ice cubes in this mausoleum ? " Candy was so angry she could have wept . " This  --  this is incredible , " she said with a tiny stamp of rage . " Oh really ! " said Uncle Jack , sounding very lucid and urbane . " I do n't see how a quick one could possibly do me any harm . " He accompanied this remark with a look of calm severity  --  not to be gainsaid  --  in Candy 's direction . Aunt Livia had brought glasses too , and now set about improvising a bar on a large hospital wheeling-table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she urged . " Ice cubes ! And with all due dispatch ! Remember , there 's a brave little sick boy waiting for you to get back with the serum . So hurry ! Mush ! Mush ! " Candy flounced out of the room and cracked the door shut behind her . Scarcely knowing where she was going or what she was going to do , she wandered blindly through the immaculate hospital halls . . . . In her mind , of course , was the desire to find Krankeit , but she soon became lost in the labyrinthinepassages and stairways , and had no idea where to seek him . Rounding a corner she faced yet another long corridor . Had she already traversed it ? It was identical with the others and she felt the confused beginning sting of tears in her eyes as she started down it . Abruptly , a door on her left opened ; a massive red arm reached out , seized her , and drew her into the room . . . . She was in a kind of dimly lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . She stood there , petrified119 CANDYwith fright , hardly daring to look at the person who had pulled her so fiercely into this sinister place . Audrey , the squat , evil-tempered scrubwoman , leaned back against the door and eyed Candy impassively . " You should excuse me , " she said suddenly , " from yenkingyour arm so brutal . " Candy 's arm did hurt , and she rubbed the spot ruefully , but she was vastly relieved that the terrifying little woman was merely talking to her  --  she had feared , at first , that her very life might be in danger . " I wanted to have a chat with you , " Audrey disclosed . " Certainly , " Candy agreed nervously . " Just this : LEAVE MINE BOY ALONE ! " " Leave who ? I 'm afraid I do n't  --  " " Please ! " cut in the stumpy scrubwoman . " I saw you with mine Irving ! Lookin ' at him  --  " Candy regarded the powerful gray-haired woman with astonishment. "  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving is your  --  your boy ' ? " " Leave him alone ! LEAVE MINE BOY ALONE ! " " Do  --  do you mean that you are Mrs. Krankeit  --  Dr. Krankeit 's mother ? " " Yes . I am Irving 's mother , but Mrs. Krankeit I am not . Krankeit ' is a name that Irving made up because he did n't like our real name . " " Made it up ? But why , what is your real name ? " " Semite , " the squat little woman gravely replied . " Mrs. Silvia Semite . " Candy understood . She could guess at the untold hell the name " Irving Semite " must have caused Krankeit as a120 CANDYlad in his student days . But good grief , what a person 's name was was n't the important thing ! She would make him see that . She would show him , when the time came , that she would be proud to become " Candy Semite . " " Irving changed his name because he 's so sensitive , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . Why are you  --  " Candy stopped , staring at Mrs. Semite 's soiled workclothes in utter bewilderment . " You mean this ? " and Irving 's mother waved contemptuouslyat the mops and pails . " Well . . . yes . " " It 's so that I can be here , close to mine boy . " " Bit . . . but . . . " Candy looked about hopelessly at the brooms and dripping brushes . " Irving , my son , is a genius , " Mrs. Semite reminded Candy . " I want to be near him , to see him  --  every day . In his office I ca n't stay , I know  --  it embarrasses ' him , and to the patients it looks funny to have his mother always standing there . All right . I understand that . " " And so you 've taken on this job in order  --  in order to be near your son ? " " Exzectly . And no one should know I 'm his mother .. . but to you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . You 're not a nize girl for him ! " Candy looked away self-consciously and steeled herself for what was coming . No doubt Irving 's mother had also heard the story about her and was going to revile her now as Dr. Dunlap had done . But the older woman had become silent . She was stand-121 CANDYing with her ear to the wall and seemed to be intently listening to something . .. . In another instant she sped to a shelf stacked with bars of soap and packages of detergent . Scurrying like a mother squirrel , she moved these objects aside , and presently uncovereda part of the wall where there was a small sliding panel . She cautioned Candy to silence , holding her finger to her lips , then slid the panel open and put her face to the aperture . After a few seconds she turned back toward Candy with a bemused smile on her face . " There he is ! " she whispered ecstatically . Candy stepped to the opening , which seemed to have been intended for a movie-projector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphitheater . The vast room was empty save for Dr. Dunlap , who was sitting under a strong light in the very center , and Krankeit himself , standing high in the uppermost tier of seats and barely discernible in the shadows . Dr. Dunlap had a device of some sort clamped to his head : there were electrodes taped to his temples , and wires from them led to a screen coated with some fluorescent material , which stood a few feet before him . On the screen danced a jagged pattern of lines  --  wave lengths of the electricalimpulses of his brain , apparently  --  and the **27;5702;TOOLONG , leaning forward slightly , stared wide-eyed at them as if hypnotized . " Can you give me an all-clear ? ' " called Krankeit tersely , a small megaphone raised to his mouth . " All clear ! " replied Dunlap , tight-lipped . " Ready for your little standby ? " demanded Krankeit . " Ready for little standby ! " snapped Dunlap. 122 SP ' CANDYKrankeit leaned over into space , his keen eyes riveted to the patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miniature megaphone to his lips again . " Ready for your little countdown ? " " Ready for little countdown ! " Krankeit regarded his wristwatch , stared at the sweeping second-hand. " 8 ... 7 ... stand by for standby ... 6 ... ready for ready ... 5 ... 4 ... stand by ! ... 3 ... 2 ... 11 Ready for your big standby ? " He was practically shouting now , and both men had the intensity of children at a game of magic . " Ready for big standby ! " " Ready for your big countdown ? " " Ready for big countdown ! " " Stand by ! " shouted Krankeit , and , as he continued , his voice took on an odd metallic quality as though it were coming through a large public-address system : " 100 ... 99 ... 98 ... 97 ... 96 ... 95 ... 94 ... 93 ... 92 ... 91 ... 90 ... 89 ... 88 ... 87 ... 86 ... 85 ... 84 ... 83 ... 82 ... 81 ... 80 ... 79 ... 78 ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 ... 71 ... 70 ... 69 ... 68 ... 67 ... 66 ... 65 ... 64 ... 63 ... 62 ... 61 ... 60 ... 59 ... 58 ... 57 ... 56 ... 55 ... 54 ... 53 ... 52 ... 51 ... 50 ... 49 ... 48 ... 47 ... 46 ... 45 ... 44 ... 43 ... 42 ... 41 ... 40 ... 39 ... 38 ... 37 ... 36 ... 35 ... 34 ... 33 ... 32 ... 31 ... 30 ... 29 ... 28 ... 27 ... 26 ... 25 ... 24 ... 23 ... 22 ... 21 ... 20 ... 19 ... 18 ... 17 ... 16 ... 15 ... 14 ... 13 ... 12 ... 11 ... 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 51 ... 41 ... 3 ! ... 21 ... 1 .... JACK OFFI " Stationed at her tiny window , Candy looked on incredulouslyat what took place when Krankeit 's thunderous coin-123 $ CANDYmand had ceased echoing in the amphitheater . After a minutes he turned weakly from the wall and said , " I think I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid I 'm getting a bit of a headache . " " Do n't forget what I told you , " said Krankeit 's mother , eying her pugnaciously . " Leave Irving alone ! " She wandered again in the maze of white corridors , trying to find her way back to the sickroom . Walking slowly , she considered the outlandish things that had been happening to her  --  the scene with Dr. Dunlap , the strange meeting with Mrs. Semite , and now , this upsetting incidentshe 'd witnessed in the amphitheater . She 'd heard about Krankeit 's unprecedented theories from the nurse , of course , but seeing them put to practice had been somethingof a shock . She was disturbed , bewildered , and , more than anything else , she was terribly tired . She dabbed her moist forehead with a hanky and wished she could sit down . . . . A few minutes later a burst of wild laughter , coming from one of the rooms , told her where the others were . She opened the door and was presented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " Daddy " had gotten out of bed in his bathrobe and turbanof bandages , and he and Luther were grunting and shuffle-stamping about each other in American Indian style . Luther was in his undershirt , and from time to time , would lock his hands behind his neck and do an obscene wiggle like a burlesque dancer . It was the sight of this bald little roly-poly man doing bumps and grinds124 V ' CANDYin his undershirt that was provoking Livia 's hilarious shrieking . Obviously , they had n't waited for Candy to return with the ice cubes to begin their merrymaking . Seated in a corner , Aunt Ida  --  insanely calm  --  was reading a hospital-bound copy of Popular Mechanics . When they saw Candy standing in the doorway , the men abruptly ceased their barbaric squirming and changed to a chaste and stately minuet . Uncle Jack bowing sedately and fat little Luther doing a charming curtsy . " Too much ! Too much ! " Livia howled , falling on the bed helplessly . Good Grief ! Candy thought . They 've gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minuet and reverted to their primitive technique  --  Luther scuffling around the room on his knees , Uncle Jack war-whooping and stamping his feet . Just then the door opened and Krankeit entered . To everyone 's surprise , he did n't seem to be shocked by what was happening , and actually waved his hand to the dancers as if to tell them not to bother about him but to go on with their fun . Perhaps it was for her sake , Candy thought with a catch in her throat , to save her from the painful embarrassment of a scene . In gratitude for Krankeit 's good sportsmanship , Uncle Jack and Luther linked arms like chorus girls and began kicking rhythmically to the tune " Give My Regards to Broadway . " The young doctor smiled good-naturedly , but refused125 A71 CANDYto go as far as taking part himself when Luther beckoned him to come and join the chorus line . " I take it back ! " Livia cried gaily to Krankeit from the bed . " I thought you were going to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all  --  God , if there 's one thing depresses me it 's to have some mopey Hebe around when people are trying to be cheerful , do n't you agree ? " At this remark , a nervous tic appeared in Krankeit 's cheek , but he soon mastered it and said to Uncle Jack , " Well , I 'm glad to see you 're up out of bed and getting the kinks out of your bones . Must n't overdo it though . Must n't take on too much the first day . ... Careful your bandage does n't come off . . . . " Uncle Jack 's dressing had come undone , and he was waving a loose yard of gauze , can-can style , in time to the step . Now , with amusing versatility , he changed again , metamorphosing into a gorilla  --  lumbering about , scratchinghimself under the arms , and pouting his lips disdainfully . " Sid has become a real scream since he got that bang in the head , " Livia commented . The " ape " lurched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Popular Mechanics ; gripping her magazine tightly , she kept her eyes trained on the page and did not look up . Uncle Jack made an insulting monkey-face in her direction , and turned to the wall . He seemed to be making some rapid adjustments in his costume . From time to time , he made a soft hooting sound in imitation of a chimpanzee . Then , finally ready , he turned to face the crowd126 CANDY  --  he had undone his bathrobe , lifted his nightgown , and , with a fatuous leer , was exposing his member ! Good Lord ! Candy thought in panic . Not again ! " You ca n't say he 's not the life of the party , " Livia quipped in high spirits . Poor Luther , who had taken one brief look at what was happening , had buried his face in a chair , like an ostrich . Uncle Jack stood not more than two feet from Ida and cynically waved his member at her . At last she looked up from her magazine . " Well  --  uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested in a discreetly unruffledvoice , catching Krankeit 's eye . " Oh my no ! " Krankeit declared , with a scowl of professionalconcern . " Well , after all  --  I mean do n't you think  --  uh  --  " ( The ape-man was very close to her . His gross organ virtually loomed in the corner of her sight . ) " Oh heavens no ! " Krankeit assured her . " Perfectly okay . Best thing in the world for him . " " Dr. Krankeit feels that the way to clear up our mental problems is to . . . to masturbate , Aunt Ida , " Candy explained . Ida listened to this information calmly , but she had become rather green and was swallowing continuously . " AH ! " Everyone turned and looked at Livia , who had suddenly staggered to her feet . She held her palm to her mouth as if to suppress a screech of fright , and , with the other hand , she pointed an accusing finger at Uncle Jack 's member. 127 SP CANDY " JACK ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition  --  and crumbled to the floor . Uncle Jack and Luther set to work immediately to mimic her  --  falling and getting up in a series of imitations of people passing out from drink . " Great Scott ! " Krankeit exclaimed , looking at Livia lying motionless on the floor . " We 'd better get her to the dispensaryat once ! I 'm afraid she 's had a bit too much , " and , signifying to the others to continue with their fun , he lifted the unconscious young woman onto the wheeling-table and rolled her smoothly away . Now that their audience was gone , and with Candy and Ida glaring at them , the two men finally stopped their cavorting and sat down exhausted on the bed . " Whew ! " panted Luther , trying to make it seem as if their insensate exhibition had been an innocent lark , " I do n't know when I 've had a workout like that in the last six years . " He chuckled and glanced sheepishly at the women , who looked back at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , getting up and retrieving his shirt from the floor , " this has been an awfully pleasant visit , and I hope  --  uh  --  I hope we 've helped you get your mind off your troubles a bit  --  " " Wait a minute ! " Uncle Jack said excitedly , and sprang from the bed . " I just thought of one we forgot to do ! " and he began to hum the familiar strains of the Parisian " Apache Dance , " took several ominous strides , and froze ludicrously , having just knocked an imaginary Mademoiselleto the floor . " Right ? " he said to Luther . " Come on ! " he roared . " LET 'S GO ! " motioning for the chubby Luther to perform the painful role of the girl. 128 CANDY " Now Sidney , maybe we 'd better not get started again , " Luther observed apprehensively . " You know the doctor just told you to take it easy  --  " " COME ON ! " Uncle Jack bellowed , and whether he was furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply part of the dance , he stalked up to his brother-inlawand slapped him smartly in the face . This was too much for Ida , who finally passed to the attack and began pushing Uncle Jack vigorously toward his bed . " Hands off ! " he shouted in astonished protest . " Hands off , you sow ! " I ca n't stand another minute of this , Candy thought . Good Grief ! And she rushed blindly out of the room to find help . She flew down the hall , and with a little sob of despair , flung open the first door she came to , but was startled to find herself again in the service room , full of mops and buckets , where she 'd made the acquaintance of Irving Krankeit 's mother . It seemed impossible . . . she could have sworn that the tiny room was whole floors and corridors distant , tucked away in some obscure corner of the colossal building . Had n't it taken her ten minutes to find her way back from it to Daddy 's room ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detergent . . . . Yes , there was the little sliding panel ! It was still partially open , and as she looked she heard someone in the amphitheater say something that sounded like " Ping ! " Candy had an almost physical premonition warning her not to look ; but some still louder inner force$Ve . CANDYfiercely compelled her to peer into the vastness below . .. . " Chiang ! " Aunt Livia  --  naked , unconscious , attached by the wrists to the vertical operating table  --  looked like a handsome animal offered for sacrifice . Seated immediately behind her was Krankeit . The young doctor sat silently as if meditating on the form before him , then he took something from a table at his side , leaned forward , and inserted it in Livia 's girlish right buttock . " Moo ! " he said distinctly , settling back into his seat . This was Krankeit 's " ancient Chinese therapy , " Candy thought , with a tinge of reverence . These were the Chinese pins with which he had treated her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . that he was now sticking in Livia . Candy suddenly felt very tired ; and beyond the fatigue was an aching uneasiness which was n't due solely to her resentment at seeing Livia occupy her place on the tiltingtable . . . . I feel as if something were coming to an end , she thought . My childhood perhaps . . . . " Tch'ou ! " Krankeit said , and sat back . In a minute though , he was forward again with another pin . Back and forth he went , like someone giving artificial respiration very slowly ; and the pins grew into clusters like two little bouquets , one on each of Livia 's handsome tushy . . . . " Moung ! " How defenseless Aunt Livia looked ! . . . Strapped to the table , naked and unconscious . . . and a few hours ago it had been her . Of course Krankeit was a doctor , Candy reflected , but he was also a man ! And Livia was130 CANDYbeautiful . It seemed so unfair somehow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and rush into the amphitheater . " Ping ! " Oh I just wish that it would stop happening ! she thought , cross and weary . I just wish I were someplace else . . . . " Meeow ! " ( There was a note of tense excitement in Krankeit 's voice now which grew stronger with each pin. ) . . . someplace far from Racine . . . . I 'm tired of that darn old college too . " Fu ! " Krankeit cried . " Feng ! Jao ! " ( putting in three pins in quick succession ) . " I do n't care , " Candy said to herself , " I do n't want to see Aunt Livia anymore . .. or Dr. Krankeit either . " " Wowee ! " One of Krankeit 's hands , Candy noticed , was briskly engaged in his lap . Why  --  why he 's abusing himself , she thought , her eyebrows shooting up . At that precise moment , she thought of New York City , and decided to go there .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled . . . someplace where she knew no one , and where no one knew her . . . " POW ! FANG DANG POW ! " Krankeit screamed triumphantly , dropping forward from his chair , to lie utterly spent , face down and apparently unconscious , on the floor of the great amphitheater. .. . where she could lose the old Candy in the namelesscity streets , she thought , where she could finally . . . be herself. tenioThere was only one tree on Grove Street . This was the sort of thing Candy was quick to notice , and to love . " Look , " she would say softly , squeezing someone 's hand . " Is n't it too much ! I could just hug myself everytime I pass it ! " And that was where she met the hunchback . It was late one airless summer day , when the sky over Greenwich Village was the color of lead . It had just begun to rain , and Candy was standing back in a shallow doorway , waiting for her bus . Dreamily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyful in her new mandarin rain-cloak , hugging it to her  --  she saw him . He was out in the midst of the downpour , leaning against the tree , staring into the window display of the men 's shop on the corner . He was standing very still , though from time to time there seemed to be a slight movement of his back , as if he might be consciously pressing his hump against the tree. 133134 $ CANDYCandy 's humming softened as she watched him , and her heart beat a little faster . Oh , the fullness of it ! she thought , the terrible , beautiful fullness of life ! And a great mass of feeling rose in her throat at the pity she felt for her father so shut away from it all , never to know life , never even to suspect what it was all about . She put her arms around her delightful body and hugged herself , so glad at being alive , really alive , and her eyes brimmed with shimmeringgratitude . Just then two boys passed the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rain . One of them noticed the hunchback and gave a derisive snort : " Wha'cha doin ' , Mac  --  gittin ' yer nuts off ? " He kept nudging his companion , who would n't even bother to look . " The guy 's gittin ' his nuts off fer chrissake ! " he shouted again as they walked on . The hunchback gazed after them oddly . " Rubatubdubl " he said . " Rubadubtub ! " Candy had n't heard either one of them distinctly , but there was no mistaking the tone of contempt , the obvious effort to hurt and humiliate . " The ignorant fools ! " she said half aloud , and gave a little stamp of impatience . At that moment the bus rounded the corner beyond ; she frowned as she watched it approach , but just before it reached her , she took a deep breath and walked away from the stop , then casually over to where the hunchback was standing . " Hi ! " she said , giving him a wonderfully warm smile and tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain on her face . . . . Was n't it just too much , she thought joyfully , standing here in the rain , in Greenwich Village , 135 CANDYtalking to a hunchback  --  when she should have been at her job ten minutes ago ! . . . She considered the explanation she would have to give , the attempt to make them understand , and she was so happy and proud of herself she could have wept . " That 's my tree , you know , " she said instead , smiling like a mischievous child , then laughing gaily at her own foolishness . " I pretend that it is , " she admitted , almost shyly . " The only tree on Grove Street ! Oh , I do love it so ! " She leaned forward and touched it gently , half closing her eyes , and then she gave the hunchback another tender smile . The shop on this corner of Grove was a man 's underwear shop , and the hunchback 's eyes devoured another crotch or two before he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policewoman . " Rubatubdub ! " he said , agitatinghis hump vigorously against the tree . Getting run in was part of his kick . " Three men in a tub ! " cried Candy , laughing in marvel at their immediate rapport . How simple ! she thought . How wonderfully , beautifully simple the important things are ! And how it had so completely escaped her father ! She would have given twenty years of her life to have shared the richness of this moment with her father  --  he who had said that poems were " impractical " ! The poor darling dummy ! Why only a poem could capture it ! Only a poem could trap the elusiveness , the light-like subtlety , the vapor-edge of a really big thing , and lead it , coax it past . . . a poem , or music perhaps . . . yes , of course , music . And she began to hum softly , swaying her body a little , her fingers dis-136  --  . CANDYtractedly caressing the tree . She felt very relaxed with the hunchback . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray glimmer of hope had died from his eyes , and they narrowed a bit now as he decided , quite simply , that she was a nut . " Hungry , " he said , pointing to his mouth , " hungry . " " Oh ! " cried Candy , suddenly remembering , and she reached into the pocket of her cloak and took out a small paper bag . It was a bag of bread crumbs ; she carried it often for pigeons in Washington Square . " I have this , " she said , her wide eyes beautifully blue and ingenuous . She helped herself first , to show that it was n't mere charity , but rather a human experience , simple , warm , and shared . There was something disconcerting though in the way this hunchback sniggered , rolling his eyes , and squirmed against the tree , wiping his mouth with the back of his hand ; but , after a moment , he took some of the crumbs too . " Rubatubdub ! " he said . Candy laughed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases . It was as though she were behind the scenes of something like the Dadaist movement , even creatively a part of it . This was the way things happened , she thought , the really big things , things that ten years later change the course of history , just this way , on the street corners of the Village ; and here she was , a part of it . How incredibly ironic that her father would have thought she was " wasting her time " ! The notion made her throat tighten and her heart rise up in sorrow for him . " You got quarter , lady ? " asked the hunchback then , nodding his head in anticipation . He held out his hand , 137 CANDYbut Candy was already shaking her curls defensively and fumbling in her purse . " No , I do n't think I have a cent , darn it ! Here 's an Athenean florin , " she said , holding up a lump of silver , then dropping it back into the purse , " 550 B.C. . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Not unless we 're Sappho and Pythagoras and do n't know it ! " And she looked up , closing her purse and shaking her head , happily , as though not having any money herself would actually make them closer . " Are you Pythagoras ? " she asked gaily . " You get your rubadub , do n't you lady ? " muttered the hunchback as he started shuffling away . " Fuckashitpiss ! Fuckashitpiss ! Rubadub , rubadub ! " This struck Candy with such anxiety that for a moment she was speechless . She could not bear the idea of his going away angry , and also in the back of her mind was the pride she would feel if , in a few days , she could be walking down the street with Ted and Harold , or with one of the people from International House , and the hunchback would speak to her by name ; they might even stop and chat a bit , and she would introduce him : " Ted , this is my friend Derek , " or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sightless beggar in Washington Park , being able to recognize Ted 's voice . " Listen , " she cried , hurrying after him , " if you do n't mind potluck , we could have something at my place  --  it 's just past the corner here  --  I know there are some eggs .... " When Candy had slipped out of her cloak and kicked off her shoes , she went into the bathroom . " Wo n't be a min-138 AP CANDYute. " she said , and very soon she reappeared , rubbing her hair with a towel , fluffing it out , her head back , eyes half closed for the moment as she stood there in the middle of the room . " I do n't know which is best , " she said with a luxurious sigh , " the freshness of rain . . . or the warmth of fire . " She had changed into a loose flannel shirt and a pair of tight-fitting faded bluejeans which were rolled up almost to the knee . She had another towel draped across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hunchback 's chair as she crossed the room . " Take off some of your things if you want , " she said airily , " let them dry by the radiator , " and she sat down on the edge of the couch opposite him and rubbed her feet with the towel , doing this carefully and impersonally , as though they were pieces of priceless china which belonged to someone else , yet silhouetting the white curve of her bare legs against the black corduroy couch-cover , and exclaiming genially : " My feet are soaked ! Are n't yours ? " She did n't wait for an answer , nor seemed to expectone , only wanting to maintain a casual chatter to put the hunchback at ease ; she took care not to look at him directly , as she stood up and crossed the room again , indicating with a gesture the magazine stand near his chair : " There 's a PR and Furioso there  --  if you feel like light reading . I 'm afraid there 's not much else at the moment  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared then into the tiny kitchen . The hunchback had been sniggering and squirming about in the chair , and now finally he picked up the towel139 CANDYand wiped his face , then blew his nose into it and spat several times . " Rubatubtub ! " he muttered . Candy 's gay laugh rang from the kitchen . " Wish we had something stronger , " she called out , " we could use it after that rain . " Then she came in with a large bottle of Chianti and two glasses already filled , and set these on the table . " Help yourself to more , " she said , taking a sip of hers . " Umm , good , " she said , and went back into the kitchen , " wo n't be a minute . . . well , not more than five , anyway . " She had turned on the phonosomeGregorian chants  --  and hummed along with the music now as she busied herself , coming in and out , setting the table , and keeping up a spritely monologue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spat it in the towel . Through the open door of the kitchen , Candy could be seen moving about , and now she was bending over to put something into the oven . In the tight jeans , her round little buttocks looked so firm and ripe that any straight-thinking man would have rushed in at once to squeeze and bite them ; but the hunchback 's mind was filled with freakish thoughts . From an emotional standpoint , he would rather have been in the men 's room down at Jack 's Bar on the Bowery , eating a piece of urine-soaked bread while thrusting his hump against someone from the Vice Squad . And yet , though he had decided that she was . nutty ( and because of this she was of no use to his ego ) , he was also vaguely aware that she was a mark ; and , in an obscure , obstacle-strewn way , he was trying to think about this now : how to get the money . He was n't too good at142 $ ' ' CANDY 143 *r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite changed ; they seemed to be streaked with red now , and they were very bright . The precious girl noticed it at once , and she was a little flustered as she sat down , speakingrapidly , pointing to the print : " Is n't this too much ? Look at this figure , here in the corner , most people do n't even . . . " She broke off for a moment to cough and blush terribly as the hunchback 's eyes devoured her , glistening . In an effort to regain composure , she touched her lovely curls and gave a little toss of her head . What can he be thinking ? ' she asked herself . Well , it 's my own fault , darn it ! ' The small eyes of the hunchback blazed ; he was thinking of money . " I love you ! " he said then quickly , the phrase sounding odd indeed . " Oh , darling , do n't say that ! " said Candy , imploring , as though she had been quite prepared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want very much ! " he said , touching her arm at the elbow . She shivered just imperceptibly and covered his hand with her own . " You must n't say that , " she said with softnessand dignity . " I want fuck you ! " he said , putting his other hand on her pert left breast . She clasped his hand , holding it firmly , as she turned to him , her eyes closed , a look of suffering on her face . " No , darling , please " she murmured and she was quite firm . " I want fuck  --  suck you ! " he said , squeezing the breast while she felt the sweet little nipple reaching out like a tiny mushroom . She stood up abruptly , putting her hands to her face . " Do n't . Please do n't , " she said . She stood there a moment , then walked to the window . " Oh why must it be like this ? " she beseeched the dark sky of the failing day . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat it , but the voice of the hunchback came first . " Is because of this ? " he demanded . " Because of this ? " He was sitting there with a wretched expression on his face , and one arm raised and curled behind his head , pointingat his hump . Candy came forward quickly , like a nurse in emergency . " No , you poor darling , of course it is n't ! No , no , " and the impetus of her flight carried her down beside him again and put him in her arms . " You silly darling ! " She closed her eyes , leaning her face against his as she stroked his head . " I had n't even noticed , " she said . " Why , then ? " he wanted to know . " Why ? " Now that she had actually touched him , she seemed more at ease . " Why ? " she sighed . " Oh , I do n't know . Girls are like that , never quite knowing what they want  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want it to be perfect , I guess . " " Because of this , " repeated the hunchback , shrugging heavily . " No , you darling , " she cooed , insisting , closed-eyed again , nudging his cheek with her nose , " no , no , no . What earthly difference does it make ! I have blue eyes  --  you have that . What possible earthly difference does it make ? " " Why ? " he demanded , reaching up under her shirt to grasp one of her breasts , then suddenly pulling her brassiereup and her shoulder back , and thrusting forward to cover the breast with his mouth . Candy sobbed , " Oh darling , no , " but allowed her head to recline gently144 V ' CANDYagainst the couch . " Why does it have to be like this ? " she pleaded . " Why ? Oh , I know it 's my own fault , darn it . " And she let him kiss and suck her breast , until the nipple became terribly taut and she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pulled his head away , cradling it in her arms , her own eyes shimmering with tears behind a brave smile . " No , darling , " she implored , " please . . . not now . " " Because of this , " said the hunchback bitterly . " No , no , no , " she cried , closing her eyes and hugging the head to her breast , holding his cheek against it , but trying to keep his mouth from the proud little nipple , " no , no , not because of that ! " " I want ! " said the hunchback , with one hand on her hip now undoing the side buttons of her jeans ; then he swiftly forced the hand across the panty sheen of her rounded tummy and down into the sweet damp . " Oh , darling , no ! " cried the girl , but it was too late , without making a scene , for anything to be done ; his stubby fingers were rolling the little clitoris like a marble in oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deprive him of this if it meant so much . With her head closed-eyed , resting again on the couch , she would endure it as long as she could . But , before she reached the saturationpoint , he had nuzzled his face down from her breast across her bare stomach and into her lap , bending his arm forward to force down her jeans and panties as he did , pulling at them on the side with his other hand . " No , no , darling ! " she sighed , but he soon had them down below her knees , at least enough so to replace his fingers with his tongue. 145 gC CANDYIt means so much to him , Candy kept thinking , so much , as he meanwhile got her jeans and panties down completely so that they dangled now from one slender ankle as he adjusted her legs and was at last on the floor himself in front of her , with her legs around his neck , and his mouth very deep inside the fabulous honeypot . " If it means so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't think she could bear it another second , and she wrenched herself free , saying " Darling , oh darling , " and seized his head in her hands with a great show of passion . " Oh , why ? " she begged , holding his face in her hands , looking at him mournfully . " Why ? " " I need fuck you ! " said the hunchback huskily . He put his face against the upper softness of her marvelous bare leg . Small , strange sounds came from his throat . " Oh , darling , darling , " the girl keened pitifully , " I ca n't bear your crying . " She sighed , and smiled tenderly , strokinghis head . " I think we 'd better go into the bedroom , " she said then , her manner suddenly prim and efficient . In the bathroom , standing before the glass , Candy finished undressing  --  unbuttoning her shirt , slowly , carefully , a lamb resigned to the slaughter , dropping the shirt to the floor , and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little sigh , almost of wistful regret , at how very lovely she was , and at how her nipples grew and stood out like cherrystones , as they always did when she watched herself undress . How he wants me ! she thought . Well , it 's my own fault , darn it ! And she tried146 gPg ' CANDYto imagine the raging lust that the hunchback felt for her as she touched her curls lightly . Then she cast a last glimpse at herself in the glass , blushing at her own loveliness , and trembling slightly at the very secret notion of this beauty-and-beast sacrifice , she went back into the bedroom . The hunchback was lying naked , curled on his side like a big foetus , when Candy appeared before him , standing for a moment in full lush radiance , a naked angel bearing the supreme gift . Then , she got into bed quickly , under the sheet , almost soundlessly , saying , " Darling , darling , " and cuddling him to her at once , while he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about tubs of living and broken toys , every manner of excrement , scorpions , steelwool , pig-masks , odd metal harness , etc.  --  tried desperately to pry into the images a single reminder : the money ! " Do you want to kiss me some more , darling ? " asked the girl with deadly soft seriousness , her eyes wide , searching his own as one would a child 's . Then she sighed and lay back , slowly taking the sheet from her , again to make him the gift of all her wet , throbbing treasures , as he , glazedeyedand grunting , slithered down beside her . " Do n't hurt me , darling , " she murmured , as in a dream , while he parted the exquisitely warm round thighs with his great head , his mouth opening the slick lips all sugar and glue , and his quick tongue finding her pink candy clit at once . " Oh , darling , darling , " she said , stroking his head gently , watching him , a tender courageous smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gripping the foam-rubber balls of her buttocks , and sucked and nibbled147 S ' CANDYher tiny clit with increasing vigor . Candy closed her eyes and gradually raised her legs , straining gently upward now , dropping her arms back by her head , one to each side , pretendingthey were pinioned there , writhing slowly , sobbing  --  until she felt she was no longer giving , but was on the verge of taking , and , as with an effort , she broke her hands from above her and grasped the hunchback 's head and lifted it to her mouth , coming forward to meet him , kissing him deeply . " Come inside me , darling , " she whispered urgently , " I want you inside me ! " The hunchback , his brain seething with pure strangeness , hardly heard her . He had forgotten about the money , but did know that something was at stake , and his head was about to burst in trying to recall what it was . Inside his mind was like a gigantic landslide of black eels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the answer . His job : catch it ! Catch it , and chew off the top of its head ; and there , in the gurgling cup , would be . . . the message : " You have forgotten about . . . ? " But which eel was it ? While his eyes grew wilder and rolled back until only the whites showed , Candy , thinking that he was beside himself with desire for her , covered his face with sweet wet kisses , until he suddenly went stiff in her arms as his racing look stopped abruptly on the floor near the bed : it was a coat hanger , an ordinary wire coat hanger , which had fallen from the closet , and the hunchbackflung himself out of the bed and onto the floor , clutchingthe hanger to him feverishly . Then , as in a fit of bitter triumph , he twisted it savagely into a single length of coiled black wire , and gripping it so tightly that his entire148 VP CANDYbody shook for a moment , he lunged forward , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the eel . Candy had started up , half sitting now , one hand instinctively to her pert , pulsating breast . " Darling , what is it ? " she cried . " Darling , you are n't going to . . . " The hunchback slowly rose , as one recovered from a seizureof apoplexy , seeming to take account of his surroundingsanew , and , just as he had learned from the eel 's head that the forgotten issue was money , so too he believed now that the girl wanted to be beaten . " Wyly , darling ? " pleaded Candy , curling her lovely legs as the hunchback slowly raised the black wire snake above his head . " Why ? Why ? " she cried . And as he began to strike her across the back of her legs , she sobbed , " Oh , why , darling , why ? " her long round limbs twisting , as she turned and writhed , her arms back beside her head as before , moving too except at the wrist where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was saying : " Yes ! Hurt mel Yes , yesl Hurt me as they have hurt youl " and now her ankles as well seemed secured , shackled to the spot , as she lay , spread-eagled , sobbingpiteously , straining against her invisible bonds , her lithe round body arching upward , hips circling slowly , mouth wet , nipples taut , her teeny piping clitoris distendedand throbbing , and her eyes glistening like fire , as she devoured all the penitence for each injustice ever done to hunchbacks of the world ; and as it continued she slowly opened her eyes , that all the world might see the tears there  --  but instead she herself saw , through the rise and fail of the wire lash  --  the hunchback 's white gleaming humpl The hump , the white , unsunned forever , radish-root white149 $V CANDYof hump , and it struck her , more sharply than the wire whip , as something she had seen before  --  the naked , juttiIIg buttocks , upraised in a sexual thrust , not a thrust of takII1g , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital room mirror , of her own precious buttocks , naked and upraised , gleaming white , and thrusting downwards , as she had been made to do in giving herself to her Uncle JacklWith a wild impulsive cry , she shrieked : " Give me your hump ! " The hunchback was startled for a moment , not comprehending . " Your hump , your hump ! " cried the girl , " GIVE ME YOUR HUMP ! " The hunchback hesitated , and then lunged headlong towardher , burying his hump between Candy 's legs as she hunched wildly , pulling open her little labias in an absurd effort to get it in her . " Your hump ! Your hump ! " she kept crying , scratching and clawing at it now . " Fuck ! Shitl Piss ! " she screamed . " Cuntl Cockl Crapl Prickl Kikel Niggerl Wop ! Hump !

She lay back , thinkingover the events of the afternoon . Well , it 's my own fault , darn it , she sighed , then smiled a little smile of forgivenessat herself  --  but this suddenly changed to a small frown , and she sat up in bed , cross as a pickle . " Darn id " she said aloud , and with real feeling , for she had forgotten to have them exchange names. elevenIIAfter freshening up a bit , Candy left the apartment and started walking down West 4th Street . The rain had stopped , and a cool gentle breeze was blowing ; apparently it was going to be a lovely evening indeed . It was too late now of course to think about the job ; in fact , it was almost dark when she reached the corner of Sixth Avenue , and she decided , quite on impulse , to stop in at the Riviera and have a Pernod . Jack Katt and Tom Smart were there , at a front table , lushing it up and keen for puss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided . They were extraordinarily handsome and clever chaps , and Candy alone seemed immune to their undeniable charm ; this was a constant source of annoyance to them . Now , when she entered , they graciously invited her to join them , but she refused . She wanted to sit quietly alone and cherish the memory of the past few hours with . . . but she didn't153154 $P CANDYhave the name to conjure with ! And that was the blight on the experience , for she kept thinking of him now simply as " the hunchback , " and every time the word formed in her mind she was cross enough with herself to bite . She did n't like thinking of him that way . What earthly difference could it makel she kept demanding , pouting her pretty mouth and clenching her small fist on the bar . Then she recalled the name she had given him , " Derek , " and was happy with that for the moment , smiling again and sipping her drink . " What the deuce is wrong with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the girl and had seen the gamut of emotions flit across her face . " Nothing that you would understand , " replied Candy imperiously ; she did n't like the looks of this fellow , nor his forward manner . She lowered her eyes to the glass in her hand and quite ignored him ; but he walked around the bar and looked frowningly down at the stool she was sitting on . " Anything wrong ? " Candy asked , and with an icy hauteurshe knew would send a shiver up his spine . " Apparently not , " he replied easily , though without relaxinghis consideration altogether . " Somehow , from the gamut of emotions which crossed your face , I had the idea the stool had slipped up into your damp . " " I beg your pardon ? " said Candy , not comprehending , but even so not too keen on the fellow 's tone . " You know , " insisted the bartender , going back behind the bar again , " your puss , your jelly-box ... I thought the stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other night , a hefty babe was sitting here at the155 CANDYbar . .. not on the stool you 're on , but the next one , and I was watching her . Well , she seemed to gradually sink dozen toward the floor , you know , as though the stool itself were going right through the floor , and . . . well , as I say , I was watching her , and , by God , a veritable gamut of emotionswas crossing her face while this was happening . . . and what had happened was that somehow the stool had slipped or pushed up into her jelly-box , right up inside it , taking all the clothes with it , skirt , slip , panties and all , right up into her thing . . . the whole seat of the stool and about a foot of the legs . Christ , I never saw anything like it before ! Of course , she was a good deal heavier than you , in fact , a lot heavier . She was a hefty babe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her thoughts about Derek and the afternoon behind them , and she was quick to let her expression reflect the annoyance she felt ; but she allowed him to ramble on , not following the words at all , because she did n't care for this chap 's tone . She supposed that he needed her in a way , but she would n't think about that now , she was too full at the moment , too full and warm from . . . she recalled Professor Mephesto 's words , " from this wonderful business of living . " She thought of herself for the moment as a lovely , contented cat . . . snuggled warm before the fire in her furabout , purring happily ; she could have hugged herself . Yet on anotherlevel she did feel that the general ambience of the bar was somehow degrading to the experience of the afternoon , the experience she wanted so much to keep pure and whole , to nurture and fondle , privately , as one might a newborn babe of one 's own . She knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riviera bar , and she156 $7 CANDYdecided she would see if any good foreign films were playingat the local art movie-houses . She went over to the table where Jack Katt and Tom Smart were sitting and inquired . Of course they had no notion of what was playing at the art cinemas , or anywhere else for that matter , being out only for cheap strong lush and slick tight puss . But they pretended they knew all about the various programs and insisted that Candy sit down while they discussed it . Then the suave Tom Smart leaned forward and spoke confidingly to the girl : " I 'd sure like to dip my jumbo into that hot little honeypot of yours tonightl " " No , no , " said Jack Katt , his dark fire-glint eyes flashing with an impatience which would have made most girls tingle and cream , " let me handle this ! " And he tried to pull the handsome Tom Smart away and at the same time actually attempted to thrust his hand into Candy 's sweet little blouse . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was simply their way of expressing a need for her , but she did n't care for this sort of talk at any time , and especially not now when all her thoughts were with Derek . " Good Christ Almighty , " exclaimed Tom Smart , turning to his companion , " will you let me handle this ! Now you 've offended her ! Christl " " You ! " shouted Jack Katt . " You and your damned oblique approach l I want Muss ! " And so they fell to arguing and discussing the tactic , though to Candy it was a respite and she pursued her reflectionson the hours past . She hardly noticed when they were joined at the table a157 $7- CANDYfete minutes later by another person , Dr. Howard Johns , a pleasant , middle-aged chap , certainly not the looker that Tom and Jack were , but perhaps more stable , and no doubt more comfortable for a young girl to be with . Nor did Candy catch his name at first , if in fact these two even troubled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , do you know what he is ? " asked Tom Smart , after a minute , speaking to Candy . " A gynecologist ! Haha-ha ! " " Good Grief , " said Candy . " Sure , " said Tom Smart , and turning to the doctor , went on in his winningly irrepressible way , " how would you like to look up that snatch , Doc ? Boy , it 's honey and cream ! " " It 's a living snakel " said Jack Katt . This seemed to embarrass the doctor somewhat and he shifted uneasily in his chair . " Well , " said Candy , " I 've never met a .. . a gynecologistsocially . How do you do ? " " Are you kidding ? " shouted Tom Smart . " How does he do ? He gets more pussy in three hours than most chaps do in a week ! Right , Doc ? " " Now , really , Tom , Jack , " said Dr. Johns , " I mean , fun is fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn the conversation had taken . " I think you boys are terrible , " said Candy indignantly , and she got up and went to another table . " Good Godl " cried Jack Katt . " Now you 've lost that hot puss for usl Christl Christl " " What ! Whad " said Tom Smart . " I lost it ? Great Scott man , do n't you realize that if . .. " 158 AC CANDYAnd so they would discuss it for hours on end . Meanwhile , Dr. Johns got up and joined Candy at the other table . " Well , " he said , " they are certainly . . . certainly outgoingchaps , I must say . I 'm terribly sorry about that . Really ... I hardly ... " " Oh they 're just silly boys , " said Candy , " it 's just their way of trying to . . . trying to express themselves .. . aesthetically , I suppose . " " Hmm , " said Dr. Johns , glancing at them again . They were scuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer and sawdust , shouting remarks about " tight quim , " " hot puss , " etc. , etc . Both Candy and the doctor looked away . " Do you happen to know what 's playing at the 5th Avenue Cinema ? " she asked . " No , I 'm afraid I do n't , " said Dr. Johns . " Sorry . " " I 'd like so much to see a good film tonight , " said the girl . " I do n't go to the films much myself , " he said . " Enjoy them , do you ? " " Well , of course , I only go to the art films , " said Candy . " I see , " said Dr. Johns . " Films like The Quiet One , and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . " " Well , " said Dr. Johns , " would you like me to go and get a paper for you ? It would probably be listed there . " " Oh no , " said Candy , " that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased by his consideration . " Are you sure ? " he asked . " Oh yes , thanks . I 'm sure someone will come in who159 ' CANDYknows what 's playing there tonight . I know almost everyone who comes in here . " " I 'm afraid I do n't , " said the doctor . " Oh , you 'll get to know them , " said Candy , " they 're all swell kids . " " Yes , I 'd like to , " he said , rather dubiously . " Who is your doctor ... perhaps I know him . " " Well , I have n't been to a doctor since I 've been in New York .. . not to a gynecologist anyway . I 'm not married , of course , and . .. well , I suppose a single girl does n't need to go to a gynecologist very often , does she ? " In spite of her smile , the perfect girl was blushing . Dr. Johns frowned . " Well , of course , you really should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean certainly you should have that . When was the last time you did ? " " Oh gracious , " said Candy , trying to recall , " it must have been a year ago at least . " " Far too long , far too long , " said the doctor seriously . " Gosh , guess Pd better make an appointment , " said Candy . " Hmm . The difficulty is , you see , I 'm off on two months ' holiday starting tomorrow , " said Dr. Johns . He looked around the bar . " I 'll tell you what , " he said , getting up from the table , " I wo n't be a moment , " and he went out the door . Candy was humming the theme music of Alexander Nevsky , one of her favorite movies , when Dr. Johns came back in the bar , carrying a little black bag . He stopped at the table and smiled at her . " We can give you an examination , " he said , " just over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
