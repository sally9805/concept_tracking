CENTURIES OF CHILDHOOD ( 447 pp. ) - Philippe Aries-Knopf ( $8.50 ) . <P> <P> A man of the Middle Ages , dropped into the modern world , might gape at the jets and TV sets . But what would really set him back on his heels is the attitude of the modern family toward its children . <P> For if no culture in history has been so child-centered as the Spock-marked society of contemporary America , few have been so careless of their children as that of medieval Europe . How Western man moved from then to now is the subject of this rich piece of French scholarship by Social Historian Philippe Aries . <P> Sex for the Innocent . In medieval France , painters were so ignorant of what a child was that they had no idea how to paint him . A 12th century miniature depicting the New Testament scene in which Jesus says , " Suffer little children ... to come unto me , " shows Jesus surrounded by eight small men ; newborn infants were commonly painted with the musculature of grownups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Scholar Aries , is that during the Middle Ages , and for a long time afterward among the lower classes , children were thrown into the adult world at the age of six or seven , not long after their long-postponed weaning and as soon as they could get along without their mothers or nurses . Until the 17th century , they wore the same clothes as grownups . <P> Medieval society made no attempt to shield its children from sex . Adults commonly carried on sexual relations in front of them and thought their children 's own forms of sexual play were enormously amusing . " There were two reasons for this , " writes Aries . " In the first place , the child under the age of puberty was believed to be unaware of or indifferent to sex . . . Secondly , the idea did not yet exist that references to sexual matters . . . could soil childish innocence ; nobody thought that this innocence really existed . " Blackboard Jungle . But toward the close of the 15th century , a new attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent , and their innocence should be protected ; second , that they had character , which should be strengthened and formed . <P> At the same time , says Historian Aries , another process had been going on-the development of the family . Family life in medieval Europe was submerged in the moiling world of society as a whole . Even in the 17th century , it was an extremely public thing . Houses flowed with people ; visitors might arrive at any hour of the day or night , and the interconnecting rooms-except for the kitchens-were completely unspecialized . Beds were set up anywhere and everywhere , four or more to a room ; they were collapsible and were often taken down and moved after being slept in . Meals were eaten on any table that happened to be handy , and in any room at practically any time a couple or two might be sleeping , another group eating , and a third entertaining visitors and dancing . <P> The Beginning of Comfort . But in the 18th century , the family began to push back the intruders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed ; rooms began to open on corridors , so that someone going from one end of the house to the other did not have to traipse through every room in between .
