Long on nerve if sometimes short of cash , Italy 's state-owned petroleum combine , ENI ( for Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi ) , elbowed its way into the international petroleum business by adventurous gambles . Buying huge shipments of Soviet oil , it also offered cut-rate competition to Western oil majors for drilling and refining rights in Africa , Asia . Just over a year ago , ENI created a subsidiary , Snam Progetti , * to build refineries , pipelines and petrochemical plants-even for rivals . Quickly catching on , Progetti is now busy with $360 million of construction projects on four continents . Last week the yearling firm opened a U.S. branch in Manhattan , partly at the urging of such American oil firms as Esso , Phillips and Amoco , for whom it has been building abroad . <P> Milan-based , Progetti capitalizes on speed , sharp figuring and salesmanship . The company snatched a deal for a $51 million , 500-mi . Syrian pipeline away from a British firm by offering to install it in half the time at lower cost . Beating out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refinery contract , Progetti agreed to complete the 2 million-ton plant in two years . The company has also pushed into the European market with a $4,000,000 pipeline in France , a $2,500,000 undersea line in Spain and a $3,000,000 factory job in West Germany . <P> Heading up 7,800 worthwhile employees , Progetti 's General Manager Franco Salimbeni , 39 , shuttles constantly between far-flung sites to keep things moving . " That way I know what the problems are before they are reported to me , " he explains . <P> Having the Italian government as chief stockholder of parent ENI also helps . Two state agencies , Mediobanca and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano last week agreed to lend Zambia $30 million to pay Progetti for an oil pipeline from landlocked Zambia to Dar es Salam on the Tanzania coast . <P> <P> *So named because it grew out of the engineering projects ( in Italian , progetti ) division of the former Societa Nazionale Meta-nodotti , another ENI subsidiary .                   @ @
