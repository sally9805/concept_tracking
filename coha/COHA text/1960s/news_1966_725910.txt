txt Goshen , Ind. , Nov. 9 Special - Five prisoners broke out of the Elkhart county jail last night by bending apart their cell bars . Almost exactly a year ago , five other inmates had removed the same bars to escape . None of the newly departed has been heard from . While local officials , including the sheriff and his chief deputy were savoring their political victories or defeats in yesterday 's election , the five prisoners quietly made some changes in their own status . Bunk Torn Loose Some time after midnight , they apparently tore loose a steel bunk in an upstairs cell block and used it to pry apart cell bars . The bars were those which five prisoners had sawed on Nov. 2 , 1965 . They bent last night where they had been welded back into place . Crawling thru the opening they had fashioned , the five climbed to a second floor catwalk , pushed open a window leading to a roof , and leaped 14 feet to the ground . A turnkey was in his office about 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither Sheriff Woody Caton nor Chief Deputy Howard Salisbury normally are on duty at the jail at night . But both had been engrossed in yesterday 's election in which the sheriff , the only Democratic winner in the county , was elected county clerk , and the chief deputy , also a Democrat , failed in his bid to become sheriff . Sheriff Is Hunting The sheriff was absent on a hunting trip in Montana when the other break occurred a year ago . That year he was selected as Indiana 's " sheriff of the year , " not for his success in keeping prisoners confined , but for his work in the deadly Palm Sunday tornadoes . Four of the five inmates who fled jail a year ago were recaptured . As in those cases , the five who slipped away last night were awaiting trial on such charges as car theft , burglary and forgery . Authorities hope to make a better record in their recapture , eventually . Meantime , they are in the market for some better metal in jail bars .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
