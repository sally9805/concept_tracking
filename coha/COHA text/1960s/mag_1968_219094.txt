THE HIGHWAY <P> Speeding motorists will now have to contend with another highway-patrol device , one that has proved considerably more accurate than simple speedometer pacing and more flexible in operation than radar tracking . It is known as VASCAR ( Visual Average Speed Computer And Recorder ) and consists of a small computer mounted in the front seat of a patrol car . By measuring time and distance and then converting them into an average-speed reading , it can clock automobiles coming , going or even crossing . <P> VASCAR is not only versatile ; it is also easy to operate . When a cruising patrolman spots a car as much as a mile ahead and moving away from him fast , he waits for the suspected speeder to flash past a clearly defined landmark , such as an intersection , streetlamp , tree or signpost . The officer then flicks on the time switch , flicks it off when his quarry passes a second roadmark . Time is thus locked into VASCAR 's computer . To measure the distance between the two reference points , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first point , turns it off as he passes the second . Now the patrol car 's odometer has fed distance into VASCAR , which at the push of a third button automatically computes the average speed at which the motorist traveled the measured distance . <P> Test by Trials . By following the same procedure , highway police can get the speed of approaching cars . If the patrolman has measured and locked in the distance between two fixed points in advance , he can park unobtrusively off the road , clock the speed of motorists simply by turning the timer on and off as they go past . Already in use in 14 states and now being evaluated by 33 others , VASCAR , which was invented by Arthur M. Marshall , a Richmond real estate agent and lifelong tinkerer , will soon come out in a more sophisticated form , with a digital computer and readout substituted for the current mechanical computer . <P> But even with the present model , VASCAR has been used with striking results . In North Carolina , where the state highway patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrests increased substantially , and as a consequence auto accident fatalities dropped sharply to 142 from 214 the previous December . The device is so accurate that in New York , out of 1,000 motorists arrested through VASCAR , not one has yet disputed his citation . How accurate ? Well , Indiana , which has 21 of the units and has ordered 100 more ( at $895 each ) , tested the computer against the Indianapolis Speedway 's ultrasophisticated electronic timers during the trials for the last 500-mile race . Timing the Indy race cars at speeds of up to 150 m.p.h. , VASCAR was within decimals of the official track clocks .
