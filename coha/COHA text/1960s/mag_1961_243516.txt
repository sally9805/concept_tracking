" A man 's mind , stretched by a new idea ; can never go back to its original dimension . " <P> <P> - Oliver Wendell Holmes , quoted in the luncheon program of the American TV Commercials Festival . <P> <P> At first thought , and at second thought too , a festival of TV commercials is as appealing as a festival of anthrax germs . Yet last week a ballroom full of people gathered for such a rite at Manhattan 's Hotel Roosevelt and sat voluntarily through 100 commercials in a row . They shouted " great " and " terrific " because a pitch for Ban deodorant used a documentary technique and private-eye oboes to amplify uneasiness about " being close . " They rhapsodized in terms that John Ruskin might have used to describe Venice at the sight of margarine oozing down a stack of pancakes in a Blue Bonnet ad . And when Mike Nichols and Elaine May did their spiel for a Jax beer cartoon , involving a surrealistic flirtation between a female waitress and a male kangaroo ( " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl suit ? " ) , voices in the audience had a cathedral hush : " This is real entertainment . " <P> <P> Nearly everyone present was in the ad business , but the enthusiasm was not entirely faked . What was remarkable about the parade of commercials was that they had been made with so much more imagination , humor , photographic skill and musical talent than the programs they were designed to interrupt . The cinematography in a Prell shampoo blurb was visual poetry as it showed , with crystalline acuity , each gob of goo sinking into each coil of hair . There was the pathos of Willy Loman in a Metrecal pitch called the Lonely Man ( commercials have titles these days ) , which showed a forlorn , overweight figure trudging through Central Park on a cheerless winter day while a narrator spoke of blubber in tones of quiet reasonableness . <P> Perhaps surprisingly , a number of commercials did not prejudice the viewer irrevocably against their product . Martini &; Rossi 's ad was clever : a vermouth crate is shown aboard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crate ( one speculates vainly on why its owner is inside ) and grabs for an M &; R bottle that is sliding toward an open porthole . The viewer thinks the bottle will fall over board . It does , in some commercials ; but sometimes the ad is shown with a happy ending . A cartoon for Puss ' n Boots cat food shows a little man eating a can of Puss ' n Boots . A voice asks why he , a man , is doing this . Instead of replying that the cat food is so good that he prefers it to filet mignon , or something equally trite , the little man peels off his face . " I 'm not a man , " he says . " I 'm a cat dressed up for a masquerade ball . " The viewer is left to brood that although this tiny bit of cartooned lonesco may not be the funniest thing ever written , it is , pound for pound , a great deal better than Gunsmoke.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
