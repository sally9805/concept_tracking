" Dr- Hall is an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University 's College of Physicians and Surgeons and president of the Association for the Study of Abortion Reform . Dr. Jules Rivkind , an assistant attending obstetrician and gynecologist at St. Vincent 's Hospital , contends that abortion reform will make contraception unnecessary and says that the present law gives one " a sense of responsibility for one 's action . " He adds that abortion reform will increase licentiousness and promiscuity and thereby increase misery and suffering . A different view was taken in a joint statement by Dr. Edgar H.

" Some Called Hoaxes Dr. Pisani and Dr. Hall , who are two of the principal medical opponents in the abortion debate , agree that therapeutic abortions are " a hoax . " A therapeutic abortion is one allowed under law to preserve the life of the mother . " We can get a cardiac patient through her pregnancy , tuberculosis is no longer a problem , and if a woman is potentially suicidal we can lock her up for nine months , " Dr. Hall said .

By comparison , therapeutic abortions were performed on 4.361. white women who were not Puerto Ricans . During this period . 169 therapeutic abortions were performed in the city 's 21 muni-1 principal hospitals . which have 18,000 beds : 2,755 therapeutic abortions were performed in the voluntary hospitals , with 18.000 , beds , and 1.731 in proprietary hospitals , with 4.500 beds .

These women , rich and poor ; are among the one million American women who obtained abortions last year , despite restrictive laws in the 50 states , according to an estimate by Dr. Christopher Tietze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable data . He said that criminal abortions exceeded legal abortions by about 100 to 1 and that two-thirds of the patients were married women . Dr. Tietze is associate director of the biomedical division of the Population Council and a former research director of the National Committee on Maternal Health . The total number of abortions has declined in recent years , Dr. Tietze noted , due to an increase in the quality and availability of birth control methods , a trend toward early marriage and larger families , and stricter law enforcement . Heightened efforts are nevertheleess ? being made to liberalize abortitn laws in nine states ? Connecticut , New Jersey . California . Pennsylvania , Florida , Indiana ; Georgia , Arizona , and New York . The proposed changes are being debated not only in the Legislatures but also in churches , on college campuses , in living rooms and in hospitals . The 84-year-old New York law , which permits abortion only to preserve the life of the mother , was enacted  --  medical historians point out  --  when diabetes , heart and kidney disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when psychiatry was in its infancy , antibiotics were unknown and abortion entailed greater risks . An attempt to liberalize the New York law will meet a crucial test tomorrow , when efforts will be made to bring the proposed legislation out of the codes committee of the AssemThe New York Times TELLS OF DEATHS : Dr. Milton Helpern , the city 's Chief Medical Examiner , said that some abortion deaths were disguised as suicides or natural deaths . bly . The bill would broaden the , current law by including additional grounds for abortion . such as when there is substantial risk that the woman 's mental or physical health would be impaired by the pregnancy or when the infant might be born defective or when the pregnancy resulted from incest or rape . Proponents of the reform leg islation are pessimistic , largely because of the determined opposition of the Roman Catholic church , which ? considers abortion a mortal sin . In their first pastoral letter ever issued jointly , the Catholic bishops of the state 's eight dioceses urged the state 's 6.5 million Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate " the unborn child 's God-given right . " The Catholic Welfare Committee called " the unspeakable crime of abortion the new ' slaughter of the innocents . ' " Medical opponents of abortion say that " all clinical experience shows that abortion is a mental wound as well as a physical wound , " in the words of peutic abortions in the voluntary hospitals showed that 242 were performed on ward patients and 2,432 on private patients . This study was made by the city 's Health Department and published in the American Journal of Public Health in July , 1965 . Asked to explain why so few therapeutic abortions are performed in municipal hospitals , Dr. Harvey Gollance , the deputy hospitals commissioner , explained that " the patients who come to us do n't know enough to ask for therapeutic abortions , " and added , " By the time we get them , somebody else already has tried to abort them . " Physician 's Word Needed Oscar Gottfried , the director of the Association of Private Hospitals , said that proprietary hospitals did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals were " very wary " of applications for legal abortions . The United Hospital Fund , an association of voluntary hospitals , said through Oscar W. Heimlich , an associate executive director , that each hospital had its own policy . To obtain a legal abortion , a patient must get the recommendation of a physician , such as a. psychiatrist or heart specialist , attesting that her life is in jeopardy because of the pregnancy . This application is then presented to the hospital 's abortion board , usually consisting . of 3 to 12 members , which holds a hearing to decide whether the abortion is warranted . These boards seek to limit the number of legal abortions because . according to medical authorities , they do not want to gain the reputation of being institutions where legal abortions are easily obtainable . In fact , since these boards were established , in the mid-1950 's , the number of therapeutic abortions has been reduced nationally by two-thirds . 100 Times as Many Psychiatric grounds arc the most common in applications for therapeutic abortions . They make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The application is made on the basis that a patient is potentially suicidal . Medical authorities agree that this is often a ruse and that psychiatrists merely feel that their patients are not emotionally ready for motherhood . They point out that this is a long step from averting suicide or , in the words of the present law . " preserving the life of the mother . " For every woman who receives a legal hospital abortion , 100 women obtain illegal ones , Dr. Tietze said . In the predominantly Puerto Rican southeast Bronx , 700 women were admitted last year with incomplete abortions to Lincoln Hospital , according to Dr. Joseph Smith , the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at that hospital . Some of the women arrived with perforated uteri , having injured themselves with crude instruments , Dr. Smith said . " Miraculously , we lost only one case last year , from tetanus , " he said . However , some of the women saved can never again bear children . Dr. Milton Helpern , the city 's Chief Medical Examiner , said that between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that every suet : - den or unexpected death of a woman of child-bearing age was examined with the possibility of having been caused by an abortion . Some abortion deaths were disguised as suicides , he said , while others were disguised as natural deaths . Doctors Risk Jail For a woman of means who can not obtain hospital approval , the search for an abortionist usually begins with her family physician , who rarely performs abortions even on patients of long standing . These doctors sometimes defy the law  --  and risk a maximum of four years in jail ? by referring the women to gynecologists who perform a . " D and C , " ( a dilate and curretage ) in a voluntary or proprietary hospital . In one such hospital , which recently ended a Saturday-morning practice because of fear of a governmental investigation , the fee was $1,500 . This 20-minute procedure , ordinarily used to remove cysts and as a hygienic measure , also will abort a fetus . The patient , anesthetized to eliminate all pain , is protected against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one night . The D and C for abortion is performed in the first three months of pregnancy . ThereafI ter , the standard technique is Ia. y hsterotomy , or miniature Caesarian , requiring a small incision in the lower abdomen . Like Apartment Hunting The woman whose family physician can not locate a gynecologist to perform a D and C as an abortion often searches for an abortionist in the same manner that she searches for an apartment . Sometimes she settles for druggist , midwife or nurse . " You ask everyone you know , " said a married woman who had obtained an abortion because she felt that her marriage was destined to fail . This procedure also was followed by the happily married mother of two children . She said : " Another child would have devastated us economically . " College girls who can not confide in their family physicians often have access to a student grapevine , and interne friends are sometimes helpful . " We do n't recommend an abortionist , " said a. college physician at New York University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dormitories . " College Girls Interviewed A number of college students last week agreed to be interviewed on the abortion situation . A Wellesley College girl said : " There 's usually one girl who knows how to find an abortionist . " A Vassar girl said that it was " easy to locate " an abortionist . But some girls experienced difficulty . A Barnard girl said that she endured great emotional strain before finding an abortionist , because " every morning . I 'd wake up and think , my God , we have one day less . " Most abortionists willing to accommodate these college girls are " a pretty sorry crew , " in the view of Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher , president of Planned Parenthood . Many of them need large sums of money to support various habits  --  drugs , alcohol , women ? Dr. Guttmacher said . Others are sadists . Some abortionists announce they are raising-their fees while performing an abortion . Others needlessly perform a D and C on girls who are not pregnant but ! who think they are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New ! England girls ' college insists ' that the patient end ' ire the pain . after delivering Biblical lectures on the evils or sinning , according to two patients . " There is no nurse . no anesthetic ; you 're tied down , with rope , " a college girl said. ; He charged her $425 . Did 28,000 Abortions On the other hand , there is one practitioner commonly known as " the saint , " who recently retired after performing more than 28,000 abortions in a small Pennsylvania town . For almost 30 years he charged $10. raised the fee to $30 a decade ago and then to $100 when the expenses of a lawsuit and antibiotics sharply increased his overhead . He is Dr. Robert D. Spencer. , who said in a telephone interview last week that he had performed abortions on persons ! from all walks of life --  --  " from illiterates to women sent by judges , brokers . ministers , even priests  --  they 're human too . " Dr. Spencer , who is protected by his community where his practice Ls well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some middlemen allegedly attempted to make a profit , charging girls $800 and pocketing the difference . The suit was never brought to trial because of lack of evidence . " I think it 's a much greater crime to bring people into the world you ca n't take care of than to help them , " Dr. Spencer said . " Unwanted babies bring more people misery and lead to ruined lives . " Feeling of Depression But abortions also can lead to misery . " There is a tremendous feeling of depression and a complete change of outlook , " said the Vassar girl . " There 's a feeling that all your friends disapprove . Sleeping around is approved , but not abortion . " A Columbia senior , who had got in touch with an abortionist through a. middleman in a parking lot in New Jersey , said that after the abortion , she " cried for hours . " " Those who go through a minimum of agony are those who feel free to tell their parents , " said the Wellesley girl . She then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too inhibited to elicit birth-control information . Dr. Marjory Nelson , chief health officer at Barnard College , observed that " the emotional impact may not hit them right away , but they get delayed depression and guilt . " Some of this stems from the fact that an abortion often signals the end of a relationship with a man . " They do n't fear venereal disease or pregnancy , " Dr. Nelson said . " They fear desertion . They 've got to have someone to hold onto . Fidelity is the most important thing . " In Other Countries Medical opponents in the abortion controversy point to ' the experience of other countries in support of their arguments . A slight drop in fertility has been reported in Japan . where the abortion rate now exceeds the birth rate . Last year , there were 1.6 million births and nearly 2 million abortions . Some women have three , four and five in a year . The illegal abortion rate has remained the same in Scandinavia , where abortions are legal to preserve life or health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . The rate is 2 illegal abortions for every 1.000 live births . Some Scandinavian women obtain abortions behind the Iron Curtain . In the Soviet Un- , ion , Bulgaria and Hungary , : abortion is permitted simply at ! the woman 's request . In Poland. : the law requires that a woman ; be in " a difficult social situa. tion , " in order to have an a.b ? Srtion . In Czechoslovakia , the law is more restrictive , but Eael Germany and Albania are thc only two countries within the Russian orbit in which legal abortion is still difficult achieve . Supported by Many Groups Abortion-law reform-has beri supported by the New York Academy of Medicine , the New York County Medical Society , the New York State Medical Society , the New York Obstetrical Society , the New Ydrk Gynecological Society and . in polls by 90 per cent of tie state 's psychiatrists and 85 pee cent of the gynecologists . One gynecologist observed that when women were unable to get hospitals to perform a therapeutic abortion he found " it degradinz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you have to , if you have any conscience about it . " Dr. Pisani , on the other hand , states : " Some day I would like .1. o hear a whole board of experts tell me exactly what they think abortion accomplishes . For myself , I know : a dead child . - le is using poor logic and poorer medicine to say that the baby should not have been conceived and therefore should not pc born . " The medical profession ha = been facing the dilemma of abortion reform for years . The issue is now moving into the public arena . " The next step is the obligation of the Legislature , " Dr. Rashbaum said .
