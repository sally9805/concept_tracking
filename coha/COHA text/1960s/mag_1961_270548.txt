" There is no such thing , " Mark Rothko once said , " as good painting about nothing . " Yet if there is a painter alive who appears to be painting nothing , it is Rothko . Line , subject , perspective-all are gone ; says Rothko himself : " You have here nothing-but content . " <P> Last week 54 of Rothko 's paintings were on display at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , showing 15 years of the development of a man who is one of the top half-dozen abstract painters in the U.S.-one who has created a personal idiom that pleases the initiated but to the others dramatizes some of the limitations of abstractionism . In canvas after canvas , glowing rectangles of color float over other rectangles . Each canvas is a study in contradiction : everything seems in shimmering motion , but nothing moves at all . The paintings offer windows looking out on blind space , but remain as two-dimensional and flat as the canvas itself . The same formula seems to be repeated over and over again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as remote and silent as some forgotten civilization , but if contemplated long enough , they do cast a certain spell . <P> Yale &; Starvation . Rothko 's father was a Russian Jewish pharmacist who took his family to the U.S. in 1913 . Rothko grew up in Portland , Ore. , with nary a thought of becoming an artist : he wanted to be a labor leader . He attended Yale , dropped out to ' ' wander around , bum about , starve a bit . " It was not until 1925 , when he was 22 , that he settled down in Manhattan to attend Max Weber 's art classes at the Art Students League . He did not stay long . As a painter , Mark Rothko is almost wholly self-taught . <P> He began as a realist ( " That was what we inherited " ) , passed through a stage that was " allied to surrealism , " finally went wholly abstract . By 1947 he was already turning out compositions of floating colors . In the years since , Rothko has achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more complicated fashion . ' ' In our inheritance we have space , a box in which things are going on , " he says . " In my work there is no box ; I do not work with space . There is a form without the box , and possibly a more convincing kind of form . " <P> Rembrandt 's a Noun . Rothko worries a good deal about the notion of image . " ' Rembrandt ' has become a noun , " says he , " a noun that conjures up a particular kind of painting . ' Rembrandt ' has become an image . " So , indeed , in a smaller way has Rothko , and this automatically places a limit on his striving toward the limitless . To Rothko , almost everything depends on the viewer 's being able to approach a painting as a pure and unique experience , for which he should not be prepared . The impact of color , the electric shimmer of an edge , the intensity of a shape must alone bear the message . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewer should recognize nothing , there should be no barriers to his flight . <P> But how much flight can a viewer get ? Even on Rothko 's own terms , his image , once seen , is only too recognizable in the next painting , and the essential innocence of the viewer is destroyed . The spell is there - it simply does not last .
