Parents are again preparing for the occasion . It will occur this coming Sunday for the seventh straight year , and the children , with a special restlessness , will collect around the television set in much the way that their fathers do for the professional football championships . The children know the names and styles of the players they are going to see , for the program has become a modern institution and a red-letter event in the calendar of childhood . It is the Oz Bowl game , CBS 's annual telecast of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 's The Wizard of Oz . <P> From the dance of the rusty robot to Ray Bolger 's tumbling scarecrow and Bert Lahr 's campy lion , the children will greet most of it with a knowing and unexcited air . When Judy Garland sang Over the Rainbow last year , a three-year-old female sophisticate said : " She always wears her hair in braids , you know . " But Judy 's Dorothy , as a matter of surprising fact , is not the uppermost character in the children 's minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosted cornflake . <P> Meltless Memory . Before the broadcast , the children talk most of all about the Wicked Witch of the West-and when they do , they quiver . " I 'm scared of the witch , " said a five-year-old girl . By the time the hideous chick with the black eyebrows and the scimitar nose appears on the screen , three-year-olds will whinny , " Mommy , I 'm scared , " while barely articulate one-year-olds chant " Scared ! Scared ! " <P> To be fair to them , The Wizard of Oz really is a horror story , with this grackle-voiced , green-skinned , chin-warted apparition hurling fire from rooftops , skywriting ominously with a flaming broom , or saying : " Now , my beauties , something with poison in it . Heh ! Heh ! Heh ! " Hearing that , one child remembered hopefully , if a bit inexactly , that " last year Dorothy and the Wizard poured hot water on her and she melted . " The Wicked Witch will melt again this year , but not from the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ding , dong , the Witch is dead , " only to stop the melody and ask : " Is she really dead ? " <P> Den Mother . Ding , dong , she is n't , indeed . She lives at 34 Gramercy Park in Manhattan . Mothers sometimes take their children to call on her so that she-Actress Margaret Hamilton , now 62 - can pacify their inchoate neuroses and assure them that she is not in carnate evil after all . She made Oz when she was 36 , and worked in Hollywood for years afterward as everybody 's " cantankerous cook or acidulous aunt , " in her words , " with a corset of steel and a heart of gold . " Today she does character parts in the theater and on TV . Before the election , she made several appearances on NBC 's That Was the Week That Was , impersonating formidable Republican ladies and the like . <P> Before she started acting years ago , the broomless Miss Hamilton was a kindergarten teacher in Cleveland . Inspired by seeing Gertrude Lawrence , she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she was soon stirring away as the First Witch in Macbeth . That typed her , but dramatic witchcraft could not change her basic character . She not only went on to become the hag of the half-century , she also became a member of the Beverly Hills Board of Education , and a Cub Scout den mother . Now we will be able to shut off those lights , wo n't we ?
