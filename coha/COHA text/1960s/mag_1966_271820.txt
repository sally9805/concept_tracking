The hurly-burly atmosphere of Honolulu may not have seemed the most appropriate setting for a clearheaded , thoroughgoing analysis of U.S. policy in Asia . Yet , for all the haste and hoopla with which it was mounted , last week 's conference between the leaders of the U.S. and South Viet Nam did in fact put the nation 's goals-and the war itself-in clearer perspective . <P> The Viet Nam war is neither popular nor unpopular with most Americans . It is simply confusing . Nobody is better aware of that than Lyndon Johnson . Though the pollsters tell him that a substantial majority of Americans approve of his policies , he knows that he can rely only on a thin crust of active support ; and a vocal opposition is constantly gnawing away at that crust . In large measure , the fault is his own , for he has never definitively explained the reasons , risks and alternatives involved in the American commitment to Viet Nam 's struggle for independence . <P> The Honolulu conference was a good start toward changing that .

In Washington , where Johnson 's peace offensive helped to blunt the urgent demands of the war , the Administration 's present attitude is known as " the new realism . " It has crystallized as a blend of idealism and self-interest based on the acknowledgment that the military war can not be won in a vacuum , that it will only be successful to the extent that it helps liberate the Vietnamese from poverty , ignorance and exploitation . As the President said in welcoming Saigon 's leaders to Honolulu : " We are here to talk especially of the works of peace . We will leave here determined not only to achieve victory over aggression , but also to win victory over hunger , disease and despair .

" Much has been made of the disagreements between Washington and Saigon , particularly over the bombing of Haiphong and recognition of Viet Cong representatives at any future peace conference . Actually , the differences matter little . Lyndon Johnson has ruled out the first-for the time being , at least-and Hanoi has made the second academic . More important is the fact that the leaders of the two governments met face to face for the first time and came to understand their mutual aims . Most U.S. officials were convinced that while past Vietnamese leaders might have given short shrift to the social and political transformation of their country , Premier Nguyen Cao Ky fully understands the necessity for such a program . " We are dedicated to the eradication of social injustice among our people , " said Ky . " We must bring about a true social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
