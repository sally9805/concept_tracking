Few international projects have been debated with such fervor or greeted with such optimism as the St. Lawrence Seaway . When it opened in 1959 , its proponents prophesied that it would create " America 's fourth seacoast , " spread prosperity along its banks , and prove a boon to commercial shippers in the U.S. and Canada , which shared the $470 million cost of building it . After five years of operation , the Seaway has not come near to fulfilling that promise . Last week in Detroit , a Senate commerce subcommittee held hearings to discuss the Seaway 's troubles and what can be done about them . Last year 's revenues of $15.2 million fell $11 million short of meeting expenses ; the Seaway now owes $12 million in overdue interest payments to the U.S. and $65 million to Canada . <P> The system stretches 1,300 miles from Montreal to Duluth and links 22 Great Lake ports with the Atlantic , but it has failed to attract the expected commercial traffic . The Seaway 's troubles stem from a combination of engineering shortcomings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too shallow to accommodate large freighters . Most of its ports are ill-equipped to load and unload ships , and passage through the 15 sets of locks is tedious and slow ; the average ship takes ten days to travel from Chicago to Montreal . Because the waterways freeze over for four months each winter , shippers can not rely on year-round use . Finally , tolls make shipping by water almost as expensive as land transportation . The project 's backers are now debating whether to raise tolls even further to increase revenues or to cut them to attract more traffic . Commissions in both the U.S. and Canada have been ordered to report to their governments by July with definite plans for plugging the financial leaks in the Seaway.
