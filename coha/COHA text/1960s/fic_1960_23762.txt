A Story by HAZEL HECKMAN Drawings by G. Hunter Jones WOMEN MUST WEEP W H EN the phone rang , Arnold took up the receiver quickly , because his wife Emily , who had slept as lightly as a butterfly since their son Toog 's death , was snatching a nap on the portico chaise . " Dr. Adams speaking , " Arnold said softly . He drew a couple of quick concentric rings on the phone pad and waited . It was Price Benson , the young man from the sheriff 's office at Albion . " Dr. Adams ? " Benson said . He sounded excited and triumphant . " We 've got the boy here . Marsh picked him up in Phoenix . " " Boy ? " Arnold said . " Boy ? " He stared at Emily 's canary , that was swinging like mad on its perch , its yellow feathers flashing in and out of a sun patch . " We 've got Chessie Jenkins , " Benson said , so loudly that Arnold jumped . Arnold watched Emily 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , Arnold turned in his swivel chair so that he faced away from the window , and spoke . " I see , " he said . He tried to sound clinical . Benson asked , " How soon could you come over , Dr. Adams ? " " I ? " Arnold said . " Well , I do n't see that anything would be gained especially . " The thing he did see was that Emily stood in the doorway , her pale hair awry , the mark of the chaise cushion on her left cheek . He said to Benson , " If you think it 's necessary , I suppose . " Benson sounded hurt . " He was wearing your son 's watch , " he said . " We 've got to keep it , naturally . For the time being . But we 'd like you to identify it . " Ile paused as though waiting for Arnold to speak , but Arnold said nothing . " Marsh picked the kid up .

If you do n't mind coming , Dr. Adams . It 's just routine . " " All right , " Arnold said . He hung up with a dry taste . Emily faced him , her eyes as blue as Jacob 's ladder . The mark on her face was like a scar . " Who was that , Arnold ? " Arnold hesitated . " Price Benson , " he said , tearing the sheet from the phone pad and stuffing it into his pocket . The name did n't register , or else she had n't listened . " Whenever the phone rings , " she said , " I think it 's someone calling to say it 's all a mistake , that it did n't really happen . The way I wake up and think I 've had a bad dream , until I remember . It 's like something falls on me , then . " She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you think I 'm losing my mind , Arnold ? " " No , Emily , " Arnold said . He arose and 56 WOMEN MUST WEEP opened the closet door and took out his hat and coat . " Have a nap ? " he asked cheerfully . " I may have dropped off . ... Are you going out . Arnold ? " " The call , " he said . He nodded toward the phone . " I 'll be back shortly . " " Arnold ! " Emily said , remembering . " Price Benson 's that man from the sheriff 's office ! " " Yes , Emily . " " You 're hiding something . " " They 've got Chcssie Jenkins , Emily . " No need to tell her , now , about Toog 's watch . Arnold knew a sudden revulsion accompanied by a sense of loss so profound that he felt drained and empty . Arnold and Emily had given Toog the watch six months ago , for his eighteenth birthday . Six months ! F ii MI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm glad , " she said . " I 'm glad . I hope . . . " She did n't finish . " Benson asked me to come to Albion , " Arnold said . " Why , Arnold ? " " I guess it 's routine , " Arnold said . " Will you he all right , Emily ? " She faced him , her blue eyes as hard as marbles . " Do n't you start going soft , Arnold , " she said . She began to cry , as children cry , her mouth open and her face exposed . Arnold moved toward her , but she moved away , around the table , and he let her go . She picked up a pair of gloves and smoothed the fingers . She said harshly , " Sometimes I 've thought you did n't want them to find him . Sometimes I 've thought . . . " She stopped . " I 'm sorry , Arnold . It wo n't do any good I guess . It wo n't bring Toog back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chessie Jenkins hauled back in handcuffs , speaking only to ask for rest stops . Chessie had always had bad kidneys . He had wet the bed constantly , Luke had told Arnold . Arnold had sent a prescription , but it had n't helped . Arnold wondered , suddenly , whether they had notified Luke . There was n't any phone up at Luke 's place . . . . Arnold kissed Emily lightly , and tasted salt . Seeing the worn place in the /awn as he backed out along the curving drive , where Tong and Toog 's friends had turned too quickly , " squirreled " their cars , Arnold thought mechanically : I 'd better seed or sod before the spring rains stop and put up some kind of barricade . But , then , it occurred to Arnold that there would be no real need for a barricade . Emily did n't squirrel the car , certainly , and Toog 's friends never came now . As Arnold nosed down the hill , avoiding the washed gullies in the dirt road , he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path up the hill to Arnold 's house . Arnold thought , nettled : Maude 's not good for Emily . Maude sighed , and cried , " Poor Toog ! " Emily did n't need someone to cry with . Arnold waved at Maude and stopped for the stop sign that marked the arterial , and drove onto the asphalt , and turned toward Albion , the county seat , keeping his foot easy . As he drove , with the windows down , he could smell the April fragrance of the wild plum blossoms that marched in drifts , interspersed with an occasional redbud , along the meandering line of the draw . A meadow lark whistled as sharp as a razor from a fence post , Arnold caught the yellow flicker as the lark flew . Striped spring beauties , as pink and white as peppermint , and Johnny-jump-ups as blue as babies ' eyes bloomed among the grass . A tractor appeared in the road ahead and Arnold slowed . Arnold recognized Manning Alford , one of his patients . Manning ought n't be riding that iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was Manning 's work . Manning looked around and saw Arnold and pulled off onto the shoulder quickly . Arnold raised his hand and passed and leveled out . Luke Jenkins , Arnold thought with a sudden surge of helpless anger , what had Luke Jenkins ever clone wrong ? Married Essie Summers , after he had got her pregnant . Was that wrong ? Luke and Arnold had gone to school together here in Picket Rock , all through the grades . Luke had n't gone beyond the eighth , of course . He could have , he was bright enough . But his father , honest Ezra Jenkins , died , struck by lightning and knocked off his hayrack , his team killed , too , and Luke was left to look out for his mother on the run-down Jenkins place . Luke was fourteen . That was Luke Jenkins ' inheritance , his work cut out at fourteen , an ailing old woman and a stony run-down farm with taxes already two years delinquent . In high school , then , and away at college , Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , as the tallest boy in the grammar Hazel Heckman was born in Kansas and lives in Tacoma , Washington .

She has a son and a granddaughter. room , and the most conscientious , already a little bent from being too tall for the eighth-grade desks . Or Arnold thought of Luke out on the hail diamond . winding up for the pitch . Luke was good at baseball . When Arnold finished his internship and came back to practice with his father , he began to see Luke again . Luke had n't changed essentially . He looked older . Luke 's face , at twenty-six , had commenced to line some . He was a little more stooped , maybe . His teeth were getting bad . He clasped Arnold 's hand . " I 'm glad you 're back , Arnold . " Luke farmed the Jenkins place and looked after his mother , who was bedfast by then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ironing . When it got too much , when Luke could no longer leave old Sara Jenkins to go to the field , he brought in Essie Summers , a little plain ignorant thing . God knew how or what Luke paid her . Maybe Essie came because it was a home , something she had never had . Essie had come from farther south , cotton country . For all people might be poor in Mahaffey County , they did n't live in tents . Well , there they were , cooped up all winter , Luke and Essie , with a sick old woman , in that back-road place . Luke could n't get away of evenings , Sara was afraid of her shadow without Luke there , and so was Essie . They both leaned on Luke . Essie was kind to Sara , though . Essie tended Sara like a baby . Sara was a baby . " Essie 's been a Godsend , " Sara told callers . There were those coarse enough to say after a while that apparently Essie had been a Godsend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was doubtful if he minded much . Luke was used to Essie 's cooking , he 'd taught her all she knew . If he had minded , he was n't the kind to say . Luke did what he had to do . He always had . . .. Sara died meanwhile . T H E night Chessie was born Luke came for Arnold on his old tractor . No one could have taken a car up the Jenkins road , rutted deep in snow , with drifts piling and shifting between the hedgerows . It was the worst blizzard of the winter . When the knocker sounded that night , Arnold roused himself out of a warm sleep and went downstairs grumbling . There stood Luke on the snowy step , his ear toppers turned down and his collar turned up , and his lean face red with cold . " 1 bate Iike hell to roust you out , Arnold , " Luke said . " It 's Essie . " He appeared embarrassed . " Come in , " Arnold told him . But Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood on the mat with his run-over boots dripping and dragged off his cap . " I hate to fetch you out on a night like this , Arnold . " Arnold said , " That 's why I have my shingle out , " and set the coffee pot to warm . Dressing , Arnold worried . Arnold had n't examined Essie , Luke had n't called him in . Prenatal care was n't such a common thing then . Arnold was young and not so very experienced at going it alone , and Essie Jenkins was a little narrow-looking thing . Luke and Arnold talked some on the way , bent to the stinging , wind-driven sleet . It had been a hard winter on the stock , Luke said . " Hard on old folks , too , " Arnold told him . Luke agreed , " Their sap goes down , " he said . " Take Mania now . Each winter she 'd relapse . This was the worst one . She could n't make it . " Arnold guessed that it had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke hauling water . The corn had burned up , Luke said , what little the grasshoppers left . " I tried broom corn last spring , " Luke said . He laughed . " All I had left when the hoppers finished was the handles . " They turned off the old road in through the Jenkins gate . The tractor lights struck the small unpainted house , where a kerosene lamp burned feebly in a window . " Look , Arnold , " Luke said , embarrassed , as the two men scraped their feet , " about the pay . 58 WOMEN MUST WEEP I 've not got it now . But I 've got a hog to sell next month . " " Next month will be fine , " Arnold said . " Or any month . " " I 'm sure much obliged to you for coming , Arnold . " Essie Jenkins arose awkwardly from a chair beside the cookstove and came to take Arnold 's things . She bobbed her head at Arnold . She had the coffee on . You would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T H A T was Arnold 's first really close call , that night . He had to use forceps . And the baby did n't make a sound , nor look as though he 'd ever breathe . The sweat came out on Arnold . He held the baby up and spanked him . He blew his own breath in the baby 's mouth . He massaged and worked that lump of dough , aware of seconds passing . Arnold was n't by and large a devout man , but he said a prayer to himself that night . When the baby gasped and yelled , finally , Arnold yelled himself , and Luke yelled , " By God , you 've got him , Arnold ! " When the baby was squalling good , Arnold handed him to Luke and went to see to Essie . When it was all over , Essie asleep and the baby bathed and dressed by the two men and put to bed in Essie 's clothes basket in front of the oven door , Luke and Arnold sat down and drank a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the snow piled up outside . They reminisced about ball games won and ball games lost back in the grades , and about Halloween pranks played , Old Man Mingus ' wagon taken apart and assembled again on the schoolhouse roof . " It took all night . Remember , Luke ? Why , if I 'd had to work that hard at home I 'd have felt put upon . " Luke laughed and looked past Arnold at the basket in front of the oven door and filled Arnold 's glass . " Maybe I 'll name him Chester , " he said . " I 've always kind of liked the name . " Luke and Arnold rode the tractor home at daybreak in a fine warm glow . The snow had stopped by then and the earth was like a fantasy , the roads and fences glistening white , the first sunrays lighting diamonds on the shrubs and trees . " I 'm sure much obliged to you for coming , Arnold , " Luke said again at Arnold 's gate . " Until you 're better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stopped for a herd of cows in the road . The lead cow , a muley , turned broadside , the way cows will , and looked back and bawled at her white-faced calf . The bell around her neck jangled as the boy who was driving the herd prodded her with a stick . One of John Gillespie 's boys , Arnold recognized , the one with a missing finger . He could n't recall the boy 's name , Jack or Jesse . He had caught his hand in a corn cutter . Now he looked at Arnold apologetically and waved him on . Arnold proceeded slowly until he had cleared the herd . Essie Jenkins did n't have any more children after Chessie , as they called him . Essie was n't built for child-bearing . Arnold was only called in rarely . The boy had whooping cough and then measles . Arnold saw Luke often , on his tractor in the held or hauling water from the town well or hauling straw or hay . The boy was always with him . Chessie had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , even as a child , had a vague and shifty look . But he was pretty enough , fair-skinned and with blond curls . To be sure , Luke worshiped him . Arnold met Luke in Alden 's store once . Luke was buying dress goods for Essie , who rarely came to town , and shoes and stockings for the boy . Luke shook hands warmly . " How 's it going , Luke ? " " I ca n't complain . " Chessic clung to Luke 's coat and peered out at Arnold . " I want some gum dropth , Papa . " Luke laid a nickel on the counter . " It beats me how they eat , " Nate said to Arnold after Luke had gone . " All he buys is flour and coffee . I 'd gladly give him credit , but he never asks . " When the relief office opened in Picket Rock in the early ' thirties , Luke did n't apply , though he could have qualified , certainly . He hunted and trapped and fished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possums and blackbirds and coons . Even snipes . " Luke did road work when he could get it . Arnold doubted Luke made the taxes . But the Jenkins farm was n't the only one delinquent . When the boy drank Essie 's washing lye , one Sunday afternoon , Luke wrapped him in a quilt and brought him to Arnold . Arnold opened the door , and there stood Luke holding Chessie , his face as white as chalk . If Luke had been ten minutes later . . . Arnold veered away from thinking that , seeing in that instant Chessie Jenkins dead at six , a stone , moss-grown , in the cemetery to mark his memory , Luke kneeling to tend the grave . That day Luke watched and waited , quiet , filled with trust in Arnold . When Arnold tried to refuse pay , Luke 's eyes shot fire . Arnold was obliged , finally , to accept two dollars . Luke began to bring Arnold gifts , a catfish he had " noodled " from underneath a ledge in muddy Bighorn , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brace of fat mallards . Chessie hunted with Luke . Once in the dead of winter Luke and Chessie brought a bucket of wild honey and , . toward spring , a basket of pink-ribbed field mushrooms . Luke had a way of proffering a gift that made it impossible to refuse . " I had extra , " he would say . " Thought maybe you could use it . " " How 's it going , Luke ? " " I ca n't complain . " I N EA R L Y adolescence Chessie began to take things . The news , brought home by Toog , who was Chessie 's age , troubled Arnold . Dinner pails were rifled . A jackknife disappeared from a school desk . A teacher 's pen and pencil vanished . Chessie was found hiding in a broom-closet eating a piece of cake filched from a lunch pail . The cash box of the Santa Fe gum machine was broken open , and Chessie purchased sweets and a cap pistol . " When that kid comes into the stole I do n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you told Luke ? " Nate shook his head . " I just ca n't bring myself to do it . Anyhow , I doubt Luke would believe it . The boy 's as clever as a rat , and Luke wears big blinders where the kid 's concerned . " A long train of cars blocked the road , and Arnold stopped again , his engine idling . His memory , painfully sharp , dwelt on that day , two summers ago , when , but for the accident of Arnold 's having decided suddenly to show up at the annual Sunday school picnic , Toog might have been alive . Emily had mentioned that fact once , in the raw shock of first grief . She had apologized to Arnold later . As though she needed . Arnold had taken the boys and Emily to the picnic early in the day and had gone his rounds . There was an epidemic of stomach flu that summer . The oldsters called it summer complaint , or cholera morbus , and Arnold had said to Emily that morning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Emily had replied that the picnic was an institution and that the women took no end of precautionary measures with the food . Finding himself , then . in late afternoon , in the vicinity of the picnic grounds , Arnold decided to stop off . He was feeling cheerful , his patients were all improving . Mrs. Maury Reynolds had delivered twins . Maury was as grateful as though Arnold had been directly responsible .... Arnold enjoyed , who was to say he did not , the certain small prestige that being the only doctor brought him . He was always sure of welcome . There was a ball game on , the men against the boys , and Luke was pitching for the men 's side . Arnold 's son Toog was playing for the boys , his cap on backward , his trousers rolled , his hair crew-cut . Arnold was able , suddenly , as he was not often able now , to see Toog 's face clearly . Lying awake beside Emily , awake , Arnold would try to call up Toog 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . That was looking at a photograph . Emily , thank God , had put all the photographs away , finally . Emily experienced the same difficulty . Only last week , lying beside Arnold , Emily had asked , " Are you awake , Arnold ? " " Yes , " Arnold said . " Tell me how Toog looked . " But now , recalling the picnic , Arnold saw Toog and saw the others , as plainly as though a lantern slide had been thrown on a blank wall , saw and heard : the crack of a bat , the smack of the ball on leather , the slow liquid murmur of the river on the riffle . Luke was the star player for the men that day . Luke was one who had kept lean . Weil , times had kept Luke lean . Luke took up the bat and cracked a fast grounder . Luke caught three flies in a row to retire the side , and came in modest and sober . 60 WOMEN MUST WEEP " How are you , Arnold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold 's hand . " How 's it going , Luke ? " Luke grinned . " I ca n't complain . " Emily came with a plate of food for Arnold , and Arnold sat down to enjoy the game . Essie Jenkins was there , too . She sat apart , her hands wrapped in her apron , as though she thought , so , to escape notice . Her hair , which had grayed since Arnold had seen her last , was combed into a tight bun at the back . Her nose looked pinched , her skin glistened . She bobbed her head at Arnold . Arnold did n't see Chessie , nor think about him , until the cry went up that Chessie Jenkins had gone down for the third time in the deep hole and Sylvain Bettis had pulled him out . Chessie lay on the hank , his white fat exposed where his trunks had slipped , his blonde hair streaked with muck . Arnold found , or thought he found , a feeble thread of pulse . Luke asked , white , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , Luke . " Arnold began respiration , aware of Luke watching , trusting . Essie , surrounded by sympathetic women , patted , soothed , whimpered now and then . The crowd stood silent . The river murmured past , indifferent . Ten minutes passed . Twenty . " He 's coming round , Doc ! " Chessie gasped like a fish and belched green water . He began to cry . " Papa ! " " Here , " Luke said . Arnold stood up and called for a blanket . Luke wrung Arnold 's hand . " I 'm much obliged to you , Arnold . I reckon I 'll never get through saying that . " I T WAS the girl with Toog who identified Chessie , the Evans girl . Toog and the girl were parked clown by the Jenkins place . " Just talking , " the girl said . Arnold was obliged to give her a hypodermic , finally , to quiet her , to get a straight story . Chessie had appeared with Luke 's shotgun , a handkerchief tied around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Toog laughed at him , " she sobbed . " I guess he thought it was some kind of game Chessie was playing . Cops and robbers . I thought that myself . Toog laughed and jerked the mask off Chessie 's face and grabbed the gun . That 's when it went off . " Toog lived until the next day . Luke came to the hospital , but Arnold refused to see him . " Tell him anything , " Arnold instructed the nurse . " But get rid of him . " Arnold could n't face Luke . DONALD HALL DR .

" I heard the Dean observe , at tea and cakes , Face stuffed and sneering , " Fait has what it takes . " It was assumed that Chessie Jenkins caught a freight out , or hitched a ride . Arnold had not seen Luke since . Arnold ran through a stop light and heard the squall of brakes , the horn , the angry shout . " Sorry , " Arnold murmured , but went , of course , unheard . He was approaching the city limits now . The scattered small homes of the cement-plant workers lined the kolichi-coated streets . Arnold slowed for a group of white and Negro boys who were playing football on the roadway . They stood to one side and waited for him to pass and then closed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of girls sat cross-legged at a game of jacks . No blade of grass grew in the bleak yards of the almost identical houses , and the few stunted trees were sparsely leafed . A woman with her back to Arnold was hanging clothes . Arnold turned into a quiet tree-lined street and drew up in front of the courthouse , an ancient brick building , domed and turreted , with the jail in back . Leaving the car , he knew again the strong revulsion that had plagued him earlier . Why had he come ? He could have easily refused . A doctor always had excuses  --  a patient , a sudden call . He thought with heavy dread of a preliminary hearing , a trial dragging on interminably , at which Arnold must appear . What end could possibly be served by sending Chessie Jenkins to the grim state penitentiary for Life , or all of life that counted ? Arnold deplored the brittle exchange , the battle of verbal thrusts between defense and prosecution lawyers , two men whose lives the outcome would not essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , making of it a contest between two paid con tenders . He wished strongly , suddenly , that they had not caught up with Chessie Jenkins , or that Chessie had been killed resisting capture . Arnold had no desire , certainly , to see Tong 's death avenged . The wide sandstone steps up which Arnold walked were hand-hewn and old , each step a platter worn by the tread of feet . In the yard an old colored man was at work , pushing his broom ahead of him as a child would push a hoop . Arnold glanced briefly up at the statue of blind Justice with her balance , and stepped into the revolving door which turned heavily with a lumbering sound and ejected him into a corridor that smelled of sweeping compound and ancient books . A sign on the wall read SHERIFF 'S OFFICE , a hand with an index finger pointing upward . Arnold climbed slowly . I N S I D E the sheriff 's office , he saw too late to turn back , Luke and Essie Jenkins sat side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same coat she had worn for as long as Arnold could remember ; he recognized it at once , a black coat , rusty , with a dab of brown fur on the collar , like a mangy kitten clasped about her neck . Luke , it occurred to Arnold , must have come directly from the field ; he wore over-ails and a frayed gray suit-coat , buttoned closely . Luke held his ancient black felt in his hands against his chest , like a shield . Seeing Arnold , he arose , bent , an old man , and stood waiting , his eyes on Arnold 's face . What have I ever done for Luke , Arnold asked himself  --  thinking in that moment that Luke 's sorrow ( of course it was ) was greater than his own  --  except to keep his son alive to bring him sorrow finally ? Arnold heard his own father saying , " There comes a time when it 's better not to try to play God , Arnold , but to just desist . " Arnold 's father had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , that there came a point in delayed infant respiration beyond which there was real danger of cerebral damage . But how , Arnold asked himself in anguish , was a man to know ? You did what you had to do when you had to do it . What if Arnold were to say that in his opinion Chessie Jenkins was incapable of choosing right from wrong ? Did he believe that ? And would it profit Luke any to give him back his son once more , if that lay in Arnold 's power ? The two men faced each other . There was no trust now in Luke 's eyes , no faith in Arnold . There was only a haggard fear , the stamp of grief too deep for time 's erasure . " Hello , Luke , " Arnold said . He started forward . But at that moment , behind Luke , Essie Jenkins began to cry suddenly , her mouth open and her face exposed . It reminded Arnold of Emily . He bobbed his head at Essie and turned away quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding , as unobtrusively as possible , Exhibit A , a leather-banded , chromium-encased watch .
