Many a man groans and bears it when he comes home to find a TV dinner in the oven . Not Pierre Franey . The first time he found frozen dinners in his house at Valley Stream , N.Y. , recalls Franey , " I was furious . " His gall was on account of Gallic upbringing . Born 46 years ago in Burgundy , Franey began an apprenticeship as a kitchen boy at 14 , learned to cook at Paris ' Drouant restaurant ( two Michelin stars ) , reached his culinary peak as chef of New York 's Pavilion ( which would undoubtedly rate three stars if Michelin graded U.S. establishments ) . Like Friend and Fellow Chef Ren Verdon , who quit the White House last year after he was ordered to use frozen vegetables , Franey had always had a Gallic horror of anything surgel . <P> Profitable Freeze . Yet he is also a reasonable man . In 1960 , Franey left Pavilion to become vice president and top chef for the Howard Johnson chain of restaurants ( 785 , plus 18 Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the profitable field of quick-frozen " gourmet " foods for its own dining rooms and for retail sales in supermarkets . Franey , therefore , forgot his French fury long enough to think about improving on the TV dinners his wife had bought . <P> He discovered that fresh meat holds its flavor better than does meat that was originally frozen at the packing house , then frozen again after being added to a recipe . Also , spices have to be limited in frozen foods because they grow stronger when a dish is thawed and reheated . When friends - raved over a dish of Franey 's sweetbreads in champagne sauce , without realizing that it had been frozen , Franey and his staff of 15 Howard Johnson chefs went into the quick-freeze business in earnest . Today Howard Johnson , along with its fried clams and charcoal steaks , turns out 24 gourmet dishes in one giant kitchen . Such meals represent a growing part of the chain 's $200 million annual sales . <P> Franey 's workday in his commissary kitchen at Queen Village , N.Y. , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still the frankfurter ( 20 million served last year ) and the hamburger ( 15 million ) ; Franey not only approves the quality of the ingredients for these French-frightening delicacies but has added his own touches to them . Principal touch : less fat , more lean . He also oversees the clams and the steaks . Last week Franey was busily processing 100,000 lbs . of Thanksgiving turkey . <P> Potential Fare . Thanks to Franey , the menu at any orange-topped Howard Johnson restaurant around the U.S. now includes Welsh rabbit , chicken stroganoff , veal scallopini , lamb curry and seafood thermidor . " We 're upgrading gradually , " says Franey . " You have to keep the average American in mind . But maybe some day we 're going to serve caviar at Howard Johnson 's . " <P> Still , a Pavilion chef would shudder at the Johnsonesque proportions Franey uses .
