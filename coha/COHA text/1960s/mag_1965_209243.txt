In thousands of offices and factories all over Italy , the visit of a friendly little salesman with a plain brown briefcase is as much a part of the workaday routine as the coffee wagon is in the U.S. He is the neighborhood cigarette peddler , and every week he makes his rounds with a fresh supply of Camels , Kents and Marlboros at prices ranging from 40 to 48 a pack . The same brands sell at 77 to 79 at the state-owned tobacconist 's , for the state tobacco monopoly imposes a 35 duty on every legally imported pack of cigarettes , while the friendly little man 's cigarettes are smuggled , mostly from Switzerland . <P> The Swiss could not care less , so long as the smugglers register their purchases for export . The contrabbandieri respond gratefully by registering-most of the time . As a result , official Swiss statistics show that cigarette exports to Italy ( usually of U.S. brands made under license in Switzerland ) flared from 50 million packs in 1960 to 210 million packs last year , while Italian statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1964 . Italian border police nabbed another 70 million packs of smokes being toted over the border on everything from helicopters and freight cars to trained St. Bernards . One particularly imaginative operator pumped his contraband across a wide Alpine lake in a crude , homemade submarine . The most reliable technique for safe smuggling is still the local spallone ( from the Italian spalla , or shoulder ) . He is a sure-footed mountain man who trudges through the rocky gorge and Alpine forest of the border country with his fags in a shoulder knapsack , then sells them to a distributor who supplies the big cities . <P> Public opinion is on the side of the smugglers , especially in the mountain country , where nearly everyone has a friend or relative in the business . When border police accidentally shot a girl spallona in the neck last winter , citizens picketed the guard post with placards declaring : YOU SHOULD N'T SHOOT A GIRL FOR SMUGGLING ! Actually , the police are not as strict as they might be , since the mountain folk , if foiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narcotics . Explains Border Police Chief Salvatore Gallo : " The state prefers in a certain sense to tolerate smuggling rather than to see an increase in common delinquency. "
