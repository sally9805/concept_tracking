By a vote of 290 to 130 , the House of Representatives last week passed a sweeping civil rights bill and sent it to the Senate . The breakdown on the vote was interesting : 152 Democrats and 138 Republicans voted for the measure ; 96 Democrats and only 34 Republicans voted against it . In other words , in one of the most lopsidedly Democratic Houses since the days of F.D.R. , Republicans were vital to the passage of a bill for which the Democratic Administration means to take full political credit this year . <P> Tomfoolery . Because of the party-line stance taken by the Republicans under the leadership of Indiana 's Charlie Halleck , the bill 's diehard Democratic opponents knew they were fighting a lost cause . They therefore spent the last hours of debate engaging in tomfoolery . For example , Virginia 's Judge Howard Smith , chairman of the Rules Committee and leader of the Southern Democratic forces , offered an amendment that would ban discrimination by reason of gender as well as race . " This bill is so imperfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment do ? " <P> " Nothing could be more logical , " chimed in New York Republican Katharine St. George , speaking to her male colleagues . " We outlast you . We outlive you . We nag you to death . We want this crumb of equality . And the little word sex wo n't hurt the bill . " <P> Four other female House members rose to second the idea . But Oregon Democrat Edith Green went and spoiled all the fun . " At the risk of being called an Aunt Jane , if not an Uncle Tom , " she said , " let us not add any amendment that would get in the way of our primary objective . " Her logic failed to impress the House . It passed the amendment , 168 to 133 , to the delight of a woman in the gallery , who shouted , " We made it ! We made it ! God bless America ! " She was promptly ejected . <P> At the Senate Door . After the final vote , President Johnson praised the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the task is for the Senate . I hope the same spirit of nonpartisanship will prevail there . " <P> Small chance . For one thing , Republican Senate leaders like Illinois ' Everett Dirksen have already announced themselves as opposed to the bill 's public accommodations section . For another , the bill , when it arrives from the House this week , would ordinarily be sent first to the Senate Judiciary Committee , chaired by Mississippi Democrat James Eastland . If left up to Eastland , the measure would stay in committee forever . Therefore plans have been made to " meet the bill at the Senate door " and , with the help of some complex and unusual parliamentary strategy , bypass Eastland 's committee . But not even that will forestall a Democratic filibuster . And if anything is certain , it is that when the bill does come to the floor , its Democratic opponents will try to talk it to death .
