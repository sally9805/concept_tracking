txt " I 'm not crazy about Brown , but I would n't vote for Nixon if they had a yeller dog running against him . " declares Burt Barrett , a retired South Dakota farmer now living in Long Beach . Asserts Bakersfield auto Ream " I do n't particularly I 'll vote for him if that 's the rid of Brown " Frankly , says San Francisco nurse Lilt Spito , " I 'm wishy-washy about both of them " Similar negative sentiments come from voter after voter asked their preference in the California gubernatorial battle between Democratic incumbent Edmund " Pat " Brown and former Vice President Richard Nixon . Probably the most common reply is " I wish I had a third choice . " Some confirmed Republicans think their man clearly has the broad national and international background to be an outstanding governor : some diehard Democrats believe their man has put together a fine four-year record of achievement . But the most widespread view among several hundred Californians interviewed seems to be that Mr. Brown is rumbling and indecisive , Mr. Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to be the nation 's most populous , deserves a better choice . " A Nose-Holding Contest " " It 's a nose-holding contest , " concedes a Brown lieutenant . Agrees a Nixon adviser : " People will be voting against , not for . " A key Republican maintains " Brown is our secret weapon , " while a Democratic leader declares " Our greatest asset in this campaign is Dick Nixon . " This lack of enthusiasm for either candidate is surprising because of the great national interest in the California clash , easily the leading drama on the U.S. political stage this fall . Next month 's balloting could end Mr. Nixon 's political career , or start him back on the path toward the White House . The outcome will influence which way California 's fat 40 electoral votes go in the 1968 Presidential election . National press and TV coverage of the campaign is snowballing , and help streams into both camps from outside California . Former President Eisenhower flies out next week to ? plug his onetime ' second-in-command ; several Administration officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Kennedy , a summer visitor , returns late this month . The voters ' " lesser-of-two-evils " attitude makes it particularly hard to predict the outcome . Many will go to the beach or go fishing election day ; much will depend on which voters actually turn out . Brown Favored In Poll Democrats have reason for confidence . Registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans almost 3 to 2 . The widely quoted California Poll showed the affable , 57-yearold Mr. Brown in mid-September running ahead of Mr. Nixon 48% to 42% , with 10% undecided , slightly better than earlier showings . Democrats from the start argued Mr. Nixon was the kind of Republican to solidify their frequently floundering party . But Democrats are jittery . The June primary had ominous overtones ; almost onefourth the Democrats voting then either skipped the governor 's line , voted for a littleknown Brown rival or wrote in a Republican name . Democratic leaders fear apathy will hurt Mr. Brown more than it hurts Mr. Nixon ; traditionally , higher percentages of registered Republicans turn out each electioff , unless some burning issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats a riot act on the need for a mammoth " get-out-the-vote " drive . The 49-year-old Mr. Nixon , a shade thinner and much more relaxed than in 1980 , is drawing larger and more enthusiastic crowds than is Gov . Brown . He takes comfort from the fact he 's never failed to carry the state  --  for the Senate in lop , with Ike in 1952 and 1958 , on his own for President in 1980 . " That means a lot of Democrats have voted for him one time or another , " an aide emphasizes . * ' Admittedly , Mr. Nixon is having problems with some Republicans who consider him too liberal and resent his repudiation of the ultraconservative John Birch Society and his refusal to endorse three GOP Congressional candidates who are Birch members . ( Mr. Nixon says " California tradition " requires separate campaigns for state and national offices . ) Onethird of the votes in the June GOP primary went for conservative state legislator Joseph Shell , and many of these Republicans insist they 'll not vote for Mr. Nixon next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or skip it entirely . " says a Highland Park advertising artist who supported Mr. Shell . " Neither Brown nor Nixon is conservative enough for me . " But Republican and Democratic politicos figure most Shell supporters will end up voting for Mr. Nixon . They reason the conservatives deeply committed to conservative candidates elsewhere on the ticket , will turn out to vote and then reason Mr. Nixon is at least more conservative than Mr. Brown . To arouse conservatives , however , and to convert lots of needed Democrats , Mr. Vixen is bearing down on the " Communist issue . " Declares a top advisor : " Dick Nixon , the Communist fighter . That 's the issue were going to win on . " Stressing " 14 years of experience in fighting communism , " Mr. Nixon calls for a ban on campus speeches by persons who 've pleaded the Fifth Amendment in investigations of Communist activity or have refused to register under the Subversive Activities Control Act . He urges mandatory high school courses on Communist tactics . He charges Gov . Brown has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incapable of dealing with the Communist threat within the state . " He charges that the California Democratic Council , a statewide liberal organization , controls the Democratic Party and moves it toward such stands as abolition of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and admission of Red China to the United Nations . " Communism has always been a good issue here , and Dick 's always won with it , " declared a top Nixon adviser . " Now people are more concerned about it than ever . They 're unhappy about Cuba and looking around for some way to hit back . " Nixon strategists see little risk of estranging many voters . " The only people who 'll get mad are ones who were never going to vote for him anyhow , " asserts one aide . But Democrats believe the Communist issue will backfire and are striving to promote that result . Gov . Brown and his lieutenants accuse Mr. Nixon of " smear " tactics , charge that his emphasis on communism is a sign he lacks real issues . Talks with voters sugge.st that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than support . " I do n't like the way the Republicans jump up and down and call everybody Communists if they do n't agree with them , " says Jack Franklin , a retired railway official here . Always Republican before , he leans to Mr. Brown now . Burbank mechanic Richard Orgo was undecided until Mr. Nixon started stressing the Communist Issue , but is now Democratic-Inclined . " I do n't go for anyone smear ing someone else , " he explains . Of course , this is by no means Mr. Nixon 's only issue . He charges Gov . Brown rims the most costly government in California 's history , with $1 billion of higher taxes levied during his four-year term . High taxes and bureaucratic harassment , he adds , keep industry out and contribute to unemployment . He depicts the Democrat as a vacillator whose opposition to capital punishment is merely one instance of failure to cope with dope-peddling and other crime . " California needs a decisive leader . " Mr. Nixon 's billboards and literature proclaim . In rebuttal , Mr. Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . He promises there 'll be no tax increase next year if he 's re-elected . Mr. Nixon is pictured as a " stranger " to California ; the Democrats revive talk of " tricky Dick . " Declare Brown billboards ; " The man California can trust . "
