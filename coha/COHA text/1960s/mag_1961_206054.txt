Who is a Wall Street insider ? Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , insiders are defined as officers , directors and major stockholders of corporations , and are sternly prohibited ( maximum sentence : two years and $10,000 ) from using inside information for private gain on the stock market . But the law does not reach thousands of people who are not really in but are far from out : financial reporters who are often the sole outside possessors of inside information before the story is published , friends who get tips from directors , securities analysts whose research allows them to become privy to company secrets . Last week , in a decision written by its new Kennedy-appointed chairman , William L. Gary , the Securities and Exchange Commission made an unprecedented move toward bringing the in-betweens within the law . The case turned around Robert Gintel , 33 , a partner in the Wall Street brokerage house of Cady , Roberts &; Co. , and his role in a well-timed sell-off of Curtiss-Wright Corp . shares on Nov. 25 , 1959 . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Curtiss-Wright , had held a much ballyhooed press confer- ence in which he displayed a revolutionary rotary combustion engine that he said C-W was going to produce . On the strength of this promised new product , C-W shares jumped 8 points in the next two days , to reach the year 's high of 40 . But at the C-W directors ' meeting on the 25th , the decision was made to cut the quarterly dividend from 62 to 37 . <P> Call to the Office . According to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange , the dividend reduction should have been flashed at once to the Exchange and the Dow-Jones ticker service . Through a series of secretarial slipups , the messages were delayed by nearly an hour . Unaware of this , J. Cheever Cowdin , who was both a C-W director and a partner in Cady , Roberts , telephoned his office and left a message for Gintel about the dividend reduction . For a few moments , Gintel was the only outsider with the news . Instinctively , he sold-and made for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In the ensuing investigation of Hurley and the strange behavior of C-W shares , Gintel was singled out for having acted on insider information and was severely reprimanded by the Exchange and fined $3,000 , which was the same profit he had made for his wife 's account by selling 950 shares short . <P> Something to Live With . Though Gintel argued that he simply acted to protect his customers , the SEC last week suspended him for 20 days from the New York Stock Exchange . The ruling : since Gintel had acquired inside information through a special relationship with an insider , he was bound by the same rule as insiders . Said the SEC : " Clients may not expect of a broker the benefits of his inside information at the expense of the public generally . " <P> Though most Wall Street houses already follow the principle that if one partner is an insider , all other partners in the firm must be prepared to behave like insiders , hardly anyone , including Gintel , doubted that the SEC had correctly used the episode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker : " If I know what the law is , I can live with it .
