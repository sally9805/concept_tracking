<P> The Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco is not so much a neighborhood as a state of mindlessness . The Erewhon of America 's " pot left , " a 10-by-15 block midtown section , has over the past year become the center of a new utopianism , compounded of drugs and dreams , free love and LSD . It is a far cry from the original Utopia , envisioned some 400 years ago by Sir Thomas More , whose denizens demanded six hours of work each day : the 7,000 mind-blown residents of San Francisco 's " Psychedelphia " demand a zero-hour day and free freak-outs for all . <P> Speed &; Acid . Utopia on the Bay is bounded at one end by the greenery of Golden Gate Park , split down the middle by the fragrant eucalyptus trees of " The Panhandle . " Tourist buses have already made The Haight-Ashbury ( its residents insist on the definite article ) a regular stop . Down the center of Psychedelphia runs Haight Street ( which hippies hope to have renamed " Love Street " ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver-mining Floods and the couture-vending Magnins-is studded with steamboat-Gothic mansions and psychedelic gathering places like the " I and Thou " coffee shop and the " Print Mint . " Its inhabitants wear everything from Elizabethan motley to Judean beards . They preach every gospel from the 19th century socialism of France 's Charles Fourier to the all-purpose caritas of St. Francis . Most of them-perhaps 80%-are steadily high on drugs ranging from LSD to such synthetic stimulants as Methedrine , Dexedrine and Benzedrine , which are known collectively as " speed . " Gaudily painted trucks and buses thread with somnambulatory leisure through The Haight-Ashbury 's sunny streets like evocations of an acid dream ; the sickly scent of incense fills the air to mask the reek of marijuana . <P> Strollers wear jingle bells at their ankles , beads or flowers at their throats , and strum guitars or tootle flutes . It is not rare to see a Haight Street hippie put a dime in a parking meter , then flake out along the curb for a legal dose of sun tan . Wall posters , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them signed " Love " or " Peace " and bearing such timeless messages as " Gypsy come home-your mother is pushed out of shape . " <P> Illogical Extension . The Haight-Ashbury is an illogical extension of such 1950-style scenes as Los Angeles ' Venice West , New York 's South Village , and San Francisco 's own North Beach , where the beats of the **29;1285;TOOLONG generation gathered in delicious despair . What has been added is a vague sense of mission , drawn from the ideals of the New Left and the new lotus-eaters . Central to that new theme are " The Diggers , " who run a sort of psychedelic soup kitchen providing free chow to hungry hippies.
