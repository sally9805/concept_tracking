The Autobiography of W. E. B. Du Bois . International Publishers , $10 . If the name " Du Bois " means anything at all to most Americans , it is probably linked in their minds with those campus sects ? the Du Bois clubs ? that speak for Moscow-style Communism . Several years ago Richard Nixon , with his special gift for parodying our native follies , suggested that the campus Communists were trying to capitalize on the phonetic kinship between the Du Bois clubs ( dew boys ) and the Boys Clubs ( da boys ) . Actually , the Communists were quite within their rights , for in the last decade of his remarkable life ? he died in 1963 at the age of ninety-five -- William Edward Burghardt Du Bois had become a loyal and , it must he added , a courageous spokesman for Stalin ism . Most of his life Du Bois was something decidedly better . He was the first American Negro in the twentieth century to gain national recognition as intellectual , tribune , and agitator . Prickly , gifted , endlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how his unavoidable embattlement had forced him , as he said , into a " twisted life " and sufficiently principled to keep right on battling . He taught , he exhorted , he prodded and shamed American Negroes into their climb from passivity to militancy . He was a scholar of some importance , both as sociologist of urban Negro life and historian of Black Reconstruction . He kept hammering away at the thick hide of American conscience , and by his example made ridiculous the racist nonsense in which Americans indulged themHarper 's Magazine , March 1568 selves . Above all else , he was a formidable antagonist , tough in polemic , fierce with a phrase , impatient toward fools . Hardly a tendency in Negro politics today , but it owes something to Du Bois . In the course of his long life he tasted the repeated defeats of the American Negroes and , with the energy of despair , kept changing his views , sometimes to place his stress on absolute integration and sometimes to fall back on a kind of segregated nationalism . His experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet this remarkable man is barely known today ? we Americans are not very strong when it comes to historical memory . Du Bois wrote two incomplete autobiographies , Darkwater at fifty and Dusk of Dawn when past seventy . The first shows Du Bois at the point in his career , surely the most interesting , when he had fought a hard battle against Booker T. Washington 's creed of accommodation ; the second shows Du Bois at a point when he had in effect turned his back on American society and accepted a quasi-nationalist view of the Negro struggle , which in some respects was similar to that of Washington himself . The book now issued as his Autobiography was completed in 1960. when Du Bois was past ninety , and together with an account of his life in the Negro movement , every page of which is valuable , it includes sections on his travels in Russia and China and his harassment as a political suspect during the McCarthy years , every page of which is predictable . International Publishers , the leftwing house that has issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by no means an entirely new piece of work ; clearly , when it comes to commercial caginess , it has little to learn from bourgeois publishers . Nevertheless , the Autobiography is a work of considerable importance . Parts of it , dealing with Du Bois 's youth and early years , form a classic of American narrative : composed in a lovely if old-fashioned formal prose , rich in portraiture of late nineteenth-century New England , and packed with information and opinion about the early years of Negro protest . Other parts read as if they came from the very heart of a mimeograph machine . The classical outcry of Negro autobiography in America is probably Richard Wright 's Black Boy , a record of suffering so extreme and anger so harsh as to be almost beyond bearing and sometimes beyond belief . Claude Brown 's Manchild in the Promised Land follows roughly in the same tradition . By way of contrast and correction , Ralph Ellison 's scattered memoirs stress the inner strength and occasional joy of American Negro life ; Ellison rejects the notion that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to create its own values and improvise its own Mr. Ho-we , bimonthly critic in these columns , is professor of English at Hunter College , the editor of the magazine " Dissent , " and author of several books , including " Politics and the Novel . " pleasures . Nothing written by these or other gifted American Negroes prepares one , however , for the opening autobiographical pages of Du Bois , an account of his youth that seems quintessentially American in its pastoral serenity : I was born by a golden river and in the shadow of two great hills , five years after the Emancipation Proclamation , which began the freeing of American Negro slaves . The valley was wreathed in grass and trees and crowned to the eastward by the huge bulk of East Mountain , with crag and cave and dark forests .... The town of Great Barrington , which lay between these mountains in Berkshire County , Western Massachusetts , had a broad Main Street , lined with maples and elms , with white picket fences before the homes . The climate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been living in this area since the late eighteenth century , part of a tiny enclave that hardly knew segregation or hostility . When the elder Du Bois , a man of mixed blood , came to Great Barrington , he joined a clan of Negroes who lived by farming , minor crafts , and service jobs : a world relatively comfortable and enjoying the stiff democracy of the New England town . All the traits we associate with New England ? the Puritan stress upon work , the inbred life of the family , the personal styles of reticence and rectitude ? seem to have been absorbed by these Negroes obscurely nestling in Western Massachusetts . And when Du Bois writes about his boyhood , he presents himself not so much as a Negro but as an American of an older and more virtuous age : The schools of Great Barrington were simple but good , well-taught ; and truant laws were enforced . I started on one school ground , and continued there until I was graduated from high school . I was seldom absent or tardy . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously on the multiplication tables and we drew accurate maps . We could spell correctly and read with understanding . This was not , nor could it be , an untarnished idyll . Negroes , even when living in comfort , had an awareness of limited opportunities . Still , The colored folk were not set aside in the sense that the Irish were , but were a part of the community of long standing ; and in my case as a child , I felt no sense of difference or separation from the main mass of townspeople . Bright in school , the boy found encouragement among the townspeople ; once he bought Macaulay 's History of England in five volumes , in 25-cent weekly installments ; and when the time came for him to go to college , the local whites raised a purse , a sort of community scholarship . What grips one in reading these pages is the story of a life that on almost every outward level follows the pattern of American industry and ambition yet must carry within itself the certainty of frustration , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoke . Young Du Bois seems to have sensed all this himself : he was class orator when he was graduated from school in 1884 , but the address he gave was a celebration of Wendell Phillips , the great Abolitionist leader . It is as if that " twisted life " about which decades later he would speak so bitterly had enforced itself upon his consciousness from the very start . Yet the boy had never moved beyond the protected circle of Negro life in Western Massachusetts . He knew little or nothing , at first hand , about the life of American Negroes in the terrible years when the white South had reestablished itself through sheer terror and the white North had sunk back into indifference . When the idea came up that he should go to Fisk University , a Negro school in Nashville , Du Bois 's family objected strongly , for they must certainly have understood what their darling would encounter on a journey south . But their darling went , and it changed his life forever . " Henceforward I was a Negro . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bois 's work as a summer teacher in Eastern Tennessee , where he was greeted by the Negro farmers with a touching and absolute faith : I travelled not only in space but in time . I touched the very shadow of slavery . I lived and taught school in log cabins built before the Civil War . My first school was the second held in the district since Emancipation .... Despite his difficulties in opening himself to other people ? perhaps because of them ? Du Bois proved to be a goad teacher : I loved my school , and the fine faith the children had in the wisdom of their teacher was truly marvelous . We read and spelled together , wrote a little , picked flowers , sang , and listened to stories of the world beyond the hill . Exposure to the post-Reconstruction South brought crucial lessons : " No one but a Negro going into the South without previous experience of color caste can have any conception of its barbarism . " After Fisk , Du Bois was lucky enough to get into Harvard for graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever to be admitted there , he slipped still more deeply into that schizoid way of life from which , it now seems clear , he really had no escape : half pampered prodigy , half despised nigger . He studied with William James ( who was genuinely kind ) and Santayana ; the years in the South had prepared him psychologically for the mixture of icy correctness and subtle segregation he would find in Cambridge ; and he turned , by way of defense , into " a self-centered ' grind ' with a chip on my shoulder . " But meanwhile he was learning how to shape his life : he was learning to live inwardly , tensely , at a high emotional price but also from the incomparable resources of his pride . " I had my ' island within ' and it was a fair country . " Picture him now at twenty-six : a young Negro scholar who had done graduate work at Harvard and spent time in further study abroad ; a bit of a dandy flashing a Van Dyke beard , elegant gloves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teaching job at Wilberforce University , a Negro denominational school , for $800 a year . In these years he commanded " a terrible bluntness of speech that was continually getting me into difficulty . " Between his grating iconoclasm and the fundamentalist pieties of the Negro college at the turn of the century , there could be no lasting truce . As Du Bois struggled through academic life ? with a happy thirteen-year stay at Atlanta University , one of the few Negro schools that deserved to be taken seriously ? he slowly carved out his special role . He would be both scholar and tribune , both a dispassionata student of the socioeconomic situation of Philadelphia Negroes and the leading spirit among those Negro intellectuals who set themselves the goal of the outer liberation and inner regeneration of their people . This was then , as now , an overwhelming task , for it required Du Bois to confront both white domination and black demoralization . Atlanta was poor but hospitable . It gave Du Bois freedom to begin serious sociological studies of Negro life , to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold his annual Conferences where the programmatic bases would be worked out for the Negro movements of tomorrow . The one thing modern history seems to bear out is that every movement for liberation requires first of all a totally committed intelligentsia , a vanguard of visionaries ? and this Du Bois helped create . Living now in the Deep South , however , he could not work in isolation or without disturbance . Very soon he had to confront ? which meant , unavoidably , to clash with ? Booker T. Washington , then the dominant figure in American Negro life and one of the canniest politicians ever to operate in this country . Nothing in Du Bois 's life , nothing in the BOOKS history of twentieth-century American Negroes , is more important than this clash . 117 The standard " enlightened " view of Washington which until recently I accepted without question ? it is a view shared by most liberals and perhaps by most Negroes ? runs something like this : When Booker T. Washington made his famous 1895 Address at the Atlanta Exposition , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surrender . According to Washington , the Negroes would cede their claims to equal citizenship and would repress their struggle for political power , civil rights , and higher education . In return for this recognition of the supremacy it had just wrested through terror , the South would call a halt to lynching and wanton brutality , and would help the Negroes gain vocational training , so that they could find employment in crafts and new light industries . White and Negro labor ( I continue to summarize Washington 's scheme ) would be taken out of competiton , by strict segregation in work and by granting the whites a near-monopoly of skilled employment . Negroes would be left with farm and unskilled labor . As a sweetener for this arrangement , Northern white philanthropy would enter the picture by providing financial help , so that the Southern Negroes could establish their craft and industrial training schools . Disfranchised and resigned to second-class status , the Southern Negroes would at least find a peace of sorts and be able to achieve some economic improvements . For the militant Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of a sellout . Du Bois opened the attack : The black men have a duty to perform ... a forward movement to oppose a part of the work of their greatest leader . So far as Mr. Washington preaches Thrift , Patience , and Industrial Training for the masses , we must hold up his hands and strive with him .... But so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice , North or South , does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting , belittles the emasculating effects of caste distinctions , and opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds ... we must unceasingly and firmly oppose him . Years later an authoritative Negro historian , J. Saunders Bedding , would continue in the vein of Du Bois : Having raised Washington to power , it was in white America 's interest to keep him there . All race matters could be referred to him , and all decisions affecting the race would seem to come from him . In this there was much pretense and , plainly , not a little cynicism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sanction of the Negro people ; and there was the pretense , second , that speaking in the name of his people , he spoke for them . But what if , like it or not , Washington did speak for them ? And still more painful , what if Washington 's strategy was the only workable one for Southern Negroes at the turn of the century ? These were questions that radicals , liberals , and militant Negroes never thought to ask ? and for perfectly understandable reasons . During the last few decades it has been necessary above all to break from the psychology of acquiescence which Washington had encouraged . But now that time has passed and some histori-BOOKS cal perspective is possible , we can see that the Du Bois-Washington battle was far more complex than we had supposed . Booker T. Washington was in effect the leader of a conquered people , and a conquered people is never quite free to choose its own leaders . He was , if you like , the Petain of the American Negroes , but far shrewder and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French . The evidence also suggests that Washington was sometimes a surreptitious de Gaulle , deeply involved in a quasi-underground resistance . Professor August Meier , a histor. ian whose sympathies are wholly with the civil-rights militants , has printed in the Journal of Southern History , May 1957 , a fascinating account of the Washington-Du I3ois struggle in which he presents a large amount of evidence to show that the issues between the two men can not be reduced to acquiescence vs. militancy . Du Bois was an intellectual whose obligation it was to think in terms of long-range ends ; Washington was a leader who had to cope with immediate problems . The white South had just achieved a counterrevolution in which Negroes had been reduced to near-slavery ; in fact , as Washington made clear in his still-impressive autobiography Up front Slavery , the Negroes were in many respects worse off than before the Civil War . They were frightened , demoralized , and economically helpless . Simply to come to them and cry out for militant struggle in behalf of political enfranchisement or full integration , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little help to them , and would have provoked ghastly retaliation from the white South . Washington had therefore to maneuver from day to day , making the best he could out of an all but total defeat . He spoke deprecatingly of political rights in order to assuage the whites whose money and toleration he needed ; but in practice , as Professor Meier shows , he covertly tried to preserve the Negro franchise and kept supplying funds for test cases in the cou rts . Washington was an extremely skillful leader . He built up a network of semi-visible agents throughout the country , whom he kept under strict control by means of subsidies and shrewd tactical advice . He maintained close connections with the Republican party and especially Theodore Roosevelt , serving as its central agency for dispensing patronage ( such as it was ) to Negroes . He was friendly with some of the richest and most reactionary white industrialists . Professor Meier concludes : " Washington was surreptitiously engaged in undermining the American race system .... The picture that emerges from Washington 's correspondence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " Yet when Du Bois launched his fierce assaults upon Washington , he was clearly speaking to the point . For it was true that in large measure Washington had pledged the Negroes to the humiliations of Jim Crow . It was true that officially he had made peace with the reigning powers . It was true that he felt strong hostility toward the handful of Negro intellectuals who distrusted his political machine , his dictatorial methods , and his wily rhetoric . Washington was not an attractive figure ; he was a remarkable leader who helped sustain the morale of a broken people . And to the extent that he succeeded , he prepared the way for his own removal . Du Bois was a brilliant intellectual who insisted that only a program of unconditional equality could be acceptable to enlightened Negroes and who proposed as a major immediate task the training of a Negro elite , the Talented Tenth , " which might lead the black masses into struggle . In a recent biography of Du Bois ( Stanford University Press ) , Mr. Francis Broderick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and style : Washington , thick-set and slow-moving , had the assurance of a self-trained man . A shrewd , calculating judge of people , he had the soft speech and accommodating manners that made him equally at home among sharecroppers and at the President 's table . A master of equivocation , he made platitudes pass as earthly wisdom . . . Du Bois , slight , nervous in his movements , never forgot for a moment his educational background . Proud and outspoken , he held aloof from the Negro masses , but felt at home with a small company of his peers . . ? . Washington had the appearance of a sturdy farmer in his Sunday best ; Du Bois , with his well-BOOKS trimmed goatee , looked like a Spanish aristocrat .... James ' Weldon Johnson observed years later that one unfamiliar with the twelve-year period after 1903 could not imagine " the bitterness of the antagonism between these two wings . " In the short run , there can be no doubt that Washington offered the Southern Negroes more than Du Bois possibly could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly yield visible benefits . But Du Bois , in part because he lacked Washington 's deep roots in Southern life and in part because he worked from a truly national perspective , opened the way for the decades of struggle that were inevitable . He might not be able to compete with Washington at the moment ? what could he offer an industrious Negro hoping to learn carpentry ? ? but he was right in saying that even if Washington 's entire program were realized it would not begin to solve the problems of the American Negroes . For as the historian Vann Woodward has remarked , " Washington 's individualistic doctrine never took into account the realities of mass production , industrial integration , financial combination , and monopoly . . ? . His training school ... taught crafts and attitudes more congenial to the pre-machine age than to the twentieth century .... " We see here one of those utterly tragic situations in which two enormously talented men are pitted against each other in ferocious struggle , each clinging to a portion of the truth , each perceiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those objective barriers which the triumphant whites place before all Negroes , acquiescent or rebellious . The more men like Du Bois and Washington were penned in as Negroes , the more they were driven as Negro leaders to fight with one another . Yet from that war , at unmeasured cost , there emerged the Negro movement as we have come to know it . in 1905 Du Bois and a handful of intellectuals started the Niagara Movement , which put forward , with stirring bluntness , a program for unconditional equality . From the Niagara Movement there soon emerged the NAACP , in which Du Bois would spend a large portion of his life , as editor of its journal Crisis , as its main spokesman to theworld at large , and as a hard battler within its ranks for whatever his ideas happened at a given moment to be . V The final years were somewhat less than glorious . Du Bois , whose whole life had been devoted to a restless experiment in unorthodoxy and rebellion , ended his life by lapsing into Stalinism , that dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union show not the slightest trace of discomfort , even though they were written after the Khrushchew revelations . On the Hungarian revolution : " I was glad when the Soviet Union intervened and thus served notice on all reactionaries .. . " etc. , etc . On China : " envy and class hate are disappearing . " On Russia : " the overwhelming power of the working class ... is always decisive . " On Western Europe : " the British unions and the AFL united to divide Germany and to restore the Nazis to power in West Germany . " What troubles one is not merely that such remarks are inane , but that Du Bois surrendered all those critical attitudes he had spent a lifetime sharpening . And this can not be explained by senility ; he kept his powers to a remarkable extent . I see , then , two ways of grappling with the problem , either one of which could form a conclusion : ? W. E. B. Du Bois suffered every defeat and humiliation of his people , and he kept changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes what should simply have been their birthright . Is it not entirely understandable , therefore , that in his ultimate despair he should have turned to the ideology of Stalinism ? That he should have ignored its repressions and murders , so long as it seemed to champion the rights of black men ? What is surprising is not that Du Bois turned toward a totalitarian outlook but that so few Negroes joined him . To judge the octogenarian Du Bois is to display a failure in sympathy concerning the emotions of the oppressed . r To understand is one thing , to justify another . The explanation just offered for Du Bois 's acquiescence in totalitarian politics may be quite correct , yet that does not remove the fact that he , so long a victim of injustice at home , became an apologist for injustice abroad . After all , there were other Negro leaders , equally militant , who found it possible to fight against Jim Crow in America without becoming apologists for dictatorship in Europe and Asia          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
