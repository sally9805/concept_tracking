Notes and Comment OUR eye was arrested recently by a Radio Free Europe Fund advertisement in the Times that asked , " Will your grandchildren read the Bible ... or Karl Marx ? Nikita Khrushchev has said , ' Your grandchildren will grow up under Communism . ' It the Soviet Premier 's threat comes true , your grandchildren will study Karl Marx . " We are convinced that Mr. Khrushchev 's prediction will nut come true , but we think that our grandchildren had jolly well better read both the 13ible and Karl Marx , if they know what 's good for them , and no either-or about in What 's more , we 'd urge that they take a good , careful look at " Mein Kampf , " the Veda , the Koran , and the United States Constitution .

" Grolier Gastronomy WE missed the espionage exhibit at the Grolier Club last fall , but this institution 's recent gastronomy show found us at a black-tie vernissage lecture in its exhibition hall , seated near Mr. Washington Dodge , a director of Henry Holt &; Co. and the Colonial Sand &; Stone Co. , and Mr. Alfred A. Knopf , of Knopf and Random House . The speaker of the evening was Mr. Ted Patrick , the editor of Holiday and , to the best of our knowledge , the only man with a Who 's Who listingthat certifies him in the same breath , or flourish of the typewriter , as a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor , a commander of the Italian Order of Merit , and a commander of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin , a Burgundian drinking society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy wedding , but I think things are getting better , " this commanding figure said as we gazed over Mr. Knopf 's shoulder at a Cave du Restaurant de la Pyramirk menu dated " 23 I1otit 19.53 " and inscribed , beneath its content , " Pour Mme. et M. if . II . Knopf . " Mr. Patrick proceeded to discuss cookbooks , among which he cited Escoffier 's as the greatest , and guidebooks , among which he awarded the palm to Michelin and the back of his hand to Duncan Hines . " The Guide Michelin sends anonymous men into the kitchens of the restaurants it visits , " he said . " ' That 's why it 's called a sociitr anonyme , " said Mr. Dodge , sotto-voce . Next , Mr. Patrick saluted BrillatSavarin as the master of gourmet works , and George Saintsbury as the peerless leader of reminiscent gastronomicalbooks . " Then , there 's a strange category of author who is against food , " he said . " Sort of a Robert Ruark type .

" Periodical writing has improved , through the efforts of Craig Claiborne , " he said of that journal 's food editor . " He has raised the whole Level of newspaper food writing . " He went on to observe that in his opinion the Pavillon is the greatest restaurant in America , and " 21 " the noisiest . " What in the world do men know about cooking ? " we heard a lady say as , the lecture over , we strolled about the hall . " How many of them have cooked three meals a day for four or more people for twenty years , as I have ? " Proceeding chronologically , we inspected an Egyptian butcher 's hill , circa 2350 B.C. , inscribed on a baked clay tablet one inch square ; a black serpentine Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal , circa 900 B.C. , depicting a king at a ritual repast ; a manuscript , one remove from unique , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth-century Neapolitan recipes ; a Mermaid Tavern dinner hill ; and a galaxy of Early American cookbooks , including Fannie Farmer 's . At this point , we were providentially joined by Mr. Herbert Cahoon , of the Morgan Library and the Grolier Club 's committee on arrangements . He advised us that the show , which he installed , had been suggested by Mr. Edward Naumhurg , Jr. , a member of the club 's council . " We 've had room for only two hundred major items , " he said . " I 'm not counting such miscellaneous ones as Alfred Knopf 's wine labels . We 've borrowed from the Morgan Library , the Academy of Medicine , private collectors , and dealers ; two excellent cookbook dealers are the Corner Book Shop , on lower Fourth Avenue , and Elisabeth Woodburn , in Hopewell , New Jersey .

Bok , editor of the Ladies ' Home Journal , asking him to excise references to drinking from the fist installment of his " A Christmas Venture " ( " It is absolutely necessary that there should be no mention of drinking in our magazine " ) . A couple of wine bottles , labelled " Pontet-Canet 1888 , " attracted our notice , and Mr. Cahoon said they had been found in the club 's cellar by James Lovett , who has been the steward since 1923 .

CIVIL WAR CENTENNIAL INTELLIGENCE : In a window at Hammacher Schlemmer is an " 1861 Turn Coat " for dogs . On one side are the Confederate colors , on the other the Union colors . Parabolized SOME mightyarcane courses are taught in various odd corners of this great city , and among the most arcane that we 've encountered is a course in telescope-mirror-making , sponsored jointly by the Hayden Planetarium and the Optical Division of the Amateur Astronomers Association . Two classes are held each week , on Tuesday and Thursday evenings , from seven to ten , deep in the dungeons of the Planetarium building , and about a dozen students are to be found in each class . Most of them are men  --  men of all ages and occupations , who seem to have very little in common except the pleasure they derive from standing for hours in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . As for the drums , Mr. Richard Luce , the benign , white-haired chairman of the Optical Division of the Amateur Astronomers Association , explained them to us at once . " They serve as ideal workbenches , " he said . " ' We 've had them ever since 1937 , when we started giving this course . What 's important about them is their weight and steadiness . Back in ' 37 , we filled them with six hundred pounds of water apiece , and the water 's been in there ever since . " Steadiness is crucial to mirror-making , Mr. Luce went on , because when a mirror is being ground , a single careless stroke or slight jarring of the glass may spell ruin . The student begins by fixing a disc of plate glass six inches in diameter and about an inch high to the top of a drum . This disc is called the tool . Granulated carborundum is sprinkled over the surface of the tool and moistened , and a second piece of glass , of exactly the same shape as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror even before it becomes one , is slowly rubbed over the tool until , after hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours ( in the course of which increasingly fine grades of carborundum are used ) , a perfect spherical section has been scooped out of the Pyrex . Mr. Luce noted that by " perfect " he meant a section that touched at all spots . When the mirror has reached this point , it is polished with pitch impregnated with rouge . Then a few final strokes over the tool parabolize the mirror , which is to say that they deepen the curve a few millionths of an inch . The surface of the Pyrex is thereupon coated with aluminum and set in the bottom of a six-inch telescope , where , if all is in order , it serves as a bucket for catching starlight and reflecting it , via another mirror , to the eyepiece . " A very delicate operation , " said Mr. Luce , " A single piece of coarse carborundum getting into the powder can scratch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash might do the same thing . There 's nothing like a spoiled glass , after Eft ) hours ' work , for bringing out a person 's true character . " Leading us into a darkroom reserved for the testing of mirrors , Mr. Luce introduced us to an associate of his , Mr. Roy A. Seely , who turned out to be chairman of the Occultation Committee of the American Association of Variable Star Observers . What does the chairman of an occultation committee do Why , he makes sure that the moon is on schedule , 1/3 checking stars that are behind it . Is the moon on schedule , we asked , and Mr , Seely was able to assure us that , at that moment , it was . " It rarely gets more than a second ahead or behind , but it 's always good to know for certain , " he said . " Would n't he able to predict eclipses if you did n't know . " Mr. Seely vouchsafed the further information that he is a past president of the A.A. V.S.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CM e for every variable star ; and that his favorite stars , both of which can he captured by the six-inch mirrors made in class , are SS Cygni and R Coronae Borealis , because they are the most variable . Mr. Seely was engaged in testing the almost finished mirror of one of the most promising students in the class  --  the Reverend Frank West , a local minister . Mr. West , who was anxiously standing by , told us that he 'd worked all through the previous week 's class period getting a last , tiny hump out of his mirror , and that he hoped he 'd done it right . " I 've never looked at anything through a telescope , and now I 'll he finding out what it 's like up there , " he said . ( The phrase " up there " struck us as an appropriate one for a gentleman of the cloth to use . ) " I 'm a minister trained in psychiatry , " he went on , " and I 'd recommend mirror-making as being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We were about to ask him whether he intended this remark to he taken personally by us when Mr. Seely , having eyed the mirror through an instrument called a Foucault shadow tester , declared that its spherical section was as near perfect as no matter , and sent a happy Reverend back to his drum to parabolize . The Case of Tooth No. 12 AWARRIOR of the Second World War , who returned to civilian pursuits in 1945 , was astounded to receive this message not long ago from the adjudication officer of the Los Angeles Regional Office of the Veterans Administration : DEAR Sic : From time to time we must review all cases to be sure that all action taken is correct , The evidence now in your case shows that service-connection for Tooth No. 12 is clearly wrong . The term -service-connection " refers to an injury that is considered to have occurred while a serviceman was on active duty . I Therefore , we propose to end service-connection for this tooth . Records show that service-connection was granted for Tooth No. 12 by comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge examination which showed it missing . Subsequent records from the Service Department show that this tooth was noted as nonrestorable on examination dated February 17 , 1942 , less than 30 days after entrance on active duty . The tooth was extracted on February 18 , 1942- A determination has , therefore , been made that treatment for Tooth No , 12 was for defects which preexisted enlistment , and that the treatment given was remedial . This is not a final decision and we realize how serious the matter is to you . Any additional evidence you may have should be submitted as soon as possible . The most effective type of evidence would he a statement torn a dentist or doctor who treated or examined this tooth prior to your enlistment . You may also come to this office to explain personally why you feel that service-connection is warranted . Sixty days from the date of this Letter we will review all evidence in your claim and inform you of our decision . If this action is taken we will terminate your service-connection for Tooth No. 12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Tooth No. 12 and is currently worried about a couple of shaky molars ( No. 14 and No. 18 ) .

SIGN glimpsed by a nervous Mani hattan motorist trying to find his way out of Woodstock , New York , at dusk on a gray winter 's day : " ELECTRIC WELDING &; TATTOOING . " Mostly Sir Sydney AMATTER-or-FACT gruesome- n ess characterizes all Sir Sydney 's stories , whether set against the background of Edinburgh . or of Egypt , " the . Rerald Tribune Book Review said of " Mostly Murder , " the autobiography of Sir Sydney Smith , some Sundays ago . " But even very bloodthirsty readers will regret there is not more in it about Sir Sydney , obviously 2 most attractive person as well as an eminent expert . His private life is not , however , on sale for four dollars and ninety-five cents . " Neither is it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , but , thanks to Sir Sydney 's recent presence at the Second International Meeting on Forensic Pathology and Medidile , which was held at the New York University Medical Center , and to our recent presence in his rooms at the Commodore , we are in a position to tell a little more about him than he chose to tell about himself in his autobiography . As one of the world 's leading authorities no forensic medicine , or medical jurisprudence , he had been suitably honored by the Meeting , and we found him , a blue-eyed man with a quizzical expression , fingering a sizable bronze medal . " New York University gave it to me today , " Sir Sydney said . " It 's a very serious symptom when you start getting these things . I do n't believe it 's gold . We used to give gold medals for theses at Edinburgh University , but gold has gone up , and now we give silver gilt . They 're known as gold medals , though . " We had boned up on the reticent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Zealand in 1883 , the son of a Londoner who had gone out for gold and ended up as a roadmaker ; that , after a medical education there and in Scotland , he had spent three years as a medical officer in New Zealand and eleven far more exciting ones as Principal Medico-Legal Expert to the Egyptian Ministry of Justice ; and that between 1928 and 1957 he had served his alma mater , Edinburgh University , first as Regius Professor of Forensic Medicine , then as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine , and finally as Rector . Egypt , Sir Sydney told us , is a capital place for capital crime . " When I was there , it had a population of fourteen million , and a thousand murders a year , or about seventy per million , " he said . " We 're amateurs in Great Brit ain  --  only three murders per million per annum . I should imagine you have ten times that many . This is my first visit to New York . I 'm impressed by the towering immensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should think you 'd want to get out of town for relief , though . I liked the Egyptians , you know ; I enjoyed the whole life there . My job was more fun than going to the opera , and I got paid for it ; my salary was tax-free , and the government made me a Commander of the Order of the Nile , Third Class . The Egyptians are very good people , though they do a spot of murder ; it does n't mean very much to them . Over in Ceylon , where the people are nice and quiet and easygoing , there 's also an enormous amount of murder . Arsenic is a favorite poison with murderers everywhere , and has been from the earliest times  --  I suppose because it 's so easily obtained and so easily administered . It has no taste  --  you can drop a few grains in your target 's coffee  --  but it 's the worst possible poison in point of detection ; it sticks in the body , and you can get it in an autopsy years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wrote a textbook , ' Forensic Medicine and Toxicology , ' in 1924 , and I 'm now knocking up another book , on poisons and poisoners through the ages , with El good deal about the early Venetians . Murder is an old story , but sexual crimes have gone up tremendously in recent years . Bad behavior is perfectly natural , of course ; good behavior has to he developed through training , and there 's less training of children these days than there used to he . In England and Wales , crime indictable offenses  --  multiplied six times between 1900 and 1957 , mostly among fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds . I do n't know where the end lies . The human race is degenerating , but if everyone degenerates I suppose we 'll achieve a kind of normality in degeneration . " We asked which poisons are hard to detect " Well , there 's stramonium , which comes from the thorn apple , but I do n't think I 'd better go into this subject , " Sir Sydney said . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You find that by not doing something you should you put it off , so you always have something to do . One of the great pleasures in life is not doing something you ought to do , such as writing a book on poisons . You just say , ' Well , I wo n't write anything today , ' and then you go out to your garden my wife and I have a nice one , outside Edinburgh , with a greenhouse full of peaches and grapes and pears  --  and you do n't cultivate it . ( You get someone else to do that . ) Or you go to your club  --  I belong to Edinburgh 's New Club , which is very old ? ? and browse through the papers . I refuse to play cards there , I 've never been any gond at cards ; I think I 'm too stupid . I never can remember any of the cards that have been played . Do you know , that textbook of mine is still being used  --  it was published in Arabic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its tenth edition  --  but my entire royalties from it have come to less than those I 've already had from ' Mostly Murder . ' " Sir Sydney shook his head , and his wife , a jolly-hooking , lady , came into the apartment , followed by a man who handed him a copy of " Mostlj Murder " and asked him to autograph it . Having obtained the autograph , the man left , and Sir Sydney asked Lady Smith who he was . " I have n't the remotest ; he just followed me up in the elevator , " she said , with a Scottish burr . " I thought he was one of your old students . " " Never saw him before , " said Sir Sydney . " I 've just had my hair done , " Lady Smith said , shaking her curls at us . " My husband was given a standing ovation and three cheers when he got that medal this morning . We met in Edinburgh , where I was born , and we 've been married fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country boy from New Zealand , and fell into her clutches , " Sir S. said affectionately . " We came here on the Mauretania and are going hack on the Statendam . I prefer sea travel to air . I like the routine of a ship . I used to fly a lot , but I found that after a flight I was stone-deaf . " " Our son , Sydney , is a writer , " Lade Smith said to us . " He wrote a play that was produced at the Edinburgh Festival last summer . " " Hr was very cock-a-hoop about it , " Sir Sydney said . " I wrote a play myself once , when I was an undergraduate . It was about various diseases and various parts of the body . They assumed various roles . " Lady Smith gave her husband a look . " It was unprintable , " he said . " The cerebellum was the governess , and so on . " Lady Smith mustered up another connubial look and said something that sounded to us like " Biscuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the body , " Sir Sydney said . " The liver ? " Ladv Smith repeated her mysterious word , and Sir Sydney lapsed into silence . We asked her what she had said , and she replied , " Uskut ! ' It means ' Shut up ! ' in Arabic . "
