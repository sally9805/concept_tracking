( As audience is getting settled actors begin to appear , one by one or in pairs . They lie down on the stage . When everyone is settled there is a short silence . As lights begin to dim , song is heard on tape . It should be played once before action begins . ) VOICE ( Singing The Viet Rock ) Far across the Southern Sea Is a land where Viets rock . Here every morning you can see The Viets roll . When the bombs fall , The Viets rock and rock . When the napalm bursts , Then the Viets roll . At the sound of jets , The Viets rock and rock . When the tracers flash , Then the Viets roll . Rock and roll , rock and roll , How the sweet Viets Love to rock and roll . Those dear little Viets Love our rock and roll .

The sounds should be joyous , aggressive , like those children make when playing vigorous games , but in no way should the actors try to give their impressions of sounds they think children make . This is cloying and irritating . The sound must come from their past , but the voices must come from inside and not be forced . The actors should have worked to free their imaginations before the play begins . What happens in the first ten minutes on the floor should take on the character of group free association , to represent a tribal recall of ancient scenes and events . Playtime material , especially of war games , cowboys and Indians , cops and robbers , should be allowed to come to the surface and explode into sound , sounds of weapons , horses , tanks , planes , guns , troops , orders , marching , bugles , songs , etc .

They talk to each other in a bubbly way and , holding hands , slowly rise together . This makes a beautiful shape , round but changing . They keep their heads down to maintain shape . As they rise , they begin to move in a circle . The circle begins to bounce . The sound is teasing and full of fun ; when they are nearly erect the circle should bounce up and down in unison . When it reaches a climax , the circle should explode , flinging the actors around the floor , laughing . They stay in place , laughing at each other . There is an instant transformation .

The situation is grave , the perils immense . We hope with the aid of the Almighty to find a just , equitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness ? ( Witness One is in place facing the Senators .

With all due respect to our Administration to whose commander and chief I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , that we stop pussy-footing around and won that war . From my vast experience in invading both islands and mainlands , with both foot soldiers and advanced weaponry , I say we have to lay our cards on the line and do the job . I say , get the atomic bulldozer operational . Get it off the drawing board and out bulling down that jungle . The native population should be moved temporarily to some valley in eastern California , and then get the hell the atomic bulldozer in there and push the jungle into the sea . That way there wo n't be any cover for the enemy to hide out in , we mop up , blacktop the cleared land  --  and then  --  shazam !  --  we have a hell of a parking lot for jet bombers for when the next domino threatens to fall . SENATOR ONE Well thought out . WITNESS ONE Someone had to do it , Sir . SENATOR TWO Next witness . SENATOR ONE You did it , Sir . WITNESS ONE Thank you , Sir . SENATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Woman Statesman , starts to make her way to the witness chair . The Senators rush to help her settle herself , then they resume their seats .

WITNESS FOUR Fellow officials . . . honored Senators , ladies and gentlemen of the press . . . my American fellows and gals , I want to tell you that this Administration to which I am a party to indulges in nothing but realism . I want to go on to say that realism does not rule out the hope that hope could come in the not too distant future . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SENATOR TWO Sir , would you care to elaborate on However ? WITNESS FOUR Why , Senator , I 'd be glad to . If the ignorant and sensational press would just stop overreacting , we could get a job of hope really done around this globe . But no ! Every tiny mistake , a few teensy bundles of bombs dropped in the wrong place , and the ignorant and sensational press just has to blow everything up . Blow it up . Blow it up . Blow it up . Bleep it . Blop . Bleep , gleep , blow . Sleep , sleep , sleep . Forgive me , but I have n't had any sleep in eighteen months . Blow it up . Blup . Blup .

SENATORS We hope so . WITNESS FIVE ( He speaks quite rapidly like a mechanical man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested observers around the galaxy that we 've begun to turn the tide . The moon is with us , we 're not quite over the hump , but do n't swallow the first deliberate propaganda line you see , but as free men learn to assess words . Words do n't mean what they say . Actually the north is tactically defeated , but we have n't begun to see the end of this thing . Some of my colleagues are encouraged , some see a war of attrition , some are optimistic . And I 'd like to say that for myself , I 'm cautiously optimistic in my transistors and capacitors , but on certain days my entire circuit is in deep despair . There is a question that I 'd like to put to you , Sirs ? p. 32 SENATORS Why , thank you , Sir . It 's an honor . WITNESS FIVE Sirs : who is man ? SENATORS Next witness !

WITNESS SIX You must negotiate with all parties . Have n't you learned the lesson of assassination ? SENATORS Assassination ? WITNESS SIX You had my husband and brother-in-law killed and they had your President assassinated . In some circles that is called an eye for an eye , in others tit for tat . SENATORS This woman is in contempt . Arrest her ! WITNESS SIX Hanoi is a beautiful city . I was born there . I want my children to see the streets where I walked as a girl . No one is safe ! No one is safe . ( She rushes to a bench and seems to stab everyone sitting there . They slump over . She becomes only an actor again and takes her place on opposite bench . A moment of chaos. ) p. 33 SENATOR TWO Arrest . Order ? Order ? Order ! SENATOR ONE Next witness . ( Witness Seven , a curly-headed writer , slumps to the chair and sits on the back of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a writer of your intense commitment take time off from his typewriter to give his views . SENATOR ONE What do you think we should do about the war in Vietnam ? WITNESS SEVEN Nothing . SENATOR TWO Nothing ? WITNESS SEVEN Nothing . The war will die of cancer . You 'll die of cancer . Everyone will die of cancer . Me , I think too much . I 'll die of cerebral hemorrhage . SENATOR ONE Nevertheless , as a leading writer of our country we 'd be happy to hear if you possibly have a possible solution . WITNESS SEVEN The war ai n't there , it 's here .

Vomit up the lard , you asses , before the future of our sperm is burned in Asiatic light . All you studs got to stop smearing napalm on the genitals of the weak . We got the fever . We do n't got prosperity , we got the fever . Purge the bestial disease of the computer madness wigged into your shit by the bitch Goddess  --  burn out the blood of the malignant cells and cleanse your ego before it 's too late . The horror from the sewer of our disease is rising up to choke your throat and all our images are manipulated from birth to death by cynics .

WITNESS EIGHT ( After pause ) Song of my people . SENATOR TWO Can you give the nation , your nation 's view of the situation in Vietnam ? WITNESS EIGHT ( After a long pause , a shadow of a smile . He gathers himself up and , shaking from within , fires at them . ) This is the end of the line for you  --  and all you white men . The red man and the yellow man and the black man are banding together . We will run you off the scorched face of this earth . We will run you into the sea . We will fly you into the air .

Their hands flutter in bewilderment . ) SENATOR TWO What have we here , Senator ? p. 35 SENATOR ONE They 're Vietnamese . Thought it only democratic we ask the opinion of the common people over there . SENATOR TWO Good man , Senator , good man . ( Witnesses ' crying mounts .

The Senator rises and gestures . ) SENATOR ONE Er , Usher ! Usher , will you please escort these ladies to the powder room . I think they want to freshen up . ( The Witnesses rise and quietly resume their seats . A beautiful woman , Witness Ten has taken her place in the witness chair . She arranges herself and maintains a radiant pose . The Senators rise in an attitude of prayer . Those on the benches kneel in place . Some sing , and others chant . The Senators move to the seated woman , genuflect , and place some small coins in her open palm . They genuflect again and back toward their chairs. ) p. 36 SENATOR ONE Madonna , words can not express the pleasure we feel in your presence . SENATOR TWO Madonna , what is your position on Vietnam ? ( The Madonna carefully and slowly strikes and holds another pose . The actress playing this role should study famous paintings and sculptures of the Madonna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are clear to the audience . The Senators ask her three more times to state her position on Vietnam . ) SENATOR ONE ( Chanting ) Holy Mother , we thank you for your views . ( The Madonna , gracefully and maintaining a pose , exits to her place on the bench , but it would be nice if she flew straight up and out of sight . ) SENATOR TWO Next witness !

Everyone becomes engaged in overt loving . One couple sends love out to the audience . ) SENATOR ONE ( In a daze , walks back to her chair ) Love . ( She kisses Senator Two. ) p. 38 WITNESS TWELVE ( A vigorous contemporary patriot jumps up and runs to the witness chair ) What is this soft-headed , lily-livered kind of thinking ? Is this for patriots ? Love ca n't stop criminals or tyrants . Love is no good without a body to express it . Get out there and defend the right to happiness of our brothers . ( He leaps up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freedom . Are you frightened to cross the Pacific ? CROWD ( Reacts ) No , no ! WITNESS TWELVE The world has shrunk to the size of a pea . We are our brother 's keeper . The flag of the United States of America shall shelter all who wish our aid . Hold your tongue . Stiffen your spine . There is still something worth fighting and worth dying for . The same thing our fathers and grandfathers fought and died for at Valley Forge , Gettysburg , the Alamo , Anzio , Guadalcanal , Iwo Jima , Okinawa , Pork Chop Hill . ( The crowd is all around his chair now . ) WITNESS TWELVE Freedom . Let freedom ring ! Kill for freedom ! ( The crowd repeats . He starts to sing America the Beautiful . Everyone sings with genuine patriotic fervor . They hoist him on their shoulders . They march all over the committee room . They march straight toward the audience , stop short , do an about-face . Salute , hold hands on hearts , etc for one full chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should sing with all the genuine love and gusto they can muster . Big , big , big ) @x ( Open with the stage filled by all the actors ; it should have the feeling of irregular squares . Some face audience . Some face stage left , others stage right . Some face upstage . They sing " America " exuberantly as before , but no sound comes out . If a proscenium stage is used , begin a Rockette chorus line and kick all the way to stage front . Every two lines they do an exact about-face so that they are facing opposite direction from opening of act . When they reach the chorus , they march to the formation for the next scene . Then all but three people fall to their knees and take up positions facing audience . Left standing are one G I , a Mother , a Girl . They are in the center of the mass of bodies in a triangle facing outward . The women who play " sweethearts " throughout the play kneel in front of the Girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Mother . Boys kneel in front of G I. As the scene begins all the actors on the floor should flirt with the audience , using only their eyes . It should be the effect of group snapshots in which only the eyes move . However , the three principals are mobile . As the scene progresses the three may change places . The scene should end with them clustered together , arms and bodies closely intertwined , but their faces still toward audience . ) G I March 9 , 1966 , My Tho , Vietnam . Dear Mother . . .

The men march around stage to the shouts of their Sergeant . The girls assemble themselves in an extraordinarily ragged and unruly line . They are now South Vietnamese soldiers . They make their lunches as they wait in the hot sun . They entertain themselves by singing sentimental love songs . Each actress should sing her favorite secret love song .
