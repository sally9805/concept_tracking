" It 's up ! " The word spread through the newsroom like a FLASH-IMMEDIATE wire bulletin . What was up , one afternoon last week , was a single sheet of white paper , thumbtacked to The New York Times 's third-floor notice board and signed by Publisher Arthur Ochs ( " Punch " ) Sulzberger , announcing a shake-up among top Times editors . Highlights of the memo : - " James Reston , Executive Editor , has been elected a Vice President with primary responsibility in the areas of news coverage . He will return to Washington and will continue his three-times-a-week column from there . " - " Clifton Daniel , Managing Editor , will become Associate Editor with a group of new duties . He will head up a series of special projects and will supervise the New York Times News Service . " &gt;- " Abe Rosenthal , Associate Managing Editor , and before that , Assistant Managing Editor and foreign correspondent , will become Managing Editor . " - " Seymour Topping , Foreign News Editor , will become an Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted , perceptive Times staffers had read the writing on the wall . It had been no secret that , at 59 , " Scotty " Reston-resident sage and star columnist-had not enjoyed the managerial duties of his executive editorship . It was also well known that he much preferred Washington to New York and felt that his column had suffered since he was moved away from his capital sources . <P> Nor did Managing Editor Clifton Daniel 's shift come as a surprise to many . Ever since Reston took command as executive editor over Daniel in May of 1968 , it had been generally assumed that Daniel , 59 , would be denied the full editorial control that his predecessor , Turner Catledge , had enjoyed . <P> Most predictable of all was Abe Rosenthal 's ascension to Daniel 's job . With Reston 's blessing , the innovative and energetic Rosenthal , 47 , had , in fact if not in name , been running the paper for months . Significantly , when Reston returns to Washington-probably next month-Rosenthal will report directly to the publisher . <P> Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last December when he made Rosenthal associate managing editor with license to ride herd on the " bullpen " - the traditionally sacrosanct bank of rewrite editors . Finally , the appointment of able , amiable Seymour Topping , 47 , as assistant managing editor gives his good friend Rosenthal a strong right hand . " Nearly two years ago , " Sulzberger summed up , " we began seriously to plan the transition to the next generation . . . That mission has been accomplished . " <P> The only surprise was that the announcement came sooner than expected . The changeover machinery , including the promotion of Reston to vice president , was geared to the retirement of Vice President Turner Catledge , which would have been mandatory in early 1971 when Catledge turns 70 . But five weeks ago , Catledge told Sulzberger he would retire at once , and Sulzberger and Reston set in motion the plan to install Rosenthal as top editor . When Cat-ledge changed his mind about retirement , the publisher decided to go ahead with the change anyway and created a new vice-presidential slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
