Meeting with a group of baseball luminaries in the White House last week , Lyndon Johnson accepted a bat from Boston Red Sox Slugger Carl Yastrzemski , then clowned it up for photographers by faking a bunt . The action drew a telling comment from the American League batting champion . " You 're too big to be a hunter , " Yastrzemski chided the President . " You have to hit home runs . " <P> <P> That is precisely the problem , particularly in L.B.J. 's low-scoring innings with the niggardly 90th Congress . As he presented the first of a dozen new legislative programs to Congress last week , Johnson was clearly avoiding the temptation to swing away ; he chose instead to punch out a few Texas leaguers . <P> Most ambitious of the new proposals is the $2.1 billion manpower program , under which the President hopes to forge a partnership between industry and Government to provide jobs for the hard-core unemployed . Last year 's " concentrated employment program " conducted by the Labor Department identified some 500,000 Americans-mostly Negro , Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who face serious employment handicaps . <P> Campaign Themes . Under JOBS ( for Job Opportunities in Business Sector ) , the Government will refer the unskilled to one or another of 103 companies that have shown interest in the program . The firms would provide on-the-job training , with Washington picking up the tab for all extra costs ( transportation , education , medical services ) up to an annual $3,500 per worker . The aim : to put 100,000 hard-core unemployed on the job by June 1969 , and 500,000 to work by 1971 . To coordinate the plan , the President created a 65-man " Alliance committee , " chaired by Henry Ford II , whose firm has already launched an ambitious program of recruiting from the ghetto . The new group also includes such leading businessmen as Coca-Cola President J. Paul Austin and Aircraft Manufacturer James S. McDonnell Jr . <P> <P> Even at that , the President remained cautious about JOBS prospects . " It 's better to have tried and failed than not to have tried at all , " he told reporters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an eleven-page civil rights proposal that contained more rhetoric than innovation . Asking for no new legislation , Johnson concentrated on his major civil rights bills submitted but not passed during the last session : fair juries , fair housing , enforcement powers for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , and stronger federal protection for those exercising civil rights . As important as anything in the two messages was the tone of expanded economic opportunity and sharper equal-rights legislation , which in all likelihood will be two of the President 's main campaign themes for 1968.
