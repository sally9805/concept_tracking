What do stubborn children , fortunetellers , jugglers , gypsies , practitioners of hoomanamana ( Hawaiian black magic ) , sleight-of-hand artists , common fiddlers and persons who paint their faces have in common ? Under the varying laws of the 50 states , they are all vagrants and punishable by fines of up to $1,000 and two years in jail . Almost without exception , such charges would be laughed out of court . But vagrancy laws are so vague that they apply to a great many other people too-and when they are used , or when the police even try to put them to work , they are no laughing matter . <P> Vagrancy laws got their harsh nature in harsh times . After the Black Death decimated 14th century England , such a statute was enacted to keep workers from roaming about to take higher paying jobs and to require all able-bodied men to work . The notion that everyone should work appealed to the moralistic settlers of Colonial America who so preserved the duty-to-work concept that the ancient attitude still persists-anyone who is drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be locked up . <P> Elastic Uses . Such a presumption of guilt conflicts with modern U.S. legal concepts . Yet when a person is booked for vagrancy , it is , in effect , up to him to prove his innocence , and for the drunks and down-and-outers who suffer the great majority of vagrancy arrests , this can be difficult . Since vagrancy is regarded in all states as either a petty offense or misdemeanor , defendants are usually given no chance to consult a lawyer and prepare a defense . They are summarily tried by police courts and magistrates in procedures that often last only seconds . <P> In addition to bagging bums , police use vagrancy laws as catchalls with which to hold crime suspects during investigations , to keep tabs on illicit activities , to chase undesirables out of town , and to pester criminals on whom they have been unable to pin a rap . In general , the attitude is that the laws are there to use when no other law will serve . New Orleans uses vagrancy laws to jail gamblers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let them know we have them under surveillance . " In Philadelphia a man who insisted on making love to his wife three and four times a night was jailed for vagrancy because , as a social worker explained , " the magistrate could n't think of anything else , and he could n't leave him there with that poor girl . " In Manhattan two weeks ago , Gambler Frank Costello was arrested for vagrancy while dining in a theater-district restaurant , Dinty Moore 's . Costello 's lawyer challenged the charge , and a judge quickly dismissed it after the arresting officer admitted that he had not heard anyone offer 73-year-old Costello a job and Costello refuse to take it . <P> New Trend . The ease with which Costello beat the rap shows the weakness of vagrancy laws . Yet precisely because the prosecution usually backs off so fast on such charges when the accused is prepared to fight , vagrancy laws are seldom tested in court , where they would almost certainly be ruled unconstitutional . <P>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
