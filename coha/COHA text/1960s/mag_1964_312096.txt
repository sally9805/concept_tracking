THE ECONOMY <P> In times of economic vigor , companies tend to increase their inventories , expecting even greater sales ahead and hoping to avoid possible increases in the cost of materials . The U.S. economy is certainly healthy-but the supplies on the nation 's shelves have not been building up in their usual relation to sales . In fact , the Commerce Department announced last week , business inventories in January actually declined by $160 million ( to $103 billion ) , the first monthly drop since early 1961 . What is going on ? <P> The answer lies chiefly in the improved skill of U.S. businessmen . Since financing a stockpile can cost a firm up to 20% of its sales dollar , businessmen have been working steadily at machines and methods designed to make large inventories unnecessary . Better sales projections now enable companies to anticipate their future needs more closely , and speedier deliveries from suppliers with ample plant capacity make it unnecessary to keep big stocks on hand . Automated warehouses make possible much tighter control of inventories ; computers are increasingly being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Although manufacturers expect their sales to rise at least 6% to a new record this year , they have shown no intention of panicking into a massive inventory buildup , plan to buy just enough to keep stocks at the present ratio of 1.5 times sales volume . Their restraint is important to the economy , since rapid buildups during past periods of good business have had a major hand in triggering recessions . It also means that inventories , long used as a dependable indicator , from now on will be far less valuable in charting the course of the economy .
