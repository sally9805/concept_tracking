txt " We have to preserve the integrity of the academic institution , " said the president of one of the largest universities in the United Stales . " And this is frequently going to put it in tension with the surrounding society . I 'd say that this tension is a little greater today than it has been in the past but not seriously greater . It is a concern , but not a worry . " So speaks Dr. Clark Kerr , president of the University of California . Probably nowhere are the tensions he cites more agonizingly evident than the nine campuses of his university . Key questions asked The University of California is called a hydra-headed educational megalopolis . Some observers say it contains in microcosm all the higher educational problems that now are exacerbating  --  or will exacerbate  --  col ? leges and universities all over the nation for years to come . The questions Dr. Kerr faces are a chal ? lenge throughout the country : ? Have American college students turned their collective backs on most of the values of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // By a staff cartographer Multiversity ? The nine locations of University of California campuses . *Educator explains U. S. student unrest // deeper or more extreme today than those of previous college generations ? ? Can the burgeoning demands for higher education in the United States be met responsibly , and ? if so ? how ? In a recent interview Dr. Kerr put some of these problems into perspective for Americans who the expressing a growing concern with the apparent alienation of their young people from long  --  accepted standards and mores and a disenchantment with the institutions where this alienation is being expressed . Period of rapid change ' Relaxing in the spacious , cheerful office of Chancellor Franklin Murphy after a regents meeting at the Los Angeles campus of the University of California , Dr. Kerr said : " This is a period of very rapid change in the United States . Students have always been more likely to favor change while the inclination of most taxpayers is to oppose it . " This is nothing new , but I suppose the disparity is greater today than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are greater and coming more quickly . " There is a growing gap between the intellectual elite and what might be called the power elite . The activist students reflect this feeling . " Who  --  or what  --  are the activist students ? And how many of them are there ? " There is a great danger , " says Dr. Kerr , " in generalizing about students . We simply ca n't and must not do it . They are a hetereogenous group in many ways . This is also true ideologically , even among the extreme action groups . " If you take apart one of these groups and examine its makeup , you wonder why the students are n't fighting among themselves since they represent such a wide disparity in point of view . " Generations compared Dr. Kerr continued , " There are two major differences between previous college generations  --  particularly those of the 1930 's , when there was a similar unrest  --  and the students of today . " First of all , present students are less ideological and more issue oriented than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more concerned , for example , with civil rights and peace than with communism and socialism . " Secondly , today 's students have discovered the tactic of civil disobedience , which I consider counterproductive . I think some of the activist students are coming to believe this , too . " Dr. Kerr then broke student populations down into four broad groupings that he feels need to be understood in assessing what is going on among college students today : ? Vocational  --  students who are in school primarily to get a degree that will open the door to a job they want or are there to " get married . " ( " This has always been the largest single group and still is , although it is now declining slightly relative to the other groups . " ) ; ? Collegiate  --  students whose most compelling interest is in fraternities , sororities , and athletics . ( " This group is definitely declining in size today , although it has long given a tone to every campus . " ) ; ? Academic  --  students who are interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonconformists  --  representing a relatively small portion of the student body but from whose ranks come the students who have been making the headines . Nonconformists elast  --  ified " Another problem in understanding today 's college students , " says Dr. Kerr , " is that too many people tend to lump all the nonconformists into one group , when they should be considered in three distinct groupings . First , there are the Bohemians , the longhair , bearded existentialists who have no ideological orientation . These are the nonconformists that we see . " But there is also a third group , the Peace Corps type , the type that Camus calls the ' rebel . ' These young people are reformers it ho are willing to work within the system , ideologues , the Marxists , and the Maoists and Fascists . These people we hear . " This is by far the largest of the nonconformist groups , and it is frequently allied with the other two when their causes coincide . " Where there is no future with the first two nonconformist groups , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat of real moral concern . " This third group is not nearly as visible or as noisy as the other two , but we must be very careful to avoid a sweeping condemna tion of all nonconformists simply because they are different , because in many ways , the future belongs with the third group . " Multiversity ' defined What about the structuring of the University of California to handle the growing student load ? Does Dr. Kerr regard a series of subsidiary campuses scattered about the state as the answer ? And what lessons has California learned from the " multiversity " ? " The term ' multiversity ' is sometimes misunderstood to mean multiple campuses , " says Dr. Kerr . " What I mean by multiversity is a growing multiplicity of teaching and academic opportunities that might be present on one campus or a dozen . " Harvard is the best present example of a multiversity that is no longer on the periphery of society but rather at the center of social progress . Our universities now have an involvement with the totality of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of society . " What about the multiple campus concept ? Does he recommend it for other states ? And what pitfalls lay in its path ? " It has certainly worked well for us . The process may look ungainly , but the results are impressive . I could cite all sorts of statistics : " For example , we are far ahead of any other university in the number of members of the National Academy of Sciences and of Peace Corps Volunteers , and our three new campuses at San Diego , Santa Cruz and Irvine embody some exciting new educational concepts . " Concentration on growth Dr. Kerr cautioned : " But there are , of course , some serious problems , too . For one thing , we have to concentrate so much on the growth demands that we ca n't give enough attention to developing and improving what we already have . " The recruitment and training of new people  --  especially administrators ? is a constant and time-consuming problem . " Then , of course , we 're always faced with the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public the nature and scope of these growth problems we deal with daily . " The university has been criticized for its failure to provide enough local autonomy to the chancellors of the various campuses . Does Dr. Kerr believe in decentralization , and to what degree is it practiced at the university ? " We began a program of diffusing administrative power from the central administration to the various campuses when I became president of the university in 1958 . " At that time , 80 percent of the administrators all over the state reported directly to the president 's office . Within a year and a half , that figure was completely reversed and 80 percent were reporting to the various chancellors instead . " In February of 1965 , I sent a letter to all of the chancellors asking what further decentralization they wanted . We 've met those requests almost completely . " The only move in the other direction was the action of the Board of Regents in giving me authority to step in and overrule a chancellor in any specific situation that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that this power will never have to be used .
