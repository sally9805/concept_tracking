These Are The Damned is a small , harrowing science-fiction thriller in which expatriate U.S. Director Joseph Losey ( The Servant , Eva ) puts his best film footage forward , displaying some of the razzle-dazzle camera technique that has won him a major reputation among movie buffs . Filmed in England in 1962 with a second-string cast and a familiar atomic-age theme , The Damned exudes a mesmerizing air of intangible menace . <P> Losey gets his tale off to a snappy start at Weymouth , a seedy Victorian-style beach resort where rock ' n ' roll mocks the glories of a bygone era . An affluent American tourist ( MacDonald Carey ) picks up a tart ( Shirley Anne Field ) who lures him away to be mugged by Teddy boys . At a local inn , a worldly sculptress ( smashingly played by Viveca Lindfors ) wryly suggests to her lover ( Alexander Knox ) that his real mistress is the " mysterious project " he heads at a heavily guarded clifftop installation near town .

His shrewdest touch is the band of motor cycling Teddies who swarm like gnats through the narrative , their blind , mindless violence set up as a stinging contrast to the crueler , chillingly cerebral evils yet to come . <P> During a second rendezvous , the tourist and the tart are pursued by the Teddies up to the forbidden military site and over the cliffside , where they are rescued by nine clear-eyed but strangely cold-blooded children . The youngsters ' home is an antiseptically sealed experimental station within the rocky precipice ; there Knox is nurturing a super-race enabled by mutation to survive what he sees as the inevitable nuclear holocaust . Although Losey 's ban-the-bomb arguments by now sound stale and conventional , the film 's climax fuses foolishness and fission in a poetically persuasive nightmare . Doomed lovers , terrorized children and a strutting Teddy boy all flee by land and sea , chased by Knox 's avenging whirlybirds , which swoop overhead like precision-made angels of death .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
