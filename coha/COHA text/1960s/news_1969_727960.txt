Miles of south suburban Chicago Is always looking closely for . This year he plans to spray his grass with mixtures of fungicides totaling 4,925 pounds of expensive chemicals . Or maybe your browning lawn needs more water . Each summer Mr. Miles irrigates his grass with about 31 million gallons , pumped through a 10-mile network of pipes and sprinklers . Of course , he tends a bit more turf than the average weekend gardener . Mr. Miles is superintendent of two 18-hole golf courses at Olympia Fields Country Club . He 's one of the nation 's estimated 5,500 golf course superintendents , whose jobs are part agronomy and part aggravation . Their bosses are dedicated golfers whose own lawns at home could be a tangle of dandelions but who rage if their bobbled putts can be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chance Remark Each year many superintendents have their reputations put on the line when their clubs host major tournaments . Then , a chance comment to a sports reporter by a disgruntled pro C'I would 've broke par if the greens were n't in such lousy condition " ) could give their handiwork a nationwide bad press overnight . Golf course superintendents " are expected to raise laboratory-quality grass under battlefield conditions , " says Ben .1 . Chlevin , executive director of the superintendents ' national association . This year some 11 million American golfers , nearly 50% more than five years ago , will tromp around 9,615 golf courses ( many smaller , publicly owned courses ca n't affort fulltime superintendents , which explains why there are fewer superintendents than courses ) . The golfers will chew up the turf with their spiked shoes and dig it up with their clubs . To cope with the punishment their grass must take , superintendents have become a highly specialized , professional group . Twenty years ago , when golf was n't the national craze it is now , ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no formal training . Some of them came from farms , while others drifted into the work because they had a green thumb . A Costly Crop Today , superintendents are entrusted with growing what 's probably the nation 's most expensive crop . Many plush country clubs sprawl over land worth $50,000 or more an acre , and in metropolitan areas such as Chicago their superintendents spend upwards of $100,000 a year to maintain each 18-hole course . With this kind of money at stake , golf clubs are n't hiring amateurs anymore . Many of the younger superintendents have bachelor 's ' degrees in agronomy or some related subject , and a few hold master 's degrees . Many are graduates of special turf management courses offered by a dozen universities around the country .. The new breed of superintendent works with soil tests and chemical analyqPq instead of intuition . Some are even feeding soil conditions into computers to help determine how much water and what kind of fertilizer to apply and when . Top superintendents are paid up to $23 , - 000 a year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of his colleagues , Oscar Miles Of Olympia Fields is a golf enthusiast . When he was a teen-ager he considered making golf his career but then chose superintendency because he saw " more potential for advancement " in grass-growing than on the pro circuit . Now an energetic 30-year old with a sand-colored mustache , Mr. Miles plays his two courses at least twice a week " So I can see how the course is from the golfer 's point of view . " ( He has a seven handicap . ) Thick Grass Under his watchful eye , his 36-man summer crew ( 15 are year-round men ) mow the club 's eight miles of fairway every other day at fiveeights of an inch . He keeps fairway grass growing thick so that golf balls will perch on top of the blades instead of sinking down . That 's important becauge golfers lose a degree of control of their hits if grass or clover comes between the swinging club face and the ball . Mr. Miles ' greens are trimmed early each morning at three-sixteenths of an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpets . The tees are also clipped daily , at three-eighths of an inch , and the roughs are mowed weekly at three inches . The worst enemy of Mr. Miles ' 380 acres of manicured greenery is people 's feet . He can control the damage caused by members playing 45,000 rounds a year , but tournaments are major headaches . Last August 70,000 spectators flocked on Olympia Fields ' north course for the annual four-day Western Open , and Mr. Miles knew the milling throng , many with spiked shoes on , would trample his grass to death . Replanting it all after the tournament would take time and interrupt members ' play . But Mr. Miles came up with a solution . After the first day of the tournament , he had his men spread grass seed along the crowd 's traffic patterns . " The spectators spiked the seed into the ground for me , and all I had to do was water it , " recalls Mr. Miles .. " Three weeks after the tournament you would n't know we had anybody here . " Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the-superintendents agree . It 's getting along with the club members that can be a strain . which is why some superintendents dream up occasional little extras as public reLai:ions efforts . On ladies ' day at Sunset Country Club in SL Louis , lour example . superintendent Robert V. Mitchell seta out potted geraniums at the tees and marks the cups on each green with pink poles holding pink flags trimmed in Neck lace . It helps to have a tight rein on tempers , too . One recent Fourth of July the Danville , In .. Country Club brought in some ponies for members ' children to ride . That night somebody tied one pony to the flag on a. green . When James W. Brandt , the superintendent , arrived at work the following morning he found the tethered pony bad worn a trench in the green by circling the pole all night . The bad luck award , however , seems to have been permanently retired by Fred Harris , superintendent of the 27-hole Los Coyotes Country Club near Los Angeles . In October 1964 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a few greens . Unfortunately , when the stuff had been packaged . soil sterilants somehow were mixed in with the nutrients , and every blade of grass on four greens promptly withered and died . A livid board of directors threatened to fire Mr. Harris , but he proved with soil tests it was n't his fault . After a long period of litigation involving the fertilizer company and other suppliers , the club was reimbursed for the damage . Meanwhile , it took six months to rebuild the greens . Then in December of the same year , a mammoth storage tank on a neighboring oil tank farm sprung a leak and sent about 300,000 barrels of crude oil gurgling over five Los Coyotes fairways . The oil company resodded the course , but with soil that had such a high saline content it took Mr. Harris a year to restore the fairways to normal . The worst most superintendents have to put up with is vandalism , which is increasing despite efforts to increase grounds security . Besides tearing up the sod with drag races or spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty words deeply into the close-cropped greens . " It always seems to happen just before the ladies ' tournament , " moans one superintendent . At one Los Angeles-area course , the superintendent walked out one recent morning to find a green completely stripped of sod . The police quickly nailed the culprit , a nearby homeowner who had decided his yard needed some nice grass . " It was easy to track him down , " says a friend of the course superintendent . " All they did was go down the street and look for the best lawn on the block . "
