The operation may be a complete success , the surgeon may do a superb piece of needlework with sterile sutures , yet somehow the wound may still become infected just where the stitches were placed . Lord Lister , father of antisepsis and asepsis , knew this almost a century ago , and tried soaking his sutures in phenol ( carbolic acid ) to make them active as germ killers . But the effect wore off too soon . Surprisingly , even modern-day stainless steel sutures are almost as likely to be the site of an infection a few days after an operation . <P> Last week surgeons at New York 's Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn described an antiseptic suture that seems to be just what Lister was looking for . Dr. Harry H. LeVeen and colleagues reasoned that if old-fashioned silk suture thread offers hiding places for germs , it will also have room to absorb a fair amount of antibacterial chemical . After swelling the silk to make it still more absorbent , they soaked it in a preparation of benzethonium , a modern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice , and got 100% protection against infection for at least five days , even when the animals were challenged with a massive injection of pus-forming staphylococci . <P> The surgeons are now beginning to use the sutures in human patients .
