For a long while after the gunfire has died away in the Dominican Republic , diplomats , lawyers , politicians and professors will be arguing the legality and morality of the U.S. intervention . <P> The U.S. , of course , did not invent intervention-it has been an instrument of nations ever since there have been any . The U.S. has probably used that instrument with greater restraint , and less for the purpose of territorial aggrandizement , than any other major power in human history . Yet upon no fewer than 148 occasions-the latest being in the Dominican Republic-the U.S. has " intervened " in the sense of landing armed troops on foreign shores in situations short of declared war . <P> The classic use of U.S. military intervention , has been to enforce respect for American lives and property . Thus , in 1801 , marines landed in Tripoli to free the crew of a seized U.S. ship . In 1849 , a U.S. naval force debarked in Turkey to gain the release of an imprisoned American . In 1851 , U.S. troops intervened on Johanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imprisonment of an American whaling captain . <P> A Bulwark Against Designs . But far more important than the protection of American nationals was worry that European countries might come over the Atlantic again to intervene in pursuit of old colonialist designs . This fear , in turn , gave rise to the U.S. 's enduring defensive bulwark against foreign encroachment in the Western Hemisphere : the Monroe Doctrine . <P> Contained in President James Monroe 's State of the Union message on Dec. 2 , 1823 , the doctrine declared : " The occasion has been judged proper for asserting , as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved , that the American continents , by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain , are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers . " Implicit in the Monroe Doctrine was the threat that the U.S. would oppose any such European intervention with armed force . <P> While the U.S. was occupied with the Civil War , Spain regained control of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian Archduke Maximilian as Emperor of Mexico . But in 1865 , shortly after Appomattox , the Spaniards cleared out of Santo Domingo ; a year later France , under U.S. pressure , began pulling its troops out of Mexico , leaving Maximilian to die before a Mexican firing squad . In 1903 , after Germany , Britain and Italy decreed a blockade of Venezuela to force the dictator of the day to pay claims due their citizens , President Theodore Roosevelt warned the Europeans away with a threat of intervention by the U.S. fleet .
