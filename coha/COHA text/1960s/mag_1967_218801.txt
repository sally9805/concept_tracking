Fanning out across England , a group of Mao-minded revolutionaries tries to seize control of the communication centers . When one of them invades a radio station , an obliging engineer advises that the first air time available is three weeks from Monday . Another rebel bursts into the House of Commons gallery , but his fiery oration is drowned out by a weary debate taking place on the floor . Finally , Prime Minister Harold Wilson gets wind of the revolution and goes on TV . <P> " I do n't think , " he says , " it 's going to affect me much , er , personally . It 's me and my colleagues that 've got to be left with the job of governing the country . Decisions have got to be made , perhaps unpopular , but we shall make them . The more unpopular they are , the more we shall make . At last we know where we are going and can see the end of the road . " With that , the scene shifts to a car trundling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That spoof recently made a big splash on A Series of Birds , the boldest , brashest and most controversial new show on British TV . The star , director , writer and most of the cast are John Bird , 30 , whose devastating mimicry of Wilson and other world leaders made him the terror of the telly a few years ago on That Was the Week That Was . But unlike TW3 , which confined its satire to a string of short , disconnected vignettes , Bird 's new show preys on a wide range of subjects in one continuous 25-minute sketch . <P> Violence for Peace . It is not so much what Bird says but who he is when he says it . To polish his metallic-voiced , dandruff-flecked , chipmunk-cheeked impersonation of Harold Wilson , he spends hours studying the Prime Minister 's " Brechtian performances " on TV , which he likens to " a political guerrilla fight : always backing off , always in retreat , but always seeming to attack . " <P> With a quick change of hair style , posture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a smug Queen Victoria or a lurching Foreign Secretary George Brown , sputtering : " I 'm having to solve the Viet Nam war , and you do n't see pictures of me doing that , do you ? No ! You see pictures of me doing the hokey-pokey ! " In a recent takeoff on BBC documentaries , he played a mustachioed producer , a brandy-guzzling announcer , an unemployed lathe operator-and the entire British Cabinet . In last week 's skit , Bird was a lisping Field Marshal Montgomery who passes up a " Violence for Peace " demonstration to go to Viet Nam and take lessons from a U.S. officer who trained at the " Massachusetts Institute of Guerrilla Warfare " and who wears a counterinsurgency kimono designed by Pucci . <P> Automatic Shutoff . A graduate of Cambridge , Bird sharpened his claws in The Establishment , a satirical revue , and this year played character roles in three films . Off-camera , the short , puffy satirist is a disheveled and slightly laconic chap who retreats into the ranks of the anonymous . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close friends , " except in his characters . " He lives a secluded life in suburban Chiswick with his wife Anne , the daughter of former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Grant Stockdale , reads highbrow literary criticism and , he says , sits pondering for hours over his electric typewriter that automatically shuts off whenever he hits on an idea .
