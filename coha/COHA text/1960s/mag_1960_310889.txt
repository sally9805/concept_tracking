Washington Music Critic Paul Hume 's ears went red ten years ago when he got some blue language in the mail from the White House : Harry Truman did n't like Hume 's musical judgment on Daughter Margaret 's singing . That might have taught any other critic that music and politics do n't mix . But after all , Washington is a political town . Lately , on his radio program called Guest Conductor , Critic Hume has been airing the favorite melodies of the 1960 candidates . By last week he had all four on record : <P> JACK KENNEDY , a faithful Guest Conductor listener ( whose father Joe , the family 's No.11 music buff , listens to Beethoven records by the hour ) , detailed his choice in a long letter written by Wife Jackie : Debussy 's Afternoon of a Faun , Ravel 's La Valse , Berlioz ' overture to Benvenuto Cellini , Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov , and dances from Borodin 's Prince Igor . <P> VICE PRESIDENT NIXON , who was once a fair fiddler ( he played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now prefers to relax by playing the piano , picked Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake . His true favorites , he added , are sentimental ones : the score from Oklahoma ! ( because it was the first show that he and Pat saw after moving to Washington ) and Mexican folk songs ( because they remind him of his honeymoon south of the border ) . LYNDON JOHNSON , an indiscriminate admirer of Strauss waltzes , was understandably careful to ask also for such Western folk songs as Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie , Home on the Range , and Whoopie I Oh ! <P> HENRY CABOT LODGE , whose agile baritone voice often livens U.N . parties , displayed the most catholicity of taste by selecting Mozart 's Clarinet Quintet K. 581 , Handel 's Messiah , Alexander 's Ragtime Band , St. James Infirmary , and other Dixieland tunes as played by the Dukes of Dixieland . For good measure , Mrs. Lodge added her own preference , which is a long way from Whoopie I Oh ! : Bach 's Suite No. 3 in C Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
