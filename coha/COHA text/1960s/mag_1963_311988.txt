THE BUDGET <P> In January 1962 , presenting his budget for the fiscal year that would end June 30 , 1963 , President Kennedy exercised a politician 's license for optimism in predicting a tidy little surplus of $500 million . The forecast was , of course , hitched to the prospect of a resurgent U.S. economy . But the economy did not show the strength expected , and the Government spent more than it collected . Thus , as fiscal 1963 last week came to an end and as Treasury accountants began totting up the figures , they found that instead of that original little surplus , a deficit of some $7.8 billion seems likely . But , all things being relative , it could be worse . Even the Administration , revising its own figures , last January officially predicted a deficit of $8.8 billion . Main reason for the improvement from that figure : the economy finally began to move .
