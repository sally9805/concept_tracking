A Story by MAX STEELE Drawings by Nola Langrter The Glass-brick Apartment T HEY tell me here that it sometimes helps to remember events accurately and to see them all again . I was ten the summer my Uncle Nat was taken away sick and I was not to talk about it with any of the neighbors . Four years before that summer when I came to live with my grandparents , Uncle Nat had moved out of his upstairs room to the basement where he 'd made a cool , dry apartment for himself . It was the time in the early ' thirties when everything was Modern  --  meaning , in the South , glass-brick . Uncle Nat , by saving each week , had managed during two years to replace the old sunbaked bricks with glass ones . The lot sloped from the street to the creek and the apartment had full-sized windows , the sills of which were a good two-feet above the garden path . Often he stood , very tall and bony , looking out the big plate-glass window at the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the apartment from the very beginning . Uncle Frank , her oldest son , had been killed in France ; Uncle Charles had left home when he was sixteen , and no one knew where he was ; Fred , the youngest , my father , came only at Christmas time . Uncle Nat was the only one left . Except for two years at the University , he had lived all his life in a room across from my grandmother 's . The room had a high ceiling and a ceiling fan , and one of Uncle Nat 's toy airplanes still hung from the center of the fan and circled slowlywhen the fan was turning . He and my grandmother had fought every clay for two months while he and Will Jason , a Negro who had worked for him at his florist before it was closed by the depression , were wallboarding the basement . " Living in a basement ! " my grandmother seemed to say at least once every day . " If you do n't come down with consumption , it 'll be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , we were in the front parlor and she was standing in the tall windows which reached from floor to ceiling , fussing with the dark , red velvet drapes . Uncle Nat was standing by the door with a cup of flour he had come up to borrow . " What 's worse ? " I asked , hoping for descriptions of a tropical disease so horrible I could not go to sleep . " Living at home , " Grandpa said . He loved Grandmother and Uncle Nat , but not when they were together . " Why , " I whispered to Grandpa , " is living at home worse ? " He fingered his empty pipe and glanced up through his white brows . When he winked I knew he meant : " Later , when we walk down to Five Points for the evening paper . " She had seen him wink . " Make him think of his mother . " She jerked the drapes and the brass rings jumped along the brass rod . " Make him homesick . " But Grandpa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped me . He knew I was glad that my mother was keeping books for some peach growers and that I was here for the summer . I was glad that my parents were getting separation papers and that in the fall my mother and I would have a very small apartment in a large apartment house with balconies and with a policeman at the corner . My father could n't bother us then . " Have you written your father ? " Grandmother asked . She had opened my last letter from him and knew that he did n't like living alone . She believed it when , at the end of the letter , he promised to quit drinking . She did n't know him like I did . My father had gone off to school and had married without returning . " He did n't get away soon enough , " my mother used to say . " Still he 's better off than Nat . " She never said why . To keep now from telling Grandmother that I had written him , I asked : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who told you that ? " She seemed taller when she walked under the glass beads of the chandelier to the dark mantel . I looked to Grandpa for help , but he was studying his pipe . " You see what she 's been telling him ? " Grandmother said . Here , " she " meant my mother ; at home , " she " meant my grandmother . " Why do you call her ' She ' ? " I asked . " Do n't you know her name ? " She could hear the anger in my voice . " Careful how you talk to me , " she said . " You 're getting a little too smart to suit me . " I hated her . At that moment when she turned and started out of the room , stiff and proud , I thought again how I wanted to take my BB gun and shoot at her in her stiff corsets . Grandpa and Uncle Nat were watching me and I was afraid they could see what I was thinking . Uncle Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of his large , even teeth . " How do you like living in my old room ? " I told him I liked the fan and the airplane and the army-boy adventure hooks Ieft over from when he was a little boy . " He 's still a little boy , " Grandpa said . Max Steele 's first stories in " Harper 's " came out in 1944 when the author was a private in the Army ; his Harper Prize Novel , " Debby , " was published in 1950 . Born in Greenville , South Carolina , and a graduate of the University of North Carolina , Mr. Steele has lived also in California , New Orleans , Paris , and Cuernavaca , Mexico . Uncle Nat quit smiling . He stared at my grandfather a while before he filially said : " Like father , like son . " Sometimes it was no better here than it was at home . Just when you were all set to like everybody , they did n't like each other . Uncle Nat walked out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " Forty years old and still single and still living at home . " While Grandpa played with his empty pipe , I sat on the arm of his chair . When I saw that he was not going to say anything else , I asked him my question again : " Which 'd you rather be run over by : an old Greyhound bus or a new one ? " He still had n't answered that one . I REMEMBER that later that summer Uncle Nat and I were at the foot of the garden when he asked me in a funny voice : " How did your mother treat your father ? " He was sitting on an old broken-down wicker chair and wore only a pair of khaki shorts and dirty white sneakers . His skin was as brown as the hair on his chest and legs . He 'd been clipping hedges but had stopped to sweat . All he did now that the florist was closed was to tend the garden , sometimes with Will Jason , but usually by himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek . We 'd been talking about where I lived and how many rooms and things like that when he asked me that question in a funny voice . " Sir ? " I said . I did n't know how to answer . My father was my father , and mother , my mother and nobody " treated " anybody anyway . " I do n't know . " " It 's none 62 THE GLASS-BRICK APARTMENT the woods . I watched and listened too . The late morning sun was slanting through the water oaks and , willows and lighting up the crepe myrtle and the water where it foamed white around the wet green rocks . A white butterfly was flicking under the bushes and over the water and up over the rocks . A swarm of gnats hung near the moss bank and moved , the whole cloud of them , in sudden jerks , up , then settled slowly back . " It 's all got by so fast , " he said . " A man thinks life is going to be .. . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only bee noises from the crepe myrtle , and from the woods beyond , noon noises , hot and still . He looked so much like my father I felt , for the first time , kin to him ; and I felt the same kind of shyness I felt when my father was happy-drunk . But when I tried to sit on the arm of his chair he jumped up . The chair fell over and landed on top of me . He did not try to lift it off , but stood over me , whispering through the wicker , as if I were a wild animal in a cage : " Do n't touch me ! " I lay in the grass under the wicker chair , unhurt , but wanting to cry and not to cry . I was not stunned , but I was not breathing . " Crazy ! Crazy ! All of you are crazy ! " I wanted to shout as he hurried toward his apartment under the house . That 's what my mother said to my father and to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , not loud enough for him to hear : " I do n't want to touch you . " I was embarrassed for him and for myself . Breathing again , no longer needing to cry or not to , I wanted only to get out from under the chair and across the stream and to sit in the dugout which my father and uncles had dug when they were young . My grandmother had seen it all , just as she saw everything . Already she was rapping on his window , and not seeing him , was coming down the garden path toward where I lay under the chair . As she stepped through the flower border and onto the grass , she called to me : " What did you do to him ? " " What ? " I asked , standing up with the chair between her and me . " Do n't you say ' what ' to mel " " M'am ? " I asked . " What did you put on him ? " She studied the chair as thoughshe expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could not tell her that I had merely wanted to put my hand on his shoulder , that sitting there he looked sad and like my father . I could tell her nothing . " You 're more trouble , " she said , " than all my four sons put together . " I wanted to say , " You go to hell . " But I just stood there , out of her reach , anti let her stare at me and I stared right back into her gray eyes without blinking . I pressed my lips together right to let her know how much I hated her and how much I wished she were dead . We stared without moving . Behind me I could hear the water white against the stones and could see again the white butterfly skimming the water but all the time I was staring into her gray eyes knowing 1 would not be the first to look away . The bee noises sounded at one moment far off and the next moment inside my head and the garden was so bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garden burned on my eyelids . My grandmother was a black shadow standing like a paper doll against the bright garden and I was a paper doll too , swaying backward and forward . I kept my lips pressed tight and made spit back of my teeth with the tip of my tongue . If she moved toward me , I 'd spit on her . But she did not move and I could not . After a while she was no longer black nor the garden so bright nor the bees so close in my head . But we did n't move . What if we were to die here like this ? What if we never moved ? The grass would grow tall around our legs . Then it would snow and the snow would pile up and maybe bury us . IIer face was twitching now . A muscle in her cheek was jumping . I wanted to laugh . But I thought about how much I hated her . " You wo n't break my spirit . " I had heard the words somewhere and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wo n't break my spirit you wo n't . . . " I said over ant . over till the words ran together in the glare and hot silence like pats of butter and I could both see and hear them but they had no meaning because she was staring and her eyes ran together like the pats of butter and the words and there were her eyes in the pool of butter and my mar-bles in the sand pool and the words and bee noises in my head . The garden was bright , then dark . After a long time the garden turned bright again and there was a sob in my throat . I could not swallow now . My right knee was trembling and I felt like 1 was going to sit down without wanting to . She did not move . I could n't cry now or sit down or run away . I did n't know what to do . I dried my palms against my wet shorts and remembered to press my lips together again , tight , to show her how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as much . Now I could imagine leading her down to show her the marbles in the sand pool and pressing up close to her and smelling the dusty lemon odor of her starched dress . I said it over and over : " I hate you I hate you . . . " But the words lost their meaning and left me with nothing to keep my face mean and my Iips tight and my backbone stiff . " It 's a silly game we 're playing , " I said to myself , " and I can quit anytime I want to , " I could feel a smile in my eyes and I wondered would she know it was a silly game and that we could quit . I could feel the smile on my lips . She lifted her chin and the line from the corner of her nose to the corner of her mouth deepened . It was not a smile and not a sneer , but a proud look as though she 'd won . " It 's a good thing you changed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher and picked her way through the border and up the walk . I had n't lost . I had n't looked away . I was still standing there in the same spot . She had n't won , she had n't ! I wanted to pick up a rock and throw it at her . I wanted to run across the stream and sit in the dugout . My knees were trembling and I sat down in the grass and tried to think about nothing , not even about the ant that was crawling up a blade of grass and waving its feelers against the air . I bent my head low and asked it my question : " Which 'd you rather be run over by : a new Greyhound bus or an old one ? " I N LATE August the dime store windows were full of notebooks and yellow pencils . In three weeks school would be starting and I was homesick . Uncle Nat was acting funny and hardly spoke to me at all . He would n't come into the garden if I were playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were in the house . He had , though , one day when 1 was in the dugout , come up to his room and taken the toy airplane . I did n't care but I would n't even look through his window to see if he had it hanging up in his apartment . My grandfather would walk me down to Five Points and explain that it was not my fault but to stay out of Grandmother 's way because she was worried and sleepless about Nat . The only thing 1 heard her say about it though was : " I wish we could afford Will Jason one day a week . He could get Nat interested in gardening or in something , I believe . " But Grandpa said he did n't think Mr. Robins would let Will come and add the cost to the unpaid drug bill . " I do n't know how much longer he 'll let me have pipe tobacco . " Twice I wrote to my mother to come and get me , but I did n't tell her that my grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written back that the last peaches had been shipped and that next week she would go into town and have the furniture moved and would send for me . I wrote and told her please to send now . I would n't be in the way . Please , I could help her with the furniture if she would send for me . I did n't mention what was happening to Uncle Nat and how my grandparents were worried . The next evening she telephoned long-distance and explained that it would be easier her way , that I 'd been a brave boy all summer and could n't I be brave a week or so longer ? She spoke to Grandpa and then to me again . " Yes , " I had to say , even with my grandparents listening . " Yes . I know you love me . " Then , because she kept asking , I had to say with them listening : " I love you too . " But then I could n't say " good-by " when she said " good-by . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and finally she said , " Hang up , darling . " I could hear my breath in the phone and could smell the dusty telephone smell , but I could n't say anything . " Hang up , darling , " she said . " So I can hang up too . " I knew she meant it was costing money but I could n't say " Good-hy . " I put the receiver back on the hook and went upstairs without speaking to my grandparents who were watching me and lay down on the rug in the middle of the room and studied the string dangling from the fan . T H E rest of that week I stayed away from the house as much as possible . In the mornings I worked on the dugout ; but when I started back to the house for a plank , I could see Uncle Nat standing in the garden , not with a hoe or mallet , but just standing . Then when I would come out on the creek bank he would be gone . The next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden every morning . The sky was September blue and clear all day without a cloud . One noon when I was hopping across the stream , late for lunch , I heard shouting near the house . I stepped back and waited , not hiding , but not in plain view . Uncle Nat was walking back and forth shouting up at the house : " I 'll he damned if they do ! " He ran into his apartment and slammed the door . No one was in the yard , but then I saw my grandmother 's head in the kitchen window . I turned and started bark to the dugout , but thinking that she had perhaps seen me , turned again , and jumped from stone to stone across the creek , Lunch was not ready . The green beans had burned to the bottom of the pot . The kitchen was full of smoke . In the dining-room the ice tea was poured and the ice already melted . In the kitchen my grandparents were both talking at once in sudden spurts , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the other , then both , too excited to finish anything . Sitting in the dining-room behind the swinging door , I finally understood : my father had lost his job a month ago . My mother had discovered it when she went for the furniture . He could not afford an apartment for her or for himself . My grandparents had no money to send her . The money from her summer job would feed us for a while , but would not be enough for rent . She was giving my father fifty dollars so that he could go to California where he claimed he could get a job . She would have to come here to live . Grandpa began in a loud voice : " Then she 'll have to take an upstairs room . . " I will not have her telling me . . . " " All right , then . " Grandpa 's voice dropped and was calm . " What else can we do ? " " Nathan 's got to listen to reason . " Grandmother 's voice was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked in an even , calm voice as though he were talking to a baby . " He 'll have to move back upstairs and let them have the basement . " " That 's what you wanted all along . " his voice was angry again . " Is n't it ? " I could hear him push back a chair and walk to the window . " Do n't say that 's what I want ! " Grandmother said . Suddenly her voice dropped and she said quietly , " I 'm trying to do what 's best for every-body . " " Poor Nat , " Grandpa said . " It 's all he has ... " ' Besides , " my grandmother 's anger was back , " two women can not live in the same house to-gether . This way she 'll have hers , I 'll have mine . " Again there was shouting in the yard . Uncle Nat was under the kitchen window . " 1 knew it ! I knew when I was painting this goddamn basement that Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California for God 's sake ! " Grandpa hollered out the window . " That 's right , " my grandmother said . " Tell the neighbors . " " They 're not going to have it . burn it first . " The basement door slammed shut . " If she 'll sell most of that awful , new-looking furniture , " my grandmother was saying , but I did n't listen to the rest . I drank a glass of warm tea and took two corn muffins which had already been split and buttered and went out the front door and through the side yard to the creek and across it to the dugout . I A T E that afternoon when I came back up ... i through the garden , I could see Uncle Nat standing in the exact middle of the big window . The curtains were drawn on either side of him and he stood without moving . I tried not to look at him , but I kept glancing up . If I told him it was n't my fault , that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him we 'd move out as soon as my father got a job . . . but that would n't fool him . . . it did n't even fool inc . Shoot ! He could n't even hold a job here . ? But I was trying to think of words to say in case he stepped out and blocked the path . He was staring , though , at something way above my head , off in the woods . I wanted to turn to see what he was seeing , but I kept on walking up the path and around the house without stopping . As I went to sleep that night a wind was scraping oak leaves against the window screen and across the slate roof . Once in the night T was half-awake and heard voices in the hall . Grandmother and Uncle Nat were talking and she was saying : " I 'm glad you changed your mind . " During breakfast the next morning my grandparents did not speak . In the silence I planned what I would say to Uncle Nat if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , my father , or anything about where we were going to live . I 'd simply tell him about the new steps to the dugout . If he wanted to go and look at them , he could go with me . As soon as my grandmother folded her napkin , I asked to be excused and ran clown , hoping to find him in the garden . He was still standing between the curtains , staring over my head at the same spot in the woods . He did not move . Had he beers standing there all night ? Had I dreamed the wind and the voices in the hall ? " Uncle Nat , " I said , not loud . He did not hear . " Uncle Nat , " I said with more breath , then softer . " You want to see the dugout ? " Still he did not move . I stood close to the window . His eyes were open but he was not blinking them . I tapped on the window to make him blink , to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . He did not blink . He was still staring . I rapped louder . " Uncle Nat ! " I could not see him breathing either . " He 's dead ! " I thought . I moved back from the window and screamed : " Grandpa ! " Both my grandparents came to the kitchen window , but I could not look up or away from Uncle Nat standing between the curtains staring out Ai that spot in the woods , not blinking , not breathing . " What is it ? " they were both asking but could n't tell them or look away . With my grandparents coming down the steps I was no longer afraid . I knew he was not dead . " Uncle Nat , " I tapped on the glass . " Uncle Nat . " Then , behind me , my grandfather said : " Oh , my God . " My grandmother pushed me aside . " Nat , " she called . She cupped her hands on each side of her face and peered into the window , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said firmly . She stepped back , but he was still staring at the spot in the woods . " Well , " Grandpa said . He was looking at my grandmother as though they both knew something . " This is it . " My grandmother 's face had no expression , nor did her voice when she turned back and rapped on the window . " Nat , answer me . " " We 'll have to get in , " Grandpa said . They were almost whispering but they did not sound afraid , or sad , or anything . They could have been talking about potatoes . " Have you got a key ? " " You 'll have to use the skeleton key . It 's under the scarf on my dresser . " As my grandmother spoke she did not look away from the window , but she said louder , as though she could see Grandpa rounding the path by the corner of the house : " You 'll have to go in from the upstairs door . " She turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robins to send Will . Jason . " " What if .. . " I began . " Tell him I said to , " Grandmother said , firmly , but quietly . " What if he wants to know why ? " " Tell him Nathan 's sick , " she said . " Do n't tell anybody else . " As I passed Grandpa he said : " Run , boy . Run . " And I said the words to myself all the way to the drug store . T H E next evening everything was settled . A doctor was in the hall making one last phone call . My grandparents were on the side porch trying to close the bent top of a thermos full of hot coffee . Will Jason was carrying a basket of food to the black U-Drive-It car parked in the driveway . Grandpa and Will Jason would drive all night and be at the state hospital by eight o'clock the next morning . Uncle Nat sat in the front seat staring straight ahead at the street . I stood back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nat that we did n't want his apartment . I wanted to tell him something to make him laugh . If he would smile , even a little , he could , I knew , quit staring and begin moving again . If they let me stare back at him , I could get him to smile . Or if I could think of something to tell him . But he knew all my jokes and riddles . He knew about the Greyhound bus . I even thought of poems and rhymes I knew and movies I had seen and about the new steps to the dugout . I moved around the side of the car away from the house and stood near the front window where he sat staring . I did n't try to stand on the running board because he might think I wanted to touch him again . I moved on up to the front of the car , still trying to think of something to say . He did n't seem to notice me , I eased up on the bumper and onto the front fender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to turn his head if he did n't want to be staring at me through the windshield . The street light was reflecting from the windshield but on the other side I could see his eyes still looking straight ahead . Then I said the rhyme I knew : Say , little boy ! Where 'd you get your britches ? Your mama cut the pattern out , Your papa sewed the stitches ! Uncle Nat did n't move . But Will Jason came up to my side and said : " What 're you doing up there ? " " I 'm telling him a rhyme I know . " Will Jason began lifting me off the hood . " I do n't think he 'll appreciate it , " he said . He set me on the ground . Then he watched my grandfather on the porch shaking hands with the doctor . Will Jason walked around to the driver 's side and opened the door . He leaned into the car and said : " We 'll be on our way in a minute , Mr. Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
