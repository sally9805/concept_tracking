txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 46 Letters to the Editor of The Times G.O.P. Stand on Budget Cuts To the Editor : Your June 11 editorial entitled " The Ceiling Battle " performs a remarkable feat . First it lambasts Republicans in the House of Representatives for rejecting the Johnson Administration 's request for a $29-billion rise in the national debt ceiling and then proposes , as if it were The Times 's own idea , precisely the remedy which House Republicans have been advocating since last March . " What is needed is a new sense of realism in the White House as well as in Congress , " the editorial concludes . " The Administration ought to present a revised budget and the House reconsider its attempt to cripple the Treasury . " On March 22 I , together with Representative John J. Rhodes ( Republican - Arizona ) , chairman of the House Repub. lican Policy Committee , introduced House Resolution 406 , the text of which is : " Whereas the House of Representatives must , in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fiscal year 19681 Now , therefore , be it " Resolved , That the President be respectfully requested to indicate the places and the amounts in his budget for the fiscal year 1968 where he thinks substantial reductions may be made . " Resolved , That a copy of this resolution be submitted to the President . " Public Concern Clearly the intent of the June 7 vote denying the $365-billion debt ceiling request , in which Republicans were joined by sufficient numbers of " dissident Democrats " to win by 210 to 197 , was not to cripple the Government 's fiscal operation but rather to reflect public concern over the 1968 budget estimates , which you term " clearly unrealistic . " On the following day the ranking Republican member of the House Ways and Means Committee , Representative John Byrnes , Republican of Wisconsin , proposed a temporary extension of the present $338-billion ceiling to allow the Administration time to reconsider the budget as we have urged . Surely this is responsible and realistic action by the minority party . Mr. Rhodes and I are pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Johnson to revise and resubmit his 1968 budget , which , incidentally , follows a decade  --  old precedent set by a Democratic Congress led by Speaker Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson . President Eisenhower complied and cut his own budget . We are happy to have the support of The New York Times , with or without partisan credit , for the principle of realism and candor in the Federal budget . We are not " seeking to embarrass President Johnson . " However , the House of Representatives as a coequal branch has forcefully called his attention to discrepancies in his budget estimates which are embarrassing in themselves . We want to give him another chance to close the fiscal credibility gap . GERALD R. FORD , M.C. Minority Leader Washington , June 12 , 1967 ? Doves ' on Mideast To the Editor : All of us who are not true pacifists must thereby agree that there are some situations , some causes , some people , and/ or some geography worth fighting for . Thus there is no contradiction , no illogic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or even withdrawal ) there while at the same time advocating United States support ( or even intervention op the side ) of Israel . Indeed , there are Vietnam " doves " who advocate helping the Arab states ? as the Communists do and are therefore that kind of " hawk . " The answer is that there is no such thing as a categoric , absolute " dove " except a true pacifist , and most of us are either not that morally courageous or that blind to the realities of an imperfect world . The attempt by some Vietnam " hawks , " including some in the Administration , to point public scorn at Vietnam " doves " who happen to be Mideast " hawks " is both silly and frightening . It is silly because it is based on a non sequitur . It is frightening because it is indicative that ) those " hawks " do not see that it is logically and morally still necessary for us as a free people to be able to decide for ourselves what causes we will espouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth fighting . R. W. VAN DE VELDE Princeton , N. J. , June 12 , 1967 The writer , the first U.S. military attach ? in Israel ( 1948 ) , is on the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University . ? Support for Asian War To the Editor : While the recent rallying of many Americans to the Israeli cause in the Middle East is , to say the least , laudable , I feel that the time may be right to remind some of us that we are indeed Americans . There are at this same time American men fighting and dying in the jungles of Vietnam who need our support just as badly as the gallant people of Israel . The cause in Vietnam may not be as clear-cut , nor the ethnic and religious connections of any great significance , but we as a people , like it or not , have assumed the responsibility for stopping the spread of world Communism . It 's about time that the men assigned to carry out this responsibility for us receive the same kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel . JOHN L. HARDY Albany , June 8 , 1967 ? Families of Sailors To the Editor : So much money has been raised for the aid of Israel , it is hoped that a certain amount of this will be used to help the families of the sailors who were killed and wounded in the Israeli attack on the U.S.S. Liberty . MCCLvl M. HOWLAND Belle Mead , N. J. , June 10 , 1967 Welfare Union Charges City Fails to Bargain To the Editor : A New York Tithes editorial of June 13 welcomes the passage of the Mayor 's Office of Collective Bargaining Act . We had previously been assured , in numerous Times editorials , that the city was willing to bargain , in good faith , with its employes and that the O.C.B. bill was a reflection of this good faith . In view of the above , it is tragic that The Times refused to comment , let alone rebuke , the Director of Labor Relations , Herbert Haber , for a refusal to bargain in good faith with the employes of the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public commitment following the end of the January Welfare Department strike that all unresolved issues would go to fact finding after a brief period of negotiations . In May Mr. Haber decided he made no such commitment . He now states that he agreed only to " take appropriate issues " to fact finding , a qualification he did not make in January . Curiously he finds only two of our 36 demands appropriate for fact finding . O.C.B. or no O.C.B. there can not be collective bargaining when the City of New York refuses to keep good faith and live up to its commitments . No impasse or fact-finding procedures can be of any value in settling disputes when one party is permitted to break its word when it feels it can get away with it . When the city breaks its word it is a disservice to the community for The Times to be silent , in view of its continuous comments on so-called irk ; sponsible unionism .
