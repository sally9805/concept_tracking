Censorship of the press is hardly a rarity in Latin America , but Brazil 's military-backed government seems more brazen about it than most . Instead of arresting , warning or otherwise punishing specific editors for printing articles that President Arthur da Costa e Silva finds offensive , the government is now flatly telling the nation 's press how to handle stories in advance . Preparing for Nelson Rockefeller 's scheduled visit to Brazil this week , the government ordered all editors to " collaborate in order to create a favorable climate for the stay among us of this representative of the Government of the United States of America on his trip of good will . " More specifically , the order banned any mention of " hostile acts toward the illustrious visitor in any country of Latin America or reference to the postponement or cancellation of the visit . " While Rocky is in Brazil , only positive news about the visit must be printed . Any demonstrations against him must be ignored .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
