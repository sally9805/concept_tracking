txt Mayor Lindsay announced yesterday that a large toy manufacturer had been persuaded , with the hell ) of a $739,500 loan , to stay in New York City and expand rather than move out . The loan , from the State Job Development Authority , is the 73d such loan in the city since the authority was established four years ago . The Mayor used the loan as an occasion to counter the publicity that has come with the exodus of a dozen prominent companies ' offices to the suburbs in the last year . In the most recent loss , Eastern Airlines said last weekend that it would move its reservations center to Woodbridge , N.J. Yesterday 's announcement concerned Child Guidance Toys , Inc. , of the Bronx , a manufacturer of plastic educational toys for children of preschool age . The company , according to its vice president , Milton W. Browner , has 580 employes . A city official pointed out that not only would the city not lose this substantial number of jobs , it would actually gain some new ones in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new plant next month , also in the Bronx . The authority loan is for 30 per cent of the cost ? the maximum allowed by the authority 's rules . Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States has advanced a first mortgage for 50 per cent of the cost ? $1.2-million . And the company itself must put up the rest or get it elsewhere . The city government , and specifically its Industrial Development Corporation , fit into the picture as an agent in arranging the deal . Mayor Lindsay noted that it would not have been possible without Albany 's " involvement and coop eration , " meaning the money . The authority has lent $9-million to companies in the city in the last four years , and a smaller amount to companies ' upstate . As the Mayor pointed out , the authority 's business in the city has increased substantially in the 18 months since the development corporation was set up . The Child Guidance loan is the second largest to date , exceeded only by an $810,000 loan to Russ Togs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's loan to Child Guidance is a 3 per cent second mortgage for 20 years . Equitable 's loan is at 6% per cent for the same term . Mr. Browner said that the company had contemplated leaving the city , for New Jersey or Long Island , for reasons of space to expand . This is one of several reasons most frequently cited by companies moving out . According to a press spokes. man for the City 's Development Corporation , the state-city aid to Child Guidance and the others before it has tipped the balance in favor of staying rather than leaving in virtually every case . Some measure of the city 's problem is shown in a 28-page Business Fact Book about the city that was published yesterday by the state 's Department of Commerce . Based on results of the 1964 United States Census of business , the report showed a loss of 72,000 manufacturing jobs in five years , from 999,000 in 1958  --  the last census  --  to 927 , - 000 in 1963 . Mayor Lindsay pointed out yesterday that last year was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's manufacturing employment did not decline . On the other hand , despite the much publicized departures of some offices , white-collar jobs continue to increase , and new skyscraper floor space is almost fully rented . Contrary to the concern caused by these departures , a city official said yesterday that the International Business Machines Corporation  --  one of the most publicized departures ? now employs more people and occupies more office space in the city that when it moved its headquarters up the Hudson seven years ago .
