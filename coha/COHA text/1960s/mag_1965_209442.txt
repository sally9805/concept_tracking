From the hospital bed where he lay dying last month , Henry Wallace wrote a last letter to a 16-year-old grandson in Colorado . " I like your appreciation of the mountains , " he said . " They are made for your nose and my nose , for your eyes and my eyes . There are so many new experiences in life . Life is a serious thing for some people , but it can also be joyous if lived with common sense . " <P> Henry Agard Wallace 's life was not a singularly joyous one . Nor , despite exceptional intelligence and roots planted deep in Iowa soil , had it always been governed by common sense . Yet when the former Vice President died in a Danbury , Conn. , hospital last week at 77 , consumed by a rare , wasting neuromuscular ailment known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , his ideas and ideals had long since been woven into American life , his grand illusions all but forgotten . In the 17 years since he campaigned for the presidency as a candidate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into obscurity so all-enfolding that few Americans were aware that one of the most controversial figures of their time had been suffering from an incurable disease for more than a year . <P> Strawberries for Cash . In appearance and manner , Wallace was the prototypical Midwesterner . From the rebellious shock of hair to the scuffed shoes , he looked like the perennial farm boy . Yet behind the craggy , Scotch-Irish face and diffident blue eyes lurked a bewildering blend of intellectual acumen and messianic wrongheadedness . <P> He was a brilliant plant geneticist whose hybridizations left his fellow Americans with infinitely improved strains of corn , juicier , hardier strawberries , and hens that would lay more eggs on less feed . Only last March he was in the Dominican Republic trying to introduce strawberries as a badly needed cash crop . <P> From God to Government . Midwestern farmers still shake their heads over his program to raise hog prices by killing off millions of piglets . His later proposal to export farm surpluses to needy countries earned the derisive label of " milk for Hottentots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics at a time when U.S. agriculture was widely regarded as God 's concern , not the Government 's . <P> As a passionate humanitarian and New Dealer , Wallace initiated many radical policies that have long since been accepted as routine functions of Government : distribution of surplus food to the needy , price supports for key crops , production controls , federal management of U.S. agriculture . Many of his phrases ( " the ever-normal granary , " " the century of the common man " ) entered the language , as his agricultural schemes left their imprint on the land . <P> Sonic Barriers . Largely as a result of Wallace 's advocacy , the " farm problem " of today is vastly different from the cruel paradox of the Depression , when farmers went broke amid bounteous production . Today , despite ever more plentiful crops , the efficient farmer is assured of a decent living , contributes his buying power to the economy and his output to the hungry of the world . He may be part of a " permanently subsidized peasantry , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insists , but he stands tall on his land .
