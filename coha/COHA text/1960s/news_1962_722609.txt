txt I.L.G.W.U. INQUIRY CALLED FRAME-UP Zelenko , Chairman , Accused by Union Vice President at Discrimination Hearing By STANLEY LEVEY Representative Herbert Zelenko was accused yesterday of trying to frame the International Ladies Garment Workers Union on charges of discrimination against Negroes and Puerto Ricans . The charge against the Manhattan Democrat was made by Charles S. Zimmerman , a union vice president . Mr. Zelenko is the chairman of a House subcommittee Investigating the garment industry in New York . Faced with a possible contempt citation , and at the insistence of other committee members at the hearing in Federal Court at Foley Square . Mr. Zimmerman agreed to have the remark stricken from the record . His acquiescence was given reluctantly after a series of bitter exchanges with Mr. Zelenko . Reacts to Questions The union official 's charge was a " **32;388;TOOLONG " reaction to a series of questions and remarks by Mr. Zelenko . A contributing factor was an asserted statement by Mr. Zelenko on Friday , the first day of the inquiry , that the investigation had already produced evidence of racial discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of its staff member 's testimony because of the opinions , conclusions and characterizations contained in the testimony . The testimony was in the form of a fourteen-page statement by Herbert Hill , labor secretary of the National Association for the Advancement ' of Colored People . He is being paid on a per diem basis as a special consultant to the subcommittee . Almost at soon as Mr. Hill began to read his report , which // found the union guilty of " de facto racial segregation " against Negro and Puerto Rican workers , subscommittee members started to question his role and his statement . All , including Mr. Zelenko , said they had not seen the document in advance . Mr. Hill was interrupted repeatedly and was urged to eliminate matters of opinion . He accepted the recommendation , skipping long sections of the report . At the end of Mr. Hill 's statement , Representative James Roosevelt , Democrat of California , moved that the entire statement be submitted for editing to the committee 's chief counsel . The documents , stripped of material offensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made a part of the record . Mr. Zimmerman , who is also manager of the union 's 200,000-member Dress Joint Board here , attacked Mr. Zelenko from almost his first minute on the stand . The pitch of his voice rose steadily under questioning by the chairman , and he finally burst out in anger when Mr. Zelenko suggested that the existence of an Italian dressmakers local in New York amounted to segregation . " I resent that because it 's un- true , " Mr. Zimmerman shouted . " What are you trying to do ? make a case against us ? You have already said on television that there is discrimination in our union , even before the hearing is through . Is that fair ? " Silence Ordered Mr. Zelenko ordered the witH ness to be silent , but he burst ' out again from time to time . Other committee members took pains to disassociate themselves from the chairman 's line of questioning . Mr. Zimmerman was particularly nettled by a lengthy inquiry by Mr. Zelenko into a contract clause that permits low-paid workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer . The chairman interpreted the clause , as union disregard for the welH fare . of Negro and Puerto Rican members . The union official said that whenever workers did jobs out-I side their classification they were to be paid more . If they were not , he said , the matter was subject to grievance , procedure and arbitration . mr . Zelenko stuck to his interpretation and Mr. Zimmerman erupted . " You 're making a speech , not asking a question , " he shouted at the chairman . " You do n't know what you 're talking about . You do n't give me a chance to answer , You know the answer ? I gave it to you in executive session , and still you keep harping away on it . " At this point , Representative Robert P. Griffin , Republican of Michigan , intervened . " I hate to say this , " he remarked , " but I seriously question the appropriateness of the chairman 's inquiry . There is nothing improper , illegal or . unusual about this practice . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom of it ? that 's not right . " Rails at Chairman A few minutes later , as the bickering continued , Mr. Zimmermah rose to his feet , shook his finger at the chairman and cried : " I just wo n't permit you to try to frame our union . Our union has a history of fighting discrimination . What are you trying to do ? crucify. us ? " Representative John H. Dent , Democrat of Pennsylvania , attempted to placate the witness . He said : " I for one ? and I think I speak for the entire committee ? have no interest in framing anyone . " He urged Mr. Zimmerman in his own interest to strike the remark . Mr. Zimmerman sought to make clear that the charge applied only to Mr. Zelenko and not to the committee . He said the formulation of the chairman 's questions had " excited " him and that he was ready to answer all other inquiries . The witness agreed to have the material expunged , and was then dismissed . Mr. Hill , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the interests of a small and declining number of white garment workers with high seniority in the industry . " The union , he said , has two faces . One is the " public image " ? an image " carefully nurtured for many years " of a union fighting against sweatshops , bringing stability to the . Industry , providing education and financing housing . " The other face of the union , " the statement said , " IS of a trade union controlled by a rigid bureaucracy that long ago lost contact with its ' rank and file member . "
