txt Senator John L. McClellan , chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investi- : gations , formally raised today the question of conflict of inH terest in Deputy Defense Sec- : retary Roswell L. Gilpatric 's ' role in the awarding of the TFX airplane contract . Mr. Gilpat , ric immediately answered that his participation in the controversial award of a , potential $7 billion contract for ! a new type of airplane had been ; based on " considerations of na- ! tional defense , nothing else . " The General Dynamics Cor- ' poration received the contract , on the decision of the civilian leaders of the Defense Department , although the military chiefs of the Air Force and ' Navy had recommended the Boeing Company . According to some estimates , the total cost arising from the initial order of 23 planes may rise to $8 billion or $9 billion . Mr. Gilpatric , as a member of the New York firm of Cravath , Swaine &; Moore , was a lawyer for the General Dynamics Corporation for two and a quarter years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , 1961 . Senator McClellan , Democrat of Arkansas , raised the conflict-of-interest issue in the first open session of the investigative hearings that began last February . The session brought out that Mr. Gilpatric was influential in // bringing the General Dynamics account to his law firm , that Maurice Moore , senior partner of the firm , was named to the General Dynamics board of directors one month after the TFX contract was awarded , and that the law firm was named counsel for the company at the same time . At the time when Mr. Gilpatric was serving as counsel , the relationship was as special counsel . Another firm was then the General Dynamics general counsel . Mr. Gilpatric 's wife and the wife of Defense Secretary Robert S. were among the handful of spectators . During the session , in the Senate Caucus Room , a Justice Department memorandum clearing Mr. Gilpatric of any legal or ethical conflict of interest was entered in the record after Senator Jacob K. Javits , Republican of New York , called attention to it . Senator McClellan continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the defense official closely on his relations with General Dynamics and his previous testimony in closed session regarding that relationship . Republican Senators Thomas R. Curtis of Missouri and Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota joined the Democratic subcommittee chairman in charges that Mr. Gilpatric had withheld in the past the full extent of his ties to the winning contractor . They charged the defense official with implying in a previous statement that he had served as a lawyer for Boeing as well as General Dynamics . Cites Role for Boeing Mr. Gilpatric denied that he had intended to equate his work for the two companies . He had served as a witness for Boeing in a contract-renegotiation case with the Federal Government , he pointed out . For General Dynamics , he was the member of his law firm assigned as counsel . In addition , Senator McClellan said he had gotten the impression from earlier testimony that the Deputy Secretary was saying he had served as counsellor to General Dynamics on only one matter . From documents obtained by the subcommittee staff and entered in the record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many matters . The Deputy Defense Secretary said he had not intended to give the impression that his work for General Dynamics had been limited to one matter , but that only one major task had occupied most of his time for his client . That was , he said , the acquisition by General Dynamics of the Material Service Corporation of Chicago in 1959 . In response to Senator McClellan 's questions , Mr. Gil. patric said that he had attended board meetings of General Dy. namics and that he had also given advice on matters of personnel and certain policy , questions . To emphasize his defense against conflict - of - interest charges , Mr. Gilpatric pointed out that he had received no fees directly from General Dynamics and that his share of about $110,000 in fees from the military contractor in the period during which he was assigned as counsel came to about $3,000 . This amount , he stressed , was a small part of about $300,000 that he had earned as a partner in the firm during the same period . Mr. Gilpatric , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , said his income as a member of the law firm was about $140,000 a year . As he underscored his relatively small return from his legal services for General Dynamics , Senator McClellan exclaimed with a note of exaspeuation : " Let 's do n't make this thing ridiculous . " Senator McClellan added that , during the time Mr. Gilpatric was receiving what he regarded as a relatively small return for the General Dynamics legal work , he was also receiving a snare of income from the legal work done by other partners in the firm on their cases . Mr. Gilpatric agreed , noting also that there were 120 lawyers in the firm . Senator Javits came to the Deputy Secretary 's defense at this point . He stressed that , since a question of conflict of interest was involved , it was pertinent to point out that the specific return from General Dynamics to the Pentagon official had been relatively small . Senator McClellan explained today that earlier hearings had been closed to the public because they dealt with matters of national security . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the different nature of the questioning .
