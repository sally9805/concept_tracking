THE BEGGAR by F. M. Esfandiary. 141 pages . Ivan Obolensky , Inc. $3.95 . <P> <P> For a man brought up in a diplomat 's family , Fereidoun Esfandiary is shockingly undiplomatic . His first novel ( Day of Sacrifice ) made such a telling critique of social and political conditions in modern Iran that in recent years the author has " found it inadvisable to live in Iran . " His second book is a ferocious satire that attacks a fundamental assumption of civilization : the concept of justice . Composed in remarkably stylish English , The Beggar presents in an appalling parable the ancient argument of mercy : that one man 's guilt is shared by all men inextricably , that punishment is itself a crime . The parable : <P> <P> Not many years ago , in an Arab village , a baby was born with weak legs . Little Ali might well have learned to stand on his own feet , but after he had fallen down a few times his mother 's heart ached for the poor child and she decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . Everybody suspected that the boy was not necessarily a cripple , but it was not unpleasant to have somebody dependent around , an easy butt for the sort of generosity that makes one person feel big because it makes another person seem small . So all through Ali 's childhood the good people of the village carried the little cripple everywhere he went and felt invincibly virtuous on this account . <P> Man 's Estate . When the child became a man , he was fit to be nothing but a beggar . So Ali , with the help of his neighbors , made a little platform on wheels , rolled himself down to the marketplace , and sat there miserably day after day , holding a tin cup . The villagers both pitied and feared this monstrosity of their own making , and continued to maintain his misery as a sort of public convenience . <P> The beggar nevertheless made one pathetic attempt to live like a man . He undertook , in so far as he could , to support a poor widow and her daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the widow 's bed . Unhappily , others were sometimes permitted the same pleasure . One night when two young villagers pushed his platform up the long steep hill to the widow 's isolated hut , the beggar found Ahmad the woodcutter there . <P> In rage and humiliation , Ali hid in a shed situated some 30 feet downhill from the hut , and there fell asleep . Wakened by the smell of smoke , he realized in horror that the widow 's house was on fire , and made violent attempts to drag himself up the steep slope to save her . But his body , weakened by a lifetime of socially induced inactivity , was so feeble that it took him half an hour to cover less than 30 feet . When the villagers came running up the hill , they found Ahmad and the widow dead in bed and the beggar lying in the mud a few feet from the hut .
