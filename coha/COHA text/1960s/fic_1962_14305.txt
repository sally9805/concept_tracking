An apartment hotel off Park Avenue , midday . At rise a handsome woman , JOYCE CHILTON , is silently reading a playscript , wearing glasses . As she reads , Room Service is wheeling away the luncheon table . Sitting in the room with JOYCE CHILTON is FRANK WILSON , a year or so younger or older than JOYCE CHILTON . He is a fairly well-known novelist and the author of the playscript JOYCE is reading . When Room Service has closed the door JOYCE takes off her glasses and speaks . JOYCE CHILTON As I told you on the phone , I like your play . FRANK WILSON Good . JOYCE CHILTON Well , do n't act surprised . I told you I liked it yesterday . FRANK WILSON I am surprised . Pleased is the better word . I was surprised yesterday , and I 'm pleased that you still like it today . JOYCE CHILTON ( looking at him carefully ) : Are you one of those ? FRANK WILSON One of those what ? JOYCE CHILTON Am I going to have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. p. 3 JOYCE CHILTON I 'm not so sure . Even the way you say no is n't just a plain no . I 've read all your novels and some of your short stories , and I 'm a fan of yours . But Levine tells me this is your first play . FRANK WILSON The first play that 's got as far as this . By that I mean , the first play I 've finished and allowed anyone to see . JOYCE CHILTON Well , you have one hell of a lot to learn about writing plays . In the first place , if you wrote this play for me , you 've got to give me an entrance . FRANK WILSON I do give you an entrance . Quite a good one , I thought . JOYCE CHILTON You thought . Mr. Wilson , I am Joyce Chilton . I 'm not  --  well , never mind who I 'm not . But I 'll tell you what I 'm not . I 'm not the kind of actress who is standing Up Left gazing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you have here . " As the Curtain rises , Sandra is gazing out of the window . " That , my friend , is for the birds . There are certain actresses who like to gaze out of the window , who have been gazing out of the window in every God damn play they 've been in for the past thirty-five years . For my money , they are gazing out of the window when there is no window in the set . They pose for publicity pictures and by God they 're gazing out of the window , although in at least one case that I can think of , the entire action of the play takes place in an underground air-raid shelter . I 'm thinking of one particular actress , of course . ( She looks at him suspiciously . ) Has she seen this play ? p. 4 FRANK WILSON Miss Chilton , you are the first actress to see this play . JOYCE CHILTON Yes , you 've said that before . FRANK WILSON You can ask Mort Levine . JOYCE CHILTON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know you , but I know Levine . That son of a bitch would n't dare lie to me . All right , I suppose unconsciously you wrote this play for someone else , a certain other actress . And Levine persuaded you I 'd be better for the part . FRANK WILSON That 's true . JOYCE CHILTON What ? FRANK WILSON The last part is true . I did n't write my play for any actress . I do n't believe in writing vehicles . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , have you got a lot to learn . FRANK WILSON But Mort did persuade me to let you have first look , because he thinks you 'd be ideal for Sandra . JOYCE CHILTON What do you think ? FRANK WILSON I agree with him . JOYCE CHILTON Come out and say it . You think I 'd be ideal . FRANK WILSON Yes , I do . p. 5 JOYCE CHILTON Well , do n't be so stingy with your compliments . I 'll do your play . FRANK WILSON I 'm glad to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hidden meaning . FRANK WILSON Yes , there 's a hidden meaning . Not too well hidden , I guess . JOYCE CHILTON What is it ? Say it . FRANK WILSON Well , you said you 'd do my play . But I seem to detect a mental reservation . JOYCE CHILTON Uu-huh . Well , you 're right . I 'll do it if you make certain changes . FRANK WILSON Beginning with your entrance . JOYCE CHILTON You 're damn right beginning with my entrance . When Joyce Chilton comes on , she sweeps on . One son of a bitch , a critic , of course , once said that I charge on . Okay . I do . As long as I 've been in the theatre  --  and it 's easy to find out how long that is  --  I 've always symbolized one thing more than everything else . Vitality . Now let me show you something . ( She goes to the window and gazes out . ) Now let me show you something else . ( She goes out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door , smiles at FRANK WILSON as though he were a character in a play , and sweeps toward him , then , still acting , says to the character as she abruptly halts : " Oh , Larry , I forgot , I 'm not speaking to you . " ) Which do you like better ? p. 6 FRANK WILSON You 're right . The second way is better . JOYCE CHILTON Well then , why did n't you write it that way ? FRANK WILSON Well , for one thing , Larry has left her for another woman . JOYCE CHILTON And you think the best way to show that is to have her gawking out the window . Mr. Wilson , you 've been married twice , right ? FRANK WILSON Yes . JOYCE CHILTON I looked you up in Who 's Who . I gather from certain passages in your books that there have been more than two women in your life . In other words , you 've slept with quite a few . FRANK WILSON More than two . JOYCE CHILTON And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a dull bastard like this Larry in your play  --  if he walked out on Sandra , do you really think Sandra would waste her time moping at a window ? If I were Sandra I 'd be on that telephone so fast  --  but in the first place I would n't have married Larry in the first place . If I were Sandra I might have had an affair with this Larry , but marry him , no . Now I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking about sex . That Larry was so good in the hay that Sandra married him for sex . p. 7 FRANK WILSON Yes , I make that point in the play . JOYCE CHILTON You state the point , but you do n't make it . I do n't believe it . I do n't believe it for one minute . It does n't necessarily take brains to be a swordsman . Some of the  --  well , some of the most notorious swordsmen in New York are about as stupid as they can get . But this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand Sandra she might get in the hay with him once , but I doubt if there 'd be a repeat performance . FRANK WILSON Why do you think he 's so dull ? I think he 's a pretty nice guy . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , you like him , do you ? FRANK WILSON Yes , I do . At least I ended up liking him . JOYCE CHILTON I see . Then you must have ended up disliking Sandra . FRANK WILSON Very much . JOYCE CHILTON A real bitch , huh ? FRANK WILSON Not an obvious one . Not a stereotyped character , I hope . But yes , a real bitch . JOYCE CHILTON Do you mind if I ask you a question ? FRANK WILSON Go right ahead . JOYCE CHILTON Is Sandra really your first wife ? p. 8 FRANK WILSON No . JOYCE CHILTON Really ? It was just a guess . FRANK WILSON ( after a tiny pause ) : She 's my second wife . JOYCE CHILTON Oh ! Ah ! Are you still living with her ? FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . You must have been reading an old Who 's Who . JOYCE CHILTON I see . Then you 're divorced . FRANK WILSON Been divorced for over a year . JOYCE CHILTON Well is n't that nice ? I mean , how convenient . FRANK WILSON Why so ? JOYCE CHILTON Well , they say perfectly awful things about me , of course . FRANK WILSON You do n't mind that , do you ? JOYCE CHILTON No . Because some of them are true . But some of them are n't . You probably heard that I had an affair with Sidney Renwick a year or so ago . FRANK WILSON Yes , I heard that . JOYCE CHILTON Well , I did n't . As soon as I agreed to do a play with him everybody said uh-oh , those two , Joyce Chilton and Sidney Renwick . Well , there was absolutely nothing . Sidney was having a big thing with the ingenue and I covered up for them , but everybody said I was the one . So you see some of the things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to be one of my best friends and she was so sure that Sidney and I would be sleeping together that she went off and had a quiet little affair of her own . You never heard that , did you ? p. 9 FRANK WILSON No . JOYCE CHILTON Of course not . The only one you heard about was me . I was just this minute thinking , Sidney 'd be very good for Larry . FRANK WILSON Yes , he would . He 's a good actor . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , for God 's sake . Sidney Renwick a good actor ! FRANK WILSON I 've always liked him . I thought he was excellent in  --   --  JOYCE CHILTON ( over him ) : Always liked him . Of course . I adore Sidney . But Mr. Wilson , please do n't ever let anyone that knows anything about acting hear you say that Sidney 's a good actor . FRANK WILSON He gets damn good reviews . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , I want him in your play . I think he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just Sidney . The theatre is so full of pansies or if they 're not swishing all over the place they 're that new group , that all look like window-cleaners . On my word . And Sidney looks well and dresses well . Had a bath , and shaved , and at the same time you believe he 's interested in the women in the play . But an actor  --  no . Do you know how Sidney gets by ? On his appearance , and taking direction . Sidney 's very clever that way . He knows he 's not an actor . I think he secretly hates being an actor . But he has sense enough to know that if he lets the director handle all the brain part , and does exactly what he 's told , he can rely on his appearance to get him through . And of course he 's a quick study . Directors like that , and so do playwrights . But there 's never anything creative about Sidney 's performances . Never . You can get him for a thousand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dogs last season , and I know he has nothing for next season . And Sidney and I are awfully good together . I 've been in four plays with him . I feel comfortable with Sidney . Promise me you 'll send him your play and at least let him read for you . p. 10 FRANK WILSON I 'm all for him . Do you know his phone number ? JOYCE CHILTON I have it here somewhere . And Levine always knows how to reach him . Now I 'm afraid we have to break this up . I 'm having a permanent at two-thirty . But darling , you 'll have lunch here tomorrow ? Same time ? I know we have a play here . I 'm convinced of it . He rises and by his expression it can be inferred that he is somewhat troubled . CURTAIN p. 11 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO The next afternoon , a small restaurant , now deserted except for SIDNEY RENWICK sitting alone in the **31;1824;TOOLONG lull . He is an attractive , well-dressed man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RENWICK rises . A waiter follows WILSON . SIDNEY RENWICK Mr. Frank Wilson ? FRANK WILSON Yes , Mr. Renwick . SIDNEY RENWICK Sidney Renwick . FRANK WILSON Oh , I knew that , of course . SIDNEY RENWICK I 'm having coffee . Will you have a drink ? FRANK WILSON I do n't think so , thanks . Coffee for me . The hovering waiter nods and goes . SIDNEY RENWICK Well , sir , I read your play , Mr. Wilson . FRANK WILSON So soon ? SIDNEY RENWICK So soon ? The messenger brought it to my apartment last night and I almost telephoned you at three o'clock this morning . I 've only read one of your novels , the first one , I guess , and I liked it very much . But why have n't you been writing plays ? Mr. Wilson , this is a play . The waiter serves the coffee . p. 12 FRANK WILSON Thank you . SIDNEY RENWICK Holy smokes , man , you should have been writing plays for ever . What are you smiling at ? FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Holy smokes " . I do n't think I 've heard anyone say it since he died . SIDNEY RENWICK You must be about my age . Thirty-eight ? FRANK WILSON No , I 'm forty-one . SIDNEY RENWICK Three years . You 're the only man I can think of that 's caught our generation . Were you in the army ? FRANK WILSON Yes . SIDNEY RENWICK So was I. Special Services . Training films and stuff like that . I ended up a PFC . Were you an officer ? FRANK WILSON Yes . First Lieutenant . I was doing about the same thing you were , but writing them instead of acting them . Why ? SIDNEY RENWICK Well , I was just trying to find out how you happen to have caught the disillusionment and so forth . In your play , Larry 's really very typical of our generation . FRANK WILSON Yes , I think he is . SIDNEY RENWICK Sense of values and so forth . A fundamentally decent fellow , but having a very hard time adjusting . Have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RENWICK Neither have I. ( He laughs . ) I do n't like to play to small audiences . FRANK WILSON Very good . SIDNEY RENWICK Well , let 's talk about Larry . FRANK WILSON All right . SIDNEY RENWICK It 's quite a fat part , of course . An actor 's dream . I guess I 'm onstage eighty per cent of the time . FRANK WILSON Just about , I guess . SIDNEY RENWICK Luckily I 'm a quick study . You know what that means ? FRANK WILSON It means that you learn your lines quickly . SIDNEY RENWICK It means something else , too . I was referring to the fact that when you have an actor that 's a quick study , it gives you more time to polish , polish , polish . You do n't have to worry about his learning new lines . FRANK WILSON I suppose not . SIDNEY RENWICK Absolutely not . That way , the author can bring in a new scene and you 're in business right away , instead of having to cope with actors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's true . p. 14 SIDNEY RENWICK For instance , I could be up in this part by Saturday , but maybe when you saw a run-through you 'd want to do a lot of rewriting . It 's always that way . Then the way the theatre operates today , the creative director has come to be at least one of the most important factors . Who have you got to direct this ? FRANK WILSON We have n't got anybody yet . Signed . SIDNEY RENWICK Oh , you have n't ? Well , you know who the only man that can direct this play is . FRANK WILSON Joe Rasmussen . That 's who we  --   --  SIDNEY RENWICK Joe Rasmussen ? Oh , no . Oh , Mr. Wilson . Do you know him ? I mean , is he a personal friend of yours ? FRANK WILSON No , I 've never met him , but he directed one of my favourite plays . SIDNEY RENWICK What play was that ? The Valid Resentment ? FRANK WILSON Yes . SIDNEY RENWICK Mr. Wilson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You talk to Axel Schmidt , who only wrote the play . Get him to tell you about Mr. Joe Rasmussen . Do you remember that scene in The Valid Resentment , it 's in the second act , where What 's Her Name plays the whole scene in a bra and panties ? p. 15 FRANK WILSON Sure . SIDNEY RENWICK You know whose idea that was ? Joe Rasmussen 's . The soldier is supposed to carry that scene . It 's the big scene in the whole play , where Axel Schmidt is really eloquent about war . Pure poetry , it was . Strindbergian it was . Better than Berthold Brecht . And how does Mr. Joe Rasmussen handle it ? He has this broad with a pair of jugs you could hang your hat on squirming around like What 's Her Name in Tobacco Road . That 's the Rasmussen touch . Oh , boy . FRANK WILSON That was explained to me . SIDNEY RENWICK How ? How could anybody explain it ? I can explain it.Rasmussen was laying the dame , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , but there was another explanation aside from that . SIDNEY RENWICK I 'd like to hear it . I 'd really like to hear it . FRANK WILSON Well , the way it was explained to me , during the soldier 's speech , the girl is supposed to be so deeply moved by what the soldier is saying that she reacts sexually . SIDNEY RENWICK You 're not kidding . FRANK WILSON Because she 's an earthy , primitive woman , and sex is one of the few things that can stir her , or at least is one of the basic forms of expression she has . She does n't comprehend what the soldier is saying , but she feels it , senses it . p. 16 SIDNEY RENWICK Yeah . Yeah . And meanwhile , who the hell is paying any attention to what the soldier is saying ? FRANK WILSON I did . SIDNEY RENWICK You did ? You were n't distracted ? FRANK WILSON I was distracted , yes . But I really think the girl added something to the scene . SIDNEY RENWICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to know her when I was in radio . She played a 12-year-old girl paralysed with polio , and that took acting . Not on her part . On mine . I was playing Dr. McDowell , the earnest young general practitioner , and there 'd be Shirley in a sweater , standing beside me at the mike . Supposed to be twelve years old , and permanently crippled . And every day when we were signing off Shirley would give three big bumps , N  --  B  --  C. Bump . That 's where Joe Rasmussen first knew her , but boy he had to get in line . I have nothing against Shirley . Hell , she was a very useful and obliging girl . But she did n't belong in The Valid Resentment . I understand you 've got Joyce Chilton signed . FRANK WILSON Not signed , but the contracts are being worked out . SIDNEY RENWICK What does she say about Rasmussen ? FRANK WILSON She likes him . Admires him . p. 17 SIDNEY RENWICK She does ? FRANK WILSON Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , you 'll hear it . She 'll sign if we get Rasmussen . SIDNEY RENWICK Oh , then you 're committed to Rasmussen ? I did n't realize it had gone that far . FRANK WILSON Well , he 's being very tough about percentages . He wants twenty per cent . SIDNEY RENWICK They all do , ever since Kazan got it from Street-car . How far apart are you ? FRANK WILSON Ten per cent . Stanley Stanton has offered him ten , and he wants twenty . SIDNEY RENWICK Well , that 's none of my business , thank God . He may be worth it , if you want him that much and if Chilton wants him that much , and if you want Chilton that much . ( He is noticeably subdued . ) I was just wondering , what 's with Joyce Chilton and Joe Rasmussen . FRANK WILSON I have no idea . But we want you . Stanton wants you , and Miss Chilton wants you , and so do I. SIDNEY RENWICK ( brightening a little ) : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Wilson , whoever plays Larry , whether it 's me or whoever it is , you 've got to protect that character . I mean the character of Larry . There 's a big demand for leading men these days , and you 're not going to get anybody good to play Larry if Joyce Chilton and Joe Rasmussen start butchering that part . I can work with Joe Rasmussen . I 've known him for years . As I said , I used to know him back in radio when he was trying to be a writer , and boy did that stuff stink . We used to send him out for coffee , for God 's sake . He was one of the writers on the show , but they took him off the writing and made him a sort of assistant director , and his job was to get us coffee . Oh , I know Joe . But just you remember what I 'm telling you . Watch him . And watch Joyce Chilton . And watch the two of them . I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce Chilton is not going to like your opening scene . Where you have Sandra staring out the window ? Oh , no . Not Joyce . You 're going to have to throw that out and build up Joyce 's entrance . p. 18 FRANK WILSON ( beginning to learn guile ) : Oh , do you think so ? SIDNEY RENWICK I would like to make you a small bet . FRANK WILSON Hmm . CURTAIN p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE The same restaurant , the next day at about the same time in the afternoon . FRANK WILSON is sitting alone . A badly dressed little man about WILSON 'S age enters . He is wearing a cheap suit , no vest , black four-in-hand tie , loafers . His trouser cuffs almost cover the loafers . He enters slowly , and speaks to FRANK ( he is , of course , JOE RASMUSSEN ) . JOE RASMUSSEN ( pointing his finger ) Are you Wilson ? FRANK WILSON That 's right . Are you Joe Rasmussen ? JOE RASMUSSEN ( over him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and a big piece of Danish with about a quarter a pound of butter . Cream and sugar with the tea . Where you from , Wilson ? FRANK WILSON Indianapolis , Indiana . Why ? JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah . Is that what it 's like in Indiana ? Those people in your books ? What a cultural Sahara that is . If your picture is valid , that is . And I guess it is . I guess so . You convinced me it 's a valid picture . What crap . What a way to live . A cultural vacuum . James Whitcomb Riley . Booth Tarkington . Meredith Nicholson . George Ade . ( He shakes his head. ) p. 20 FRANK WILSON Theodore Dreiser . JOE RASMUSSEN Do n't give me Dreiser . FRANK WILSON Ring Lardner . JOE RASMUSSEN They did n't write in Indiana . FRANK WILSON Where are you from ? JOE RASMUSSEN What does it matter where I 'm from ? FRANK WILSON Well , it seemed to matter to you where I was from . Forget it . JOE RASMUSSEN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Rochelle , New York . FRANK WILSON And you went to Harvard . JOE RASMUSSEN How do you know that ? FRANK WILSON It 's in all your publicity . You do n't mention New Rochelle , but you always do Harvard . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , I 'm thinking of dropping Harvard . FRANK WILSON Have a seat . JOE RASMUSSEN I 'm restless I do n't want to sit down I just walked all the way down from the Hayden Planetarium . The God damn thing was closed . All the way from 81st Street and Central Park West . ( He sits down. ) p. 21 FRANK WILSON Closed ? Why was it closed ? JOE RASMUSSEN I do n't know . Oh , they 're painting or some God damn thing . They would n't let me in . FRANK WILSON They ought to know better than that . JOE looks at him , puzzled , unused to sarcasm . JOE RASMUSSEN What 's the matter , do n't you like me , Wilson ? FRANK WILSON Not so far . JOE RASMUSSEN Stick around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , not facing FRANK WILSON . He sprawls , with his legs spread out . JOE RASMUSSEN You know , there is something very immoral about a joint like this when there are no people in it . I get a feeling of  --  I can almost smell the seductions that were started here two hours ago . Like over there at that table , probably some advertising jerk making a fast pitch at some model . Nothing in it for either one of them . No love , no honest lust . But just because he 's an advertising jerk he has to seduce a model , and because she 's a model she has to expect it of him . Over there , some fairy trying to make a date with some handsome Italian waiter . I do n't like this joint . But I do n't like any joints . People ought to stop eating in public . You got too God damn many scenes with people eating ! p. 22 FRANK WILSON Only two . The breakfast scene and the scene in the diner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people eating . That 's too many . I 'm through with directing scenes where people are eating or drinking . Everybody in the audience knows it is n't whisky . They 're all wondering , is it ginger ale or is it cold tea ? Illusion , gone . I had one actor though . I fell in love with him for one reason . He was supposed to feel faint and drink a glass of water . Well , the play had a long run and I guess we were in our fortieth week and I discovered this guy , instead of drinking water , he was drinking vodka . Any time I got a part for him , he 's got it . Because you know what he did ? He drank that vodka the way a fainting man would drink water . Not fast , the way they do in the movies and plays . But a little bit at a time . And it was his idea , it was n't mine . I said to him , " Harry , you beautiful lush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear you used to be quite a boozer , Wilson . FRANK WILSON Is that what you heard ? JOE RASMUSSEN That 's what I heard . I heard that 's why your wife left you . FRANK WILSON Wrong . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , put me straight then . FRANK WILSON Why the hell should I ? It 's none of your God damn business . p. 23 JOE RASMUSSEN Everything I express the slightest interest in is my business . I make it my business . If she did n't leave you for booze , why did she leave you ? I want to know why this Sandra dame in your play is such a bitch . Larry leaves her , in the play , but I understand your wife left you . All right . I 'll get it out of you some time . FRANK WILSON I do n't think so . JOE RASMUSSEN You want me to direct your play , do n't you ? FRANK WILSON ( with dignity ) I want you to direct my play . JOE RASMUSSEN ( imitating him ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reading . Pomposity will get you nowhere , Wilson . A former drunken newspaper reporter from Hicksville U.S.A. is no good trying to be Colonel Blimp , so knock it off . I do n't mind your hostility , but do n't be a God damn phoney . You 're too good a writer for that . FRANK WILSON You 're sweet to say so . JOE RASMUSSEN That 's better . Sarcasm is okay . But do n't draw yourself up like a dowager , or a butler . You 've never been around the theatre at all , have you ? FRANK WILSON No . JOE RASMUSSEN How did you happen to write a play instead of using the characters in a novel ? p. 24 FRANK WILSON Because I 've always liked to go to the theatre and I always wanted to write a play . JOE RASMUSSEN Wilson , you 're all right . If you knew the crap I get when I ask that question . I 've worked with two novelists that wrote plays . One was a good play , the other stank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did it for the money . FRANK WILSON He probably did . JOE RASMUSSEN Sure he did . I know he did . But in being so frank , so candid , he was trying to pretend to me that his frankness covered a great aesthetic process . Crap ! The other novelist , he wrote the turkey . His answer was a windy thing about dimensions and depth and audible impact versus the visual . Oh , dear me . I went right to work and sabotaged that play . I did n't want that son of a bitch writing for the theatre . FRANK WILSON You deliberately sabotaged his play ? JOE RASMUSSEN Are you shocked ? Did you ever review a bad novel ? FRANK WILSON Yes . JOE RASMUSSEN You blasted it , did n't you ? FRANK WILSON I panned it . JOE RASMUSSEN Well then do n't be shocked at me , Wilson . You were doing the same thing I did , only I was doing it better . I got that son of a bitch out of the theatre and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theatre that should n't be in it . p. 25 FRANK WILSON And you 're the judge of who should be in and who should n't ? JOE RASMUSSEN Do you know of a better judge ? You do n't , because there is n't any . Wait till you see me work , kid . FRANK WILSON Kid ? JOE RASMUSSEN Kid . To me you 're a kid . In this business you 're a kid . You got lucky and wrote a good play , but in the theatre I 'm grandpa and you 're a kid . Who uh you got in mind for Larry ? FRANK WILSON I 've talked to Sidney Renwick  --   --  JOE RASMUSSEN Who told you about Sidney Renwick ? FRANK WILSON I did n't have to be told about him . I know his work . JOE RASMUSSEN Who told you about him ? Sidney Renwick ai n't an actor that comes to anybody 's mind quick . Sidney Renwick is an actor that you make a list of all the leading men . Then you go through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see Renwick 's name and you say to yourself , he might not be bad . That 's how plays end up with Sidney Renwick in them . FRANK WILSON Maybe , but not in this case . JOE RASMUSSEN You 're not gon na sit there and swear to me that you thought of Sidney Renwick unassisted. p. 26 FRANK WILSON I was assisted . JOE RASMUSSEN Who by ? FRANK WILSON Joyce Chilton . JOE RASMUSSEN Really ? She suggested Renwick ? FRANK WILSON She did . JOE RASMUSSEN Gim me a minute to think . FRANK WILSON Take as long as you like . JOE RASMUSSEN Sidney Renwick is the ideal man for the part . I know that . I thought of him as soon as I finished reading your first scene . But that ai n't why Chilton suggested him . They been in three or four plays together , but he was never the leading man . Not that Joyce is so choosy . Let me think a minute . They were in a play together about eight or ten years ago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was . FRANK WILSON When what was ? JOE RASMUSSEN It must of been then . FRANK WILSON What must have been then ? JOE RASMUSSEN That she found out she could handle Sidney . FRANK WILSON I must apologize to Miss Chilton for my thoughts . I was beginning to suspect that you were trying to figure out when they had slept together . p. 27 JOE RASMUSSEN Well , that 's when they did , I guess . But it do n't always work out that Joyce can handle a man just because she slept with him . Every four or five years she falls in love with some guy that she ca n't handle and then you got a happy woman . ( He studies FRANK , then shakes his head . ) No . FRANK WILSON No what ? JOE RASMUSSEN You 're not sleeping with Chilton , are you ? FRANK WILSON No . JOE RASMUSSEN Anyway , not yet . Do you go for her ? FRANK WILSON Sure . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , but big ? FRANK WILSON No , not big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOE RASMUSSEN That 's good . Personally , I 'm not going to go to bed with her till after we open in New York . And if you 're smart , you wo n't either . FRANK WILSON For all you know , I may have other arrangements . JOE RASMUSSEN Pomposity again . You mean you have a girl ? FRANK WILSON There again , Rasmussen , that 's none of your God damn business . JOE RASMUSSEN But you 're wrong . It is my business . If you 're going to make changes in this play , I got ta know if Joyce Chilton dictated them from a bed in the Boston Ritz . p. 28 FRANK WILSON Never fear . If I make changes that 's not how they 'll be made , or why . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , we 're all right if you stick to that . We can get a sexy girl to play the maid and you can work it out with her . But never lay the leading lady before you open in New York . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valid Resentment . She wanted me to gang up with her against Schmidt , Axel Schmidt , the author . But I crossed her . I got a little broad named Shirley Tanner . Oomp . I put her in the play and I was banging her till we opened on Broadway . That way I was protected from the leading lady and her blandishments . You think these things are unimportant , but you 'll learn . We 'll get a sexy little broad for the maid . We could get Shirley Tanner , but she ai n't a maid type , and anyway I can hear screams from Chilton the minute she saw Tanner . You know , a woman can measure thirty-eight inches bust measurement , but if she sees a woman with thirty-nine bust measurement she says it 's disgusting . I never knew it to fail . Waiter serves pastry and tea . JOE RASMUSSEN Take it back , I changed my mind . ( Hands waiter a five-dollar bill . ) I do n't want to be at a disadvantage with you , Wilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the dentist . I got a coupla teeth I got ta take care of before we go into rehearsal . That play I told you I sabotaged . On top of everything else I had a wisdom tooth that was murdering me . Maybe that 's why I sabotaged his play . Who the hell cares if we open the seventh of October ? Who the hell cares if we ever open ? p. 29 FRANK WILSON Well , I do , for one . And quite a few other people . JOE RASMUSSEN No . The last play with a big idea was called Wings Over Europe . FRANK WILSON I do n't think I ever heard of it . JOE RASMUSSEN Produced by the Guild in 1928 . It ran ninety performances . Written by Robert Nichols and Maurice Browne . FRANK WILSON How old were you in 1928 ? JOE RASMUSSEN I was six years old in 1928 . What kind of a question is that ? How old was I when Hamlet was first put on ? How old were you when The Animal Kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , I do n't know . But I can tell from this play of yours that you read The Animal Kingdom . Maybe you saw it , I do n't know , but your play is the same idea as Philip Barry 's . So do n't give me that how old was I in 1928 . FRANK WILSON Ignoring your implied accusation of plagiarism , what was Wings Over Europe all about ? JOE RASMUSSEN It was about the splitting of the atom . FRANK WILSON That far back ? JOE RASMUSSEN That far back . 1928 . See ? So do n't be so touchy when I call you kid . In this business I 'm grandpa . Wilson , how long does it take you to write a novel ? p. 30 FRANK WILSON About two years . JOE RASMUSSEN In two years I can read seven hundred plays . And I have . FRANK WILSON You 've read seven hundred plays ? JOE RASMUSSEN I 've read over three thousand plays . I read seven hundred in two years when I was at Harvard . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I do n't have to impress anybody . FRANK WILSON Nobody asked you to try . So why do you ? JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , I should have got over that a long time ago , but I did n't . Where 'd you get that necktie ? FRANK WILSON ( looking down ) This ? I think I got this at Tripler 's . JOE RASMUSSEN Finish your coffee . Tripler 's is only around the corner . I want to get one like that . FRANK WILSON ( rising ) I 'll buy you one . JOE RASMUSSEN ( touched ) You will ? CURTAIN p. 31 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR The office of STANLEY STANTON , theatrical manager . STANTON is about thirty-five , a law school graduate , publicity hound , who got into the theatre by way of clients of the big law firm in which he started out . He has had two hits and three flops , but the flops have not hurt him financially . He is a huckster-type smoothie , and his office is on Madison Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILSON enters . The time is afternoon , the day following the preceding scene . STANLEY STANTON Good afternoon , Frank . FRANK WILSON Hello , Stanley . ( Takes out a cigarette case , and STANLEY holds a lighter for him . ) Thank you . STANLEY STANTON My pleasure . Make yourself comfortable , and prepare yourself for a shock . FRANK WILSON A shock ? STANLEY STANTON Yes . ( He points to a pile of papers . ) All signed . Joyce Chilton . Sidney Renwick . And Joe Rasmussen . FRANK WILSON That 's the kind of shock I do n't mind . STANLEY STANTON No , I should n't think you would . I expected the negotiations to last over a week . But do you know who expedited the whole thing ? p. 32 FRANK WILSON No . STANLEY STANTON You did . FRANK WILSON I did ? I did n't do a damn thing . STANLEY STANTON Maybe you do n't think you did , but all three of them like your play and they all like you . Joyce said she trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Joe Rasmussen  --  what did you do there ? He 's supposed to be the stormy petrel of the American theatre . A tough baby to get along with . But do you know what he said ? You like me to quote his exact words ? FRANK WILSON Yes . STANLEY STANTON His exact words were , " I 'll marry him if he 'll have me . " Meaning you . Of course that 's the way Joe talks . Nothing homosexual about Joe , you realize that . He did n't mean anything by it that you could take exception to . It was Joe 's idea of expressing exceptional admiration . How did you do it ? FRANK WILSON I bought him a necktie . STANLEY STANTON ( laughing weakly ) : Heh heh heh . All right , if you do n't want to reveal your secret . But I wish I knew the name of your haberdasher . FRANK WILSON All I did was listen to him , and I did n't yes him . STANLEY STANTON How do you mean you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to handle Joe . I 've never worked with him before , but I 've always wanted to . With Joe staging our play , we 're in business , even if it did mean giving him a mortgage on my mother . p. 33 FRANK WILSON What did you give him ? STANLEY STANTON What he asked for . Twenty per cent , or five thousand dollars a week , whichever was greater . I 'm not going to make a nickel on this play , Frank . With me it 's a labour of love . I 'm frankly stage-struck and I admit it . FRANK WILSON Well , I 'm glad to hear it , Stanley . I 'll remember that later in case you want me to take a cut . STANLEY STANTON Heh heh heh heh . Well , what else have I got for you . We have a theatre . As soon as I signed Joe Rasmussen and the other two , I got right on the phone and I got the promise of a theatre . We open the eighth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this play to Detroit . I do n't want those wise guys going to Philly or New Haven and coming back that same night before Sardi 's closes , putting the blast on your play . I want to open in Detroit and then to Boston , and if we need any more time , maybe we run a week of rehearsals here in New York . You know how that works ? Paid audiences , previews . Lousy audiences , but we pick up a dollar . And sometimes they like it , you know . You ca n't always tell about audiences . FRANK WILSON No , I guess not . You ca n't always tell about plays , either . STANLEY STANTON Oho . Vooze avay ray-zone , Frank . Vooze avay . If you could tell about audiences and plays , I 'd settle for that any day . You can have a uranium mine . I 'll settle for that talent . See what else . This afternoon I got an appointment to confer with Mary Lee Pastor . You know her work ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage designer . STANLEY STANTON Right . She 's the biggest fag in show business , but  --   --  FRANK WILSON You mean Lesbian . STANLEY STANTON Not her . She 's so masculine . I think she 's a fag . FRANK WILSON Oh . STANLEY STANTON But she 'll steal from anybody . You want a traditional set , she 'll give it to you . You want moderne , she 'll give you moderne . She has no ideas of her own , but she has got taste . Why should n't she ? She has the same taste as the best designers in the business because she copies from them . But I 'll say this for her . She 's cheap . She wo n't go over the budget . FRANK WILSON I hope she , or maybe I mean you  --  I hope we do n't skimp on the set for the second and third acts . I 'd like to see that giving the impression of affluence . STANLEY STANTON I know , Frank . That 's the word you used . Affluence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzer has sounded and he speaks into it . ) Yeah ? What ? She 's here in the office ? Well , tell her to come in . Joyce Chilton in my reception room . JOYCE CHILTON enters , sweeps in , walks to FRANK WILSON and halts , saying : " Oh , Larry , I forgot , I 'm not speaking to you . " She smiles at WILSON , and says , in her natural voice , " Hello , darling . " p. 35 STANLEY STANTON ( on his feet ) : What 's this hello I 'm not speaking to you ? JOYCE CHILTON Private joke , darling , is n't it , Frank ? FRANK WILSON Very private . JOYCE CHILTON ( sitting down , taking a cigarette , which STANLEY lights for her ) : Thank you , darling . STANLEY STANTON My pleasure . JOYCE CHILTON What am I interrupting ? You do n't have to be polite . STANLEY STANTON I was just telling Frank , I have an appointment this afternoon to confer with Mary Lee Pastor . JOYCE CHILTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sets ? Who are you going to have her steal from this time ? STANLEY STANTON Well , since you put it that way , Donald Oenslager , probably . JOYCE CHILTON Good . She steals from him very nicely . She has more trouble stealing from Jo Mielziner , although that 's not saying she does n't try . But speaking of Mary Lee Pastor , that 's in the general area of what I dropped in about . STANLEY STANTON ( to Frank ) : You remember what I said about me not making a nickel on this show . p. 36 JOYCE CHILTON Make it on your next , darling . This man has made two fortunes from two plays that did n't cost him anything . Cheap actors . Cheap sets . That one in the girls ' reformatory , the ugliest cheapest set I ever saw . Well , get ready to shell out now , sweetie . You have a play about affluent people this time . Affluence , such a nice word . Keep it in mind , Stanley dear . Not wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought of that word , Frank . FRANK WILSON Thank you . STANLEY STANTON I wish you 'd have said wealthy . That word affluent is going to cost me plenty . All right , Joyce dear , as if I did n't know what was coming . JOYCE CHILTON Well  --  there 's a young man in Paris  --   --  STANLEY STANTON I 've heard of him . JOYCE CHILTON No you have n't . Not this one . This is another young man . This one has them all terrified , he 's so talented . He 's like that new painter that begins with a B. In fact , two B 's , as in Miss Bardot . FRANK WILSON Bernard Buffet . JOYCE CHILTON Thank you , dear ! I should know his name . I have a painting of his that I 've been offered thirty thousand for . Bernard Buffet of course . I have a thing about names . p. 37 STANLEY STANTON I never knew you had a thing about thirty thousand dollars though . JOYCE CHILTON No , I , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , this young man in Paris is having his first big show in August , and if I could be the first actress to wear two of his creations , he 's going to be such a sensation that women would actually come to the theatre just to see two of his originals . I have it all figured out , Stanley , that you could charge it off to publicity . Vogue and Harper 's Bazaar would co-operate , I know they would . I 'd give my soul to be the first to be dressed by this young man . STANLEY STANTON Would you give your body ? JOYCE CHILTON Be careful , Stanley , I have a witness . As a matter of fact , I have given my body , for a great deal less . STANLEY STANTON Then this guy , this designer , he must come pretty high . JOYCE CHILTON What a nice compliment , Stanley . Even if you did n't mean it that way . Yes , he comes high . STANLEY STANTON Like how much for one dress ? JOYCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but two thousand , three thousand , four , five , I do n't know . I have no idea . p. 38 STANLEY STANTON Honey , in the contract you signed this morning  --   --  JOYCE CHILTON I know . You agreed to let me select two evening dresses at a cost not to exceed two thousand dollars . But I want to change that . We can have an exchange of letters . You 're a lawyer , and you know how that can be done . Otherwise , what else is new ? STANLEY STANTON Get her . Is n't she wonderful ? She does n't even wait for me to say yes . JOYCE CHILTON Well you will say yes , wo n't you ? You do n't want me making my entrance in gunnysack , do you ? STANLEY STANTON Gunnysack , at one thousand dollars a copy ? JOYCE CHILTON Honey  --  if you do n't let this Paris person dress me , I can come on in gunnysack . Read the contract . You wrote it . It says , I can select two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . But it does n't say I have to spend thirty dollars . I have the right to select my costumes , and all you do is pay for them , up to two thousand dollars . STANLEY STANTON Well I 'll be a son of a bitch . JOYCE CHILTON I know , is n't it awful ? STANLEY STANTON What would you do if you were in my place , Frank ? p. 39 JOYCE CHILTON Do n't answer that question , Frank . You may want me on your side later on , so be careful what you say now . FRANK WILSON Miss Chilton is the star . She 's got to look her best . JOYCE CHILTON Ah , now that 's real gallantry . And it 's all for the good of the play , is n't it , Frank ? FRANK WILSON Of course it is . JOYCE CHILTON Of course it is . Well , I did n't mean to interrupt anything . ( She rises . ) STANLEY STANTON ( as his buzzer sounds ) : I have n't agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her I 'll see her in a minute . Mary Lee Pastor . JOYCE CHILTON Oh . Then , Frank , you 'd better come with me . I think he 's going to take it out on Mary Lee , and you do n't want to see that , do you ? She cries easily . CURTAIN p. 40 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE FRANK WILSON 'S hotel room , strictly hotel room dcor , relieved only by a portable typewriter and a few books , newspapers and magazines . FRANK is in his shirt-sleeves and slacks . The time is late afternoon of the day following the preceding scene . FRANK , with his reading glasses on the top of his head , is swinging the telephone , obviously waiting for a call to be completed . FRANK WILSON ( into telephone ) : Hello Yes . Hello , Stanley Uhhuh Stanley , I 'm going to hang up on you now We might as well get this settled at the very beginning.When you want to speak to me on the telephone , do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then keep me waiting . Make the call yourself . It only takes about thirty seconds of your valuable time , and maybe my time is valuable , too . I think it is . He gently puts the phone back in the cradle , and sighs with relief over the fact that he has declared himself . He lights a cigarette , puts his feet up on a chair and clasps his hands behind his neck . The phone rings and he looks at his wrist watch . FRANK WILSON ( sweetly ) : Hello Yes , Stanley Uh-huh I know that I know all that , Stanley Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Well , my point is this , Stanley , and it 's a very simple one . I 'm not working for you . At the very least , we 're partners in a joint enterprise . If I were working for you , as an employee , being paid a salary , I would have to hold still for this what I consider discourtesy . But I 'm not working for you , I 'm not your employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone while you get around to speaking to me Now wait a minute . I have n't finished.When I call you , my name is announced to you . I have no secretary , and even if I did have , I would never allow my secretary to say " Put Mr. Stanton on the wire . " I consider that disrespectful Oh , I know you did n't . I know that , Stanley . But the fact is , it is disrespectful . You would never let your secretary say " Put Mr. Baruch , or Governor Rockefeller , on the line . " Well , at this point in your life I am probably just as important as Mr. Baruch or Governor Rockefeller , therefore entitled to the same respect.I 'm not even going to insist that my time is as valuable to me as yours is to you . But from now on , if I answer the telephone and it 's your secretary asking me to hold the wire , I 'm going to hang up . And when the phone rings again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing what you should have done in the first place.Is that clear ? Good Good . What did you call me about ? What ? You want to know if I 'm free for lunch Friday ? You mean you have your secretary keep me on the line while you 're getting around to asking me if I 'm free for lunch ? Is that the way you always invite people to lunch ? In that case , I am not free for lunch . I 'll go to your office , if you want to talk about the play , but I 'll be damned if I 'll have lunch with you . Hangs up , and he hears a voice shouting , " Bravo , bravo ! " followed by a " Dragnet " knock on the door . He opens the door , and JOE RASMUSSEN enters . p. 41 JOE RASMUSSEN That 's the way to handle those people . Good work . FRANK WILSON You heard it all ? JOE RASMUSSEN Every word . I always listen outsida room before I knock . Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . And I 'll read your mail , too . If you do n't want me to read your mail , do n't leave it lying around where I can get at it . The best way to handle guys like Stanton , do n't be in when he phones . Always tell his secretary you 'll call him back . FRANK WILSON Yes , but I answer the phone myself , and she knows my voice . JOE RASMUSSEN Lie to her . FRANK WILSON Yes , but she always says , " Mr. Wilson ? " and I say it is , and then she says , " Hold on , please , for Mr. Stanton . " JOE RASMUSSEN Then you say to her , " I just decided I 'm not Mr. Wilson . Tell that fathead boss of yours I 'll have Mr. Wilson call him . " I wanta show you sumpn . ( Picks up the phone and gives the number " Murray Hill 8-3640 " . ) Is this the office of Mr. Stanley Stanton ? The Stanley Stanton ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rasmussen Stanton , this is your old friend Singin ' Sam , the Barbasol Man I 'm all right Where am I ? Why I 'm over here at the Racquet Club having a cocktail with Papa . Where the hell else would I be at this time of day ? Hello , there , Worthington . Hello , there , Schuyler . Good afternoon , Sir Dudley . Just saying hello to the mob , Stanley . Pardon What I called you about , Stanley . Our author , Frank Wilson , he 's headed for a nervous breakdown . So do n't cross him Oh , you did ? When did you suspect it ? ( He holds the phone so that FRANK can listen along with him . ) You do n't say Persecution complex , Stanley . That 's what I think Schizo , eh ? Yeah . Yeah Well , yeah . Always . It 's always those quiet easygoing guys Tension , yeah . That 's right No , no violence , not at this stage . That comes at a more advanced stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't give a damn after the eighth of October , but we got ta nurse him along till then Well , I thought I 'd tell you , but I see you already guessed it . All right , Stan boy . ( He hangs up . ) Well , I guess we got his ulcer started . I do n't mean that . He 's a thick-skinned , insensitive , unimaginative , complacent horsetwat . And I happen to know he is n't using a nickel of his own money to put on your play . He took a nice capital gains on his two hits and put the money in tax-exempts . He got the backing for this play at ha ' past eleven yesterday morning , as soon as he got me and Chilton signed . You know why he 's producing your play instead of a better producer ? Because your agent , Levine , knew that Stanton could get the money quicker than anybody else . Right now he 's hot . It goes like that , in waves . Some years everybody pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Other years he wo n't be able to promote five thousand dollars with John Wilkes Booth in Our American Cousin . But he 's set for life . If he quits being a producer , he goes back to being a theatrical lawyer , with a big reputation for knowing all about the theatre . He do n't know any more about the theatre than I do about raising bees . There 's money in honey , that 's all I know . And that 's as much as he knows about the theatre . Well , tomorrow we look at some actors . Gim me a drink . Gim me a Scotch and water . Tomorrow will break your heart . Tomorrow we got about ten actors reading for the part of the judge . So far the casting has been easy . You got your star , a good-looking broad that can act when she wants to . You got your leading man . He 's what one critic used to call a cigarette-case actor . He carries a long gold cigarette case in his inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with Sidney Renwick , you let him take out his cigarette case , fondle it , take out a cigarette , tap it on the case and steal a little suspense there while he takes his time lighting up . It do n't work so good in London . In London your audience can smoke in most of the theatres . But in New York everybody 's dying for a cigarette and they all watch Renwick while he puts the cigarette in his kisser , puts the case back in his pocket , then reaches in several pockets to find his lighter . I 've seen Renwick steal a little more with the lighter bit . He pats his pockets . No lighter . Then he 'll take a lighter off a coffee table and you 'd think he was lighting the candles for a church wedding . But he 's good . He 's all right . He 's a quick study , and he 's no booze problem , and he 's right for Larry . So you had no trouble casting so far . But wait till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never saw before in your life . Maybe two of them you remember from old movies , former leading men . They know we 're looking for a man to play a judge , so tomorrow you 're going to see more dignity than you 'll ever see in the United States Supreme Court . Good manners . And charm . The first man we have read , you 're going to want to say , sign him . The second man will be just as good . You 'll want to sign him . And maybe the first man is the one that eventually gets the part , but you have to let them all read . If you do n't , you 're a no-good , heartless son of a bitch . I learned my lesson the hard way . We were casting a play and we wanted a woman to play a cook . The first one that read for us , I said sign her . Some old lady come up to me and said , " You bastard , we come here with our hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read . You do n't even let us go home and dream that maybe you 'll phone in the morning . " Well , she did n't phone in the morning . She did a dive out the window of her apartment . Tomorrow you 're going to look at these old guys and wonder where they all were . Where have they been ? How have they been living ? The ingenues , and the juveniles . They 're young , they eat , they shack up with one another . But old men and old women that you know have n't been in a play in five , ten , fifteen years . Some you never saw . But they belong to Equity . Now they 're not all people that saved their money . Actors do save their money , and when I was in radio I used to work with men and women that had been stars , big stars , too . Radio was a life-saver for them . They got good money and they were working , they were seeing their friends and knifing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a wonderful time . It was radio , so all that mattered was their voices and their timing . They did n't even have to remember lines . And it did n't make any difference if they had bags under their eyes or the old wattles were hanging down over their collars . Or if they got fat , or they had to walk with a cane . Nobody saw them except the other people on the show . Of course I never saw a one of them that would n't pass up a guaranteed thirteen weeks on radio for a chance to get back on Broadway . But that 's another matter . As long as they stayed in radio they were eating and working and saving a little . But tomorrow I 'll see old actors that I never even knew in radio . I do n't know where they 've been . And only one of them is going to get a job tomorrow . p. 42 FRANK WILSON Hmm . JOE RASMUSSEN You might as well toughen up , Wilson . That 's the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You got this hardly more than a walk-on , Larry 's mother . There 'll be at least twenty women wanting that part . I 'll tell you now what 's going to happen . There 'll be one old dame , she wo n't stand with the others . She 'll keep off to one side , because she figures she 'd be lost in the crowd , and we 'll notice her . Then she 'll disappear , and you know where she 'll be ? She 'll be out front , looking for you . The author . You 'll be sitting there in the dark , watching the people onstage . Then you 'll feel a hand on your arm . " Oh , there you are , Mr. Wilson . I 've brought this copy of your latest novel I wish you 'd autograph . Will you say something just a tiny bit  --  personal ? My name is Mary Smith , but do n't just say to Mary Smith , Sincerely , Frank Wilson . I do so love this novel and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And all the time she 'll be sizing you up , trying to decide whether you 'd go for the real pitch . And that can be something , my friend . If she 's young enough , say around fifty , she 'll offer you various Oriental pleasures herself . If she 's older , she probably will say she has a niece or even a daughter that 's dying to meet you . And all she wants is a bit part in your play . It 's all she does want , too . She is n't out to blackmail you or take you for a bundle . Maybe she does n't even need the money the job pays . My advice to you , this being your first play , do n't sit alone when we 're casting . Always have somebody with you . They 'll try to get you off alone , but do n't go . p. 43 FRANK WILSON Are you married ? JOE RASMUSSEN I been married to the same girl for a year and a half . Wife Number Three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know she was my wife . Angela Kirkbride . FRANK WILSON Oh , the poet . I did n't know she was your wife . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , she do n't always remember it , but neither do I. Angie 's a good dame . She 's kind of a mutt for looks , but she 's got a hell of a shape . I do n't even have a hell of a shape . And we both got divorced to get married , so there must be something there . We have all our fights over politics . She liked Dewey . FRANK WILSON She did ? JOE RASMUSSEN Not did . Does . She says if you 're gon na be a champion of the underdog , be a champion of the underdog . And she means it . She wrote in Thomas W. Dewey the last election . FRANK WILSON Thomas E. Dewey . JOE RASMUSSEN ( gleefully ) : She did n't know that . Ah , she 's a good dame . I think I 'll call her up . ( Says " New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm wearing the tie you gave me ? FRANK WILSON Yes . It 's damn good-looking . p. 44 JOE RASMUSSEN Sincere . Is n't that what they call it ? Hello , hello Hello , Lupe ? This is Johnny . Awoo-awoo . What are you doing ? Huh ? I 'm having a drink with a guy here The Bellevue-Stratford . I know it 's in Philly . ( She says that proves I 'm in New York . ) Yes , I 'm in New York . I 'm with the author . Tell him what ? No , I ca n't tell him that . And I wo n't let you tell him . You do n't know him well enough No , he may have one stashed away in the can , but otherwise I have n't seen any . ( Have we got any women with us ? ) What are you gon na do tonight ? What the hell do you wanta wash your hair for ? Why do n't you cut it off and wear a wig A what ? How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what a merkin is . FRANK WILSON ( nodding ) : Uh-huh . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , he knows , but I do n't She says do n't tell me , make me look it up Listen , the hell with your hair . Why do n't you drive in and we 'll have dinner some place . I 'll take you to that French place over on the West Side No , you come here . I got ta be here all day tomorrow You know what you 're missing , do n't you ? What ? ( He laughs . ) You son of a bitch All right . Will you meet me ? All right . ( He hangs up . ) The hell with you , Wilson . I 'm taking the 6-12 . Son of a bitch . What a dame . ( Pointing his finger at FRANK ) : And she 's really quite ugly . FRANK watches him go , follows him to the door and listens to see if JOE is there , suddenly swings open the door and JOE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 JOE RASMUSSEN ( thinking quickly ) : Aha , I knew it . FRANK WILSON You knew what ? JOE RASMUSSEN I knew you would n't get right back to the typewriter . FRANK WILSON You were waiting to see who I telephoned . JOE RASMUSSEN How can you say that , about a  --  Who are you gon na telephone ? FRANK WILSON You 're going to miss your train . Beat it . ( He closes the door and goes to his typewriter , types one word  --  Sandra  --  and then aloud ) : Oh  --  Larry  --  but I 'm not speaking to you . ( He types it . ) CURTAIN p. 46 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX This scene takes in a conversation in which the principals are in two bedrooms that are separated by more than twenty city blocks : JOYCE 's bedroom in her apartment , and FRANK 's bedroom in the hotel . The time is some hours after the preceding scene . JOYCE is in bed , watching TV ; she turns down the volume with the remote-control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The phone in FRANK 's room is heard , ringing several times . As he wakes up a pinspot goes on him and we see that he is in pyjamas , and that the floor of his room is littered with crumpled paper , evidence of his rewriting . FRANK WILSON ( sleepily ) : Who the hell Hello ? JOYCE CHILTON Oh , I 'm sorry . You were asleep . FRANK WILSON Wha ' ? JOYCE CHILTON It 's your leading lady , but you go back to sleep . If you were asleep . I 'm not sure I 'm convinced . You 're so convincing that I a little bit suspect you . FRANK WILSON Wait till I light a cigarette . JOYCE CHILTON Now I believe you . If you were faking you 'd never think of that bit . FRANK WILSON Dear lady , I 'm not an actor . p. 47 JOYCE CHILTON Oh , but you are . All authors are actors , except that they act with words instead of making faces and putting on makeup , the way we poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were fully awake . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , now do n't be mean , Frank . Do n't be mean . You 're so good with words , and I ca n't even write a coherent letter . That 's why I telephoned you , by the way . FRANK WILSON You want me to write a coherent letter for you ? JOYCE CHILTON No . You see I was sitting here , cosy in bed , enjoying my comfort , and when I feel good like that I like to share it . Do n't be obvious . FRANK WILSON ( before she can stop him ) : Share your bed ? JOYCE CHILTON I said , do n't be obvious . I no sooner said that than I realized what you 'd say . No , honey , I 'm alone , as I often am , in spite of what you 've heard to the contrary . The only company I have is my hot-water bottle . Well ? FRANK WILSON Well , what ? JOYCE CHILTON Are n't you going to say you 're envious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially after you just warned me not to be . Anyway , exactly where is the hot-water bottle ? p. 48 JOYCE CHILTON Under my feet . FRANK WILSON Which is exactly where I do n't want to be . JOYCE CHILTON I could put it some place else . FRANK WILSON Now you 're talkin ' . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , I get it . You do n't want to be  --  FRANK WILSON Under your feet . That 's right . JOYCE CHILTON Really , you 're so mean , I 'm almost tempted not to tell you why I called you . And it was nice , too . FRANK WILSON Dear lady , you know as well as I do that nothing short of a power failure would keep you from telling me whatever it is you want to tell me . JOYCE CHILTON I suppose so . When I want to do something nice I can be very determined . A friend of mine once told me I was ruthlessly kind . Rather cute . FRANK WILSON Pretty cute . It follows in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a whim of iron , you remember ? JOYCE CHILTON I thought Mark Twain said that . FRANK WILSON No . What you thought Mark Twain said was actually said by Charles Dudley Warner . p. 49 JOYCE CHILTON What was that ? FRANK WILSON Uh  --  the report of the weather is greatly exaggerated . Everybody talks about my death , but nobody does anything about it . JOYCE CHILTON You 're con-fusing me . And I really hate to be confused . I 'm a very simple-minded girl . Gal . At my age when you call yourself a girl it 's better to pronounce it gal . Then those other bitches wo n't be able to say , " Get her . " FRANK WILSON Is that supposed to be the statement of a simple-minded gal ? You 're about as simple-minded as an IBM computer . But you 're not fooling me . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , dear . You 're making it almost impossible to tell you what I wanted to . You 're going to suspect me of something . FRANK WILSON Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't suspect me of something ? FRANK WILSON I promise you I will , then if I 'm wrong , you 're in the clear . JOYCE CHILTON Well  --  you know , I have this house in Connecticut . FRANK WILSON No , I did n't know . JOYCE CHILTON Well , I have . You do n't think this dingy little apartment is all I have to show for  --  for my years as a star . p. 50 FRANK WILSON I did kind of wonder about that . JOYCE CHILTON Well I should think you would . Surely you gave me credit for having some self-respect . FRANK WILSON Self-respect ? How does that enter into it ? JOYCE CHILTON Well , after all , I 've been married twice , and both my husbands were affluent men . Love that word . So when they wanted a divorce , or I did , I forget which  --  you surely do n't think I was going to let the bastards get away without paying . I have too much  --   --  FRANK WILSON ( with her ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Exactly . FRANK WILSON And that 's how you happen to have this house in Connecticut . JOYCE CHILTON Among other things . It 's a dear . I hate to leave it for a minute except when I have to come out and earn my living , like now . FRANK WILSON Well , we do n't go into rehearsal till August . JOYCE CHILTON I know , but I have to go to London and then of course I want to be in Paris before the fashion shows . That I have to do . So my adorable little house will be empty till I get back from Paris . Would you like to stay there ? p. 51 FRANK WILSON In your house ? What for ? JOYCE CHILTON To work on our play . You 'd be absolutely undisturbed . I have a German couple that live there all year round , perfect servants and used to the ways of people like us . The wife is a wonderful cook and the husband is good at all sorts of things . He can even shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would n't be interested . JOYCE CHILTON Said what ? FRANK WILSON That he can shoe a horse . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , you 're mad ! You 're divinely mad . You 're just like me . I adore a mad sense of humour . FRANK WILSON How much would this house cost me , including the old smithy ? JOYCE CHILTON Cost you ? I 'm not trying to rent my house . I would n't let a stranger set foot in it . I want to give it to you , for the whole of the month of July and part of August . If you wanted to pay the help , I pay my couple six hundred and the gardener gets sixty a week . But the other expenses do n't amount to much . I have an arrangement with some kind of a service , they come and clean out the swimming-pool . That 's not much . FRANK WILSON They probably find a diamond bracelet every now and then . p. 52 JOYCE CHILTON Only once , a diamond wrist watch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? FRANK WILSON Oh , I 'm just mad , I guess . JOYCE CHILTON You would n't have to join the club unless you really wanted to . If you do , I can speak to Ralph and see if he ca n't get you a summer membership . FRANK WILSON Do n't speak to Ralph . Who is Ralph ? JOYCE CHILTON My first husband , silly . He lives down the road . Ralph McAneny . FRANK WILSON Well , then go on speaking to him . We 're civilized people , I hope . But do n't say anything about my joining the club . In fact , Joyce , I think I 'll just stay here , thanking you very much for your kind offer . JOYCE CHILTON You mean you do n't want my house ? FRANK WILSON It 's nothing against you or your house , but  --   --  JOYCE CHILTON Surely it is n't the money . You write best-sellers . FRANK WILSON Sure it is . You 've heard of alimony . And is n't that the foolish question of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay it . You see the difference ? You get it , and I pay it . JOYCE CHILTON ( a lament ) : Oh , Frank , why did you get married ? p. 53 FRANK WILSON It 's what they call a good question , but a little late . JOYCE CHILTON Do both your exes get alimony ? FRANK WILSON No , only one . But she has a hell of a lot of self-respect . JOYCE CHILTON You 'd be near Joe Rasmussen . He lives only about ten miles away . He and that female Dracula . Oh , I do wish you 'd take the house , Frank . If it really is the money  --  I have to pay the servants anyway , and the other expenses . FRANK WILSON I somehow inferred that . JOYCE CHILTON I was chiselling a little , but in fairness to myself , I could rent the house for two or three thousand . FRANK WILSON In July ? JOYCE CHILTON Well , August is the best month , of course . How did you know that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JOYCE CHILTON I 'll tell you what I 'll do . Would you go halves on the servants and the upkeep ? Or let 's make it a flat sum . Can you afford to pay me a thousand for all of July and the first two weeks in August ? FRANK WILSON Let me think . I 'm paying four-fifty here . Half of four-fifty . I 'd be paying six-seventy-five here . That would be three-and-a-quarter more than I 'm paying now . p. 54 JOYCE CHILTON You 'd be paying the food bills for the servants , too . FRANK WILSON You 're very honest . I might have overlooked that . JOYCE CHILTON But in the long run even that would be cheaper than having your meals in restaurants . FRANK WILSON Oh , what the hell . All right . It 's a deal . A thousand bucks . JOYCE CHILTON I 'm so glad . You wo n't regret it , either . Now I can go away feeling that my lovely house is in safe hands . FRANK WILSON What about a lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather not . Because what I 'd really like you to do , instead of paying me rent , why do n't you just buy me a present ? FRANK WILSON Like what , for instance ? JOYCE CHILTON Oh  --  just cash . Ten one-hundred-dollar bills FRANK WILSON It 's so much simpler that way . JOYCE CHILTON I think so , do n't you ? FRANK WILSON Yes . It just occurred to me . JOYCE CHILTON What ? FRANK WILSON I 'll bet that hot-water bottle feels like a solid block of ice . p. 55 JOYCE CHILTON Why it does . How did you know ? FRANK WILSON Oh , you know me . Mad . She looks frowningly at the telephone . JOYCE CHILTON Good night . FRANK WILSON Good night . CURTAIN p. 56 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN STANTON 'S office , a few days later . STANTON is behind his desk ; sitting in the office with him are FRANK WILSON , JOE RASMUSSEN and SIDNEY RENWICK . They are killing time while waiting for the arrival of JOYCE CHILTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the Journal-American . STANLEY STANTON What are you reading , Joe ? JOE RASMUSSEN This ? This is a comic book . You want it when I 'm finished with it ? STANLEY STANTON No thanks . I do n't have any children . JOE RASMUSSEN What 's with children ? I got two , but not old enough to read . This is indigenous art . STANLEY STANTON Is that why you read them ? JOE RASMUSSEN No , but it 's why you ought to . I do n't have to worry about art . People write about me and my art , so now I do n't have to worry about it no more . The Art of Joe Rasmussen . From Belasco to Rasmussen . Do n't you ever read those articles ? STANLEY STANTON Oh , sure , I read them . JOE RASMUSSEN The stormy petrel of the American Theatre , by Nigel Tenney , in the New Statesman ? Hey , Frank ? p. 57 FRANK WILSON Uh-huh . I saw that one . JOE RASMUSSEN Look , ma , I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me in the Manchester Guardian ? FRANK WILSON It is n't the Manchester Guardian any more , Joe . JOE RASMUSSEN What is it then ? FRANK WILSON Just the Guardian , without the Manchester . They 've extended their guardianship . JOE RASMUSSEN Suits me . Everybody says I need a guardian . Where the hell is that broad ? STANLEY STANTON ( knowing he means JOYCE ) : She said she 'd be a little late JOE RASMUSSEN That figures , but I 'd like to get to the ball game , there 's a double-header today . Frank , you wanta go the ball game with me ? I got a box . FRANK WILSON You what ? JOE RASMUSSEN It ai n't my box . It belongs to Universal Airlines but I use it all the time . Press agent 's a pal of mine . STANLEY STANTON What can you do for Universal Airlines ? JOE RASMUSSEN Opening night seats for all the plays I work on . The press agent offers them to his boss , the boss offers them to the president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Gadget Corporation gives them to somebody else . Very seldom you can parlay a favour as much as that . Everybody 's happy , and I get box seats for the ball games . Wuddia say , Frank ? p. 58 FRANK WILSON Not today , Joe , thanks . JOE RASMUSSEN Whennia moving to Connecticut ? FRANK WILSON Next week . STANLEY STANTON Oh , you 're moving to Connecticut ? JOE RASMUSSEN Do n't tell him where if you do n't feel like it . I should n't of opened my big mouth . FRANK WILSON I thought I told you . I 'm renting Joyce 's house while she 's abroad . JOE RASMUSSEN Boy , could I make a bad gag out of that . STANLEY STANTON You must be renting it for ten years . JOE RASMUSSEN That 's the kind of gag I meant . I 'm glad you said it , Stanley.Thanks . STANLEY STANTON My pleasure , Joe . I hear it 's a charming estate . It 's near you , is n't it , Joe ? JOE RASMUSSEN It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be able to throw rocks at me when we start working . STANLEY STANTON Within easy motoring distance , though ? JOE RASMUSSEN Easy for Frank . I got my licence suspended for two years SIDNEY RENWICK What for , Joe ? p. 59 JOE RASMUSSEN The usual thing . SIDNEY RENWICK Reckless driving ? JOE RASMUSSEN No , I was n't driving recklessly . I was just drunk . I 'm much more careful when I 'm drunk , but try and tell them that . SIDNEY RENWICK Then do you have to depend on Angela ? JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah . And if the State of Connecticut had any idea how she drives a car they 'd gim me back my licence . Oh , here she is . All rise , gentlemen . Madame Schumann-Heink . JOYCE CHILTON I 'll hit you right over the head with this umbrella . Madame Schumann-Heink . JOE RASMUSSEN You better not come to rehearsals this late . JOYCE CHILTON Now do n't get tough with me , Joe . You can say anything you please after the twelfth of August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemanly self . Hello , Frank . Hello , Stanley . Hello , Sidney . STANLEY STANTON I only wanted we five to get together this one time before we scatter to the four winds , you might say . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , and what the hell for ? STANLEY STANTON Well , I thought it would be a good idea to have us all together  --   --  p. 60 JOYCE CHILTON While we 're all still speaking . STANLEY STANTON Oh , I do n't think this company is going to have that kind of trouble . We 're a small group , and we all respect one another 's ability . I do n't foresee any of the usual difficulties . Of course there 'll be some , there always are . But in my opinion , I 've gotten together about as talented a group of people as any manager on Broadway . We have a great star , one of the very few that has a real personal following . Our leading man , Sidney , you could n't find a better leading man than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real challenge , if you know what I mean . And last but by no means least , there is n't a manager on Broadway that would n't give his eye teeth to have Joe Rasmussen work for him . And in addition to those here  --  you notice that the ones that are here today are the ones that get billing  --  we 're also going to have people in the smaller parts that will be chosen for their excellent acting ability , and that goes for the set designer and the costume people , lighting , and so on . ( He pauses and the others are modestly silent . ) JOE RASMUSSEN ( who has been making notes on his comic book ) : You forgot some-thing , Stanley . STANLEY STANTON What was that , Joe ? p. 61 JOE RASMUSSEN Who 's gon na handle your insurance ? STANLEY STANTON I have a very good  --  Oh , you 're kidding . JOE RASMUSSEN Why should I kid ? You might as well give us the whole picture along with the rest of this crap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good play by Frank Wilson , a novelist that does n't know his arse from first base in the theatre . His play needs work , as all plays need work , and that work has to be done by Frank and me . Nobody else . If anybody has any suggestions to make to Frank or me , put them in writing and we 'll flush them down the can . If you want to see them flushed down the can , I 'll be glad to pull the chain in your presence . But you 'll all be saving a lot of time if you just drop your suggestions down the donnicker yourself . We start rehearsals on the twelfth of August . If anyone has to have their appendix out , have it done now . Or the dentist , or anything like that . If you have any money troubles , go to Stanton , but if you have any other beefs , come to me . You 'll have to , because Stanton wo n't be around while we 're rehearsing . ( This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You got anything more to say , Stanton ? STANLEY STANTON Well  --  JOE RASMUSSEN ( not giving him a chance ) : Okay . Have a nice trip , Joyce . Do n't eat too much . You , too , Sidney , wherever you 're off to . Frank , I 'll see you next week . ( Looks at his watch . ) I 'll catch some of the first game . They all look at each other in silence as the curtain descends. @x Interior , JOYCE CHILTON 'S house in Connecticut , a week later . It is a surprisingly sensible room , book-lined , unchintzy , with a large globe , dictionary stand , and a sturdy card table on which FRANK WILSON has placed his typewriter and paper . He is staring blankly at the typewriter at rise , which is simultaneous with the entrance of BRUNO , the manservant , bearing a small tray on which are a cup and saucer , coffee vacuum , cream pitcher and sugar bowl . BRUNO Chentleman . Is half past ten o'clock . FRANK WILSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table and stands waiting to be recognized ) Chentleman . FRANK WILSON What is it , Bruno ? And why do n't you call me Mr. Wilson ? BRUNO Yes sir . FRANK WILSON We 're in the country . Let 's be informal . ( He is aware that BRUNO will not understand this small frivolity . ) Is there something on your mind ? BRUNO On my mind is  --  you wish two cups for coffee ? FRANK WILSON No , one will do . Why would I want two cups ? p. 64 BRUNO I hear somebody else talking . FRANK WILSON No . BRUNO ( doggedly ) : I hear somebody . FRANK WILSON Oh , I know . I 've had that trouble before . That was me you heard . BRUNO No , it was a woman 's voice I hear . FRANK WILSON That was me . BRUNO ( with an unpleasant smile ) : No . Excuse me , was a woman . FRANK WILSON Like this ? " Darling , if you leave me this time , it 's for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled and annoyed ) : Ja . Yes sir . FRANK WILSON That was me . Do you know what dialogue is ? BRUNO No sir . FRANK WILSON ( going to bookshelf , takes down a small book ) : See if they have a word for it in German . BRUNO In German is words for everything . Long words . FRANK WILSON ( looking at dictionary ) : How right you are . Yes . Here . Zwiegesprach . Zwiegesprach , ja ? p. 65 BRUNO ( nodding ) : Ja ja . Zwiegesprach . Unterhaltung . Conwersation . FRANK WILSON I guess so . I ought to explain . I am a writer . ( BRUNO nods . ) You dig that . Well , I am writing a play . Rewriting it , actually . ( BRUNO nods . ) Which Miss Chilton is going to act in . ( BRUNO nods . ) In a play , in this play , she speaks words . ( BRUNO nods . ) And other people speak words to her . ( BRUNO nods . ) Those words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANK WILSON Now when I am writing those words  --  pay attention , now  --  when I am writing those words , I say them aloud first . Like " Darling , if you leave me this time , it 's for good . " Which incidentally is all the words I wrote since eight o'clock this morning , but that 's neither here nor there . I 'm sorry , Bruno , I 'm confusing you . The words you heard , that you thought were being spoken by a woman  --  I was speaking . I want the words to sound right , so I say them aloud . BRUNO ( dawn ) : Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh . FRANK WILSON There was no one else here . Only me . You understand the word thorough ? p. 66 BRUNO Yes sir . We Germans are wery thorough . FRANK WILSON I thought you 'd know that word . Well , I 'm thorough , too . I try out these words before putting them on paper . BRUNO Oh , yes . That 's good . That 's thorough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that 's quite true . But Americans can be thorough , too . ( BRUNO smiles sceptically , superiorly . ) I could recall several instances of it but no use reviving what might be rather unpleasant memories . BRUNO Too fast . FRANK WILSON Nothing , really . In any event , now you understand why you thought you heard a woman 's voice ? BRUNO Yes sir . Was Mr. Wilson speaking . Not a woman . FRANK WILSON Right . And it will happen again . In fact , the more you hear it , the better I 'm working . If you do n't hear it , I 'm not going very well . BRUNO ( interested in anything technical ) : When you are working , you are talking . When you are talking , you are working ? FRANK WILSON I could n't have put it better . Well yes , I could improve on that . When I am talking to myself , I am working . When I am working , I am talking to myself . p. 67 BRUNO ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming lady and gentleman for lunch ? FRANK WILSON Right . We 'll be three for lunch . BRUNO Wery good , sir . Cocktails at half past twelve ? FRANK WILSON No cocktails . Oh , clam juice , or tomato juice maybe . BRUNO ( frowning ) : But we serve lunch at one o'clock . Elsa prepares a souffl . FRANK WILSON We 'll be prompt . BRUNO Wery good , sir . FRANK WILSON Oh , Bruno . BRUNO Yes sir ? FRANK WILSON Tell me about this room . It 's the kind of room I 'd like for myself , but I 'm surprised that Miss Chilton  --   --  She did n't go to any extra trouble for me , did she ? BRUNO No sir . These furnitures and decorations , they was all new when Miss Chilton got married the second time . She bought everything for a surprise , but Mr. Robinson , he never like this room . He liked modern furnitures . He was surprised but he did n't like the surprise . FRANK WILSON Then why did n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 68 BRUNO Plenty of money , but he did n't stay long in this house . They was married two winters and one summer . Most of the time they was in New York . FRANK WILSON I see . Well , it 's a very comfortable room . BRUNO Even more comfortable in the winter , with the TV . FRANK WILSON Oh , you like it too ? BRUNO Sure . Anything else , Mr. Wilson ? FRANK WILSON That 'll be all , thanks . My guests should be here  --  oh , probably around twelve-thirty . BRUNO Is that them ? Is a station wagon in the dri'way . FRANK WILSON ( looking at his wrist watch ) : It could n't be . And yet , all things considered , it could . ( He looks out of the french window and shrugs . ) FRANK WILSON ( calling out ) : Come in this way , Joe . Joe ? JOE RASMUSSEN and his wife ANGELA KIRKBRIDE RASMUSSEN enter through the french window at Left . JOE is wearing a loud sports shirt and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , is wearing a black shirt and black toreador pants and Japanese slippers. p. 69 JOE RASMUSSEN Hello , Frank , this is Angela . If you 're gon na be formal , call her Miss Kirkbride . She do n't like to be called Mrs. Rasmussen . Frank is liable to be formal till he likes you , then he relaxes . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( to FRANK ) : Be formal then . I want to be able to tell when you start liking me , if you ever do . FRANK WILSON Good morning , Miss Kirkbride . How are you , Angie kid ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Do n't rush things . I 'd just as lief call you Mr. Wilson till I like you . ( Turning to JOE ) : And listen , you , do n't go around saying I do n't like being called Mrs. Rasmussen . I do so like it . JOE RASMUSSEN That 's not what you told me . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I changed my mind . JOE RASMUSSEN When ? Yesterday ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE This morning , on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't always read your mind . Most of the time ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Do you know something ? You never read my mind , never since I 've known you . You do n't even read my poetry . p. 70 JOE RASMUSSEN I did try . After that , reading your mind was easy . Frank , you comfortable here ? Or are you used to luxury ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE God damn novelists , best-sellers . JOE RASMUSSEN I would n't be comfortable in a place like this , but maybe you 're used to it . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Look at this place ! Are they for real , those books ? JOE RASMUSSEN Pinch them and find out . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Yeah , that 's the way you find out . That woman last night , you 're lucky her husband did n't flatten you . You 're lucky I did n't . JOE RASMUSSEN You jealous ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE No , I was n't jealous . I was just sore at you . ( To FRANK ) : He said to this crashing bore , a Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are your wife 's for real ? " Can I have some of that coffee , if nobody 's drinking it ? FRANK WILSON I 'll ring for some . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( holding her hands to her ears ) : Ooh . That line grates on me . " I 'll ring for some . " Ugh . It conjures up all those plays I used to go to with my aunt . My aunt that I was named after . Bad enough to be named after her , but when I was discovered secretly writing plays when I was ten years old , Aunt Angie used to take me to matines . Her idea of encouraging the nascent playwright , the first author in the Kirkbride family . In every single God damn one of those plays there was a character that said , " I 'll ring for some . " p. 71 JOE RASMUSSEN That 's crap , and you know it . I 've read over three thousand plays and I never saw that line . I 've seen the line , " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ring for some . " Go ahead and ring for some , Frank . FRANK WILSON ( doing so ) : If it does n't turn your wife 's stomach . JOE RASMUSSEN ( laughing ) : Show him how you can really turn your stomach . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Oh , shut up . JOE RASMUSSEN ( still laughing ) : You ca n't stop her . Hey , Frank . I found out what a merkin is . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Oh , shut up or I 'll leave you and you 'll have to take a taxi . Eight dollars . BRUNO ( at doorway , Right ) : Yes sir . FRANK WILSON Some coffee , please , Bruno . Anything else , anybody ? No . Just coffee for three . BRUNO Yes sir . ( Leaves . ) JOE RASMUSSEN What happened to him at Nuremberg ? He must of copped a plea . You hear anything from La Cheelton ? FRANK WILSON I do n't expect to . p. 72 JOE RASMUSSEN Well , get ready , because you will . She went by boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long letter any day now . Suggestions . Four or five days on a boat will give her plenty of time to put that mind to work . And that means suggestions . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I read your play twice . I have some suggestions . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to her ) : I have one for you , too . Butt out , and stay out . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( ignoring him haughtily ) : Do n't have What 's Her Name , Sandra , standing at the window . Not if you 're going to have Joyce Chilton for your leading lady . She has to breeze on . The way you have it , it 's a static beginning . ( FRANK and JOE look at each other , and JOE shakes his head negatively , to indicate that he has not spoken to ANGELA about this . ) You do n't want that , not with Joyce Chilton . I 've seen her in a dozen plays , and if you once lose that animation , she dies on you . She always has to have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort for her to come alive again . Vitality like that , you know , it 's a blessing , maybe , but it creates problems . And you have several places in your play where she has nothing to say or do , and it 's going to be up to this guy ( indicating JOE ) to goose her back into action again . p. 73 JOE RASMUSSEN She 's right , Frank . FRANK WILSON I 'm inclined to agree with her . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Well then I 'll shut up . JOE RASMUSSEN There 's no fun in it for her now . She was looking for an argument . ( ANGELA stretches out on a sofa and lights a cigarette , ignoring the men and deep in her own thoughts ) But do n't listen to anything else she tells you . Do n't listen . You do n't have to be polite to Angie . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Yeah , you found that out , a long time ago , you ill-mannered Boy Scout . He was a Boy Scout till he was sixteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scout . You want to know something about that woman over there ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE You be care  --  ful . JOE RASMUSSEN You want to know how she found out I was a Boy Scout ? On our honeymoon  --  the real one , not the out-of-town try-out  --  we went to some little town in Pennsylvania , I even forget the name of it . You know why ? FRANK WILSON No . JOE RASMUSSEN Because it was near some bird sanctuary . She did n't tell me that . She said we went there because I liked Pennsylvania Dutch cooking . " When did I ever say I liked Pennsylvania Dutch cooking ? " I asked her . " I can tell , " she said . Well , I did like it . I mean it was all right if you like everything cooked in dough . p. 74 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE You never eat anything but pastry . His favourite food is a chocolate clair . JOE RASMUSSEN ( hesitating ) : And Danish . I like Danish and once in a while a Napoleon if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a wonder he has a tooth in his mouth . JOE RASMUSSEN ( back to FRANK ) : You see what she 's trying to do , Frank ? Trying to divert me from the story of our honeymoon . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Your story of our honeymoon . JOE RASMUSSEN Sure my story . There was nothing new about the rest of it except that we were married . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE That was news in itself . The first time I went out with him he said any time I wanted to get married , he knew the captain of the Staten Island ferry . JOE RASMUSSEN Get it right ! The excursion to Sandy Hook . Anyway , we were there three days , this little hotel near Reading P A , and I was reading plays , and she 'd take the car so 's not to disturb me . Not to disturb me ! She could hardly wait to get out of the room . You know why ? To go take a look at some hawks . You know ? Hawks ! ANGELA KIRKBRIDE It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change , leaving you to look at some hawks . p. 75 JOE RASMUSSEN All that time she was making like a female Dylan Thomas , actually she was a bird-watcher . A Girl Scout . Tell you something else she was  --  a member of the East Orange Junior League . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE The Junior League of The Oranges . JOE RASMUSSEN Tell him where your Aunt Angela used to take you to lunch before the matine . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE The Colony Club . Now you tell him about your merit badges . JOE RASMUSSEN Woodcraft , and first aid . I got a merit badge in first aid because I was the one they used as a patient . They were always bandaging me up and putting me in splints . You should of seen me making like an accident victim . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE That 's what I wanted him to say . You realize now what you 've got directing your play , Mr. Wilson . A ham . A ham actor from way back . JOE RASMUSSEN I was good . Watch . He lies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groaning , " Do n't touch it ! God , let me die ! " At this point BRUNO enters and places the coffee things on a table , then scornfully , silently marches out . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( as casually as possible ) : Let him die . Or let 's pretend he 's a horse and shoot him . JOE gets laboriously to his feet . p. 76 JOE RASMUSSEN So anyway , you know how it is , Frank . A lot of men find out a lot of things about their wives on their honeymoon . But I found out that mine was a bird-watcher . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE That 's what a honeymoon is for , is n't it ? To find out things you did n't know before ? JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , well like I said , by that time we were pretty well acquainted . FRANK WILSON ( to ANGELA ) : When did you find out he 'd been a Boy Scout ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Through a big lie . That 's how I usually find things out about him . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could never read any of her poetry and we used to argue about that . So I told her , I said I wrote better poetry than that when I was fourteen years old . " Do you still have any of it ? " she asked me . And I said I 'd look in my scrapbook when I was a Boy Scout . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE And the next day he had a piece of paper that he 'd written on , imitating a fourteen-year-old boy 's handwriting . " I got a merit badge for poetry when I was a Scout , " he said , and this was one of his poems . JOE RASMUSSEN I wanted to see if she knew anything about poetry . p. 77 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE And this is what he 'd written : If I can stop one heart from breaking , I shall not live in vain ; If I can ease one life the aching , Or cool one pain , Or help one fainting robin , Unto his nest again , I shall not live in vain . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a limb , but that 's pretty good for a Boy Scout . In fact it sounds like a poem a Boy Scout would write . Of course you did n't write it , Joe ? JOE RASMUSSEN Will you tell him , or shall I ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE It was written by that well-known Boy Scout , Emily Dickinson . JOE RASMUSSEN She recognized it right away . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Anybody would that knew anything about poetry . FRANK WILSON I did n't , but I do n't know anything about poetry . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Neither does Mr. Rasmussen , or he would n't have copied anything as obvious as that . JOE RASMUSSEN It sounded very Scouty to me . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE The Harvard man speaking . JOE RASMUSSEN ( loftily ) : There are a few gaps in my cultural background . I admit it . p. 78 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE He spent all his time at Harvard reading plays . FRANK WILSON So he told me . Three thousand of them . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE He told me two thousand . He knows who played the maid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know for sure . For openers , there was no maid in Private Lives  --   --  ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Or who won the World Series in  --  1936 . JOE RASMUSSEN ( eagerly ) : Another easy one . The Yankees beat the Giants in a six-game series . I saw every game except the fifth , the game Schumacher won 5 to 4 . Maybe it was 6 to 5 . No , it was 5 to 4 . I had a sadistic uncle a Yankee fan , took me to all the other games but not that one . I wonder , was the fix in on that game and he knew it ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Did n't anybody warn you , Mr. Wilson ? FRANK WILSON What about ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Him . About him . I was watching you , and you do n't know whether he was kidding or not . He was n't . He half believes that his uncle would fix a World Series game just to annoy him . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , you know my uncle . Would n't he ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's be sensible . JOE RASMUSSEN Too late now . That was damn near thirty years ago . ( Shakes his head . ) I 'll never be able to see that game . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( to FRANK ) : See what I mean ? The question keeps coming back to me , Mr. Wilson . Why did you want to get Joseph to direct your play ? It is n't his kind of play at all . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , I wanted to ask you that , too , Frank . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I 'll be truthful with you , I told Joseph not to do it . JOE RASMUSSEN She did . She said I had nothing to gain and everything to lose . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Let me tell him myself . You do n't have to tattle . I said your play was all right , nothing special . Good characters and good dialogue , but not a play . JOE RASMUSSEN Show the man the bruises where I hit you when you said that . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE But how could an author like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good for a play like yours ? FRANK WILSON Do you really want to know , Mrs. Rasmussen , or is this all academic ? p. 80 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I 'd sort of like to know . If it does n't take too long . FRANK WILSON It wo n't . I saw other plays Joe directed , besides The Valid Resentment , and two movies he did . He could n't possibly know anything about the South , from personal experience , and yet Georgia Boy was absolutely convincing . I 've spent a lot of time in the South . The play he did four or five years ago  --   --  JOE RASMUSSEN Perihelion . FRANK WILSON Perihelion , that was laid in the year Two Thousand Five Hundred , but I got personally involved with those people . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE In other words you 're saying , or leading up to saying that he 's enough of an artist , and all that jazz . Okay , that 's a valid reason . FRANK WILSON Thanks . But it is n't the principal reason . JOE RASMUSSEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go ahead , Frank . Tell her . FRANK WILSON I wanted Joe to direct this play because a man that hates his guts told me that your husband has a thing about failure . He ca n't stand anything but unqualified success , and therefore works twice as hard as anyone has to , only because he wants the play to be a success . p. 81 JOE RASMUSSEN Axel Schmidt told you that ? FRANK WILSON Yes , it was Axel . JOE RASMUSSEN I did n't know you knew him . FRANK WILSON I do n't . I called him up when Stanton said he was going to try to get you . JOE RASMUSSEN If I 'd of known that I would n't of taken your play . FRANK WILSON I do n't apologize for trying to find out what I could . You did the same thing to me . JOE RASMUSSEN How do you know I did ? FRANK WILSON I assume you did . Just a guess . JOE RASMUSSEN You assume correctly . FRANK WILSON Sure . I 'm new in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that I 've had a lot of experience with book publishers and there 's only one difference between them and theatrical managers . JOE RASMUSSEN What 's that ? FRANK WILSON A book publisher gets to his office at ten o'clock , the theatrical manager gets to his at eleven . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to ANGELA ) : Well , did he answer your question to your satisfaction ? p. 82 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE He was a little too glib , but he makes a lot of sense . You are success-prone . FRANK WILSON I ca n't take the credit for that , Axel Schmidt told me that . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , but you knew when to believe Axel and when not to.He can be the biggest God damn liar I ever knew . FRANK WILSON Maybe I 'll be before this is over . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE You 've got plenty of competition in that department . My little Joseph , here . JOE RASMUSSEN Do n't forget Joyce Chilton . And I 'll bet Sidney Renwick  --  no , not very convincing . Sidney 's a natural-born liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somebody gave him a Gentleman 's Manual , How to be a Gentleman in Twenty-four Easy Lessons , and the part where it says a gentleman should n't lie , that threw Sidney . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Do n't tell me there is such a book . JOE RASMUSSEN No , but I 'm thinking of writing one . It 'd be easy . Just study Sidney , and whatever he does , a gentleman would do the opposite . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE If he heard you say that he 'd cut his throat . JOE RASMUSSEN No . Slit his veins , in a tub of warm water . You have n't been following Sidney . p. 83 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE No , that would be like man bites dog . JOE RASMUSSEN She 's pretty sharp this morning , for a dame that was up all night writing a poem . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Oh , shut up . You do n't have to tell everything you know . JOE RASMUSSEN God , you 'd think I said she was entertaining the fleet . I only said you  --   --  ANGELA KIRKBRIDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it talked about . I mean that , Joe . JOE RASMUSSEN When she calls me Joe , I make for the shelter . All right , Angie . I 'm sorry . ( He has gone too far and knows it . ) Frank , did you do anything about that third scene ? You know , where Sandra in the flashback has a line , " Darling , if you leave me now , do n't come back " ? Have you been thinking about that ? You see , if she says , " Do n't come back , " that is a peremptory line . You see what I mean ? A peremptory line is almost the same as an order . It closes out any further discussion , and that is n't the way she feels at that particular moment , Frank . She wants to leave it open . She wants to talk , to discuss their troubles . And she does n't want to give him an excuse to walk out . FRANK WILSON Yes , I changed the line . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you leave me this time , it 's for good . " p. 84 JOE RASMUSSEN Better . Much better . Puts it squarely up to him without being an ultimatum . In other words , she 's saying , " If you leave me now , I have no other choice but to let you go . You make the decision . I do n't . " Much better , Frank . Thank you . ( FRANK is a little surprised and pleased by the " thank you " but does not let JOE know it . ) Then Larry hesitates . You see , Frank , the kind of dumb-head Larry is , he would n't have hesitated for the other line , but now when he hesitates , that 's valid . It gets through his skull that Sandra does n't want him to leave , and that she 'll do almost anything to keep him from walking out . FRANK WILSON Almost anything , Joe . But later on , do n't forget , she realizes that she 's had it as far as Larry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on , when she 's had time to think . In this scene she has n't had much time to think . You know , everything happens pretty fast in this scene . FRANK WILSON ( nodding ) : Yeah . Yeah . JOE RASMUSSEN Oh , I agree with you absolutely that she 's had it as far as Larry 's concerned . But we know that before she 's supposed to know it . And we God damn sure want the audience to know it . This is a pretty honest dame , and we want the audience to be with her , or actually a little ahead of her . Not too much , but a little . You know , pulling for her , even though they know what mistakes she 's going to make . Or because they know what mistakes she 's going to make . Right ? p. 85 FRANK WILSON Right . JOE RASMUSSEN At the same time , Frank , do n't let me prejudice you when I call Larry a dumbhead . I do n't like him , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like anybody that works in an office , rich or poor , Catholic or Jew , I just do n't like office guys . Saloon guys , factory guys , farm guys  --  but not office guys . That 's a blind prejudice I have . But in this play , Larry is an office guy , and I 'm going to help you make the audience like him . We have to have that . And Frank , that 's where your play is weak . The dame , Sandra , we 're ready to open tonight , as far as the Sandra character is concerned . We do n't want to tinker with her . I 'll watch you to see that you do n't , and you watch me in case I start trying to improve her . ( ANGELA rises quietly , smiles happily at the men at work , and slips out apparently unnoticed by the men in their absorption . ) In case you did n't notice it , we 're now free to make any comments on women that we feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Let me tell you about this broad Sandra . I knew a dame just like her in CURTAIN p. 86 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Same as Scene One ; after lunch . JOE , ANGELA and FRANK have just finished lunch , are entering the room and assuming post-luncheon attitudes . JOE RASMUSSEN I 'll say this for you , Frank . You got yourself a good cook , or does she go with the house ? FRANK WILSON Too good . Yes , she goes with the lease . But I 'm not going to be able to eat that kind of food and start work right after lunch . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I was almost ashamed to eat that food , dressed the way we are . JOE RASMUSSEN I noticed that . Shyness overcame you as soon as you saw what we were getting . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Do n't be sarcastic . JOE RASMUSSEN Sarcastic ? Not sarcastic . You were so shy that the only way you could cover it was by compulsive eating , sometimes called making a pig of yourself . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd be able to work through till five or six . JOE RASMUSSEN You do n't think you can ? FRANK WILSON Not unless I take a nap . Do you realize that we three put away a chicken curry this big . p. 87 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Not to mention Joseph , with at least four rolls with butter and chutney . FRANK WILSON I did n't eat any of the rolls . JOE RASMUSSEN Honey , buy some chutney . I think I 'll have that instead of marmalade ANGELA KIRKBRIDE One of these days you 're going to end up with diabetes . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , what the hell , I 'm going to end up with something . Everybody does . And you keep forgetting , I 'm part Turkish , and we Turks eat a lot of sweets . FRANK WILSON I did n't know that , Joe . I 've never known a Turk . There was one at college , but he was a senior my freshman year , so I never got to know him . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( to JOE ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RASMUSSEN She does n't believe me , but my grandmother was raped by a Turk . FRANK WILSON How did that happen ? JOE RASMUSSEN The usual way . He knocked her down and pulled up her skirt , and  --   --  FRANK WILSON I did n't mean that . I meant the circumstances . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE He 's a little bit shaky on the circumstances . In the first place , the whole story is a God damn lie , and in the second place he invented it as an excuse for eating candy and pastry all the time , and in the third place , he 'd like to have a harem . p. 88 JOE RASMUSSEN Little does she know . Her idea of a harem is a lot of broads sitting around on pillows and eating coffee with a spoon . I belong to the modern Turks and I do n't have my harem all in one place . Hey , Fatima , come on over and tickle my feet . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( ignoring him ) : I wonder if I could get into one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to go for a swim . JOE RASMUSSEN Frank ? FRANK WILSON What ? JOE RASMUSSEN Could she get into one of Joyce 's bathing suits ? FRANK WILSON Oh no , Joe . No you do n't . JOE RASMUSSEN He does n't think you could . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE If we were home I would n't need a suit . JOE RASMUSSEN Well you need one here , with that butler . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Oh , I know , I know . Frank , could n't you give them the afternoon off , Bruno and his wife , and I could  --   --  No , I guess not . JOE RASMUSSEN No . Now let 's see the next thing that comes from that agile mind . You do n't know this about her , but she 's going to spend the next couple hours figuring out ways how she can go for a swim . Then by that time we 'll be ready to go home . But once she gets an idea , boy She hates to give up . p. 89 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE If Frank takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go and get me a big towel . I 'm sure Miss Joyce Chilton has those six-by four towels . FRANK WILSON If you do n't mind I think I will take a nap for about half an hour . Joe , do you want to come up and see if there are any big towels ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE You have no objection if I go in bareskin ? FRANK WILSON No , none at all . Why should I ? Frankly , I 'd enjoy it . In fact , I think I 'll take a nap and then join you in the pool when I wake up . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE But you have swimming trunks . FRANK WILSON Yes , I have trunks . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Well , I 'm not going in bare and you come in wearing trunks . FRANK WILSON What difference does it make ? We 're all grown-up men and women . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( to JOE ) Well , say something . JOE RASMUSSEN Wuddia want me to say ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Well , you do n't want me going in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? JOE RASMUSSEN Why not ? Why are you so anxious to have him go in bare-arse ? p. 90 ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I did n't say that . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , but it 's logical . What 's the objection to him wearing trunks ? The objection is you want him to go in bare-arse . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE No it is n't , and I did n't imply it . JOE RASMUSSEN Did n't she , Frank ? FRANK WILSON Well , it would seem that way . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Oh shut up , the two of you . ( She storms out and the men exchange grins . ) JOE RASMUSSEN You 're getting wise to her . You played it smarter than I did . She always wants to do the opposite . The trouble is , so do I , and I give her an argument instead of letting her have her way . You still want to take a nap ? FRANK WILSON I guess not . Let 's just sit and gab , and if we happen to get around to the play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . JOE RASMUSSEN All right . ( BRUNO brings in coffee and departs . ) I wonder where we 'll all be one year from today . What will you do if your play 's a big hit ? You know , like a year 's run ? FRANK WILSON I 've thought about that . p. 91 JOE RASMUSSEN I would n't want to have anything to do with you if you had n't . Show business  --  take dreaming and hoping out of it had you got the worst bunch of cut-throats and chisellers and phonies and hypocrites . You have them anyway , but what makes them different in show business than any other business , once or twice a year they take a big dive in the dark , and they hope the pool is full of champagne . If the God damn pool is empty  --  smacko ! But that 's what you do if you have a hit . Champagne , you 're over your head in it . What will you do ? FRANK WILSON Right away , or a year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILSON Well , I 'd buy presents for everybody . JOE RASMUSSEN Except Stanton . Do n't buy him anything . He 'll rob you in little ways that you wo n't know about . Like if you go away he 'll sell your house seats to the brokers and split the take . So do n't buy him any presents . FRANK WILSON All right . No present for Stanton . Then I think I 'll buy myself a boat . JOE RASMUSSEN What kind of a boat ? FRANK WILSON Oh , a schooner , or a yawl . JOE RASMUSSEN You 'll buy it right away ? p. 92 FRANK WILSON Yes . They 're cheaper in October . JOE RASMUSSEN But you have to pay storage all winter . FRANK WILSON Oh , no . I 'd take off for the South , the Inland Route , and I 'd spend all next winter on the boat , going from place to place in the Caribbean . JOE RASMUSSEN You know how to sail a boat ? FRANK WILSON Not a big one , but I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more about it than I do . I 'll take him along . JOE RASMUSSEN What will he do ? Quit his job ? FRANK WILSON If he has n't been fired . Boats are all he cares about . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , but you 're doing this as much for him as for yourself . I want to know what you 'd do for yourself . What would you buy for yourself ? FRANK WILSON Well , the trouble is , Joe , I do n't exactly know . I 've made a lot of money , and spent it , so it is n't as if I were having it for the first time . That experience I went through in Hollywood , 1946 . I had a house bigger than this . A couple like Bruno and his wife . A Bentley . And a Renoir . Do n't forget I had three best-sellers in five years , all sold to pictures for big money , and I wrote the screen plays for two of my books . p. 93 JOE RASMUSSEN Taxes . FRANK WILSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes and alimony . But I lived rich for a while , so that 's out of my system . I guess what I want is the satisfaction of seeing a play I wrote on Broadway  --   --  JOE RASMUSSEN And a hit . FRANK WILSON Yes , and a hit . But honestly that is n't as important to me as it ought to be . JOE RASMUSSEN It better be . If you do n't have that zing , boy , you 're gon na have a lot of headaches for nothing . You 're going to dive into that pool and it 's gon na be empty . FRANK WILSON I do n't think of this as a pool that I 'm diving into . To me it 's an idea I had , with some things I wanted to say about married life , and I could say them in a play , or I could say them in a novel . It 's a play because I did it that way . JOE RASMUSSEN No , there 's more to it than that or you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's luck , Joe . I 'm not even sure what the word dramaturgy really means . JOE RASMUSSEN If you want to know what I think , I think you 're a better playwright than a novelist . I hope you have a hit so that you 'll be hooked , and wo n't want to go back to writing novels . You know why the movies bought your novels ? I do . Because regardless of whether they were novels , dramaturgically speaking they are naturals . Only you do it by accident . All you need is a hit , to get you started . p. 94 FRANK WILSON I sure as hell do n't intend to go on writing plays if this is a flop . JOE RASMUSSEN You do n't now . Wait till we get in rehearsal . Wait 'll you see your first run-through . And wait till that night in Philly or New Haven or wherever we open . ( Terror begins to show on his face . ) Frank . FRANK WILSON ( innocently ) : What ? JOE RASMUSSEN Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure . JOE RASMUSSEN Listen . FRANK WILSON Yes . I hear a voice . JOE RASMUSSEN Are you expecting anybody ? You son of a bitch , are you holding out on me ? FRANK WILSON On my word of honour  --   --  JOE RASMUSSEN If you knew about this and did n't tell me  --   --  FRANK WILSON Joe , take it easy . Now I do n't hear anybody . JOE RASMUSSEN Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh . Oh , no . JOYCE CHILTON appears in the doorway at Right . She is beaming , sure of her welcome , beautifully dressed in a suit , carrying a small airline bag in one hand and a jewel box in the other . She frames herself in the doorway . p. 95 JOYCE CHILTON Oh , yes . As the great Durante would say  --  innnnnnnn poisson . ( Advancing on FRANK and JOE , kissing them both ) : Dear Frank . Dear Joe . Are n't you glad to see me , and surprised ? I 'm so glad to see you . JOE RASMUSSEN ( stupefied ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsive to her vitality ) : Hello , Joyce . How did you do this ? JOYCE CHILTON Was n't I the impulsive one ? Sit down now and I 'll tell you all about it . Let me see now , where to begin . Last Tuesday , or was it Wednesday . No it was n't a matine day , it was Tuesday , I got on board that dear Queen Elizabeth . They 're so wonderful to me on the Queen Elizabeth and they had all sorts of things planned for me , but I told them , no , no gaiety , no festivities this trip . And I virtually locked myself in my little suite and spent every waking minute with  --  guess what ? JOE RASMUSSEN Frank 's play JOYCE CHILTON Well , you 'd know that , Joe , because you 're in the profession , but Frank is so modest , he 'd never think of it . Yes , I had practically all my meals served in my room and I went over your play with a fine tooth-comb . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She holds up the little airline bag . ) Oh , did you know the Irish have an airline ? Just think of that . They are trying to catch up with the modern world . Movie studios all over Ireland , I 'm told . And an airline . p. 96 JOE RASMUSSEN The next thing , they 'll have an atom bomb , and then look out . JOYCE CHILTON I do n't know about that , but we 've got to stop thinking of them as a backward people . Airlines and movie studios and everything . Anyway , I read and read and read and made notes , notes , notes , and it was all I could do , Frank , to restrain myself from calling you on the ship-to-shore telephone . But then I thought of the expense and inconvenience to you , dear . You might have been able to deduct it , but they 're so unpredictable about what they 'll allow and wo n't allow . So I realized the last day on the Queen Elizabeth  --  I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to do and that was turn around and come right back home . So I took an automobile to the London Airport , with all my luggage still on the Queen Elizabeth , and I could n't get a thing on the New York plane , but fortunately I was recognized and this perfectly charming Englishman telephoned to the Shannon Airport , that 's in Ireland  --  whurr the Rivvah Shannon flo-ows  --  and he found out that there was a vacancy or a cancellation or something on one of these Irish planes . So I flew to Shannon and from there to Idlewild , arrived safe and sound this morning , and here I am . Is n't it all exciting ? Sarah Bernhardt could n't have done that . FRANK WILSON No . Well , welcome home , Joyce . Welcome home . p. 97 JOYCE CHILTON Thank you , dear . Has everything been all right ? FRANK WILSON Just fine . Perfect . JOYCE CHILTON ( something on her mind ) : I did n't come at the wrong time , did I ? FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm as broad-minded as it 's possible to be . But did n't I see Shirley Tanner in my pool , naked as the day she was born ? You could do better than that , Frank . You 're an attractive man , and the nicest women go for intellectuals these days . Every man to his taste , but I wish you 'd get her out of here . You know , ( she holds her hands in front of but at a distance from her bosom ) enough 's enough . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to FRANK ) : Do n't interrupt her . JOYCE CHILTON ( turning to JOE ) : Oh , you brought her . That 's right , you did have a thing with her , did n't you ? Back for retakes , eh ? But do you think it 's fair to Bruno to have this Rhine maiden sloshing around without any clothes on ? FRANK WILSON Joyce , the girl in the pool is Joe 's wife . Angela Kirkbride . Joe 's wife . JOYCE CHILTON ( deadpan ) : Hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me . ( Thinks of something and brightens . ) Well , I 'm so glad it is Mrs. Rasmussen and not Shirley Tanner . p. 98 FRANK WILSON I should say this , Joyce . Joe and I are just as much surprised to hear that Angela 's in the pool as you were to see her . JOE RASMUSSEN She crossed us . We thought we had her talked out of it . JOYCE CHILTON No matter . Nothing , really . Of course she could have borrowed a bathing suit from Bruno 's wife . However , no harm done , and it 's more or less the custom over your way , nude bathing , is n't it ? ( She smiles , over-sweetly . ) Do n't tell Mrs. Rasmussen about the men at the golf club . It would spoil it for her . JOE RASMUSSEN What men at the golf club ? JOYCE CHILTON Oh , that crowd of men on the seventeenth tee . JOE RASMUSSEN ( in a hurry ) : Where do you keep your towels ? JOYCE CHILTON The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exits ) : I 'm not sure they 'll cover your wife , though . JOE RASMUSSEN They 'll cover enough of her . ( JOE leaves them alone . ) JOYCE CHILTON ( sitting down , taking out a cigarette , which FRANK lights for her ) : Ah , journey 's end . Do you love my house as much as I do ? p. 99 FRANK WILSON Well , in the short time I 've been here , I 've gotten very fond of it . JOYCE CHILTON I 'm so glad . Do you like this room ? FRANK WILSON I certainly do . JOYCE CHILTON That 's good . I was a little afraid . I spent two whole days before I sailed , doing this room over especially for you . Most of the old pieces belonged to my grandfather and I had them in storage , but I got them out because I had a hunch they were the kind of things you 'd like . You know , I feel very much at home in New England . My ancestors were sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ship model , and some of these chairs . They 've all been in the family since time immemorial . It 's all a bit masculine for as feminine a person as I am , but I wanted you to have one room where you 'd feel  --  at home . So I want you to know , Mr. Frank Wilson , I spent two whole days getting this room ready for you . FRANK WILSON Whatever time you spent , it was well worth it . JOYCE CHILTON Well then I 'm well rewarded . I suppose you 're wondering how my return affects our deal . Well , that 's more or less up to you . FRANK WILSON Oh , I 'll move back to town . That 's all right . JOYCE CHILTON No , now wait a second . It really all depends on  --  Oh , let 's not be evasive . Have you got a girl , a mistress , that would make a stink if you stayed here ? In other words , what is your situation in that department ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any one person . Free-lancing . JOYCE CHILTON Sure , I understand . Well then no one 's going to object if you stay here . FRANK WILSON No girl-friend of mine is going to object . What about you , though ? JOYCE CHILTON Uh  --  between engagements , so to speak . You see , Frank , I 've reached that very peculiar position where if I have lunch with a man , everybody jumps to conclusions . Whereas , on the other hand , if an author is staying at my house and working on a play that I 'm going to be in  --  well , they jump to conclusions then , too , but in the latter case there 's always a lingering doubt . They wonder if I 'd be so open about it . You see what I mean ? If I 'm seen having lunch with a man , I might as well be as naked as that channel swimmer out in my pool . Why did n't she cover herself with grease ? An awful lot of lard there to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But about the living arrangements . JOYCE CHILTON Naturally you have some things you want to say . FRANK WILSON Well , yes , I have . The trouble is , I do n't know what to say . JOYCE CHILTON Would you like a little help ? You 're thinking , what if this gal and I keep it Platonic for a week or so and then dear old propinquity takes over ? p. 101 FRANK WILSON Yes , that one thought I had . JOYCE CHILTON And  --  this is you thinking  --  am I smart to get mixed up with her at all when I 'm supposed to be rewriting a play . Can I live in this house with her without making a pass , how is that going to affect my play ? Maybe I better go back to the hotel till I finish the play , and then make a pitch . FRANK WILSON All very true , very accurate . JOYCE CHILTON But there 's more . You must have been wondering , just these past few minutes , whether it might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . FRANK WILSON Yes , I thought that . JOYCE CHILTON Well , so far you 've honestly admitted everything . But have you given any thought to the possibility that I 'm not interested in going to bed with you ? Tell me the truth , Frank . FRANK WILSON No , I frankly thought it would be all up to me . JOYCE CHILTON ( quietly ) : Yes , that 's my reputation . It is n't fair , you know . I 'm not all that promiscuous . I had an affair with Sidney Renwick years ago , and not a soul knew about it . I was already a star and he was a love-sick juvenile , getting kicked around , underpaid , not very talented , and no self-confidence whatsoever . He cried on my shoulder one night in Boston , and I was nice to him . I slept with him every night for a week , and I 've never even kissed him since then . I would no more sleep with Sidney again than I would with Stanley Stanton , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney was young , pitiful , and quite sweet , and I 'll say this for Sidney . He never talked . It would have been very easy for young Mr. Renwick to blab it around that he was having an affair with Joyce Chilton , but he never did . People have made guesses that he 's slept with me , but they know in their hearts that they 're only guesses , because they 've guessed at the wrong times . I had an affair with Robert W. McAtherton. p. 102 FRANK WILSON You could n't have . You do n't go back that far . JOYCE CHILTON I did , though . He was my dramatic coach when I was nineteen . He was close to sixty , or maybe he was sixty . But I worshipped that man . That voice , that wonderful voice . Do you remember his Othello ? FRANK WILSON I never saw him . JOYCE CHILTON You missed one of the truly great . I paid him fifteen dollars an hour , when I was making sixty dollars a week . Forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every cent of it , even if I did have to eat on a dollar a day . He did n't seduce me . I just adored him so that I was there for the taking , and gladly . He was ashamed . Oh , he was so ashamed . " My child , I need your money more I 'd go to his room at night , but most of the time he was dead drunk , sometimes lying on the floor , and I 'd go away without his knowing I 'd ever been there . That 's how he died , you remember . In a furnished room on Fifty-fourth Street . One of the great artists of all time . And a wonderful , wonderful lover . ( She is silent , and he reaches over and puts his hand gently on hers . ) I am thinking of a line . It 's Iago 's line , but Robert McAtherton loved it . " Reputation is an idle and most false imposition ; oft got without merit , and lost without deserving : you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a loser . " I think I have it right . p. 103 FRANK WILSON Did you ever play Shakespeare , Joyce ? JOYCE CHILTON ( bitterly , but only faintly so ) : Hah ! For twenty years , when I come on there 's a buzz goes through the audience . The women commenting on my costume . Then quiet while they wait to laugh at my first funny line . No , the spell of Mr. Shakespeare 's words would be broken if I ever said them . FRANK WILSON It was n't just now . JOYCE CHILTON That 's because you 're nice . You listen . You have heart , and that communicates , you know . Nobody 'd ever go to see me in Shakespeare , and really why should they ? I 've been as lucky as any actress ever was . I was an ingnue till I was thirty , and the critics were very nice about that . I was a star , but I was still doing ingnue parts . Then I made the transition from ingnue to soignee leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a draw . Aided and abetted , of course , by publicity . Two big front-page love affairs and two , uh , affluent marriages , if that 's a proper use of my new favourite word . I 'm a star , and I 'm rich . Those are the two things I wanted to be , and I am . ( Slightly defiantly ) : And we start rehearsals in August . What else could I want ? FRANK WILSON I 'm sure I do n't know , Joyce . But whatever it is , I hope you get it . p. 104 JOYCE CHILTON You do , do n't you ? And you 're making all sorts of guesses as to what it is . You would n't guess anything as obvious as love , or children . FRANK WILSON Such obvious things occurred to me , but I 'd hesitate to mention them . JOYCE CHILTON Children are out of the question and have been for a long time . Physically . But that still leaves love . FRANK WILSON All right then , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would trust me to love him ? I do n't mean what man would count on my being faithful to him . I mean just what I said . Trust me to love him . A man old enough to marry me , he 's probably pretty cautious about love . He is n't going to let himself love a woman who wo n't give him the same kind of love in return . At my age and at his age , we could have a pleasant enough arrangement without marriage or without love . The arrangement could be based on deep affection , or deep affection might develop from the arrangement . But that is still some-thing short of love . I want to be in love again and for the final , last time , and I think I could be . But I have n't seen any signs of it , in myself or in any man . And as I think about it now , no man should trust me to love him . As I was telling you about Sidney , and then about Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in love with him , and when I was talking about Mr. Mc-Atherton , I loved him . That 's what this damn business I 'm in has done to me . Why should any man trust me to love him , when I can quick-change like that ? p. 105 FRANK WILSON Well , at least you 're aware of your  --   --  JOYCE CHILTON My what ? FRANK WILSON Well  --  your tendency to vacillate . You 're honest enough with yourself to realize that you can love one man at a time , but that the time is n't going to last very long . JOYCE CHILTON It does n't last five minutes . For the past week I 've been very much in love with Larry , in your play . FRANK WILSON You 've been , or Sandra ? JOYCE CHILTON Why  --  I was  --  or was it Sandra ? I do n't know . I thought it was me as Sandra , but now that you ask the question , I 'm not so sure . I guess it was me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She suddenly turns to him . ) Are you Larry ? FRANK WILSON More than you are Sandra . Basically . Larry is me . JOYCE CHILTON You 're kind of rough on yourself in the play , are n't you ? FRANK WILSON That 's one of the reasons why it 's a play and not a novel . In a play I get a better look at myself , and it 's high time I did . I was married to two pretty good women , and I 've done a lot of very embarrassing thinking about them and about those marriages . p. 106 JOYCE CHILTON Why are you embarrassed ? FRANK WILSON Well  --  self-castigation is a form of self-pity , of course . But it seems to me that I did as much as Geraldine did to louse up my first marriage , and then I did the same thing all over again with Lucy , my second wife . JOYCE CHILTON What were the things ? FRANK WILSON One thing , really . I never made the effort , or took the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOYCE CHILTON Oh , well . That 's masculine . Or anyway , human . FRANK WILSON It 's both , and I 'm convinced it 's what louses up marriage . The dominant , male breadwinner , and the dominant female house-wife are so God damn busy being what they are that they never have time for anything else . JOYCE CHILTON Yes , but what were they before they were married ? I agree with you , but here are the two of us , you and I , liking each other very much  --   --  FRANK WILSON Very much . JOYCE CHILTON Almost to the point of love . FRANK WILSON ( smiling a little ) : Yes . JOYCE CHILTON Yes . I love you dearly at this moment , Frank , and you love me , do n't you ? p. 107 FRANK WILSON Dearly . JOYCE CHILTON And you would n't think of trying to dominate me , or I , you . But if we got married , you were the breadwinner and I was the housewife , it would n't be any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to dominate , and my kitchen and my life made me want to dominate . FRANK WILSON Well , yes . So I guess the only solution is to abolish marriage . JOYCE CHILTON You 're being funny , but a lot of people have , and a lot more would if they could . FRANK WILSON Yes , but I 'm not yet ready to advocate that in a play . Or at all . It may not be even the semi-perfect state , but it 's the only game in town . No , not the only game in town . But it 's the best arrangement so far . JOYCE CHILTON Well then you and I 'd better not try it . FRANK WILSON You mean together ? JOYCE CHILTON Or separately . No marriage for you , no marriage for me . FRANK WILSON I have no intention of trying it . By the way , is any of this in your notes ? JOYCE CHILTON Oh , heavens no . My notes are  --  well , why does Sidney have to be onstage so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut me out of my own play , are you ? JOYCE CHILTON Oh , I can see you 're going to make trouble for the star . I love you dearly , Frank . FRANK WILSON I love you dearly too , Joyce . JOYCE CHILTON Will you stay ? FRANK WILSON Here ? Sure . As long as we love each other dearly , we 're safe . JOYCE CHILTON ( rising ) : Anyway , you wo n't go away before I 've had a bath . I suppose that will be the next big thing in aeroplanes : a bathtub . FRANK WILSON They go so fast nowadays you have n't got time to get dirty . JOYCE CHILTON My baths have nothing to do with cleanliness . I have some deep-rooted guilt complex that makes me take three or four baths a day . I used to think it was wanting to be clean , but that was all straightened out for me by my second husband . He used to psycho-analyse me while I was waiting for him to climb in the hay . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my simple little brain . She pats FRANK 'S cheek and exits , and JOE RASMUSSEN appears in french doorway at Left , then saunters in . FRANK WILSON ( slightly annoyed ) : I suppose you were listening . p. 109 JOE RASMUSSEN I sent Angie home . I did n't figure this would be a good time for her and the Duchess to swap insults . We got more important things to talk about . Yeah . I was listening . I told you I always listen , and I read mail too . I told you that . ( Languidly sprawls on a chair . ) You know what John Drew said ? John Drew said more actors were ruined by a good voice than were ever ruined by booze . FRANK WILSON I do n't like you to listen in on my private conversations . JOE RASMUSSEN ( ignoring FRANK 'S remark ) : This poor dame . You know I 'm getting to like her . I used to think she 'd open up her drawers like a cash register . But she really went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , going for McAtherton . What I like is that she was so nave about it . She thinks of herself as a nice little stagestruck kid that was kind to an old broken-down actor . She likes that image of herself , and I like her for liking that image of herself . If she knew the truth , McAtherton was a lecherous old bum . FRANK WILSON How do you know that ? You 're younger than Joyce . You probably were in high school when she was taking lessons from him . JOE RASMUSSEN ( angrily ) : Anything I say about the theatre , it 's reliable . Did you ever hear of Annie Laurie Menzies , pronounced Ming-ees ? No. p. 110 FRANK WILSON No . JOE RASMUSSEN Annie Laurie was McAtherton 's third wife , he was married five times . I had her in a play once . I knew all about the legend of Robert W. McAtherton , so I used to pump her about him . That line about , " I need your money more than I need your love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANK WILSON Well , if you ever tell that to Joyce I 'll give you a punch in the nose . JOE RASMUSSEN I do n't want any punch in the nose , but that ai n't why I 'm not gon na tell her . I believe in illusions . Hell , I 'm in the illusion business . But now that I know that about Joyce , I would appreciate it if you would consider putting in a scene in the second act . You know where Sandra has the talk with Larry 's father . She wants to find out from the old guy what 's the matter with Larry . FRANK WILSON ( deciding not to sulk ) : Yeah . JOE RASMUSSEN If you have no objection , I wish you 'd consider writing the scene from the angle of Sandra . Uh , the way it is now , all she does is ask the old guy a lot of questions , and he answers them . But instead of that , she still asks the questions and he still answers them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man that are some of the good things and the bad things in Larry . In other words , the old guy is an older edition of Larry . That is , if you have no objections . I do n't ask you to make changes with-out giving you a reason . All right , the reason for this change . First of all , this change would n't mean any changes in the characters of Sandra or the father . Second , knowing what I do now about Joyce and McAtherton , I could get one hell of a scene out of her . And it 'll only add maybe three minutes to your second act . p. 111 FRANK WILSON I like it . JOE RASMUSSEN ( rather to himself ) : Yeah , I like it . ( Soliloquizing ) : Maybe we can work something out . If I went after her myself , you 'd probably get sore , because you 're getting a little stuck on her . And Angie would be sore as hell at me and when she 's sore at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for me to work when Angie 's sore at me . We have to work something out . I wish you were a little older , then it would take care of itself . Or if you were a fairy . I worked with a lot of fairies in my time and they can give you a lot of trouble , but they do n't give you trouble over women . FRANK WILSON ( sarcastically ) : No , that 's what a fairy is , is n't it ? JOE RASMUSSEN I got one solution , but I do n't know if Joyce would hold still for it . What do you think ? Do you think Joyce would let me move in here ? FRANK WILSON I gather that all this is aimed at keeping me from having an affair with Joyce . Well , with your big ears , you heard what she said . She is n't interested . JOE looks at him as at a sweet but stupid child . JOE RASMUSSEN I think I 'll ask her . Yeah , that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses , she 's admitting that she wants to sleep with you . That 's the only reason she could refuse . I really got her on a spot . ( He goes to doorway at Right and calls out ) : Hey , Joyce ! p. 112 FRANK WILSON She ca n't hear you , she 's taking a bath . JOE RASMUSSEN When she comes down I 'll ask her . She ca n't say no to that request . FRANK WILSON What are you planning to do , chaperone us , like a Spanish duenna ? JOE RASMUSSEN What else ? She comes back here with a suitcase full of notes that she thought up a week ago . You do n't know it yet , but every God damn one of those notes is very carefully thought out . This dame is a real pro , you know . There 's nothing silly about her . You know what she did on the Queen Elizabeth ? I 'll show you . She played every scene . Not only the ones she 's in , but those she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brand new play . Right now there 's stuff in your play that you never thought of . Where you have her Down Left , listening to a speech by Renwick , I bet you she has herself Up Right so that Renwick will have to turn his back to the audience . Here , I 'll show you . ( He demonstrates , using FRANK for RENWICK . ) FRANK WILSON Everybody knows that much about the theatre . JOE RASMUSSEN You did n't when you wrote it . I know that . Because the only two times that Renwick or Larry has long speeches , you have Joyce Down Left . As soon as I saw that I knew there 'd be trouble , and she spotted it , you can be damn sure . ( FRANK shrugs , and is silent . ) I could collect some money off you if you wanted to make some bets . I 'll bet you I can tell you two lines she wants cut out , and I could damn near tell you what she 's gon na suggest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Scene , where Larry tells his father that he has decided to leave Sandra because she 's frigid . p. 113 FRANK WILSON ( nodding ) : " Frigid and calculating . " JOE RASMUSSEN Right . Now I 'll tell you about that line . Joyce does n't realize that when the guy calls her frigid , he 's admitting that he 's had trouble keeping her aroused . You intended that line to characterize Larry , did n't you ? FRANK WILSON Yes , of course . JOE RASMUSSEN Sure . But Joyce Chilton , this dame upstairs , she 's not going to let anybody call her frigid . The only thing it means to her is that the audience might think Joyce Chilton is frigid . Not Sandra . Joyce herself . Joyce Chilton is always going to be in there protecting Joyce Chilton , and the hell with you and your play . For that reason , the reference to the son at Yale has got to go . A son at Yale pegs her age , and she wo n't let you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be somewhere around forty-five , and I will bet you fifty dollars to twenty that she 's going to argue with you that the son ought to be in prep school , not college . Frank , she knows I 'm tough , and she knows I know my way around in this business . So when we 're in rehearsal , if I have her doing something she does n't want to do , standing one way , sitting another way , giving an actor a piece of business  --  she 's not gon na argue with me . She 's gon na get you to change lines that will let her do what she wants to do . In other words , destroy what I 've made her do , get rid of it . What you 've got ta do with this dame is go right up and slap her in the kisser right at the very beginning . And you ca n't do that if you 're sleeping with her . At least you ca n't . ( He laughs . ) I could , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 114 FRANK WILSON What do you mean , slap her in the kisser ? Exactly what ? JOE RASMUSSEN I mean , the first change she suggests , no matter even if it 's a good one , you got to say , " When I want a suggestion , I 'll ask you for it . " Just between you and me , if it 's any good , we can put it in later . But not when she asks you to . FRANK WILSON Well , I might as well be frank with you . That 's what I always intended to do . Not only with her , but with you , too . JOE RASMUSSEN Sure . But you do n't care if I hate you . Every author I ever had anything to do with , they all say to themselves , " Joe Rasmussen is going to direct my play , but I 'll be a son of a bitch if I 'll let him rewrite it . " Is n't that what you said to yourself ? FRANK WILSON Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get you nowhere . JOE RASMUSSEN Oh , I get around your objections in my own way . I never tell you to change something . I always ask you . I ca n't change a word of your play , myself . I know the rules of the Dramatists Guild . I 'm a member of it . But you 'll have so much confidence in me by the end of next week that I wo n't have any trouble with you . You 'll figure it out for yourself , so I do n't mind telling you . I like your play and I want it to be a hit . I do n't want to look beautiful in any two-thousand-dollar dress from a French couturier . If you wanta give me a coupla six-dollar neckties , okay . But I 'm success-prone . That 's all I want . I have to make up for years of running out for coffee for what I call nothing-people , guys like Sidney Renwick . You know , Frank , this probably never occurred to you , because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be misled by that old saying " The play 's the thing . " The play is the thing , but not just those words you wrote . Not just your dialogue and your plot . I 'll give you an illustration . You saw The Valid Resentment . You remember the scene with the soldier and Shirley Tanner ? p. 115 FRANK WILSON Sure . JOE RASMUSSEN Axel wrote a kind of an editorial about war in that scene . It was good , as an editorial , and he was sore at me because I did n't let the soldier stand in the centre of the apron , for God 's sake , and intone those words like a prayer . But what Axel did n't know was that in one performance in New Haven we did it his way . He was n't there . I got him called back to New York on some phony pretext . We did the scene his way , with the soldier facing the audience and making his appeal . It was a bomb . It was the only time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid there like a fried egg . After that we did it my way , and it never failed to get a hand . That 's what I contribute . The whole play 's the thing , Frank , and not just your words . I still have more respect for the words than I do for any actor or any director , or costume designer or the guy that does the sets . But do n't you be pig-headed , or you wo n't get that schooner . ( Languidly he goes to doorway and calls . ) Hey , Joyce , I got something I wanta ask you . You wanta take in another boarder ? Her voice is heard but the words are inaudible . FRANK WILSON What did she say ? JOE RASMUSSEN She said she 'd be right down . She heard me , but she 's giving herself a chance to think . Watch this . p. 116 FRANK WILSON I would n't miss it . JOYCE enters in lounging pyjamas , cool and soigne . She puts the back of her hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOYCE CHILTON Mm . Does n't that smell good ? Shannon Airport . FRANK WILSON Shannon Number Five ? JOYCE CHILTON No , it 's  --  oh . A tiny little joke . Very cute . I hope you boys , you gentlemen , have n't just been sitting here making little jokes instead of working . ( Turns to JOE . ) You especially , Joe Rasmussen . I do n't blame Frank for wanting to relax a little . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to FRANK ) : Here it comes . JOYCE CHILTON But you . I was almost sure I heard you just now ask me if I wanted to take in another boarder . If I 'm wrong , forgive me . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to FRANK ) : I told you this was no silly dame . You ca n't fool around with her . JOYCE CHILTON ( overgraciously ) : You can , but not during office hours . We 've got to be serious , you know . That 's why I gave up my trip to Europe , that I 've been looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , and we wo n't have a thing done . We wo n't really be ready to go into rehearsal , and that will put us back a month or so and we 're just liable to lose that theatre . Joe , you know how tough it is to get a theatre these days . p. 117 JOE RASMUSSEN ( to FRANK ) : See ? This is not a silly dame . JOYCE CHILTON Why do you keep saying that , Joe ? You know I 'm not a silly dame , at least not about my work . Frank did n't say I was a silly dame , I 'm sure . FRANK WILSON Nope . Never . JOYCE CHILTON Frank knows I 'm not . Frank and I have made a lot of progress toward a better mutual understanding , while you were out there drying off your wife . Where is she , by the way ? JOE RASMUSSEN I sent her home . I got a new tactic . It used to be the brushoff , but now it 's the dry-off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him ) : Jokes . You see what I mean ? ( She pushes a wall button to summon a servant , talking while doing so . ) I gave up my European trip  --   --  Oh , Bruno , will you go up to my room , please , and bring down a little green bag about so big . I think I left it on the chair by the window . A little green bag . JOE RASMUSSEN Takes me back to Harvard , the little green bag . BRUNO Madam . ( He goes . ) JOE RASMUSSEN You all through with the pep talk , Joyce ? p. 118 JOYCE CHILTON For the moment , yes , I guess so . JOE RASMUSSEN It was very good . It 's what stage magicians call misdirection . You know , they make you look at this hand while they 're doing something with this one . But magicians all tell me that they have a hard time fooling children . " I know where it went , " the kids say . " You still got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind of a child , too . A very simple fellow . FRANK AND JOYCE Oh , sure . My , yes . Childlike . JOE RASMUSSEN And consequently , I do n't fall for misdirection . JOYCE CHILTON ( as BRUNO hands her the bag and goes ) : What ever are you talking about , Joe ? Thank you , Bruno . JOE RASMUSSEN I 'm merely talking about you trying to get us off the subject . JOYCE CHILTON What is the subject ? JOE RASMUSSEN I asked you a question . I ask it again . Do you have anything against me staying here and working with Frank ? I 'll pay you . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , you meant that seriously ? I thought you must be joking . Why of course I have no objection , and I would n't dream of taking a cent from you . But are n't there other objections ? Your wife , for one . She might not like your staying here  --  or have you got it worked out that she was to move in , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do wish you 'd let me in on things . If we 're going to start a little artists ' colony here , all right , but give me some warning . Who else are we going to have ? I draw the line at Shirley Tanner , by the way . p. 119 FRANK WILSON We  --   --  JOE RASMUSSEN ( silencing him ) : She has n't finished . JOYCE CHILTON I think I 'll have to put up some kind of a high fence around the pool , or the golf club people will start making noises . And I know there 's some kind of zoning law about having boarding houses in certain areas . Also , if we have more than a certain number of people living here , the Township will make me put up a fire escape . That 's going to be hideous , a fire escape on this nice old salt-box . Maybe they 'd let me install one of those ropes in every bedroom instead of an ugly , rusty old fire escape . And where are we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can seat in my dining-room . I 've tried twelve , and it 's just too crowded . So  --  when do you propose to start this project ? I 'd like to see a list of the people , if you do n't mind . JOE RASMUSSEN ( tears off a corner of a magazine page and scribbles on it , handing it to JOYCE ) : Here 's your list . JOYCE CHILTON ( reading ) : Me . M , e . This is your list ? Just you ? JOE RASMUSSEN That 's all  --  but congratulations on a very good ad lib performance . She was good , was n't she , Frank ? p. 120 JOYCE CHILTON Well if I was good , do n't just sit on your hands . This is n't a benefit . ( The two men applaud . ) Thank you . You 're serious about this ? You really want to come here and live ? JOE RASMUSSEN Really , really live . I would like to come here and work close with this guy . JOYCE CHILTON What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , I do n't mind having a mnage trois , as long as your wife is n't going to . But I do n't see why you do n't get her to come here , too . Have you spoken to her about it ? JOE RASMUSSEN I do n't have to speak to her about it . I know what she 'd say . JOYCE CHILTON She could sue me for depriving her of your services . That 's the legal term for it , I believe . JOE RASMUSSEN Then you 're against me living here ? JOYCE CHILTON I did n't say that , but it 's my house and I 'll get the blame for everything that happens here . JOE RASMUSSEN Not everything . Angela would only blame you if you and I were shacked up . She do n't care what happens to Frank . JOYCE CHILTON ( quickly ) : But you do ? JOE RASMUSSEN No . Only what happens to his play . p. 121 JOYCE CHILTON And you think the best way to protect his play is to come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to stay here ? JOE RASMUSSEN What other reason could I have , Joyce ? I certainly do n't want to stay here so I can chaperone you and Frank , like as if I was a Spanish duenna . How would I look with a big high comb on the back of my head ? JOYCE CHILTON I 'd never notice it . I never get beyond those piercing eyes of yours . All right , what time do you like to have breakfast ? JOE RASMUSSEN Preferably after a good night 's sleep . JOYCE CHILTON You can have the room next to Frank 's . It 's on the other side of the hall from mine . And so , that 's settled . I feel a little bit as though I were being led around by the nose . But then I suppose I should start getting used to that . JOE RASMUSSEN I always heard you were very good at taking direction . JOYCE CHILTON You never heard any such thing , but we 're still at the polite stage , are we not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few points . By the way , are the three of us going to work together or just you two ? JOE RASMUSSEN We 'll listen to everything you have to say . p. 122 JOYCE CHILTON If that is n't the ying-yang answer of the week . ( She opens her airline bag and takes out a piece of paper . She reads it silently , then looks up . ) Frank , this is such a minor point that I 'm not going to make an issue of it . I know you wrote this before I met you , and when you did n't have me in mind for the part of Sandra . But ( she holds the paper suspended over the waste basket , ready to drop it ) @x Late in August , the scene is a bare stage , with a few bentwood chairs and two or three standing lamps with naked bulbs . Down Left JOE RASMUSSEN is straddling a chair , with his chin resting on the back of the chair . Behind him , perhaps six feet away , sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a playscript , lying open , face down . They are watching SIDNEY RENWICK and JOYCE CHILTON rehearsing a scene . SIDNEY is in tan cotton slacks and matching sports shirt ; JOYCE is in a similar but feminine outfit , plus a foulard scarf at her throat , and she holds her " sides " in her left hand . JOYCE CHILTON ( playing Sandra ) : " The trouble with you , Larry , is that you 've gone through life having your own way . " SIDNEY RENWICK ( playing Larry , and without sides ; he is up in the part ) : " One of the troubles with us , Sandra , is that you really believe that . You think I 've had it soft all my life ? " JOYCE CHILTON " And you have . " SIDNEY RENWICK " Not really . It just looks that way because I do n't dramatize everything that happens to me . " JOYCE CHILTON " And I suppose I do . " p. 124 SIDNEY RENWICK " Well , do n't you ? " JOYCE CHILTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where am I when he says that ? JOE RASMUSSEN Right where you are . You stay there till he crosses to answer the telephone . JOYCE CHILTON But I do n't feel right just standing here , Joe . JOE RASMUSSEN You 're not supposed to feel right . You 're supposed to be God damn uncomfortable standing there , building up your irritation till you explode . You want to move around , but that 's wrong for the mood of the scene . Do n't you see that , Joyce ? ( He gets up to demonstrate . You 're here , and it 's like your feet were nailed to the floor . JOYCE CHILTON I sound like a Strasbourg goose , being fattened up for pt de foie gras . JOE RASMUSSEN Cut out the jokes , please , Miss Chilton . We 're at work . You 're standing here , having this argument with your husband . You keep arguing till you ca n't take it any longer , and then you let go . Bang ! But if you 're moving around during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion at all . It 's a continuing action . I do n't want that . I want you to save it up for your next line . You know what your next line is ? p. 125 JOYCE CHILTON Of course I do . JOE RASMUSSEN ( standing away ) : That 's good . Cue , please , Sidney . SIDNEY RENWICK ( as Larry ) : " Well , do n't you ? " JOYCE CHILTON ( as Sandra ) : " Well if I did n't there 'd be damn little excitement around this house . " JOE RASMUSSEN ( imitating telephone ) : Linga-linga-ling . SIDNEY crosses to Stage Right and picks up an imaginary telephone . JOE RASMUSSEN ( pointing his finger ) : Now , Joyce ! JOYCE CHILTON ( as Sandra ) : " Do n't answer it ! " JOE RASMUSSEN Okay . Stop here , please . SIDNEY and JOYCE stand apart , paying no attention to each other . JOYCE takes out her compact . JOE goes to FRANK . JOE RASMUSSEN ( looks at his wrist watch ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to JOYCE and SIDNEY ) : It 's a quarter to twelve . Can you have your lunch and be back here at one o'clock ? p. 126 SIDNEY RENWICK I can . JOYCE CHILTON I can , but I want you to know , I have to break a lunch date . My appointment was for one o'clock , when most people have lunch . JOE RASMUSSEN I asked you not to make any lunch dates . JOYCE CHILTON I 'll be here , but I just want you to know . JOE RASMUSSEN I 'll put a gold star in your book . One o'clock , on stage , please . That gives you an hour and a quarter , and you beat the crowd at Sardi 's . JOYCE CHILTON ( haughtily ) : I never have any trouble getting a table at Sardi 's . Or anywhere else . Come on , Sidney , I 'll treat you . They leave the stage . OFFSTAGE VOICE OF A STAGEHAND You want us to knock off too , Mr. Rasmussen ? JOE RASMUSSEN Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hungry , Frank ? FRANK WILSON Not very , and it 's cooler in here than it is outside . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , and it ai n't only the ventilation . FRANK WILSON I know . JOE RASMUSSEN Trouble , you got to expect . p. 127 FRANK WILSON ( handing him a Thermos ) : Here . JOE RASMUSSEN What 's in that ? FRANK WILSON Iced tea . JOE RASMUSSEN ( pouring a drink into the cup-like cap ) : Thanks . Tastes good . Hemlock would taste better . I do n't know what the hell to do with this dame . She 's fighting me all the way , but she 's very careful to avoid one big fight . FRANK WILSON I noticed that . JOE RASMUSSEN Like she wo n't refuse to be here at one o'clock , but she 'll let you know she 's doing you a favour . The hell of it is , this all started as soon as we went into rehearsal . At her house she was pleasant and friendly . I should of known it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's no doubt about that . JOE RASMUSSEN I had her all wrong . I figured she 'd make all the trouble while we were at her house , and get it out of her system . She had plenty of reason to get sore then . FRANK WILSON You mean rejecting all her ideas ? JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah . And the way we did it . The time I said to her , " Stick to your dancing , Mabel . " p. 128 FRANK WILSON I did n't hear you say that . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah . Remember when she wanted you to take out " frigid " , and she was holding that piece of paper over the waste basket . FRANK WILSON Sure . And you took all her notes and dropped them in the basket . JOE RASMUSSEN That 's when I said " Stick to your dancing , Mabel " . FRANK WILSON I guess I did n't hear what you said because I was waiting to see what she 'd do . JOE RASMUSSEN So was I. And what did she do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did something . She rescued her notes from the waste basket . JOE RASMUSSEN But she never mentioned them again . That 's where I was stupid . I 'm not used to being around dames like Joyce , not in the home , not socially . My women are all the same . I like them saftig , noisy , belligerent , and playful . And heavy sleepers . FRANK WILSON Of the earth , earthy . JOE RASMUSSEN Yeah , but that was about a man . Ai n't that from the Bible ? I want a broad that 's a woman , female , not feminine . Like Angle , and Shirley Tanner , and sixty-five others all like them . Angie never holds a grudge . But this Chilton dame , she had us in her house for three weeks , for God 's sake . The perfect hostess , and all the while she was waiting till we got on this stage , to teach us a lesson in high-powered butchery . Well , are you learning ? p. 129 FRANK WILSON Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never want to be a director . JOE RASMUSSEN I never want to be a writer . I could n't stand it , to watch a dame screwing up my lines by giving them the wrong reading . FRANK WILSON She may get over it . Do n't give up . JOE RASMUSSEN Give up ? I 'd cut my throat before I gave up . I got two reasons I wo n't give up . The first reason , I got an idea , Frank , that this whole thing is my fault . I knew too much . I was a wise guy . I advised you to stay out of the hay with this dame till after we opened in New York . FRANK WILSON You did . JOE RASMUSSEN I did n't want the changes in your play dictated from a pillow in the Boston Ritz , remember ? FRANK WILSON ( nodding ) : Very well . JOE RASMUSSEN But if I had to do over again , Frank , I 'd tell you to jump in the kip with her , the first night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a nice reception while she was all excited . And that 's what she was excited about , Frank . A dame like Joyce do n't get excited about any play . Not that excited , enough to give up her trip to Europe . Going over she suddenly realized she wanted to sleep with you , so that 's what she came home to do . And I loused it up . And she knew I loused it up , and that 's why she 's giving me a bad time now . p. 130 FRANK WILSON Joe , that 's all very complimentary , but you could be just as wrong about her now as you were before . JOE RASMUSSEN I do n't think so . I think this is pretty good second-guessing . FRANK WILSON No , Joe . I think she meant it when she said she loves me dearly , and that means Platonic . JOE RASMUSSEN There 's no such thing as Platonic . Not if you got all your equipment . FRANK WILSON I did n't say it was Platonic with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house detective . Platonic is no place to go . Platonic is an ugly dame that do n't appeal to you  --  but six months on the polar ice cap and that ugly dame begins to look pretty good . That 's what I think of Platonic . FRANK WILSON I 'm inclined to agree with you . But Platonic is also the wrong time and the wrong place . Her house last month was the wrong time and the wrong place . JOE RASMUSSEN I 'd like to think so , to get myself off the hook . FRANK WILSON You said you had another reason for not wanting to give up on Joyce . JOE RASMUSSEN ( slowly ) : A good reason . The best reason , as far as I 'm concerned . You know who Joyce 's public is ? They 're the people that really get a bang out of Lynn Fontanne looking the way she does at her age . They 're the people that wish Ina Claire would come back to the theatre . They 're the people that cry when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that write in for tickets as soon as they see the first ad for a play by Rattigan or Coward . I 'm not talking about the opening-night people , and I 'm not only talking about women . I 'm talking about men and women , that saw Helen Hayes in Coquette , and Gertie Lawrence in Oh , Kay ! Vivienne Segal in Pal Joey . Not art people . Oh , a little arty , maybe . They like to say Shavian when Shaw 's name comes up , and maybe they heard about Stanislavski . But I 'm talking about men and women I see at the summer theatres and I never see them in the Broadway houses . They started going to the theatre when their parents took them to the Hippodrome , and they saw Joley and Ed Wynn , and Clark and McCullough . They were Theatre Guild subscribers , and they always read Robert Benchley. p. 131 FRANK WILSON You amaze me . JOE RASMUSSEN I know I do . And I know why . My reputation is for directing nose-pickers and arse-scratchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were good plays , too , some of them , although let 's face it . Tobacco Road , which opened in 1933 , paved the way , you might say . Then we had Odets and the Odets imitators . When I was at Harvard I wrote a play that was such a steal from Awake and Sing ! that I got embarrassed and called it a parody . But it was n't Odets , it was pure Rasmussen , which is crap . Crap , crap , crap . Dreadful . Then I worked in radio and was assistant stage manager and finally got to be a director . And a success . I 'm a success . But the theatre is n't all nose-pickers and arse-scratchers , any more than it 's all Shakespeare . I was one of those that helped to tie a can to Philip Barry and S. N. Behrman . We drove them out of the theatre , with their society comedies and Valentina dresses . But now I want them back , Frank . I want you to become a modern version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people that go to see Joyce Chilton . Do you know what the word theatre means ? In Greek ? It comes from the word  --  I can spell it but I ca n't pronounce it . Theta epsilon alpha omicron theta alpha iota . It means to see , to view . That 's all it means . When I looked that up it frightened me . You know why ? Because those bastards I used to work for do n't know it , but they have a legitimate right to call that box a theatre ! Will you ever call your TV set a theatre ? p. 132 FRANK WILSON No . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , we better be careful or it 's the only theatre we 'll have left . So I 'm not going to give up on Joyce Chilton , and I 'm not going to give up on you . Let 's go eat , so we 'll have the strength to cope with that bitch . CURTAIN p. 133 Act 3 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO The same bare stage , a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes but now they are wearing a dress and a suit ; the coat of SIDNEY 'S suit is hanging on one of the chairs , along with his necktie . JOE and FRANK are sitting in approximately the same places as before , but now their playscripts are resting on top of identical attach cases . JOE and FRANK are wearing the pants of suits , and the jackets are hanging on the backs of their chairs . SIDNEY and JOYCE are in the midst of a scene from the play . JOYCE CHILTON ( as Sandra ) : " It may be just as bad as before , Larry . " SIDNEY RENWICK ( as Larry ) : " I know that , Sandra . " JOYCE CHILTON " I do n't think I 've changed . " SIDNEY RENWICK " I did n't want you to change . I only wanted you to change back to what you were in the beginning . " JOE looks up at JOYCE . JOYCE CHILTON ( to JOE ) : You 're not going to make me read the last line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know damn well why not . You 've been around the theatre long enough to know . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to FRANK ) : It 's supposed to be bad luck to say the last line in rehearsal . FRANK WILSON nods ; he knows that . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to JOYCE ) : That 's a superstition I ca n't afford . JOYCE CHILTON I 've never said the last line in rehearsal , all the years I 've been in the theatre . And I 'm not going to start now . God knows , we need all the luck we can get . JOE RASMUSSEN We could fix that . With Frank 's permission , we could give Sidney the last line . JOYCE CHILTON Sidney would n't read the line either . Would you , Sidney ? SIDNEY would give everything to have the last line , does not want to go against JOE , but is even more fearful of going against JOYCE . SIDNEY RENWICK Joe , if she feels so strongly ? JOE RASMUSSEN All right , Sidney . JOYCE CHILTON I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the bitchery and skulduggery , to try to bribe an artist by giving him a line that belongs to another fellow-artist . That 's a new low . Sidney , no matter what happens , I want to say in front of these two gentlemen , and for anybody else that 's listening , that took guts . SIDNEY shrugs , not wishing to take bows for something he may regret , and not eager to give further offence to JOE and FRANK . p. 135 JOE RASMUSSEN Well , Sidney , she seems to be implying that she did n't think you had any . But you two can discuss that between yourselves . ( To JOYCE and SIDNEY and including FRANK ) : I always give reasons for things . Miss Chilton , I wanted you to say that last line because this is n't pantomime . I wanted you to say the line so that you could feel it and act it , and I want to see how you feel it and act it . I wanted to hear your voice when you speak the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in Boston . JOE RASMUSSEN Will I ? If I 'm in the last row of the balcony will I hear your voice ? JOYCE CHILTON I can be heard in the Winter Garden , and without a microphone . Nobody has any trouble hearing me . I 'm an actress . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , that 's what we hired . JOYCE CHILTON Now you just watch your step , Mr. Joe Rasmussen . I 've taken an awful lot from you . I could go to Equity right now with some of the things you 've said to me these last couple of weeks . JOE RASMUSSEN But you wo n't , will you , Miss Chilton ? How many times you been late for rehearsal ? How long 'd it take you to get up in the part ? And calling me a bastard in front of actors and stagehands and electricians . ( He pulls out a notebook . ) I not only got the dates here , I got the actual times you called me insulting names . So you do n't want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . But let 's not make any more threats about going to Equity . All right . We do n't read the last line , and congratulations on your guts , Sidney . So ends our last rehearsal in New York City . ( Looks at notebook . ) The entire company meets tomorrow afternoon at two'clock in the theatre in Boston . We 're not going to be able to rehearse in the theatre tomorrow , because they 'll be hanging scenery , but the next day we 're going to have a run-through starting three o'clock in the afternoon , with scenery and costumes . ( From out front , stepping over the orchestra pit , now appears STANLEY STANTON . ) Oh , what the hell . STANTON is buoyant , full of good will , with the Madison Avenue hearty smile . p. 136 STANLEY STANTON Joe , I know you 'll forgive this little intrusion . You 've got to admit I 've been pretty punctilious about respecting your wishes . This is the first time I 've set foot in the theatre since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just heard that I  --   --  JOE RASMUSSEN How longa you been here , Mr. Stanton ? STANLEY STANTON I just got here . Why ? JOE RASMUSSEN I just wondered . STANLEY STANTON We 're having a run-through the day after tomorrow ? What about tomorrow ? JOE RASMUSSEN ( relieved at this indication that STANTON has not been in the theatre long enough to have listened to the spat with JOYCE ) : Tomorrow we meet at two o'clock , at the theatre . But they 'll be hanging scenery , so we wo n't be able to rehearse . It 's just a meeting of the company . STANLEY STANTON I see . Well , I was hoping the entire company would still be here when I got here this afternoon , but I 'll save my little speech for tomorrow then . However , it wo n't do any harm to  --   --  JOE puts a cigarette in his mouth and STANLEY lights it . JOE thanks him . STANLEY STANTON My pleasure . As I say , it wo n't do any harm to say these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this production . Our gracious star , Joyce Chilton . Our excellent leading man , Sidney . Our famous author , Frank Wilson , and last but not least the man responsible for whipping the whole production into shape . p. 137 JOYCE CHILTON Did you say whipping , Stanley ? STANLEY STANTON ( forced laughter ) : Well , yes , but perhaps that was an unfortunate turn of phrase . If so , Joe , I apologize , although I 've always heard that you 're a stern taskmaster . Heh heh heh . I 'll only keep you a moment longer . I just wanted to say that in my opinion we 've got a smashing good company and a smashing good script , as the English say . And while keeping all our fingers crossed , I 'd almost be willing to bet that we have a smashing big hit . I was hoping we 'd be able to open in Detroit because I was born in Lansing , Michigan , and I 'd have packed the house with relatives , also friends , but our director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe , I 've gone along with all your suggestions whenever I could . Joyce is going to be the best-dressed actress on Broadway . Not that she has n't always been , but this time I have reason to know that she 's the most expensively dressed one too . Heh heh . I 'm taking a full-page ad in next Sunday 's Times and Tribune , two full-page ads , and I understand both papers are sending reporters up to Boston for interviews with our author and our director . As you know , Life magazine had photographers all over the place last week , taking pictures , but from past experience I do n't count too much on them . They certainly throw their money around . p. 138 FRANK WILSON Not to mention their weight . STANLEY STANTON Yes , that 's true , Frank , but publicity is publicity , and a good spread in Life is worth the inconvenience . What else did I have in mind ? Oh , yes . I 'm letting Harper 's Bazaar have an exclusive on Joyce 's costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show would like to do some tape interviews with you and Joe . By the way , I 'm budgeting I-won't-say-how-much for spot announcements on radio when we open in New York , and I 'm working out a tentative deal for some local commercials on TV . And speaking of TV , Joyce , I told the people on the Jack Paar show that you 'd agreed to appear the night we open in New York . I hope all your accommodations please you in Boston . Those here now will be at the Ritz , of course . I got a separate room for Mrs. Rasmussen , Joe , as you requested . Joyce , there 'll be a limousine to meet you at the Back Bay station tonight and it 'll be at your disposal while we 're in Boston . JOYCE CHILTON Oh , thank you , Stanley . You did n't have to do that . STANLEY STANTON My pleasure . Oh , and Joe , I had a very nice letter from that Professor at Harvard , thanking me for the opening night seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if you have time . JOE RASMUSSEN For him I 'll make time . p. 139 STANLEY STANTON Well , I have to catch a plane , and I guess the rest of you have things to do before you take the train . So  --  good luck to all of us , and see you in Beantown tomorrow . ( He leaves through the wings , to a chorus of thank-yous and good-byes . ) JOE RASMUSSEN Ben Bernie used to have a gag , he 'd say I want to introduce Colonel Mannie Prager , our arranger . He arranges the chairs . I hope you took notice , Frank . He mentioned everything but your play , so that ought a keep you from getting a swelled head.Sidney , what 's the matter ? SIDNEY RENWICK I do n't know . All of a sudden I want to be sick . It always happens just before I open in a show . As soon as I get the feeling that we 're really going to face an audience . I 'll be all right . JOE RASMUSSEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so will you , God damn it . JOYCE CHILTON ( unreconciled ) : Thank you . If there 's nothing else ? JOE RASMUSSEN ( to FRANK ) : You got anything to say to the star ? FRANK WILSON ( rising ) : See you tomorrow in Boston . You too , Sidney . p. 140 SIDNEY RENWICK Do n't worry about me . JOE RASMUSSEN You had your appendix out ? SIDNEY RENWICK When I was fifteen . JOE RASMUSSEN Good . So long . SIDNEY and JOYCE depart . JOE RASMUSSEN " They make a handsome couple . " That 's a line from your play . FRANK WILSON And not a very good line . I 've been thinking about taking it out . JOE RASMUSSEN Leave it in . It 's a morale-builder . Joyce and Sidney are standing in the wings when the maid reads that line , and they love to hear it . They always listen for it . Opening night it may even get a hand from loyal Joyce Chilton fans . How do you feel , Frank ? FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RASMUSSEN You 'll never feel this way again . FRANK WILSON How do you mean , Joe ? I do n't really feel anything . JOE RASMUSSEN That 's what I mean . All what you 've been going through the last four or five months  --  getting somebody to produce your play , casting the play , signing the director , little announcements in the papers , you and me working together , starting rehearsals , our troubles with Joyce , and that irritating bastard Stanton  --  all that is nothing . You remember those thirteen weeks basic in the Army ? That 's all that this amounts to up to now . You 're through with your basic , and it turns out to be nothing , does n't it ? You do n't really feel anything . p. 141 FRANK WILSON That 's right . JOE RASMUSSEN Well , I 'll tell you what 's gon na happen . Twenty-four hours from now , this time tomorrow , you 'll be in another city , and New York will seem like some place a thousand miles away that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meeting tomorrow afternoon , in a theatre where you 've probably never been before . A lot of men will be working , hanging scenery . They wo n't know you , and you wo n't know them . But some time during the afternoon you 'll think to yourself , " Here 's seven or eight men come from New York to Boston , what for ? To hang scenery for my play . My play . Guys I do n't know and never expect to know , but they 're getting damn good pay and they come all the way to Boston to hang scenery for my play . " Then you 'll look around at the people in the company . A bunch of well-known actors and actresses , they 're here in Boston because I wrote a play . A big star like Joyce Chilton is in Boston because I wrote a play . Then maybe you go out in the lobby of the theatre and there 's two or three people near the ticket window , and you hear somebody say , " Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " And you think to yourself , " My God , they know about my play already . There 's a woman from Dorchester , wants to go to the Saturday matine . " You go to your room at the hotel , you look in the Boston papers and you see the ads . Your play . All this time in New York you never realized that Boston knew about your play . You go down to the dining-room for dinner . The head waiter wo n't know you , but over near the window Joyce and probably Sidney and Stanton will be having dinner , and people will be staring at them . " That 's Joyce Chilton . That 's Sidney Renwick . " Slowly it dawns on you . All of Boston knows about your play . Never mind if a lot of them are still on vacation . It 's a big town . Anybody on Beacon Hill wants to go to the theatre , they 're going to see your play . If the president of Harvard wants to go to the theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed you wo n't be able to sleep . You 'll lie there thinking back on how it all started with an idea you had five years ago . You 'll go through embarrassment , humility , pride , apprehension . And finally you 'll get to sleep . But after tomorrow , whenever you see the word theatre in print , you 're going to react . No matter what happens with this play , for the rest of your life you 're stuck . You 're hooked . Today , now , while I 'm talking to you , you 're not hooked yet . But after tomorrow in Boston you 'll never be the same . You 're like a virgin , like a sophomore in his first varsity game . Well , virgin , enjoy your last moments of innocence . And I want to say this , Frank , I want to welcome you to the fold . You 've seen what it 's like , and a lot of it is disgusting to a guy like yourself , with ideals and ethics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you do n't get so disgusted that you 'll give up . You wo n't . When you go out in the lobby and hear that woman from Dorchester . " Can you let me have two nice seats for the Saturday matine ? " Brahms , my friend . Beethoven 's Ninth . Tchaikovsky 's Romeo and Juliet . ( He hums and pantomimes playing the fiddle through the Tchaikovsky . ) The sweetest music there is . " Two nice seats for the Saturday matine. " p. 142 FRANK WILSON I have a present for you , Joe . I was going to save it for Boston , but I think I 'll give it to you now . ( He opens his attach case and takes out a small parcel and hands it to JOE , who shows pleasure while opening it . ) JOE RASMUSSEN A present . If there 's anything I like to get it 's a present . This for me ? Me with a gold cigarette case ? You 're out of your mind . You crazy son of a bitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it says . JOE RASMUSSEN " To Joe Rasmussen , who took me for a dip in the Champagne Pool . " You remembered that ? The champagne pool . You know , Frank , I never had one of these , and I never wanted one till now . But I 'll never part with this . Thanks . FRANK WILSON You 're welcome , Joe . JOE looks down at the case , looks up at FRANK , then suddenly turns away and walks briskly offstage , for once inarticulate . FRANK watches him until he is out of sight , then stands alone in the centre of the stage , facing up , and slowly turns his head from left to right , gazing at the bare walls , taking in the flies , etc . CURTAIN p. 143 Act 3 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE FRANK 'S sitting-room in the Boston hotel . Late on opening night . At rise the door at Right is opened and FRANK allows ANGELA to pass in ahead of him . She is quietly well-dressed in a blue linen dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than previously . She takes out a cigarette , which FRANK lights for her . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Thank you . FRANK WILSON My pleasure . Good God ! Did you hear that ? That 's what association with Stanton will do . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I hope we 're not going to have him here . FRANK WILSON No . Joe 's the only one I 'm expecting here . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE What time did you say the papers come out ? FRANK WILSON We 'll get the first review in about a half an hour , I think . How about a drink ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I do n't think so , thanks . All right . If it 'll give you something to do . A light Scotch and soda , or plain water , whatever you have . FRANK prepares her drink . FRANK WILSON Have you been through a lot of these ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I guess about five . Maybe six . I think five out of town , and one play Joe opened cold in New York . p. 144 FRANK WILSON Then you 've really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Or even more . Philadelphia , New Haven , Washington . You know , some plays Joe 's had , tried out in three or four towns before New York . Wilmington . Princeton . FRANK WILSON So then it 's an old story to you . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE No . It 's never an old story . You do the same things and say the same things , every time , but it 's a new story every time . FRANK WILSON Yes , I guess it would be if you have a rooting interest in the show . Have you ever written any plays ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE About thirty-five . Plays come easy to me , because there 's never the slightest possibility that any of them will ever get produced , so I can write a play in the time it takes me to write a poem . The kind of playwriting I do is really very enjoyable . When you write a play , you have to think of the sets , and the limitations of the theatre . But you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , I wrote a play in which the stage would have to be two miles deep . FRANK WILSON Two miles ? From the apron to the wall ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE No wall . In my play , this particular play , in the fifth act  --  p. 145 FRANK WILSON The fifth act ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE It 's an eight-act play and each act is two hours long , except the fifth act . That 's a little longer . That takes longer because , as the act begins , you see , or you 're supposed to see , General Sheridan in the distance . His horse drops dead and he has to walk the last two miles . Naturally it 's in verse . FRANK WILSON Well , naturally . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE It 's a sort of serious parody of Thomas Buchanan Read 's poem . I wrote another play that shows the orchestra in Radio City Music Hall , you know how it comes up on an elevator ? FRANK WILSON Yes . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Well , in this play , the elevator does n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it 's out of sight . A kind of a switch on the Sheridan play . Naturally that 's with music . The orchestra keeps playing Poet and Peasant until you ca n't hear it any more . FRANK WILSON Your plays would present production problems ANGELA KIRKBRIDE So much so , that I have no such problems . Once I wrote a play in three acts . A conventional play about incest . But then I copied it all down in reverse . You know , for instance a line of dialogue that went , " How are you today , my dear ? " became , " Dear my today you , are how ? " You 'd be astonished at the rhythms I got . I think I could very easily learn to talk backwards . We all ought to try it . It would make us think before we speak . p. 146 FRANK WILSON It would , would n't it ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Yes , it would slow down communication , which is becoming much too rapid . One of the great troubles with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She smiles . ) Now , of course , you wish the Boston papers would communicate a little faster . FRANK WILSON Yes , I do . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I do n't think you have anything to worry about . FRANK WILSON You do n't ? Why ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I have ways of telling when a play 's going to be a hit . FRANK WILSON Well , I wish you 'd tell me . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE They would n't make sense to you . They do n't to Joe . FRANK WILSON I 'd still like to know what they are . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Well  --  if somebody starts coughing and the audience glare at him , that play is going to fold . FRANK WILSON I would have thought the opposite . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE That 's Joe 's reaction . But you 're both wrong . If they glare at the cougher they 're only looking for an excuse to be distracted . If they really cared about the play they 'd strain their ears to listen to the actors and the hell with the cougher. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you explain it . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE ( continuing ) I 'm not as a rule favourably impressed when there are cries of " Author , author . " FRANK WILSON Why not ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE You and I left the theatre too soon , so we do n't know whether there were any tonight . But when the audience calls for the author , they 're thinking . A play should n't start them thinking so soon . They should be applauding the actors , not the author . They should still be identifying with the actors , the characters in the play , not the intellect that created them . On an opening night the author has about the same standing as the groom at a big society wedding . Who needs him ? I think you have a hit because frankly , when I read your play , it sort of lay there , flat . But with the actors playing it , tonight , especially Miss Joyce Chilton , I liked it . And is n't that the purpose of a play ? The hell with how flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those actors take over . You may not think much of that theory , but wait till you 've been around a while . There is a knock on the door . FRANK WILSON The morning papers ! ANGELA KIRKBRIDE No , that 's Joe . FRANK opens the door , and it is JOE . He has a sloppily folded newspaper in his hand , which he tosses into a chair . ANGELA and FRANK both go to retrieve it . p. 148 JOE RASMUSSEN Nothing in there about us . Yogi hit two home runs . One with one on , one with two . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Who wants to hear about baseball at a time like this ? JOE RASMUSSEN What are you drinkin ' ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE A light Scotch and soda . FRANK WILSON Do n't pick on her , Joe . She 's been a godsend to me , getting my mind off the play . Do n't think I do n't appreciate it , Angela . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE You knew that 's what I was doing ? FRANK WILSON Of course I knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheridan . JOE RASMUSSEN Richard Brinsley Sheridan ? FRANK WILSON Phil . JOE RASMUSSEN There was another Richard Brinsley Sheridan . You ever know that ? He was a West Point football player and got killed in the Yale game . Who is Phil Sheridan ? I do n't place him ( Not waiting for an answer ) : How about that Joyce ? Did she give a performance , or did n't she ? FRANK WILSON Angela was just saying . JOE RASMUSSEN ( to ANGELA ) How did the cough test work ? I did n't notice any coughers tonight . My wife has this test . p. 149 FRANK WILSON I know . She told me . JOE RASMUSSEN You mean you two were just talking ? Not even a little necking ? I would n't be sore , Frank . If I was alone on opening night with a dame like Angie , the only thing 'd distract me would be a little necking . You know , around the edges , so to speak . Opening nights do n't count . Opening nights , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , Frank . He would n't have minded . Neither would I. FRANK WILSON ( half seriously ) Now you 're telling me . No , you did enough for me , Angela . JOE RASMUSSEN Frank , you did n't answer my question . FRANK WILSON Which question was that , Joe ? JOE RASMUSSEN How about Joyce ? Did she come through , or did n't she ? FRANK WILSON She certainly did . JOE RASMUSSEN If you 're gon na hand out any more gold cigarette cases , you better order one for her . Just on the strength of tonight 's performance . God damm it she was a trouper . As late as yesterday she was still going up in her lines in two scenes . But not tonight . Word perfect , and I caught the second act from a last-row seat in the balcony . Heard every word , beautifully modulated . p. 150 FRANK WILSON She was wonderful . JOE RASMUSSEN Did you stay for the final curtain ? FRANK WILSON I could n't , Joe . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE RASMUSSEN Then you did n't see the curtain calls . You know what that dame did ? You know how we rehearsed the curtain calls ? The whole cast , then Joyce and Sidney , then Joyce alone ? She would n't take a call alone . She grabbed hold of Sidney 's hand and would n't go on if he did n't go on with her . FRANK WILSON No kidding ? ANGELA KIRKBRIDE Joyce Chilton ? JOE RASMUSSEN Joyce Chilton . ( All three are silent , thinking about this phenomenon . They raise their eyebrows , then shrug it off . ) She 's coming here . FRANK WILSON Here ? JOE RASMUSSEN She told me she wanted to thank you , and where would you be ? You do n't mind , do you ? FRANK WILSON Hell , no . I chickened out , and I want to apologize for not going backstage . A knock at the door . JOE RASMUSSEN That 'll be Joyce . Now let 's give her a good hand , let 's go all out . He opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and standing behind her is SIDNEY , slightly in a fog but grinning . Led by JOE , FRANK and ANGELA applaud and cry " Brava ! Bravissima ! " and JOYCE makes a slow entrance . She goes to FRANK and kisses him on the cheek , then to JOE and rubs her cheek against his . SIDNEY hangs back , still foggy , still grinning . p. 151 JOYCE CHILTON One of the great nights of my life , Frank . Joe . Thank you both . And thank this man , too . She points to Sidney . JOE RASMUSSEN ( politely and somewhat perfunctorily ) Sidney , you were great . FRANK WILSON ( as restrained as JOE ) Yes , you really were , Sidney . SIDNEY RENWICK Hell , the part was actor-proof . His remark is lost in the next speech . JOYCE CHILTON Stanley said he 'd wait and bring the papers . JOE RASMUSSEN At last , a use for Stanley . I knew we needed him for something . There is an insistent banging on the door , and JOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STANLEY STANTON Here they are . I grabbed these off the truck , literally . JOE RASMUSSEN How are they ? STANLEY STANTON Do n't know . Have n't had a chance to read them . He starts distributing them : one to JOYCE , one to JOE , one to FRANK , and keeps one for himself . There are no more , which leaves SIDNEY and ANGELA paperless . The others flip through the pages to the review , and start reading it silently to themselves . Almost simultaneously all four look up and across the room at SIDNEY , then back to their papers , then up at SIDNEY again , who is gazing at them with a half-hopeful , half-apprehensive fixed grin on his face . The first to speak is JOE . p. 152 JOE RASMUSSEN Ho-ly Ka-zan ! Joyce . You wanta read it ? JOYCE CHILTON If I can without crying . Crying for joy , that is . By Malcolm Parker . He 's the one that was supposed to get Atkinson 's job on the Times . Very tough . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce , will you read the God damn notice ? JOYCE CHILTON By Malcolm Parker . " The news this morning is all good , for not only has the enterprising Stanley Stanton persuaded Frank Wilson , best-selling novelist , to write , and the captivating Miss Joyce Chilton to act in , the interesting new play at the Plymouth theatre , but he has also lured the hard-hitting Joe Rasmussen to abandon the monotony of his recent work . " ( She pauses , and she , and the others who have been reading with her , look up and slowly look across at SIDNEY , who is grinning and hanging on every word . She continues . ) " But as if those blessings were not enough , Boston theatregoers were treated last night to one of the finest , most sensitive , knowledgeable performances it ever has been this reviewer 's privilege to witness . Not since the late lamented Walter Huston has an actor taken over a play with such quiet authority as was demonstrated by Mr. Sidney Renwick in the new offering by Mr. Wilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of adequate performances in drawing-room comedies , proves un-mistakably this reviewer 's oft-repeated contention that Broadway type-casting is one of the greatest obstacles to progress in the theatre today . Under Mr. Rasmussen 's surprisingly deft direction , Mr. Renwick 's interpretation of Larry Worthington , a confused and questioning modern husband , could not be improved upon . In plain language , Mr. Renwick is exactly right , and he has carved out a new career for himself after years of wasting his talents on frothy , light comedy . Miss Joyce Chilton  --   --  " ( JOYCE halts her reading . ) I ca n't go on . Somebody else take over . ( She looks at SIDNEY , who has covered his face with his hands. ) p. 153 JOE RASMUSSEN ( to no one in particular ) You want me to take over ? All right . Happy to . " Miss Joyce Chilton , ever a favourite in Boston as elsewhere , plays Sandra , the wife of Larry Worthington , with the sure incisiveness that we have come to expect of this actress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience , Miss Chilton adds another faultless performance to her list of successes . She plays without the brittleness that in this reviewer 's opinion has marred some of her other characterizations . A new warmth has been infused , without which the character Sandra Worthington would have been wholly un-sympathetic . Miss Chilton 's graciousness extended even to the curtain calls following last night 's opening , when , obviously at her insistence , Mr. Renwick was literally pulled on stage . Miss Chilton stood to one side and led the applause for her fellow-artist . Although a newcomer to the theatre , Mr. Wilson writes with  --   --  " FRANK WILSON Joe , if you do n't mind . JOE RASMUSSEN I want to read it . FRANK WILSON No , please do n't . This is their night . All are looking at SIDNEY . JOYCE is sitting on his lap , holding his head to her bosom . SIDNEY RENWICK I do n't know what to say . p. 154 JOE RASMUSSEN ( humorously ) Frank , quick . Think of something for him to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILSON I 'm trying to think of something for myself to say . Thanks to all of you does n't seem enough . SIDNEY RENWICK If half of what Malcolm Parker says is true , who directed me ? Who wrote the play ? And this girl  --  this is n't the first time I cried on her shoulder , and right here in this town . You remember , Joyce ? JOYCE CHILTON I could n't forget that , Sidney . ANGELA KIRKBRIDE I 've got a sensible suggestion . Joyce , why do n't you and Sidney get the hell out of here where you belong ? JOYCE CHILTON ( rising ) Come on , Sidney . She 's right . He puts his arm around her shoulder and they leave quietly , no one speaks . STANLEY STANTON ( slapping the review with the tips of his fingers and shaking his head ) I 'll be a son of a bitch . JOE RASMUSSEN Louse up your plans , Stanton ? STANLEY STANTON Well , yes . It does . JOE RASMUSSEN Why do n't you take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . p. 155 STANLEY STANTON Oh , hell , that would be cheap . ( He looks at the newspaper squinting a little ) Roberta Sloane . The girl that plays the maid . Do you happen to know where she 's staying , Joe ? JOE RASMUSSEN She 's at the Brunswick . Good luck . STANLEY STANTON ( rising ) Well , people , I guess all I can say is thanks , too . JOE RASMUSSEN Nothing really , Stanton . Nothing but a small fortune . STANLEY STANTON Yeah . Well , good night , all . JOE RASMUSSEN ( looking at FRANK and at ANGELA ) We got an odd number here , and that 's no way to celebrate . You like that Roberta Sloane , do n't you , Frank ? FRANK WILSON ( annoyed ) Yes . She 's pretty cute . Why did you have to tell Stanton  --   --  JOE RASMUSSEN All I did was send him to the Brunswick . FRANK WILSON That 's what I mean .
