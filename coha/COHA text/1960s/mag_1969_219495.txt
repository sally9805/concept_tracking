HORN by D. Keith Mano. 337 pages . Houghfon Mifflin. $5.95 . <P> If Dante were alive today , he might well add another circle in the lower depths of his Inferno . Inhabiting this new pit of horror would be the warring Negro leaders of Harlem and the meddling white man who tries to understand them . It is just such a journey into hell that D. Keith Mano , a white author , describes with Dantesque fervor in his second novel , Horn . <P> Mano 's narrator is Calvin Beecher Pratt , a timid , fat , white Episcopal priest who leaves a cloistered , scholarly life to take over a crumbling empty church in the imagined Harlem of the 1970s . There Pratt becomes inextricably involved with an anti-white Negro organization called the Horn Power Movement and its dynamic but tormented leader , George Horn Smith . Middleweight champion of the world , orator , professed illiterate and economic genius , Smith is a man possessed of a freakish protuberance-an eleven-inch horn jutting from his forehead . <P> Despite his improbable appendage and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X and Eldridge Cleaver-Smith as a character is most extraordinary for his recognizable human qualities and frailties . Behind Horn Smith 's power and hatred there is a person who desperately needs the recognition and sympathy even of a self-consciously inadequate white priest . Yet the fact that Pratt and Smith somehow strike up something that can be construed as friendship is remarkable . The unusual results of their mutual " needs " raise the novel above the level of an otherwise purely allegorical tale of ghetto politics . <P> Pratt is subjected to all sorts of torments . He is psychologically humiliated at an anti-white Horn Power demonstration and is badly beaten up by a deranged Episcopal priest , whose own congregation , at Horn 's command , has deserted him for Pratt 's church . At a floor-by-floor , six-story orgy staged by Horn , Pratt is exposed to blatant homosexuals , naked prostitutes , hallucinatory drugs . Then one of Horn 's co-workers and antagonists threatens to blind and castrate him . Finally , the cowering priest is coated with pitch and thrown naked out into the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who expresses an almost sadistic pride in Pratt 's endurance of these humiliations-as if Horn were God putting Pratt as Job through a test of his dedication . <P> His body burned free of all its hair , Pratt 's mind verges on madness . Though he has survived these trials , Pratt still lives in fear and trembling of Horn and his apocalyptic world . And in the end , when someone attempts to kill Horn , it is Pratt who tries to protect him . Secluded in the bowels of Pratt 's church , where Horn has maintained a secret hideout for years , the two men finally reveal themselves to each other . Pratt has always been a misfit-he says-though he does have the courage to admit his fears and weakness . Horn emerges as a dabbler in medieval studies and essentially a moderate leader , doomed to be destroyed by more brutal and extremist forces . These exchanged confidences , however , offer no comfort .
