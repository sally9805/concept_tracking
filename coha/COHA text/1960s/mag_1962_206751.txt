Not long ago , chicken was a costly delicacy in Europe ; it was said that the European workingman ate a chicken only when either he or the bird was sick . Now chicken is common fare , and not just on Sunday . Much of the credit belongs to U.S. chicken farmers , who have brought down prices from Antwerp to Zurich by delivering frozen broilers to Europe at 30.5 a lb . Last year the intake of chicken rose 23% in West Germany alone . Demand for chicken expanded briskly in the rest of Europe , and U.S. farmers , with shipments worth $45 million , grabbed nearly half of the import market . <P> That 's when the great chicken war began . The Dutch accused the U.S. of dumping chickens in Europe at prices below cost of production . In Bavaria and Westphalia , protectionist German farmers ' associations stormed that U.S. chickens are artificially fattened with arsenic and should be banned . The French government did ban U.S. chickens , using the excuse that they are fattened with estrogen . With typical Gallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on male virility. * <P> Berlin &; Broilers . The Common Market is making every effort to shoo away the U.S. chickens . A new rule effective last July fixes minimum prices on poultry entering the market , and each of the six member nations is also permitted to tack on a tax pegged to domestic poultry production costs . The minimum price set for U.S. broilers is 33.3 a lb. , and the West German supplemental tax adds another 9.7 . To make matters worse , the Common Market this month imposed an arbitrary surcharge of 2.8 on broilers . All this boosts delivery prices of U.S. chickens by as much as 50% . Since August , U.S. exporters have lost 25% of their chicken business in the Common Market . <P> The U.S. has begun to react to these fowl blows . In Geneva , Senator J. William Fulbright from chicken-fat Arkansas interrupted a debate over nuclear weapons for NATO forces to protest Continental hostility to U.S. chickens . Conferring with Konrad Adenauer about Berlin this month , John Kennedy also brought up broilers . In Brussels two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are not going to see our proper and historic export markets lightly taken away from us . ' ' <P> The Bigger Fight . The great chicken war is only the opening blast in a larger crisis in trade relations between the U.S. and the Common Market . The U.S. sells 10% of its farm produce abroad , and one-third of that total-or $1.1 billion worth - usually goes to Common Market nations . The Common Market has made no secret that it is moving toward broadly higher agricultural tariffs to protect small , inefficient European farmers . Last week a panel of U.S. economists reported to Congress that U.S. farm exports to Europe may shrink as much as 30% by 1970 . Heaviest losses are expected to be in rice , wheat , feed grains-and poultry . <P> The U.S. is prepared to take countermeasures . " We did not come here to threaten , " said Freeman in Brussels-and then he went on to threaten that the U.S. may boost some tariffs of its own if the Common Market does . But the newly potent Europeans appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets more than they need U.S. markets . <P>
