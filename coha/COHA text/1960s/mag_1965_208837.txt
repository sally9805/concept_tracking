Heading into another television season , American Broadcasting Co. ' s schedule is chockablock with new shows - Gidget , Tammy , Honey West , Jesse James , The FBI , and an everyday offscreen cliffhanger that might be called Keep Your Eye on Norton Simon . The California industrialist , who has broadened his Hunt Foods into a far-reaching company ( TIME cover , June 4 ) , has been a prime stockholder in ABC for more than two years . Last week it was disclosed that he has bought much more stock through Hunt and a subsidiary , McCall Corp. , boosting his stake from 6% to 9% of the outstanding shares . He owns 400,000 shares , which makes him ABC 's largest holder . <P> Bonanza . Simon 's investment is worth about $22 million at current prices , has been rapidly appreciating . Price of the stock has doubled in the past 18 months , and last week President Leonard Goldenson reported that the company 's first-half earnings rose 41% above the same period last year , to a record $7.6 million . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC under Goldenson 's gifted goading has risen to a point where it is neck-and-neck with NBC and CBS . Stockholder Simon has reason to appreciate the Goldenson touch , but may well be miffed at his aloofness . Last year Simon tried to get a seat or two on ABC 's board , only to be frustrated when Goldenson put through a bylaws change that ruled out cumulative voting . <P> Simon is never permanently put off-as was shown anew at the annual meeting of another company , Canada Dry . Though its directors had rebuffed his bid for a board seat just a year ago , he showed up last week not only as a director but also as a prominent spokesman at the meeting . Far from acting like the feisty raider that he is often accused of being , he gracefully accepted a statement by President Roy W. Moore Jr . that Canada Dry 's next quarterly earnings would drop because of a $3,000,000 outlay to promote a grapefruit drink named Wink . ( President Moore , sipping Wink while speaking , at one point let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wink ; it was me . " ) After the meeting , Simon said : " Canada Dry is doing exactly what it should be doing . " <P> Positive Feelings . So is ABC-so far . " I have no sense of urgency , " said Simon . " We will keep on buying so long as it is a good buy . " He insisted that he did not want a director 's seat ; that Goldenson " leaves me with quite positive feelings about ABC and its future . " Television executives , however , remembered the cases of McCall Corp . and Wheeling Steel , in which Simon followed the pattern of **30;0;TOOLONG upheaval . Goldenson seems secure in his job so long as ABC , in an industry that shifts more swiftly than sand , keeps its share of viewers . Whatever happens to Gidget , Tammy or Jesse James , ABC 's new behind-the-cameras show is certain to be quite a situation drama .
