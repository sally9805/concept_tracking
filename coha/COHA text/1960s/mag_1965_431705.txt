 | Lee Oswald 's Guilt : How Science Nailed Kennedy 's Killer Here 's an expert 's report of how modern technology and detective work solved the mystery surrounding the assassination of a President HE Warren Commission 's investigation of President Kennedy 's assassination involved the most extensive use of scientific aids in the history of crime detection . Ballistics , fingerprints , handwriting analysis ? even neutron analysis ? were used by the investigators to establish who the murderer was and ho ' ' . he fired the shots that killed the President . The task assigned to the commission was stupendous . More than 500 witnesses were questioned . Bullets , shells , documents , fibers , and clothing had to Ire examined and evaluated . The angle of fire , the speed of the automobile , the wounds suffered by the President and Governor John Connally of Texas became the objects of painstaking analysis . In spite of this massive job , the commission had one great advantage ? the chief suspect , Lee Harvey Oswald , was dead . This enabled the investigators to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fe 's testimony , for example . All the technical evidence considered in the Oswald case is admissible in court , but it is not all equally conclusive in providing proof . Some types of scientific evidence you can almost " hang your hat on " ; others you accept with varying degrees of reservation . I rate as most convincing : fingerprints and palm prints , followed closely by the examination of recovered bullets and fired cartridge cases to determine if they came from certain weapons . Next in order I svoulcl place the handwriting analysis of the various cards and documents belonging to Oswald , and finally , tests of the fibers found on the gun and in the bag in which the weapon had been carried . These all point directly to the murderer . But equally important is an analysis of the wounds inflicted upon the President and Governor to determine how many bullets struck @#  | them and the direction from which they came . Tied in with that was the use of surveying instruments and cameras to determine the angle of fire from the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting , and the experiments to determine the loss in velocity of the bullets after penetrating human tissue . Following his arrest , Oswald denied owning a rifle . When later his wife , Marina , said that he did and led police to the garage where it had been kept rolled in a blanket , the rifle was missing . It had been purchased by mail by an " A. Hidell , " and sent to P. O. Box 2915 , Dallas , Tex . The alias " A. Hidell , " or slight variations , was used by Oswald on several occasions . It was used on cards and posters when Oswald was active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans , on a spurious U. S. Marine Corps certificate of service found in Oswald 's wallet , on a draft card and other documents . Oswald once got his wife to sign a smallpox vaccination certificate " Dr. A. J. Hideel . " All the signatures were identified as Oswald 's , except the one signed by his wife . Photos and fibers . Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a revolver . While it is im-5 @# possible to state that the rifle is the used in the assassination , no differ : can be detected between it and the - found in the depository , except for sling . It was also established scientifically that this photo had been taken with Oswald 's camera by his wife . In addition , cloth fibers were found on the murder weapon . These were similar to the material in the shirt Oswald ? or , at the time of the killing . A palm print ? identified as Oswald 's ? was also found on . the underside of the barrel . The weapol bore the same serial number as the records of the sporting-goods dealer who sold it . As the presidential motorcade passed . two workmen were watching through open windows on the fifth floor of the depository , directly beneath the window where two eyewitnesses saw a man firing a rifle . The discharges made very loud reports and dislodged dust and other material , which fell from the ceiling on on ( of the fifth-floor spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rifle as it was reloaded after each shot and could also hear the ejected shell cases when they struck the floor above them . ( Three empty shells were later found in front of the sixth-floor window . The commission visited the fifth floor to verify the witnesses ' accounts . When a :  | @# rifle above them was " fired , " they distinctly heard the bolt action and the empty shells striking the floor . Fingerprints and palm prints . A bag made of brown wrapping paper and tape ? materials identical to those used in the depository 's shipping department ? was found close to the sixth-floor window . Oswald had the bag with him the morning of Nov. 22 , 1963 , when he left his wife 's home in Irving , Tex . He told a fellow employee , Buel W. Frazier , who drove him to work , that the bag contained curtain rods . Fingerprint experts recovered a print of Oswald 's left index finger and his right palm print from the bag . The palm print was at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain rods . Some fibers found inside the bag were similar to those taken from the blanket the rifle had been wrapped in . But there were too few for a fiber expert to be positive they came from that source . However , the commission was convinced Oswald carried the disassembled rifle in the bag . Oswald 's palm print was found on the underside of the rifle barrel . It could have been placed there only when the gun was disassembled , and leaves no doubt that Oswald brought the gun in the bag , set up some cartons , and fired the weapon . Oswald 's fingerprints were @# also found on the cartons stacked around the window from which the shots came . A spectator along the route of the motorcade , Abraham Zapruder , took movies of the presidential car at the time the shots were fired . These films made it possible to establish with great precision where the car was when the shots were fired , the distance between shots , and the elapsed time . The Zapruder camera operated at a speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames between events , the elapsed time could be determined , as well as the position of the car . Angle of fire . During a reenactment , a camera was mounted on the murder weapon and pictures taken through its telescopic sight . This allowed experts to determine the horizontal angle of fire and the relative positions of the victims in the line of sight . They also measured the exact distance from the rifle to the victims at the time they were shot . Allowance had to be made for a slight slope downward of the street and it was found that a deflection from the horizontal of the rifle of slightly more than 17 degrees would account for the first bullet passing through the President 's neck and striking the Governor in the right shoulder , as actually occurred . By comparing all the motion pictures it was deter-  | mined that the President received the head wound when he was 265.3 feet from the rifle in the sixth-floor window and that the angle of declination was slightly more than 15 degrees . This evidence established beyond question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruled out any possibility that the shots could have come from a triple overpass in front of the motorcade . One of the greatest problems facing the commission was whether the bullet that pierced the President 's neck also wounded Governor Connally , who was riding in the jump seat directly in front of the President . After a bullet travels through tissue , it tends to become " upset , " which means that the main axis of the bullet is no longer parallel to its direction of flight . If it strikes another person , the side as well as the nose of the bullet comes in contact with the skin at the point of entrance , producing an elongated wound instead of a neat , round hole . The Governor 's " ragged wound . " The surgeons who operated on Governor Connally reported that the entry wound in his back was over an inch long in its longest diameter . The " wound of exit was a ragged wound approximately five centimeters ( about two inches ) in its greatest diameter . " As the diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates to me beyond doubt that the bullet had already penetrated the President 's neck before entering the Governor 's back . Connally was hit when he was turned slightly to the right , so that the bullet took a slightly downs course and emerged below the right i pie . By this time its velocity was nit spent , but it still had enough moment to penetrate his right wrist and left thi The paraffin test . Several hours of Oswald was taken into custody , Dal police made a paraffin test on his hair and right cheek . It was positive on hi , hands , negative on the cheek . The is apparently was made immediately aft taking fingerprints and palm prints . The paraffin ( dermal nitrate ) test ss as first demonstrated in this country ii years ago , and I was present at that demonstration . I have used it often with good results . For a variety of reason , the test failed to furnish conclusive evidence in the Oswald case , but I still regard it as a valuable investigative tool When properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suspect 's skin , but meticulously applied drop by drop from a height of several inches After cooling , the cast is removed and by a slow and painstaking process a reagent is applied that will produce a blue reaction in the presence of nitrates . A nitrate from any source will produce a certain amount of blue reaction , but a trained scientist can detect immediately whether the nitrate is due to unburned powder particles or to some other source . A negative reaction , to powder particles should never be interpreted to demonstrate that the suspect did not fire a weapon . Oswald had discharged two firearms for a total of at least seven shots ( includ-@#  | ing , the four revolver bullets that killed Officer J. D. Tippit ) about two hours before he was in police custody . A properly conducted test might have been extremely helpful . But the results of the t , - st conducted several hours later in an office instead of a laboratory ? with Osis aid 's hands probably contaminated with ink from fingerprinting ? deserves little credence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . They saw it happen . At least two eye , witnesses saw Oswald fire the shots . One was Howard L. Brennan . Congressman Gerald R. Ford , a commission member , wrote in a magazine article that Brennan was the most important witness to appear before the panel . Sitting on a wall opposite the depository , he had noticed Oswald standing in the window a few minutes before the motorcade arrived . He also saw two men at the windows below and later positively identified them . Brennan testified that although he saw most of the rifle , he failed to notice the scope sight . After hearing the first shot , he looked up and saw the man with the rifle fire again . A few moments later Brennan described the man to police . But at a lineup that evening , Brennan was unable to positively identify Oswald . Brennan later told the commission that he could have , but was afraid to do so because he feared the shooting was part of a Communist plot that would have endangered him and his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seconds posed another dilemma . If Oswald , a trained marksman firing a high-powered rifle with a scope sight with deadly accuracy , put two bullets into the President , only inches apart , how did he miss the automobile completely with the third ? The mystery shot . In every major homicide investigation , it seems that there is always some important evidence that does n't quite fit the picture and this was no exception . The commission explored varjous theories in an attempt to account for the third shot , but it is still a mystery . However , never was such an array of scientific and investigative talent concentrated on a problem as in this case . Their findings led to only one possible conclusion : Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin and he acted alone .
