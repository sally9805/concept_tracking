" This great ship will rule for a long , long time as ' Queen of the Seas . ' " With these words , Navy Secretary John B. Connally last week commissioned the CVA ( N ) 65 , U.S.S. Enterprise , the world 's first nuclear aircraft carrier and the mightiest ship ever to put to sea . <P> Every adjective about the Enterprise seems to be a superlative . Displacing 85,350 tons , it is the biggest ship in the world , surpasses the Queen Elizabeth by 8,000 tons and costs an estimated $500 million . From stem to stern , the Enterprise measures 1,040 ft. - roughly the height of the 102-story Empire State Building . Yet the hefty Enterprise handles like a PT boat . In its first trials last month , it surged through the Atlantic at speeds of more than 35 knots , accelerated from a standstill to top speed so rapidly that accompanying destroyers were left wallowing far behind . Its eight nuclear reactors will drive the carrier more than 140,000 miles at full power , more than 400,000 miles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Appropriately , the Enterprise packs the biggest punch of any aircraft carrier in history : three squadrons of 680-m.p.h . Douglas A4D attack bombers that can carry H-bombs 1,000 miles ; one squadron of 1,000-m.p.h . Chance Vought F8U interceptors ; one squadron of North American A3J all-weather attack bombers ; one squadron of the versatile , all-weather McDonnell F4H Phantom II , which last week set a new world 's speed record for jet flight of 1,600 m.p.h . To launch one of its 100 planes every 15 seconds , the Enterprise will use four steam-operated catapults that are so powerful that they could hurl a Cadillac sedan a mile and a half straight up into the sky . <P> Outside of its jet interceptors , the 4,600-man Enterprise has no weapons for its own defense , will rely on its speed , maneuverability and the guns and rockets of its shepherding ships for survival in the age of the atom and the missile . The Enterprise is specially reinforced to withstand nuclear attack , can seal itself off below the hangar deck to avoid fallout , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near misses . <P> For the past five years , the Navy has talked hopefully of some day having a nuclear surface fleet to match its atomic submarines . But nuclear ships cost up to approximately 50% more than their conventional counterparts , and the pinch of economy has restricted the Navy 's budget to the Enterprise , the cruiser Long Beach , and two frigates still to be built .
