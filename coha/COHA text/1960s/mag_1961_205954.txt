Cimarron ( M-G-M ) , a remake of the 1931 western based on Edna Ferber 's bestselling novel about the opening of Oklahoma , might more suitably have been called **29;13867;TOOLONG . It lasts 2 hours and 27 minutes , and for at least half of that time most spectators will probably be Oklacomatose . <P> This effect was apparently not easy to achieve . Cimarron took 15 weeks to film , cost $6,000,000 , involved six name performers ( Glenn Ford , Maria Schell , Anne Baxter , Arthur O'Connell , Russ Tamblyn , Mercedes McCambridge ) , 360 bit-players , 700 extras , 700 horses , 500 assorted gigs , carts , buggies , stagecoaches and prairie schooners , plus a bicycle built for three . <P> The show gets going with a whoop and a holler in 1889 as the Oklahoma Line caves in like an invisible levee and a Metrocolored flood of horses and humans pours across the widescreen to the promised landgrab . Sad to say , when the flood is past there is nothing left but dribs and drabs of scenes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than an hour it peters out in commonplace quarrels . There is also the story of Oklahoma , but in little more than an hour it gets lost in a forest of oil wells . Then there is the theme of race prejudice , but that continually dissolves in sanctimonious absurdity-as when a Jew , forced by a target-happy gunman to hold two whisky bottles with outstretched arms , lifts his eyes to heaven in a shockingly tasteless travesty of the Crucifixion . <P> Finally , there is the main theme of the picture : the struggle between the wild , free spirit ( Hero Ford ) of the vanishing frontier and the money-grubbing mood ( Heroine Schell ) of the Main Street that replaced it . This struggle is hopelessly perplexed by Scriptwriter Arnold Schulman , who begins by deriding his heroine as a hysterical , success-obsessed , man-riding witch , a walking abstract of the worst in U.S. women , and then abruptly , without transition or transformation , ends by adoring her as the archetype of the pioneer mother , the thin-lipped , raw-knuckled goddess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is Scriptwriter Schulman trying to say ? That those brave , noble , hardworking frontier women of song and story were really a flock of harpies ? Probably not . But Actor Ford , a soft-voiced fellow with a mothers-boyish grin , consistently alters Author Ferber 's " bizarre , glamorous , gigantic " Yancey Cravat into just the sort of curly-haired doormat women love to wipe their feet on . And the harpy is hideously ( though perhaps unintentionally ) well played by Actress Schell , whose nervous , incessant , sugar-coated smile suggests that somewhere inside , there is a very bitter pill .
