It was another cat-and-mouse week . <P> In his determination to chase Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith back into his hole , Britain 's Harold Wilson came up with another assortment of sanctions . <P> First he prohibited the import of Rhodesian chrome . Then came a ban on cash-and-carry trade , which supplemented an earlier crackdown on credit deals . Finally , having presumably run out of trade barriers , Wilson decided to test his thesis that most of the Rhodesian civil service is loyal to the Crown , and will prove it if given the chance . <P> <P> At his behest , Queen Elizabeth suddenly commuted the death sentence of two Rhodesian blacks convicted of set ting houses afire and awaiting execution in a Salisbury prison . The hope was that the voice of the Queen would stir the fire of revolt in Smith 's prison authorities , but that hope seemed faint at best . Shrugging off an official warning that executing the two " loyal subjects of the Queen " would be the same thing as murder , Smith made the obvious reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroil Her Majesty in politics , " something that Prime Ministers do at a risk to themselves . No date has yet been set for the execution of the two black pawns , one of whom was sentenced more than two years ago , nor has any date been set for setting the date . Until it is , Wilson can hardly expect the wardens to revolt .
