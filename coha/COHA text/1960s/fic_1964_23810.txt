Truman did . Eisenhower was the exception , but Eisenhower 's whole experience had been military or foreign . In every case after a time they begin to be more interested in foreign affairs . That 's partly because foreign affairs are more urgent and more interesting , and partly because the President has more power to act . BRANDON : You do n't think that President Johnson is essentially really more fascinated by domestic affairs and Congressional relations ? SCHLESINGER : I think he is now , but unless he deviates from what has been the typical course in his office , I believe in due time he will find himself more and more absorbed in foreign policy . BRANDON : To what extent was President Kennedy influenced by historic precedent ? To what extent was his thinking influenced by history ? No Binding Precedents SCHLESINGER : His thinking was influenced very much by history , but not in the sense of precedent . A precedent was something which the first Catholic to be elected President of the United States could hardly regard as binding . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly , if it was a sensible thing to do . I can remember the discussions before his Presidency when he was thinking of making Douglas Dillon Secretary of the Treasury . I said to him that it would be unprecedented to take a Junior Cabinet Minister from a previous Administration and of the opposite political complexion and put him in one of the most important posts in the government . President Kennedy was rightly unimpressed by this . On the other hand , he was deeply influenced by history in the sense of having a notion of the direction , the movement of events . He saw things in certain historic sweep and flow . Also he was deeply influenced by the great figures of history and their qualities of heroism , magnanimity , generosity , chivalry . He derived from history certain useful generalizations , such as that you should never get into a fight and deny your opponent a means of exit . That , for example , was something which he had had as a maxim privately for years , and which he acted upon with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think now in retrospect are historically his most important speeches ? SCHLESINGER : His Inauguration speech will go down in history as one of the great Inaugural addresses . His civil-rights speech of June 1963 is , I think , his great speech in domestic policy . And the American University speech . I suggest those might be the three great speeches . by Henry Brandon 59 BRANDON : Did you take part in any of them ? SCHLESINGER : In the American University speech , in a minor way , but the main lines of these speeches were the President 's own . He was assisted in them by Ted Sorensen , who was his brilliant and selfless collaborator in these things . The American University speech delivered June 10 , 19631 suggests how he went about them . President Kennedy began to feel in the spring of 1963 that there was a possibility of some kind of new movement in our relations with the Soviet Union , and he began to look for an opportunity to make a " peace speech . " That was the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was kept extremely confidential in the White House . McGeorge Bundy began in a quiet way to get from two or three members of the White House staff ideas which might go into such a speech . Ted Sorensen worked on it . The President thought a great deal about it , talked with Sorensen and Bundy , made clear the point of view and the ideas he wanted . Part of this draft presently emerged . It was shown to a small group in the White House . As I recall , the draft was not shown to the State Department or to the Defense Department until the Saturday before it was given . It was given on a Monday . You may remember the President went to Hawaii , and I think it was perhaps on Friday afternoon that the draft was circulated through State and Defense for their comments . Ted Sorensen then flew with the draft to Honolulu and the President worked on the final draft on his way back and gave the speech Monday morning . I think that was the kind of speech which only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a President who will not be passive in the sense of accepting only proposals submitted to him from the machinery of government , but will have the courage to have his own conception of what ought to he done , and when it ought to he done , and to impose it on the government . BRANDON : What were the reasons for showing it so late to the State Department and to the Defense Department ? SCHLESINGER : The President knew what he wanted to say and did n't want to set in motion a process of dilution . BRANDON : It seems to me that Kennedy in his speeches tried to be the reformer , the man who makes history , but in his actions he was much more cautious . SCHLESINGER : I think the problem there was that in order to prepare the ground for action in a democracy you must have consent and support , and the process of education had to come first . In GO SCHLESINGER AT THE WHITE HOUSE a fairly prosperous country like America in the 1960s , he had to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way for action . He himself , of course , was looking forward to a second term . He supposed that his reelection would be by a much wider margin , that he would have a much freer hand in Congress , that there would be many more Democrats committed to the principles of the Democratic platform , and that he would be able to do something to minimize the role of the anti-Administration Democrats . For all these reasons , I believe , he thought that in his case  --  as in the case of Theodore Roosevelt  --  it would be the second term rather than the first that would be the term of major accomplishment . BRANDON : Did he talk to you about any specific new ideas  --  both in domestic and foreign affairs ? ScHLES/NGER : No . After all , the election was still a year away at the time of his death and at that time , during the summer and fall , the major new idea which was in his mind was the poverty program . He pondered the question of unemployment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Advisers and others . He became more and more convinced that the hard core of unemployment could not be ended by a simple increase in the general levels of economic activity , and that the unemployed were those more and more in handicapped or disqualified categories  --  either ethnic minorities or the undereducated or undertrained or old people . When you subtract those various categories from the general unemployed , those who were left , who would he reemployed by an increase in general levels of business activity , were not too great . Under Walter Heller 's direction , the studies were made which prepared the way for the poverty program which President Johnson has loyally continued and carried forward . Why So Sensitive ? BRANDON : Do you think the President 's indefatigable interest in the press was an advantage or a disadvantage to him ? SCHLESINGER : Oh . I think it was overall an advantage . One of the important things the President has to do is to know what 's going on . But why Presidents are so sensitive to press criticism is hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be inured to a certain amount of misunderstanding and malice . But Presidents are terribly sensitive . Some , like Coolidge and Eisenhower , just did n't read papers which criticized them ; others , like Roosevelt , Kennedy , Johnson , and Truman , read them with apparently inexhaustible capacity for indignation . Kennedy . as you know , regarded this as one of the occupational hazards of the Presidency . Even though he often got briefly irritated , on the whole these were cause more for jokes than for genuine rage . BRANDON : Many historians have now accepted the theory that history is mainly a personal vision . A minority of historians , especially those whose preoccupation is economic history , have argued that the study of history should mean more than a personal reconstruction of the past , that it should be more concerned as to how one epoch relates to another . What is the point of view from which you approach history ? SCHLESINGER : I think history is partly a personal vision . But it is more than a personal vision because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call " facts . " These are elements on which all historians can agree ? namely , that certain people have lived , that certain battles and elections have taken place , and so on , no matter how much they differ about the interpretation . I think this substratum will continue . The questions of the interpretation are going to vary from historian to historian and from generation to generation . BRANDON : Do you think the fact that you participated  --  that you were inside of government  --  will enable you to interpret more accurately ? SctiLEsnenEll : It will enable me perhaps to describe the process of public decision more accurately than people who have never been in government , though the experience is really less important than the instinct  --  the intuition  --  about these things . Undoubtedly a great historian in a library  --  if his intuitions are subtle enough  --  can do better than a mediocre historian who spent years in the public service . Public experience by itself is no substitute for the insight which distinguishes a great . historian from an average one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse ? SCHLESINGER : My perspective on the Roosevelt Administration will be better as a result of this experience . But participation in the Kennedy Administration does not ensure that my perspective on it will be better . And what I write about the Kennedy Administration therefore will not be ( as my work on the Roosevelt Administration attempts to be ) a comprehensive and systematic account . It will rather be a contribution to the work that some future historian will undertake about the Kennedy Administration , because what is important about the Kennedy years twenty years from now may not be what you and I and Ted Sorensen think is important about it today . The Cold Wind and the Warm A story by Ray Bradbury " Good God in heaven , what 's that ? " " What 's what ? " " Are you blind , man , look ! " And Garrity , elevator operator , looked out to see what the hall porter was staring at . And in out of the Dublin morn , sweeping through the front doors of the Royal Hibernian Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall willowy man of some forty years followed by five short willowy youths of some twenty years , a burst of birdsong , their hands flapping all about on the air as they passed , their eyes squinching , batting , and flickering , their mouths pursed , their brows enlightened and then dark , their color flushed and then pale or was it both ? their voices now flawless piccolo , now flute , now melodious oboe but always tuneful . Carrying six monologues , all sprayed forth upon each other at once , in a veritable cloud of self-commiseration , peeping and twitting the discouragements of travel and the ardors of weather , the corps-de-ballet as it were flew , cascaded , flowed eloquently in a greater bloom ofcologne by astonished hall porter and transfixed elevator man . They collided deliciously to a halt at the desk where the manager glanced up to be swarmed over by their music . His eyes made nice round o 's with no centers in them . " What , " whispered Garrity , " was that ? " " You may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator lights flashed and the buzzer buzzed . Garrity had to tear his eyes off the summery crowd and heft himself skyward . " We , " said the tall slender man with a touch of gray at the temples , " should like a room , please . " The manager remembered where he was and heard himself say , " Do you have reservations , sir ? " " Dear me , no , " said the older man as the others giggled ; " ? we flew in unexpectedly from Taormina , " the tall man with the chiseled features and the moist flower mouth continued . " We were getting so awfully bored , after a long summer , and someone said , Let 's have a complete change , let 's do something wild . What ? I said . Well , where 's the most improbable place in the world ? 62 THE COLD WIND AND THE WARM Let 's name it and go there . Somebody said the North Pole , but that was silly . Then I cried , Ireland !

" But we shall know it when we see it , or it happens , or perhaps we shall have to make it happen , right , cohorts ? " The cohorts responded with something vaguely like tee-hee . " Perhaps , " said the manager , with good grace , " if you gave me some idea what you 're looking for in Ireland , I could point out ? " " Goodness , no , " said the tall man . " We shall just plummet forth with our intuitions scarved about our necks , taking the wind as ' t were and see what we shall tune in on .

" " You can say that again , " said the hall porter , under his breath . " Well , comrades , let us sign in . " The leader of the encampment reached for a scratchy hotel pen , found it filthy , and flourished forth his own absolutely pure 14-carat solid gold pen with which in an obscure but rather pretty cerise calligraphy he enscribed the name DAVID followed by SNELL followed by dash and ending with ORKNEY . Beneath , he added " and friends . " The manager watched the pen , fascinated , and once more recalled his position in all this . " But , sir , I have n't said if we have space ? " " Oh , surely you must , for six miserable wanderers in sore need of respite from overfriendly airline stewardesses  --  one room would do it ! " " One ? " said the manager , aghast . " We would n't mind the crowd , would we , chums ? " asked the older man , not looking at his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a writer of science fiction , Ray Bradbury is always involved in a number of other projects . This year he has been idea consultant for the U.S. Government Pavilion at the World 's Fair , has seen the filming of his novel , " Faitrenheit 451 , " by the French director , Francois Truffaut , and has written the screenplay of his " Martian Chronicles . " " Well , " said the manager , uneasily fumbling at the registry . " We just happen to have two adjoining ? " " Perfecto ! " cried David Snell-Orkney . And the registration finished , the manager behind the desk and the visitors from a far place stood regarding each other in a prolonged silence . At last the manager blurted , " Porter ! Front ! Take these gentlemen 's luggage ? " But just then the hall porter ran over to look at the floor . Where there was no luggage . " No , no , none . " David Snell-Orkney airily waved his hand . " We travel light . We 're here only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of underwear stuffed in our overcoats . Then back to Sicily and warm twilights . If you want me to pay in advance ? " " That wo n't be necessary , " said the manager . handing the keys to the hall porter . " Forty-six and forty-seven , please . " " It 's done , " said the porter . And like a collie dog silently nipping the hooves of some woolly long-haired , bleating , dumbly smiling sheep , he herded the lovely bunch toward the elevator which wafted down just at that precise moment . At the desk , the manager 's wife came up , steel-eyed behind him . " Are you mad ? " she whispered , wildly . " Why ? Why ? " " All my life . " said the manager , half to himself . " I have wished to see not one Communist but ten close by , not two Nigerians but twenty in their skins , not three cowboy Americans but a gross fresh from the saddle . So when six hothouse roses come in a bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter is long , Meg ; this may be the only lit fuse in the whole year . Stand by for the lovely concussion . " " Fool , " she said . As they watched , the elevator , freighted with hardly more than the fluff ' from a blown dandelion , whisked up the shaft , away . It was exactly at high noon that a series of coincidences occurred that tottered and swerved toward the miraculous . Now the Royal Hibernian Hotel lies half between Trinity College , if you 'll excuse the mention , and Saint Stephen 's Green , which is more like it , and around behind is Grafton Street , where you can buy silver , glass , and linen , or pink hacking coats , boots , and caps to ride off to the goddamned hounds , or better still duck in to Heeber Finn 's pub for a proper proportion of drink and talk  --  an hour of drink to two hours of talk is about the best prescription to follow . Now the boys most often seen in Finn 's are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could forget Timulty , Mike MaGuire , surely everyone 's friend , then there 's Hannahan , Flaherty , Kilpatrick , and on occasion , when God seems a bit untidy and Job comes to mind , Father Liam Leary himself , who strides in like Justice and glides forth like Mercy . Well , that 's the lot , and it 's high noon , and out of the Hibernian Hotel front who should come now but Snell-Orkney and his canary five . Which resulted in the first of a dumfoundering series of confrontations . For passing below , sore torn between the sweet shops and Heeber Finn 's was Timulty himself . Timulty , as you recall , when Blight , Famine , Starvation , and other mean Horsemen drive him . works a day here or there at the Post Office . Now , idling along between dread employments , he smelled a smell as if the gates of Eden had swung wide again and him invited back in after a hundred million years . So Timulty looked up to see what made the wind blow out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was in tumult about Snell-Orkney and his uncaged pets . " I tell you , " said Timulty , years later . " I felt my eyes start as if I 'd been given a good bash on the skull . A new part ran down the center of my hair . " Timulty , frozen to the spot , watched the Snell-Orkney delegation flow down the steps and around the corner . At which point he decided on sweeter things than candy and rushed the long way to Finn 's . At that instant , rounding the corner Mr. David Snell-Orkney-plus-five passed a beggar-lady playing a harp in the street . And there , with nothing else to du but dance the time away , was Mike MaGuire himself , flinging his feet about in a self-involved rigadoon to " Lightly o'er the Lea . " Dancing , Mike MaGuire heard a sound that was like the passing by of warm weather from the Hebrides . It was not quite a twittering nor a whirr , and it was not unlike a pet shop when the bell tinkles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start up in coos and light shrieks . But hear he did , above the sound of his own shoes and the pringle of harp . He froze in mid-jig . As David Snell-Orkney-plus-five swept by all tropic smiles and gave him a wave . Before he knew what he was doing , Mike waved back , then stopped and seized his wounded hand to his breast . " What the hell am I waving for ? " he cried , to no one . " I do n't know them , do I ? " " Ask God for strength ! " said the harpist to her a story by Ray Bradbury 63 harp and flung her fingers down the strings . Drawn as by some strange new vacuum cleaner that swept all before it , Mike followed the Team down the street . Which takes care of two senses now , the sense of smell and the use of the ears . It was at the next corner that Nolan , leaving Finn 's pub because of an argument with Finn himself came around the bend fast and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other for support . " Top of the afternoon ! " said David Snell-Orkney . " The Back Side of Something ! " replied Nolan , and fell away , gaping to let the circus by . He had a terrible urge to rush back to Finn 's . His fight with the owner of the pub was obliterated . He wished now to report upon this fell encounter with a feather duster , a Siamese cat , a spoiled Pekingese , and three others gone ghastly frail from undereating and overwashing . The six stopped outside the pub looking up at the sign . Ah , God , thought Nolan . They 're going in . What will come of it ? Who do I warn first ? Them ? Or Finn ? Then : the door opened . Finn himself looked out . Damn , thought Nolan , that spoils it ! Now we wo n't be allowed to describe this adventure . It will be Finn this , Finn that , and shut up to us all ! There was a long moment when Snell-Orkney and his cohorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . He looked above . He looked over . He looked beyond . But he had seen them , this Nolan knew . For now a lovely thing happened . All the color went out of Finn 's face . Then an even lovelier thing happened . All the color rushed back into Finn 's face . Why , cried Nolan to himself , he 's ... blushing ! But still Finn refused to look anywhere save the sky , the lamps , the street , until Snell-Orkney trilled , " Sir , which way to St. Stephen 's Green ? " " Jesus . " said Finn and turned away . " Who knows where they put it , this week ! " and slammed the door . The six went on up the street , all smiles and delight , and Nolan was all for heaving himself through the door when a worse thing happened . Garrity the elevator operator from the Royal Hibernian Hotel whipped across the sidewalk from nowhere . His face ablaze with excitement , he ran first into Finn 's to spread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timulty rushing in next , Garrity was all up and down the length of the bar while Finn stood behind it 64 THE COLD WIND AND THE WARM suffering from concussions from which he had not as yet recovered . " It 's a shame you missed it ! " cried Garrity to all . " I mean it was the next thing to one of them fiction-and-science Hums they show at the Gayety Cinema ! " " How do you mean ? " asked Finn , shaken out of his trance . " Nothing they weigh ! " Garrity told them . " Lifting them in the elevator was throwing a handful of chaff up a chimney ! And you should have heard . They 're here in Ireland for . . " He lowered his voice and squinched his eyes . " . . . for mysterious reasons ! " " Mysterious ! " Everyone leaned in at him . " They 'll put no name to it , but , mark my declaration , they 're up to no good ! Have you over seen the like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Finn . " I ? " But the word " convent " seemed one more magic touch . The doors sprang wide at this . Father Leary entered in reverse . That is to say he backed into the pub one hand to his cheek as if the Fates had dealt him a proper blow unbewares . Reading the look of his spine , the men shoved their noses in their drinks until such time as the father had put a bit of the brew into himself , still staring as if the door were the gates of Bell ajar . " Beyond , " said the father , at last , " not two minutes gone , I saw a sight as would be hard to credit . In all the days of her collecting up the grievances of the world , has Ireland indeed gone mad ? " Finn refilled the priest 's glass . " Was you standing in the blast of The Invaders from the Planet Venus , Father ? " " Have you seen them , then , Finn ? " the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , your Holiness ?

" " When last seen , where heading ? " asked Timulty . " On the edge of the Green , " said the priest . " You do n't imagine there 'll be a bacchanal in the park now ? " " The weather wo n't allow , beg your pardon , Father , " said Nolan , " but it strikes me , instead of standing with the gab in our mouth we should be out on the spy ? " " You move against my ethics , " said the priest . " A drowning man clutches at anything , " said Nolan , " and ethics may drown with him if that 's what he grabs instead of a lifehelt . " " Off the Mount , Nolan , " said the priest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The point is , Father , we have had no such influx of honorary Sicilians since the mind boggles to remember . For all we know , at this moment , they may be reading aloud to Mrs. Murphy , Miss Clancy , or Mrs. O'Hanlan in the midst of the park . And reading aloud from what , I ask you ? " " The Ballad of Reading Gaol ? " asked Finn . " You have rammed the target and sunk the ship , " said Nolan , mildly irritated the point had been plucked from him . " How do we know these imps out of bottles are not selling real-estate tracts in a place called Fire Island ? Have you heard of it , Father ? " " The American gazettes come often to my table , man . " " Well , do you remember the great hurricane of nineteen-and-fifty-six when the waves washed over Fire Island there in New York ?

It was the most tumultuous scene since Hieronymus Bosch laid down his palette after he painted Hell for all generations to come . You do not easily evacuate ten thousand Venetian glass boyos with their great blinky cow-eyes and their phonograph symphonic records in their hands and their rings in their ears , without tearing down the middle . My uncle , soon after , took to the heavy drink . " " Tell us more about that night , " said Kilpatrick , entranced . " More , hell , " said the priest . " Out , I say . Surround the park . Keep your eyes peeled . And meet me back here in an hour . " " That 's more like it , " cried Kelly . " Let 's really see what dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide . On the sidewalk , the priest gave directions . " Kelly , Murphy , you around the north side of the park . Timulty , you to the south . Nolan and Garrity the east , Moran , MaGuire , and Kilpatrick , the west . Git ! " But somehow or other in all the ruction , Kelly and Murphy wound up at the Four Shamrocks pub halfway to the Green and fortified themselves for the chase , and Nolan and Moran each met their wives on the street and had to run the other way , and MaGuire and Kilpatrick , passing the Elite Cinema and hearing Lawrence Tibbett singing inside cadged their way in for a few half-used cigarettes . So it wound up with just two , Garrity on the east and Timulty on the south side of the park , looking in at the visitors from another world . After half an hour of freezing weather , Garrity stomped up to Timulty and said , " What 's wrong with the fiends ? They 're just standing there in the midst of the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's cut to the bone is my toes . I 'll nip around to the hotel , warm up , and rush back to stand guard with you , Tim . " " Take your time , " called Timulty in a strange sad wandering , philosophical voice as the other charged away . Left alone , Timulty walked in and sat for a full hour watching the six men who , as before , did not move . You might almost have thought to see Timulty there , with his eyes brooding , and a story by Ray Bradbury 65 his mouth gone into a tragic crease , that he was some Irish neighbor of Kant or Schopenhauer , or had just read something by a poet or thought of a song that declined his spirits . And when at last the hour was up and he had gathered his thoughts like a handful of cold pebbles , he turned and made his way out of the park . Garrity was there , pounding his feet and swinging his hands but before he could explode with questions , Timulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think . Then you tell me . " Everyone at Finn 's looked up sheepishly when Timulty made his entrance . The priest was still off on errands around the city , and after a few walks about the Green to assuage their consciences , all had returned , nonplussed , to intelligence headquarters . " Timulty ! " they cried . " Tell us ! What ? What ? " Timulty took his time walking to the bar and sipping his drink . Silently , he observed his own image remotely buried beneath the lunar ice of the barroom mirror . He turned the subject this way . He twisted it inside out . He put it back wrong-side-to . Then he shut his eyes and said : " It strikes me as how ? " Yes , said all silently , about him . " From a lifetime of travel and thought , it comes to the top of my mind , " Timulty went on , " there is a strange resemblance between the likes of them and the likes of us . " There was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comings of light in the prisms of the little chandeliers over the bar . When the schools of fish-light had stopped swarming at this exhalation , Nolan cried , " Do you mind putting your hat on so / can knock it off ! ? " " Consider , " Timulty calmly said . " Are we or are we not great ones for the poem and the song ? " Another kind of gasp went through the crowd . There was a warm burst of approval . " Oh , sure , we 're that ! " " My God , is that all you 're up to ? " " We were afraid ? " " Hold it ! " ' Timulty raised a hand , eyes still closed . And all shut up . " If we 're not singing the songs , we 're writing them , and if not writing , dancing them , and are n't they fond admirers of the song and the writing of same and the dancing out the whole ? Well , just now , I heard them at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green . " Timulty had something there . Everyone had to paw everybody and admit it . " Do you find any other resemblances ? " asked Finn , heavily , glowering. 66 THE COLD WIND AND THE WARM " I do , " said Timulty , with a judge 's manner . There was a still more fascinated indraw of breath and the crowd drew nearer . " They do not mind a drink now and then , " said Timulty . " By God , he 's right ! " cried Murphy . " Also , " intoned Timulty , " they do not marry until very late , if ever at all ! And ? " But here the tumult was such he had to wait for it to subside before he could finish : " And they  --  ah -- -have very little to do with women . " After that there was a great clamor , a yelling and shoving about and ordering of drinks and someone invited Timulty outside . But Timulty would n't even lift one eyelid , and the brawler was held off and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drained away , one loud clear voice , Finn 's , declared : " Now would you mind explaining the criminal comparison you have just made in the clean air of my honorable pub ? " Timulty sipped his drink slowly and then at last opened his eyes and looked at Finn steadily , and said , with a clear bell-trumpet tone and wondrous enunciation : " Where in all of Ireland can a man lie down with a woman ? " He let that sink in . " Three hundred and twenty-nine days a damn year it rains . The rest it 's so wet there 's no dry piece , no bit of land you would dare trip a woman out flat on for fear of her taking root and coming up in leaves , do you deny that ?

" " Ah , Jaisus , " said Flynn , " you can say that again . " " Ah , Jaisus , " said everyone , nodding . " That 's number one . " Timulty ticked it off on his fingers . " Place is lacking . Then , second , time and circumstance , for say you should sweet talk a fair girl into the field , eh ? in her rainboots and slicker and her shawl over her head and her umbrella over that and you making noises like a stuck pig half over the sty-gate which means you 've got one hand in her bosom and the other wrestling with her boots , which is as far asyou 'll damn well get , for who 's standing there behind you , and you feel his sweet spearmint breath on your neck ? " " The father from the local parish ? " offered Garrity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in despair . " There 's nails number two and three in the cross on which all Ireland 's males hang crucified , " said Timulty . " Go on , Timulty , go on . " " Those fellows visiting here from Sicily run in teams . We run in teams . Here we are , the gang , in Finn 's , are we not ? " " Be damned and we are ! " " They look sad and are melancholy half the time and then spitting like happy demons the rest , either up or down , never in between , and who does that remind you of ? " Everyone looked in the mirror and nodded . " If we had the choice , " said Timulty , " to go home to the dire wife and the dread mother-in-law and the old-maid sister all sour sweats and terrors , or stay here in Finn 's for one more song or one more drink or one more story , which would all of its men choose ? " Silence . " Think on that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarities . The long list of them runs off one hand up the other arm . And well worth the mulling over before we leap about crying Jaisus and Mary and summoning the Guard . " Silence . " I , " said someone , after a long while , strangely , curiously , " would like .. . to see them closer . " " I think you 'll get your wish . Hist ! " All froze in a tableau . And far off they heard a faint and fragile sound . It was like the wondrous morning you wake and lie in bed and know by a special feel that the first fall of snow is in the air , on its way down , tickling the sky , making the silence to stir aside and fall back in on nothing . " Ah , God , " said Finn , at last , " it 's the first day of spring . . . . " And it was that , too . First the dainty snowfall of feet drifting on the cobbles , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the street and outside the pub came the sounds that were winter and spring . The doors sprang wide . The men reeled back from the impact of the meeting to come . They steeled their nerves . They balled their fists . They geared their teeth in their anx-July Fifth in the old burying ground by Maxine W.

After the fireworks last night climbed up and cracked the sky , the deer came in to nip the blooms from these geraniums where plastic flags with fifty stars mark such as Nehemiah White , Captain of the Valley Volunteers .

The sound of snowfall stopped . The sound of spring birds ceased . The strange children herded by the strange shepherd found themselves suddenly stranded as if they sensed a pulling away of a tide of people , even though the men at the bar had flinched but the merest hair . The children of a warm isle regarded the short child-sized and runty full-grown men of this cold land and the full-grown men looked back in mutual assize . Timulty and the men at the bar breathed long and slow . You could smell the terrible clean smell of the children way over here . There was too much spring in it .
