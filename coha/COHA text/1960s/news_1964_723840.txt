txt Premier Fidel Castro is trying to mount a revolution in sugar production in the rich plains here at the base of the Sierra Maestra . This economic revolution is vital to Cuba 's development plans . It presents more formidable problems , in many respects , than the guerrilla campaign in the nearby mountains that started Dr. Castro on the road to power in the nineteen-fifties . Soviet-made tracked tractors grind across the vast sun - drenched fields dragging plows , disks and graders that level the fine gray earth , which the wind raises in angry little twisters . These fields were in rice , which has just been harvested , but they are going into sugar cane . The land will be irrigated and fertilized . According to the plan , the cane in flat fields will be gathered by harvesters produced by the Soviet Union that . are being tested here . Under a Cuban-Soviet economic agreement , Cuba is to be the sugar bowl of the Communist world . The agreement calls for an increase in sugar production to 10 million metric tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Production last year was 3.8 million tons and the harvest under way gives no sign of significant improvement . The most Cuba has produced was 7.2 million tons in 1952 . As its part of the bargain , the Soviet Union nas agreed to buy the increases in production until 1970 at a flat price of 6 cents a pounds and provide the necessary machinery for mechanized production . The Cuban task is to improve organization of the entire sugarproduction cycle , including increases in the grinding capacity of the 153 mills now operating on the island . This is all uphill and problematical in the light of performance in the last three years . All along the 120-mile highway from Santiago de Cuba to Manzanillo that runs between the Sierra Maestra and the Canto River , there are big stands of sugar cane . The harvest is two and a half months along , and on many of the big state farms that supply cane to the mills , well in excess of half of the full-grown cane is still standing in seas of rippling green . In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in straw bats stand in shady places or cluster around booths where coffee and soft drinks are sold . On a weekday afternoon men practice baseball on diamonds near the sugar mills . Rarely can anyone be seen cutting cane . The Santiago newspaper Sierra Maestra , which calls itself the " provincial organ of the Socialist Revolution , " announced that the mills ground cane at 100 per cent of their quotas this week but to date Oriente Province " is reported to be up to 16 per cent behind schedule in some regions . " In neighboring Camaguey Province , the Government says , the shortage of cutters poses a " danger " to the crop . A serious labor problem is one of the difficulties that the mechanization of the sugar harvest is supposed to overcome . The preparation and replanting of the fields must take place before the rains begin in May . There are indications in the area that new planting is already a problem . Machines Not Tried Out At a sugar mill near here , some semimechanical caneplanting ? machines made by Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a scattering of parts for agricultural machinery . " This state farm is supposed Ito plant 2,500 acres in new cane by May 15 , starting this week , " said Conrad Escalona , who is regional coordinator of the Sugar Commission in Bayamo . " These machines may help , but they have not even been tried out yet . " " If everybody had the same spirit as Fidel , this sugar plan would be easy , but the men do not want to work any more , " said Mr. Escalona , a mill inspector before the revolution . " Before , there were always more men than one could use . I could get as much cane cut as I wanted . But now there are so many young men in the army and the pay is better on any construction job than cutting cane . " He said seasonal workers who ! come down from the Sierra , ' whose peaks loomed in the : background , were able to make Ha couple of pesos or a Ethel ( more " a day cutting cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He added : " When they go home after a month , they do not have anything to show for it . The pay is the same as when sugar was selling for 3 cents a pound . It is not enough . " Official Fails to Appear As for the state farm administrators , he said that a big meeting had been called in Bayamo and the sugar expansion plans had been set forth in detail . " The administrator was supposed to be here this morning for a look at the planters , but he has not shown up , ' , Mr. Escalona said . In some fields there are little sprouts of newly planted cane , but the problem of completing the present harvest according to specifications and getting the new fields sown and fertilized is evidently a knotty one . " If we get this all done , with the water we can pump into the fields through the irrigation canals that were used for rice , we would be able to raise cane with yields of 60 tons of cane per hectare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acre , more than twice the national , average . " These fields are ideal for those Soviet harvesters we are supposed to get here next year , " he said . " Then we will not have to rely on the loafers. "
