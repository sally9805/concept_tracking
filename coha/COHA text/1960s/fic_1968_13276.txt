He wears a mask that has no features , just a gaping and bleeding mouth ) I gaze on the past . . . and on the future . I have delved deep , meditating the fate of the Chinese .

The world hates a thing too pure  --  and devils burst into laughter ! Loud laughter is heard . The lights shine on Lan and Feng . When she sees them , the pathetic girl-creature faints . This makes everybody laugh and carry on , mainly Dagaroo , who dances and shrieks in glee . LAN ( pouring some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! With bells and drums ringing I rejoice in you !

A door am I to thee who knockest at me . . . a way am I to thee who passest ! Feng motions to Dagaroo to awaken Princess Ling . She moves like a cricket from out of a jar . ( Laughs . ) Dagaroo , take the liver from the owl . Dagaroo kills the owl and removes its liver . Dagaroo , tie the liver up in the scroll . Hang it up near the fire . Dagaroo does as Feng orders .

She calls herself happy and blessed and how she feels privileged to love me and protect me so that I will never feel lonely or frightened again ! And I 'm thinking how it would be to throw her into a pig trough  --  the pig slop squashing under her buttocks and her breasts jiggling like rabbits ! She burned her breasts off . . . she sacrified herself for me . . . and it was an impure sacrifice . . . dirtied by her passion . . . and she was anxious to be a . . . sacrifice ! She sustained her purity ! Her breast-burning was in accord with her . . . emergency . . . but I am different . . . selfless . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , " Soft weakness overcomes hard strength . A whirlwind does not last a whole day , pelting rain does not last a whole morning . " She is like a little sage  --  a nun ! Everything she desired was given to her by me ! ( Laughs . ) I made her brim over like a dark pool . . . with my tricks  --  my magic ! But she kept her eyes always always on my belly , it seemed to me as if she expected nightingales to fly out of my belly ! ( Laughs . ) And I told her stories ! Stories that I felt she must hear ! I wandered along with her in her mind at my own sweet will ! While I wandered with her I minced her into meatballs ! ( Laughs . ) One evening we were looking at a book together , with erotic drawings . I pointed to a drawing , then looked into her eyes and said , " Do people do such things ? It 's so violent ! " Her eyes became wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . I even think I smelled her heat ! ( Laughs . ) And then I told her that I was a virgin !

I told her that I would search high and low , continually praying  --  that I might meet some woman ! ( Laughs . ) And then she said that I might not have to look very far ! She asked me if I had ever made love with a man , and I told her no , how the thought of making love with a man or a woman made me afraid , and anyway that I was a magician and an acrobat and had always felt that that was enough for me ! ( Laughs . ) And then I told her again how I would like to find a woman and learn a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweet feeling ! And I held her  --  and I trembled against her soft body  --  like this ! I trembled ! ( Lan holds Dagaroo to his chest . ) She was like a flower dropping petals before my eyes or a mouse with its intestines hanging out . ( Laughs . ) " Ti lu fu kan chi tsan , " she said , and I said , " Tsan fen huan wah . " She said I was a perfect male ! A man ! I felt her wanting . . . to seize me , grab and scratch and tickle me . I called her . . . my pepper seed . . . my pip . . . my kernel of love . . . and inside my head was an ax and I was cutting off her head ! ( Laughs . ) She tried to straddle me ! She grew fur and feathers before my eyes ! Her feet changed to hooves ! I touched her shining hair . . . and in my head I was touching pigs ' bristles ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my body . . . vomited ! I called her . . . my little chicken and she called me her rooster ! Her cock-bird ! Whistle blows . What is that ? p. 37 DAGAROO The pigeons . LAN ( introspective ) The melancholy wailing of the whistles carried by the pigeons . . . they are wheeling in midair ! It reminds me of the souls of the dead roaming about in space seeking for a resting place . DAGAROO The pigeons carry news about the war . LAN ( reciting ) You suffered starvation in deserted villages , Always you saw ahead of you a gutter death , And yet you were incessantly singing Of the glorious events that occurred each day . Soldiers died , lay wounded on battlefields ; Stars fell down the sky , A thousand horses vanished in clouds . To all these your life was a sacrifice . Your poverty still glitters and shines Like the rags of a deceased saint , And the least tatter that remains Is endowed with magic powers . Their crowns and purples in this light Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor ! And you are a prisoner ! LAN I do not feel shame because of detention in prison . . . and it is no disgrace to be insulted . To desire few things is an inner cultivation . ( Pause . ) I would have aggression stopped and propose disarmament !  --  The nation has suffered terrible wounds long enough . I laugh at the folly ! Whistle blows . Strange birds . . . they reach the corners of the earth . . . If only I lived in a different place . . . in a forest of peach trees ! It would be so fragrant . . . I could preserve my moment of life . See my eyes , they 're filling with tears . . . . I have no magic to overcome death . . . . Give me some wine . Dagaroo pours him wine .

From the back of his neck , and his navel . . . and the small of his back . . . he howled with love . Two lovers ! Two lovers ! The moon in bed with us ! He is lost . . . I can not find . . .

Where does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dagaroo laughs . Who is she who keeps peering at me in a sneaking way ? ( Lan picks up some dirt and throws it into his own face . He rubs the dirt away , looks around , searching . ) I am astonished ! She has gone away ! If we meet again  --  she would not recognize me for my face is covered with dirt ! We are as far away from each other as liver and gall . . . . She has rolled away from me like a muddy egg . Hsiao yen chu hun ! Dagaroo and Lan laugh ; then Dagaroo begins to puff air out of his lips . Lan watches him , an excitement builds up in both of them . They stare at each other . Love all things , the universe is one . The egg has hair . Ying contains the whole world . A dog may be a sheep . The horse has eggs . The frog has a tail . Mountains produce mouths . Tortoises are longer than snakes . A white dog is black . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . Fire is not hot . Wheels do not touch the ground . Eyes do not see . Things never come to an end . Lights alter into strange shapes . Lan begins to spit out what appear to be little animals . Interlude Princess Ling appears . Her skin sweats blood . She begins to pray to the Head of the Empress . She is burning with ecstasy and reaches out to Lan . She screams in a shrill vibrating voice as Arab women do during celebrations . Lan gestures magnificently , then plunges a golden dart into her . Dagaroo is emotionless . He watches her die , then he leaves and returns with a female puppet , elaborately dressed . Lan approaches the puppet reverently . Lan strips the clothes from the puppet and garbs himself with them . There is intensity and an undercurrent of violence in his gestures . He makes up his face and puts on the puppet 's wig . Sometimes he speaks in Chinese : Chia tang erh chieh chung tso ting hung ko sao ti kung chi yang mon chia ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kua yen hisn . The words may be said in any order . The actor uses the Chinese tonal sounds ; he is guided by his mood and his own inspiration . Dagaroo emits his guttural sounds or says the word Hu ! After Lan is finished dressing , he is transformed into a woman . He walks and moves gracefully and naturally . He does not parody  --  he is a woman while he is dressed in women 's clothes . He carries on a dialogue with the new herself , changing his voice to a female tone when he speaks as she . p. 39 LAN-SHE What has the power of the emperor to do with the spontaneous changes of all things ? We follow two courses at once . There is nothing which is not the that , another thing 's other ; there is nothing which is not the this , its own self . Things do not know that they are another 's that ; they only know that they are this . The that and the this are alternately producing one another ! LAN-HE The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

LAN-HE Bathed in the sun , washed in the moon , among the hundred precious things I grew . LAN-SHE Are you a flower ? LAN-HE Yes !

Will you twist the threads for me ? LAN-SHE Yes ! If we sit together in the candlelight ! LAN-HE I love to think about that ! And your little feet white as frost ! And your new dress is an endless bright shining ! LAN-SHE O Emperor  --  I tremble because of your love ! I tremble like a silkworm on a leaf ! I remember when no man wanted to live with me. p. 41 LAN-HE Tender girl , you are a moon of shining flowers ! He dances and chants . The stage is darkened . Soldiers appear ; they speak in Chinese ; voices overlap . They laugh and scream . The mood is bright and happy , then changes to darkness and dread as suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them yell insults at Lan . He screams back at them in his female voice . LAN-SHE You are lumps ! Foolish lumps ! Tsung king hsin ! Lumps with mouths ! Depraved ! Depraved ! Depraved ! Hsing ! Tu ! Kua ! A soldier runs to Lan and prostrates himself before him , breathing heavily . Lin so yang .

Yen chu hun  --  all sorrow will end  --  will flow away ! ( Laughs . ) Your dethroned king is a mere woman  --  who holds in her hand no murdering sword but a pretty jade comb ! ( He takes out a comb . ) My only woe is that I might lose it in my overflowing jewel box ( Laughs. ) or that it might be broken in two by a rough soldier  --  ( He is introspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . He beat his breast . He bit his fingers . He bent over and let men kick him in the ass . He smiled . He giggled . Some men giggled with him . He heard them giggling . He was remorseful .
