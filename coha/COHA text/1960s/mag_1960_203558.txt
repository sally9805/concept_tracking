Housewives dislike hard water because it does not lather well , but it may prolong their lives , and more especially their husbands ' . A surprising relationship between a high mineral content in drinking water and low death rates from heart-and-artery disease was reported last week in the A.M.A. Journal . <P> With a few minor ( still unexplained ) exceptions , all the statistical findings are directly opposite to what would be assumed on the basis of " superficial thinking or snap judgment , " said Dartmouth College 's Physiologist Henry A. Schroeder . In fact , when he began his study , he expected to find that hard water went with hard arteries . He took off from a 1950-51 U.S. Geological Survey study of water supplies for 1,315 cities , covering 90% of the urban and 58% of the total population . The survey assigned a " hardness index " to water , found the national average was 97 . Dr. Schroeder compared the states ' index figures with their mortality , found no relationship with overall death rates . But he found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Of 25 states with harder-than-average water , all but Florida and Kentucky are north or west of the Ohio River . And in these 25 , except Indiana and Illinois , death rates from heart-artery disease are below the national average . In more than two-thirds of the soft-water states ( east or south of the Ohio , plus Louisiana , Arkansas , Oregon and Washington-see map ) , the rates were above average . <P> Differences in racial stock , diet , occupation and living habits offer no explanation , Dr. Schroeder believes . And though he feels that something in the water may be responsible , the precise ingredient eludes him . The evidence excludes practically all the known factors : iron , manganese , sodium , potassium , magnesium , calcium , carbonates , sulfates and nitrates , and a variety of softening agents . Also - and most important from the public-health standpoint-it shows that addition of chlorine and fluorides has no effect on heart-artery disease . One clue : the more alkaline the water , the greater the protective effect on human arteries .
