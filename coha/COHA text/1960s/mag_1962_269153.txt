THE hesitation waltz went on last week in Laos . Neutralist Prince Souvanna Phouma flew in from Paris , but threatened that unless he got the neutralist coalition government he wanted by June 15 , he would fly back to France-probably for good . Red Prince Souphanouvong remained in the Communist-held north , issuing occasional bulletins to the effect that he would be delighted to join Souvanna 's coalition . But the other vital ingredients-pro-Western Prince Boun Oum and right-wing General Phoumi Nosavan-were missing . Continuing their junketing round of Southeast Asian nations in search of money and sympathy , the two arrived at Manila , where they got plenty of sympathy . Neutralism , declared President Diosdado Macapagal , " is the gateway to Communism . " He found it incomprehensible , he said , that the U.S. in Laos was giving support to neutralists like Souvanna Phouma and withholding aid from staunch anti-Communists like his guests . <P> The questions raised by Macapagal are frequently heard in the U.S. One reason that the Administration 's answers seem to carry little conviction is that , since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. policy reversals and disagreements . The record : <P> Phase One : Coalition . Though it has a king , a government and an army and can be found on a map , Laos does not really exist . Many of its estimated 2,000,000 people would be astonished to be called Laotians , since they know themselves to be Meo or Black Thai or Khalom tribesmen . It is a land without a railroad , a single paved highway or a newspaper . Its chief cash crop is opium . <P> Laos was dreamed up by French Diplomat Jean Chauvel , who in 1946 was France 's Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs . At the time , France was trying to reassert its authority in Indo-China , whose rebellious inhabitants had no desire to return to their prewar status as colonial subjects . In place of original Indo-China , consisting of various kingdoms and principalities , Paris put together three new autonomous states within the French Union : Viet Nam , Cambodia and Laos . Drawing lines on a map , Chauvel created Laos by merging the rival kingdoms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champassak , whose pretender was consoled by being made permanent Inspector General of the new state . <P> French influence did not long survive the drawing of the map . Nine years later , with the humiliating defeat of Dienbienphu , France withdrew from Indo-China , and the fledgling state of Laos was on its own , along with the other remnant states of partitioned Indo-China . Independence was complicated by the fact that two Laotian provinces were securely in the hands of Communist Pathet Lao bands under Red Prince Souphanouvong . In 1956 his halfbrother , Prince Souvanna Phouma , was chosen Premier and soon integrated the two Red provinces into the kingdom by giving Souphanouvong a Cabinet post . In a subsequent national election , the Reds increased their strength by taking nine of 21 contested seats in the National Assembly .
