He pressed up close to the bar for a good look at the orangutans during his visit to the London Zoo . At that precise moment , one of the apes-Napoleon by name-relieved himself in the direction of His Royal Highness .

" La Dolce Vita 's dead , " explained Gassman , " so I called it the ' California Roman Party ' to honor the foreigners in town . " From the sound of it , La Dolce Vita is alive and well in Rome . Partygoers boogalooed through the night , watched underground flicks , forked in vats of pasta , and things did n't wind up until next morning when the fathers at the next-door theological seminary complained that the racket was disturbing their Sunday services . <P>
