Pending a new revelation , possible at any time , Mormons are committed to a certain degree of built-in segregation : Negroes can not be admitted to the church 's priesthood . For this reason , Mormon missionaries have never tried very hard to make converts in black Africa . Yet Mormons also believe that Negroes may be admitted to the priesthood in heaven . This apparently is good enough for 7,000 Ibibio , Ibo and Efik tribesmen in eastern Nigeria , who have gone ahead to organize their own branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . <P> Nigeria 's saints owe their knowledge of Mormonism to an itinerant team of Church of Christ missionaries who visited the town of Uyo in 1953 and left behind , among other books and tracts , a copy of Joseph Smith 's Own Story . Fascinated by the dramatic life of the Mormon prophet , Anie Dick Obot of Uyo decided to form a branch of the church in Nigeria , and wrote for more information to Mormon headquarters in Salt Lake City . Mormon leaders sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959 dispatched to Africa Elder Lamar Williams , who was much impressed by the Nigerians ' zeal and orthodoxy . Since then , the Nigerian Saints , governed by Obot and a council of 75 elders , have established branches in six cities . <P> Church chiefs are somewhat at a loss on how to deal with their new African converts , especially since the Nigerian government will not give resident visas to any missionaries from the U.S. " This is quite a unique situation , " admits Hugh D. Brown , Mormon first counselor . One problem now is that in the absence of supervision from Utah the Nigerian Saints appear to be deviating somewhat from strict adherence to revelation . Some Nigerian Mormons practice polygamy-forbidden in the U.S. church since 1890-and the converts already seem to have established their own black hierarchy , priests and all . " I do n't have to wait for revelation to know that I am the natural head in Nigeria , " snaps Obot , who is accepted by his elders as their bishop . " Nigerian priests will run their own branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own country . "
