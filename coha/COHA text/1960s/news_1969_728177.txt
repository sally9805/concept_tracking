txt The latest executive nightmare , already spread to epidemic proportions , goes something like this : Widget &; Gadget Corp. , dutifully complying with new Securities and Exchange Commission rules , breaks down its consolidated profit and reveals for the first time how much came from widgets and how much from gadgets , its two lines of business . It turns out that widgets are piling up profits like crazy , but gadgets are pretty sick . Shortly after the report is filed , widget customers start demanding lower prices . Three major companies announce that they are going into the widget business because its " growth opportunities have become apparent . " Angry shareholders storm the corporate headquarters , charging that officers and directors have mismanaged the gadget business . Improbable as it may sound , this " night . mare " is a montage of some of the fears that many executives now are voicing about the SEC 's new rules on detailed profit disclosure . But a closer look at the situation , including talks with SEC officials and executives of companies that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these worries are unfounded . By the same token , it 's agreed that the new rules are n't likely to uncover the wealth of information hoped for by proponents of fuller corporate disclosure . Broadening of Rules Likely The new rules , which became effective Aug. 14 after some four years of deliberation , so far apply only when a company registers stock or debt issues . However , the SEC wants to apply them to the detailed annual financial reports publicly held companies must submit to it . The agency is giving " interested parties " until Nov. 28 to comment on this change , but there 's little doubt that the profit disclosure rules will soon become effective for the annual reports to the agency . " Even if we do n't get around to formalizing the rules until January or so , we can make them retroactive to cover 1969 , " an SEC official says . If the rule is applied to the 1969 reports to the SEC , the breakdowns also would probably show up in the annual reports that shareholders receive . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex about the basic SEC rules that now apply to companies registering securities and that are expected to be extended to annual financial reports . They require each company to report separate sales and pretax profit figures for each line of business that accounts for 10% or more of its total sales or pretax earnings . Any line of business with a loss equaling at least 10% of total pretax profit also is to be singled out . For companies with annual sales of less than $50 million , the breakdown level is 15% of profits or sales instead of 10% . ( A report on sales  --  but not profit  --  similar to that specified by the new rules has been required by the SEC for some time . ) But there are a number of vexing complications , which the SEC admits will have to be ironed out as companies attempt to comply with the new rules . Perhaps the biggest unanswered question is what constitutes a " line of business . " The SEC wo n't define the term . It says that " management , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed position to separate the company into components on a reasonable basis for reporting purposes . " Invitation to Competition ? Many executives seem to think that the SEC is aiming at " product-line reporting , " which conjures up all sorts of horrors for businessmen . Herbert H. Blevins , president of the Financial Executives Institute and a vice president of Merck &; Co. , says that " product-line reporting " could mean a drug maker might have to disclose profits on each product it makes , such as antibiotics or vaccines . Such detailed disclosure " would just welcome in competition , especially in a business with a high rate of new product development , " he says . The SEC already has shown itself to be very lenient in interpreting what a line of business is , however . One of the first companies to be affected by the new rules was Monsanto Co. , based in St. Louis , which went to Washington recently to register $150 million of debentures . Monsanto describes itself as a diversified maker of chemicals , synthetic fibers and plastics . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials argued that its fibers and plastics were so dependent on its chemicals business that they could n't he terl The SEC agreed , and Monsanto was n't required to break down its profit any further than the consolidated total , which amounted to $108.8 million last year . Naturally , Monsanto is pleased with the SEC 's decision , but many others are n't . " The investor is being shortchanged " by this agreement , says Thornton O'glove , a security analyst for Scheinman , Hochstin &; Trotta Inc. , a New York-based stock brokerage firm . " Obviously , Monsanto must know internally the difference in profitability between plastics and chemicals , and their competitors know it , too . It this is the way the ( profit disclosure ) rule is going to be enforced , why bother to have a rule ? " Bangor Punta 's Example The SEC makes it clear , though , that other diversified companies with more distinct lines of business will have to report profit breakdowns . For an example of how such lines of business might be identified , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bangor Punta Corp a widely diversified company that has voluntarily published results of its various operations for the past three years . ( A recent survey of more than 500 annual reports by the Financial Executives Institute showed that 9% reported profit breakdowns . ) In its report , Bangor Punta listed 37 operating units but broke its sales and profits into only eight Categories. , such , as leisure time , fashion fabrics ; qui " agribUldness . " Some of these categories encompassed a somewhat loose grouping of products , The " leisure time " category , for Instance , consisted of nine operating companies making products ranging from luxury cruisers to high school clam rings . Some analysts complain that because each company will be able to define Its own lines of business , the profit breakdowns probably wo n't be comparable from competitor to competitor . They say this means that the SEC rules wo n't help investors choose one stock over another . Another perplexing problem Involved in applying the new rules is how to allocate corporate costs among various lines of business . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portioned out . Take the case of a Midwest firm that makes and services several types of office equipment . The company has five manufacturing plants , each of which makes parts for more than one product . It maintains 250 sales offices , each of which handles all its lines . " Our Chicago office is on Michigan Avenue , a very high-rent area , " says an executive of the concern . " We 're there primarily because the prestige is supposed to be good for equipment sales . But our service men have space there , too . They do n't need the prestige , so why should they have to pay for it ? Should we just divide the rent casts evenly between sales and service , or charge the sales departments *10 a foot and the service guys $5 a foot , or what ? " The SEC does n't have a set answer for such problems , but an official points out that if the allocation of some coats is exceedingly difficult , the breakdown need not be made . " A company may find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , corporate overhead and financing or mortgage interest costs , " the SEC officialsays . " What they will have to do is report the line  --  of-business profit before these costs , and then itemize these costs for the whole company . " ( Bangor Punta , for instance , shows its I profit breakdown " before corporate financial and administrative expenses . " ) Distorting the Results This official continues that the SEC might even challenge companies that allocate such expenditures between lines of business without good reason . " Corporate administrative costs , especially in conglomerates , might not be able to be broken down on any reasonable basis , " he says . Management spends more time on losing lines than on profitable lines , he argues , and if administrative costs were allocated by time spent the results would be distorted because the bad lines would show bigger losses and the good lines higher profits than they should . Despite this leeway on cost allocation , " breaking profits down to a 10% level involves so many arbitrary allocations that the resulting figures wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton D. Silverman , research analyst for Piper , Jaffray &; Hopwood Inc. , a Minneapolis-based brokerage house . Many executives agree . They complain that profit breakdowns that do n't take all coats into account can be misleading because the various lines of businzaz could appear to be more profitable than they actually are . And they worry they 'll have to spend a lot of time explaining their profit breakdown* to shareholders . " The small investor Is rot sophisticated enough to read and correctly Interpret all this information , " contends John J. Hangen , financial vice president of National Cash Register Co , and chairman of the Financial Executives Institute committee on corporate disclosure . " He 's probably right , " agrees an SEC official . " But that 's not to say the small investor might not become sophisticated if he 's exposed to a little of this information . " The SEC also is n't very concerned about corporate complaints that the new rules will result in profitcutting competition or give rise to some of the other problems executives have been speculating about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have n't expertenoed any of these problems . Last month Standard PrUdential Corp. , New York , for the first time reported separate profit results for its eight subaktlaries , including two that had losses . " We got about 100 letters , " says Theodore H. Silbert , chairman , " and not one criticized the contents of the report or our decision to disclose profits . " " We have n't been able to see that profit disclosure has given us any problems in customer relations , shareholder relations , employe morale or competition , " says a spokesman for Bangor Punta . " It only makes en impression the first time . After that it 's ho-hum . " Still , there may be some justification for executive worries that the SEC may later require more and more disclosure . The SEC disclaims any such intention , but executives point out that as recently as 1966 the SEC 's official position was that profit breakdowns like those it now requires were n't necessary . But pressure from Congress and analysts was applied , leading to development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into changing their minds once they can be pressured into it again , " says one executive . Such pressure no doubt exists , although it is probably less ? intense under President Nixon - titan under former President Johnson . As he was leaving office , President Johnson received a report from the staff of a committee he had appointed to study price stability . The study claimed that the new SEC rules appear " to fall short of the degree of specificity required to provide the public with adequate information . " It recommended that companies be required to report profit by " product categories " instead of " line of business " and that the profit breakdown minimum of 10% be lowered to 6%.
