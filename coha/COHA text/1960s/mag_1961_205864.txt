Early in the subzero night , alarms flashed in three fire stations dotted across the lonely Idaho Falls test site of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission . Fire crews raced toward the gloomy silo housing the experimental nuclear reactor that the Army calls SL-1 ( Stationary Low No. 1 ) , suddenly ground to a halt at the silo door when their detection equipment registered lethal radiation . Lead-suited rescue workers took over , but inside the reactor room radiation was up to 1,000 roentgens an hour ( 450 is a man-killing dose ) . They could stay inside for just a few moments at a time-long enough to haul out one man who still showed signs of life . Moments later he was dead . Two others were already beyond help , their bodies shattered by an explosion that had wrecked the reactor . <P> The SL-1 , designed to supply heat and power for Arctic DEW-line outposts , had been running successfully and efficiently for 2 years , had been shut down for overhaul for two weeks . It was equipped with every built-in safeguard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What went wrong with SL-1 ? Although technicians could stay in the building for only brief periods , everything they saw suggested that the impossible had happened : the reactor had suddenly boiled up in a runaway atomic reaction . In thousandths of a second , its water coolant had been turned into superheated steam that ruptured the reactor tank . Best guess was that some of the cadmium control rods ( which are inserted to stop the nuclear reaction ) had somehow been lifted out of position . <P> The answer to the explosion was more than a matter of passing interest . Private light and power companies believe that atomic power will never be economically feasible unless reactors can be built close to cities to reduce power transmission costs . Many a city is chary about admitting this forerunner of the atomic future . As they searched for explanations , AEC agents ran up against another sorrowful problem of the atomic age : What to do with the bodies of Seabee Electrician Richard Legg , 26 , Army Specialist John Byrnes III , 22 , and Army Specialist Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will have to be buried in lead coffins in some secluded area or consigned to the sea .
