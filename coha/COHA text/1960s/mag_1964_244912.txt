One grey morning in Buenos Aires last week a milling throng of 3,000 massed in front of the River Plate Club . Shuffling and shivering in the cold of the South American winter , they waited neither for soccer nor for revolution , but for a court of law to convene . No ordinary courtroom could have held all the clamoring creditors of Alberto Abraham Natin , 55 , a dapper , moonfaced real-estate wheeler-dealer who was charged with fraud and faced with bankruptcy . Before the crowd , seated at a stand draped in dark red felt , was a stern-faced federal judge . After months of delays and postponements , the time of decision had finally come in one of Argentina 's most notorious financial scandals . <P> Flamboyant Stock Hawking . In Argentina 's inflation-plagued economy , businessmen know bankruptcy almost as well as success . The commerce courts are clogged with tangled litigation ; 1,780 bankruptcies were declared in 1962 . But no other financial empire has fallen with as resounding a crash as Natin 's . Only four years ago , Natin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Organization for Trade , Administration , Property and Real Estate Representation-or simply ONAPRI . <P> Then in a flamboyant , stock-hawking promotion , Natin held out promises of fantastic future profits in construction and real estate , enlisted glamorous TV and movie celebrities as initial backers . <P> ONAPRI became the hottest piece of paper in the country , and Natin had no trouble selling $16 million worth of stock to 13,000 workers , socialites and laden ladies . <P> <P> The disenchantment was swift . During Argentina 's 1962 recession , stockbrokers hauled Natin into court to collect their commissions , and investors stormed the courts in panic . Natin was bounced in and out of jail three times on various charges of fraud , bad checks and " economic delinquency . " <P> Cheers &; Handcuffs . At the first mass hearing last May , about 10,000 creditors showed up , as much to see the pudgy operator as to hear a report of ONAPRI 'S financial plight . When he appeared , handcuffed to two policemen , his creditors cheered loudly . Natin , the court determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in assets . But the court agreed to call another meeting to let the stockholders decide by a vote whether he should be given a chance to settle his debts or be declared bankrupt . <P> Natin figured he had a chance . At the meeting last week , he made one last plea for a concordato-an agreement to withhold bankruptcy proceedings . He asked for two years : " ONAPRI can recover its position if it is permitted to continue operating . " In secret balloting , some 7,600 creditors favored giving Natin his time , but the margin was short of the required two-thirds . Natin 's empire was declared bankrupt , and Natin went back to jail .
