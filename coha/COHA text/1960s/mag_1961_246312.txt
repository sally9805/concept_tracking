Nikki , Wild Dog of the North ( Buena Vista ) . Disney in the raw is seldom mild , but the **36;1955;TOOLONG set does n't mind . This incessantly violent , incessantly beautiful adaptation of James Oliver Curwood 's Nomads of the North will delight every ten-year-old who ever wrestled his pillow and pretended it was a grizzly bear . <P> Filmed in color in the Kananaskis Valley , a spectacular slash in the Canadian Rockies , the picture describes the early life and hard times of a pup of the Malemute breed ( seven parts Husky , one part wolf ) . As the story starts , the pup lies playfully tussling with a black bear cub in the bottom of a canoe . All at once the canoe capsizes , and the two wobbly whippersnappers are flung into the river , washed over a waterfall . When at last they struggle ashore , pup and cub are alone in the great north woods , far from human help but entirely too close for comfort-they are tied together by a six-foot leather leash . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch on the man-walks-dog routine , a kindergarten course in the divergence of species , and possibly even a sly political charade with special interest for those nations that are tied to a bear . When the pup leaps off in pursuit of a wood rat , the cub just sits there on his little bear behind and wonders vaguely what all the barking is about , so the rat gets away and the pup goes hungry . The bear on the other hand finds plenty to eat - berry bushes and beehives ca n't run away . And while the cub is getting honey , the pup is getting stung . At night , when the pup settles down for some shut-eye on a nice soft patch of grass , the bear climbs the nearest tree . Dawn finds the dog 's muzzle sleeping blissfully on the grass , while his rump , caught in the leash , sleeps fitfully about 18 inches off the ground . <P> Eventually , of course , familiarity breeds content-one night at bedtime the little darlings , like many well-trained Disney animals , exchange a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl say ah and every little boy say ugh . Fortunately for the little boys , the cord is soon cut , and the pup runs off to bigger and bloodier adventures involving a vicious wolverine , a great big nasty old grizzly bear , a number of extraordinarily large and healthy timber wolves who have obviously had their teeth shined up by the studio dentist , and a peculiar vertical animal called Man . As described by Naturalist Disney , Man falls into two subspecies . There 's the good guys , and there 's the bad guys .
