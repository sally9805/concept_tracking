On the theory that hard liquor would only bring out the savage in the black man , South Africa 's white bosses for years have sternly forbidden intoxicants to the Africans . All the natives are allowed is thick , weak " kaffir beer " sold for seven cents per pint at government beer halls . <P> But law or no law , the Africans seem to get all the liquor they want . The more opulent buy cheap South African brandy for $3 to $4 a bottle from white bootleggers who pick it up at $1.68 in the whites-only stores . The rest drink their troubles away at the illicit drinking parlors of " shebeen queens . " wealthy black matrons who serve a throat-scalding , home-distilled brew made by boiling together potato peelings , berries and sometimes a dash of methylated spirits . <P> Since such skull-popping potions are occasionally fatal and almost always produce violence , the harried police spend much time raiding the stills , breaking up gang battles and arresting drunks . Some 25% of all arrests and prosecutions in South Africa are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to court , including 1,602 arrests of Africans for possessing yeast without a permit . <P> Out of the blue , Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd 's government introduced a bill in parliament to open liquor stores to all natives over 18 , and authorizing the establishment of cocktail bars in African locations . The police have long been urging the government to modify the antidrinking laws , arguing that a native allowed to imbibe openly might imbibe more moderately . But some observers concluded that Verwoerd was at last feeling the heavy pressure of African resentment at his harsh apartheid rules , and was trying a minor concession . <P> Grape farmers and distillers were delighted at the prospect of a vast new market , but most whites were shocked . <P> <P> THE NATION GASPS AT WIDE CONCESSIONS , headlined the Rand Daily Mail , and the head of the temperance movement cried , " I can see only evil arising from this measure . . . Africans do n't drink to enjoy it . . . they drink to get drunk . " Angriest of all were the shebeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsalable when their thirsty black customers finally could walk around the corner and buy the real stuff .
