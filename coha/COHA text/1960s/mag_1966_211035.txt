ARMED FORCES <P> Twelve years ago last month , Brigadier General Bernard Schriever went to Inglewood , Calif. , to start the Air Force 's then-secret Western Development Division , a title roughly as revealing as that of the Manhattan Project , which built the atom bomb . Schriever 's mission was to turn the drawing-board concept of a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile into lethal reality-and fast . Intelligence estimates showed that the Russians had powerful rocket boosters that might enable them to get a commanding weaponry lead over the U.S. <P> With the Pentagon 's top priority , generous appropriations from Congress and Schriever 's skilled midwifery , the project successfully gave birth to a whole family of missiles , the most recent of which is the Minuteman , current mainstay of the Strategic Air Command . Schriever rode his missiles to four-star rank and leadership of the Air Force Systems Command , where , at the early age of 50 , he became his service 's No. 1 technocrat . But last week , under a broiling sun and a flyover of 19 jet planes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parade salute at Andrews Air Force Base , Md. , and went into premature retirement . <P> Different Approaches . The ICBM was only one of his accomplishments . Schriever thought out and proposed the creation of the Systems Command itself-with " authority to plan , budget , program and control the research and development effort of the Air Force " - ten years before becoming its first chief in 1961 . Under him , the command managed a wide assortment of complex programs and projects that ranged from aerospace medical research to combat and transport aircraft , from an automated ground guidance system for interceptor operations to military communications satellites . The Systems Command also worked out administrative techniques , now being widely copied by other Government agencies , for shepherding new technical projects from the planning stage to full-fledged operation . <P> Nonetheless , Schriever had his frustrations . Although he was a young bomber-flying colonel in World War II , subsequent noncombat assignments took him out of the running to be Air Force Chief of Staff . And like many other senior officers , particularly in the Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McNamara . Schriever believes that if the U.S. is to maintain its military superiority , it must sometimes gamble large sums on chancy projects . McNamara 's philosophy is that the need for expensive new weapons and other equipment must first be objectively proved to his satisfaction . " I have tried and tried , " Schriever said recently , " but he wo n't listen to me . " <P> Discreet Complaints . Schriever 's difficulties with McNamara were hardly unique and will likely be experienced by his successor , General James Ferguson , 53 , whose last job was deputy chief of staff for research and development . While many other prominent service leaders clashed loudly with their civilian superiors in the Defense Department , Schriever was discreet about his complaints . Apparently he intends to continue being that way as he begins a new career as a Washington-based industrial consultant . Unlike the bevy of generals who got the last word in their arguments with civilian superiors by writing mem oirs , Technocrat Schriever plans to pub lish nothing more controversial than a manual on the Systems Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
