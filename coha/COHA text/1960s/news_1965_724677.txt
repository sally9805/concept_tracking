txt BIDS CONGRESS ACT Calls for Inquiry and Plans Bill to Curb Hooded Society ' Text of Johnson statement is printed on Page 11 . By CHARLES MOHR Specie/ to The NOW York Times WASHINGTON , March 26 ? President Johnson declared war on the Ku Klux Klan today after announcing the arrest of four Klansmen in connection with the slaying last night of a white woman civil rights worker in Alabama . In a dramatic television appearance , the President warned members of the Klan to get out of the white supremacy organizations that bear that name " before it is too late . " He promised to offer legislation to bring the Ku Klux Klan " under effective control of law " and suggested a Congressional investigation of this " hooded society of bigots . " Mr. Johnson was in frequent contact during the night with J. Edgar Hoover , director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , in connection with the shooting of Mrs. Viola Gregg Liuzzo . The victim had been transporting Negro demonstrators to Selma after the civil rights march from Selma to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men arrested by the F.B.I . today in Birmingham , Ala. , as Eugene Thomas , 43 years old , of Bessemer , Ala. ; William Orville Eaton , 41 , of Bessemer ; Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. , 31 , of Birmingham , and Collie LeRoy Wilkins Jr. , 21 , of Fairfield , Ala . Mr. Johnson said the four men were being charged with the Federal crime of conspiring to violate Mrs. Liuzzo 's civil rights . They could not be charged with murder by Federal officers . In Birmingham the four Klansmen were arraigned on the Federal charge and jailed . Later three of them were released in $50,000 bail each . Fought Klan ' All My Life ' Mr. Johnson appeared in the white and gold East Room of the White House at 12:40 P.M. , flanked by Mr. Hoover and Attorney General Nicholas deB . Katzenhach . The President 's manner was almost sorrowfully solemn and his tone was one of controlled indignation as he denounced the Ku Klux Klan and " the horrible Icrime " that cost Mrs. Liuzzo her life . Of Klansmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' years ago in Texas and I have fought them all my life because I believe them to threaten ' the peace of every community where they exist . I shall continue fight them because I know their loyalty is not to the United States of America but instead to a hooded society of bigots . " " So if Klansmen hear , my voice today , " Mr. Johnson said , " let it be both an appeal and a warning to get out of the Ku // Johnson Opens Fight on Klan After F.B.I .

" Mr. Johnson said that the four arrested men were members of the United Klan of America , Knights of the Ku ' Klux Klan ; the largest of a number " of Ku Klux Klan organizations . Total Klan membership has been estimated at from 48,000 to 65,000 , Meanwhile , the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been used to . protect civil rights demonstrators would be defederalized and Regular Army units would be withdrawn from such duty in the state . Withdrawal Could he Halted The White House said that the withdrawal of Federal military protection in Alabama would be " orderly and each step taken in light of conditions as they exist . " This could mean that violence could halt the withdrawal . About half the federalized Guardsmen will be released from Federal duty by midnight tomorrow , the White House said , and the others " as soon as practicable . " No exact timetable was given for removing Regular Army units . Representative Edwin E. Willis , Democrat of Louisiana , who is chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee , said in response to the President 's suggestion that he would probably call a meeting of the committee next week to consider whether to investigate the Klan . This afternoon , Mr. Johnson made a telephone call of condolences to the slain woman 's husband , Anthony J. Limo in Detroit , where Mr. Liuzzo is a business agent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liuzzo , the 39-year-old mother of five children , was shot on the road from Selma to Montgomery several hours after the voting-rights march on that same highway ended . She had taken one load of civil rights marchers back to Selma and was returning for a second load when she was shot from another car . Mr. Johnson 's mood was described by his associates as one of " sheer , wrath " when he learned of the slaying and the suspected involvement of Klan members . In his public appearance , he said he had asked Attorney General Katzenbach " to proceed at the earliest possible date " to develop legislation to control the Klan . He said he hoped the bill could be submitted as soon as the voting-rights bill passed Congress . Informed sources said it was not possible to predict at this point what form the anti-Klan/ legislation would take . These sources said it would be very difficult to draft effective legislation because of the need to protect the constitutional rights of free assembly and association . One approach . they said , might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society that advocates and promotes crime and violence . The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations recently recommended making it a Federal crime to belong to such criminal societies as the Mafia , and there is some thought that it might be possible to broaden such a law to include Klan activities . Deplores Hooded Societies In the main , Mr. Johnson 's remarks today were aimed not at individuals but at what he saw as the evil of hooded . vigilante societies . He said that Mrs. Liuzzo had ' gone to Alabama to " serve the struggle for justice . " " She was murdered . by the ) enemies of justice who for decades have used the rope and the gun and the tar and the feathers ' to terrorize their neighbors , ' " Mr. Johnson said with an almost frightening coolness in his voice . " They struck by ' night , as they generally do , for their purpose can not stand the light of day . " Reporters who saw a copy of Mr. Johnson 's typed text noted that he had written in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praises Hoover and Fill . " I can not express myself too strongly in praising Mr. Hoover and the men of the F.B.I . for their prompt and expeditious handling of this investigation , ' the President said . " It is in keeping with the dedicated approach that this organization has shown throughout the turbulent era of civil rights controversies . " Mr. Johnson said he would make all the resources of the Federal Government available to any Congressional investigation of the Klan . The question of an investigation by the Un-American Activities Committee was raised earlier this year by a new member of the panel , Representative Charles L. Weltner , Democrat of Georgia . The committee staff was instructed in February to make a preliminary study of whether such an investigation would be legal and desirable . In the past , the panel has concentrated on investigations of Communist subversion . The chairman , Mr. Willis , said today , " I intend , in due course , ! to call the members together , Ito make my report and received direction from the committee ' whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ! committee 's staff director , said , the question was whether the committee 's jurisdiction ex- ' , tended to organizations like the Klan . As stated in House Rule 11 , the committee is to Investigate organizations " engaged in the diffusion within the U. S. of subversive and un-American propaganda , instigated from , foreign countries or of domestic ! origin , which attacks the principle of the form of government as guaranteed by the Constitution . " Part of the reason for Mr. Johnson 's strong revulsion for the Klan may be found in his childhood . In the nineteen-twenties , the Klan was a major political issue in Texas , and Mr. Johnson 's father was a crusading enemy of the organization as a member of the Texas Legislature . Some persons . were tarred and feathered by the Klan near Mr. Johnson 's home in Johnson City , his father was threatened and Mr. Johnson often feared for his father 's safety . The President took and made telephone calls on the Liuzzol case during the night until about 1:30 A.M. today . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that arrests would ) soon be made .
