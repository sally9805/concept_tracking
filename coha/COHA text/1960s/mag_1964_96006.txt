I do n't even like horses . This is n't a sport . It 's a business . " That is the opinion of Howard ( Buddy ) Jacobson , who is not a disgruntled horseplayer but the leading trainer in the U.S. Jacobson leaned against the cement-block wall of Barn 10 at Aqueduct recently and continued : " It 's a tremendous way to make a living . You have a healthy life , a chance for advancement . You have Florida in the winter and New York the rest of the year . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What else could you ask for ? " // Buddy Jacobson is the 33-year-old son of a Brooklyn hat merchant , and he runs his public stable like a hat factory , heedless of the " sport " and long-cherished traditions . June has just begun , and Jacobson already has handled more than $l million in operating a 35-horse establishment . Each animal under his shed row is there to make money for one of his 16 owners and to make as much money as possible as fast as possible . // " I like to trade horses , " Jacobson says . " You 've got to be active in this business to do well . You ca n't sit still . You 've got to run your horses , and a man has got to wheel and deal in those claiming races . You ca n't have an attachment to a horse . Except for rare cases like Kelso , no horse holds valuable form more than six months . He may be worth $6,000 in January and only $2,500 in the fall . " // Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which any horse can be claimed for a specified price ) , and Jacobson sees them as " the backbone of the business , " he has concentrated his efforts in this field . Since January 1 he has claimed 30 horses worth $182,750 and has had 35 others , valued at $268,000 , claimed from him . Thus Jacobson 's stock is constantly changing . There is a 75% turnover in the merchandise every five months . // All this trading back and forth assures the smart operator of having fresh , active stock able to win races regularly . Horsemen complain that the Jacobsons of racing claim a man 's horse when it is just fit and ready to win and then discard the horse when it is no longer useful . Jacobson replies , " They claim as many horses of mine as I do of theirs . It 's a game any number can play . " // Last year he started 688 horses , won 140 races and $730,418 . He led the country in winners and was second to Mesh Tenney ( who trained only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money-earned standings . So far this year Jacobson has won 60 of 258 races and $345 , - 300 . " A trainer 's value to racing , " Jacob-son says , " should be judged by the number of horses he sends to the post . If you do n't run I do n't think it 's fair to the people in the business , the owners . They foot the bills . The sporting thing to do in this business is win money , whether in claiming races or in The Futurity . If you go fishing the sporting thing to do is catch fish . If you race it 's to win cash . " This is Jacobson 's reason for being in racing , and he follows established custom only when it benefits the bank account . " If they put on kangaroo racing , I 'd claim some kangaroos , " he says . " I go along with the association . Whatever kind of horses they write races for , that is the kind that will be in my barn . I claim different horses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses are distance or turf runners , the better-class animal that runs for around $10,000 . Up here the best horses you can have in the spring and late fall are cheap $3,500 claimers and 3-year-olds who go three-quarters of a mile . In the summer in New York you have to have half a stable of 2-year-olds to be successful . The races then are all made for 2-year-olds . I do n't make the rules . The association does . I 've got to play it their way . You know , my horse Bupers won The Futurity here last year Jacobson had bought him privately for $16,500 a month before . He took home $91,000 in that one race , $20,000 more than Kelso won in the Woodward a week later . Now , if you think my horse deserved to win more than Kelso , you 're screwy . He should have been winning a $10,000 purse . But that 's the way the business works . " // The chart opposite analyzes two typical weeks of racing and claiming activity by Jacobson . In that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer , from stakes to $3,500 claimers , and he raced stock every racing day but one ( he has had only four blank days since moving north from Florida ) . What is more , every day he had a starter the stable won money . Jacobson used eight different jockeys . He claimed seven horses worth $41,500 and had six taken from him valued at $43,750. // Now that he is established as a trainer and has a ready supply of owners interested in investing money , Jacobson does not limit himself to claimers . Last January he bought Treasure Chest , a full sister to the 1959 2-year-old filly champion My Dear Girl , for $70,000 in the Hialeah 2-year-old sale . " There are very few horses worth $30,000 or $40,000 , " he says . " They are usually worth $20,000 or $100,000 . There 's not much in between . I want to shoot for that better type of horse . If she 's the fourth or fifth best 2-year-old filly in the country , she 'll be a bargain . " What Jacobson also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year  --  the four-time stakes winner Golden Joey , a fat butterball of chestnut that has broken two track records without even trying . Jacobson also has the stakes winner Charspiv , which he claimed for $16,000 nearly two years ago and with whom he has won $80,000 . Since mid-March he has won five stakes , a handicap , an allowance race and a maiden event . He has had nine wins with claimers valued between $10,000 and $16,000 , nine wins with $6,250-to-$9,500 horses and nine with $3,500-to-$5,000 runners . " I like to have a diversified barn , " he explains . " Not too many horses of the same caliber . You 'll rarely see me running entries . Why run against yourself ? I do n't see any point in it . I usually claim horses that the fans like . Often I pick a horse that 's a big favorite . But I consider the time of the year and the potential for the horse at the time . There 's no Christmas . Those big stables do n't sell you a horse unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not limit his claiming activity to flat horses . He also takes steeplechasers . " But that 's seasonal , " he says . " Steeplechasing is the best game there is . There ought to be more of it . That 's what horse racing is  --  through the fields , over a fence , across a creek . " Jacobson believes that steeplechase horses and jockeys are superior to the merry-go-round performers on the flat , and it is ironic that the steeplechasing fraternity does not appreciate his enthusiastic endorsement . In 1959 he claimed his first steeplechaser , Sinn Feiner , and thereby shocked the tweedy set , who had been entering their horses in jumping claimers for years but , in gentlemanly fashion , never claiming each other 's horses . They now watch nervously to see when Jacob-son will sweep down and seize the horses they have nurtured and schooled carefully for years . // Jacobson is suspect also simply because he has been too successful . But , as Aqueduct 's racing secretary , Tommy Trotter , says , " He 's smart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more carefully than other trainers . When he claims a horse , he already has a race picked out for him , and Buddy does not abuse his horses . He does not run them every other day . If they train off , he ships them out to his farm and freshens them . " // Sixteen years ago Jacobson was walking " hots " for his uncle , Trainer Eugene Jacobs , for $25 a week . Last year he cleared $100,000 . He takes a stand at the end of his barn at 7 a.m. and watches his horses walked around the barn by exercise boys and hot walkers . The night before , he has mapped out the morning work for each horse . " You can run through the whole lot in two hours in the morning if you have an idea of future plans , " he says . " Of course , you have to be flexible . A horse walks by , I check him out . I ca n't see any more in 10 minutes than I can in 10 seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scheduled . If you get too close to the situation , you ca n't see . You only get a clear picture if you stand away . I do n't get too involved . I treat it like a business . " // Jacobson treats his owners in the same disinterested manner . They pay him $21 per day to board , train and care for each horse , and they give him full discretion in racing , buying and selling their stock . Jacobson is responsible . " When a horse does n't win , it is because I made a mistake , " he says . " And I make a lot of mistakes . It 's up to me to make the decisions . A jockey may lose a race for you , but he ca n't win one for you . That 's my responsibility . " // Jacobson 's assortment of owners is representative of the new men in racing . Among them are a stockbroker , a dentist , a motel proprietor , a shoe manufacturer , two electronic industrialists , and a builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the largest apartment-construction firms in the world . Lefrak , nattily attired and well-perfumed , showed up at Jacobson 's barn a few mornings ago . A reporter asked him why he raced horses . Immediately he replied , " For the improvement of the breed . " Then he paused . " And to win the Kentucky Derby , " he continued . Jacobson had commented a little while before , " When new owners first come into the business they always say to you , ' I 'm only interested in that good horse . I just want to win the Derby . I 'm not interested in cheap horses . ' But if you buy them horses and then do n't run them , they complain . Winning keeps them happy . // " Racing is an entertainment show put on for the public . The amount of money bet affects what races are run . And the bookkeeping ! You spend more time with your bookkeeper than with the horses . " Businessman Buddy Jacobson looked up and grinned . " It must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when you sat behind a table with a pile of money and paid each guy off in cash . "
