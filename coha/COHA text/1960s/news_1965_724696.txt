txt Washington Eugene R. Black 's highly publicized mission to Southeast Asia must be more than an American propaganda device . Knowing this , President Johnson 's aim is a solid social and economic welfare program for Asia that has a sound international base . This is why United States diplomacy is hard at work seeking ' the cooperation of the United Nations in lifting the region 's standard of living . President Johnson 's offer of $1 billion worth of aid to Asia , Congress willing , is designed to prime the economic pumps of Asian nations . ? This whole Johnson-propelled program is in its prenatal stage . For example , the Agency for International Development ( AID ) has no specific projects on hand that could use-any of the announced $1 billion . ? The vast Mekong lower basin project is apparently central to the Johnson administration 's thinking on the increased aid . The UN probably will administer the program within the existing framework of the UN 's . Economic Commission for the Far East . Already $67 million has been spent on or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . South Vietnam , Cambodia , and Thailand . UN agencies and 21 nations are making contributions . Studies under way Two-thirds of the S67 million has gone into surveys and studies . This tenth biggest river in the world within two or three years will be at a stage when major financing will be necessary . Several large darns will move into construction . These costs will reach into the billions . For example , the dam planned at Pa Mong which will benefit Thailand 's northeast and central Laos will cost $500 million . Under UN auspices the United States is extremely active in the Mekong project . Americans are making depth and flow // *Asian aid zone surveyed // studies . Also the United States Army Engineers are planning soil maps , mineral inventories , and road and topographic profiles . Mainstream projects on the Mekong are at Sambor and on the Tonle Sap in Cambodia , and at Pa Mong on the border of Laos and Thailand . Sambor could provide 10 times the volume of electricity produced in Cambodia today . Tonle Sap is a complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to raise the level of the river for navigation , and the elimination of salt water in the delta . Work on tributaries Pa Mong alone could irrigate about 2,500 , - 000 acres . When finished it would do more than a quarter of what the Bureau of Reclamation has accomplished in 62 years . Dams of five Mekong tributaries now are under construction : Nam Pong in northeast Thailand was made possible by a West German loan of $11 million with the Thai 's investing $7 million . Nam Pung , also in the northeast , is financed completely by Bangkok . Prek Thnot in Cambodia has been financed by Japan , Israel , Australia , and France . Lower Se Done and Nam Dong , both in Laos , are being improved to give electricity to Pakse and Luang Prabang . Altogether in the Mekong basin 54 teams of UN experts are at work . Their work fits into a master plan and includes navigation improvement , channel marking , dredging , experimental and demonstration farms , mineral surveys , and fishery and forestry studies . Payable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting economic plans are for an Asian development bank . This bank would extend from Iran to New Zealand . The bank is not expected to be formed for at least another year . It will begin with a capitalization of $1 billion . Not only Asian nations but the United States , the United Kingdom , France , West Germany , the Soviet Union , and the Netherlands will invest in the bank . Asians are learning a good deal from the Inter-American Bank . The United States has a 40 percent investment in the Latin-American institution . In Asia it will be closer to 20 percent . The Americans have offered $200 million . The first half would be payable in $25 million allotments over the first four years . Another all-Asia project which has special meaning for Southeast Asia is the Asian highway . This rather glamorous road , when finished , will run from Istanbul to Saigon . The road is actually 96 percent finished . Long stretches of it are dirt . Now it is possible . to take a bus from Calcutta to Istanbul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has refused American aid , saying that they will build the road with their own funds " some day . " Economists believe that the Istanbul-Saigon road will open up a significant trade route . It will have special importance for the hinterlands . Food and fiber President Johnson in his Baltimore speech spoke of speeding up a program for food and clothing for the needy of Asia . The United States farm surplus is administered under Public Law 480 and officials are already working up plans for a wider distribution of food and fiber in Asia . Only South Vietnam receives substantial amounts of food under PL 480 . About $71 million was spent there under PL 480 last year . Laos received an allotment of $1,700,000 last year . Thailand and Cambodia received nothing . If the United States should ever decide to . give aid to North Vietnam PL 480 would be the simplest and easiest program to administer . PL 480 takes only a small staff in'tha recipient nation . Malaria control has been especially successful in the Philippines and on Formosa under a World Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Asia . Rural electrification is being studied in Korea , the Philippines , and Thailand . The Black team will find a practical use for rural electricity throughout Southeast Asia . This short survey of possible aid for Southeast Asia on a wider scale points toward the needs the Black team will encounter . The Johnson administration sees the role of the former head of the World Bank as a scout not an administrator . Only after he returns from Asia , and pending developments on Vietnam negotiation , will the United States seriously think of appropriating the first chunk of the promised $1 billion .
