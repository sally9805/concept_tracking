Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Dec. 10 , at the invitation of  --  the U.N . Economic and Social Council , the United States is to join with other countries in the world in inaugurating Human Rights Week and in celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the U.N . Declaration on Human Rights . In the past these events typically have been restricted to innocuous ceremonial displays . Rarely have they been of genuine significance I either to the communities in which they have been held or to the issues Ito which they have been directed . ' This year it is imperative to use this occasion for a precise appraisal of the status of international human rights and of the opportunities that have been taken ? more often missed  --  by our own country to contribute toward their enhancement and improvement . The fact is that the United States has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights . For the past ten years we have followed a policy of abstinence , first inaugurated by Secretary of State Dulles in April , 1953 , in an effort to stave off the attempt by Senator John Bricker to impose limitations upon the Executive treaty-making power . To appease the Bricker forces , Secretary Dulles assured the Senate that the United States would not offer for ratification any U.N . treaties touching upon human rights in any form . Indifference Generated And this guarantee has been rigidly carried out . It has immobilized American participation in the international protection of human rights . It has had a disabling effect internally within the United Nations upon numerous treaties that are long pending and awaiting discussion . Our publicly proclaimed abdication not only of leadership but of support has helped generate an attitude of universal indifference . But it is heartening that in one of his last Presidential messages President Kennedy took firm steps to change these restrictive policies . In July our late President sent to the Senate for ratification three separate U.N . conventions in the field of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forced labor , and the protection of the political rights of women . In his accompanying message he repudiated the concept of isolationism in human rights that has guided our national practice for the past ten years ; that , for example , has caused such measures as the Genocide Convention to remain locked in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee without action since 1951 , despite extensive public hearings and its own subcommittee 's favorable report . Values Cited Our ratification of the conventions will yield at least three practical benefits to ' the United States : It will attract wide attention abroad among nations whose support we solicit and will encourage similar commitments by other states , especially some of the newly independent countries who look toward the UN . conventions as a model for their own domestic practices . It will empower us as a contracting party to call attention to those countries that may have ratified the conventions but have failed to implement them in practice . It will restore to us the necessary credentials to influence in the future the drafting of other international legal norms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of Human Rights little has been done to act upon its terms . This way at least we can begin . PHIL BAWL Director , Commission on International Affairs , American Jewish Congress . New York , Dec. 6 , 1963. * To End Ticket Scalping To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Collusion between box-office treasurers and theater ticket agencies has existed for many years . The public must share the guilt , since it is responsible for keeping this shameful practice alive . The person who pays for his tickets out of an expense account can afford to pay exorbitant prices in order to make " a big impression , " while the person who can not afford even the legitimate agency fee ( $1.50 ) must be satisfied with side and rear seats left at the box office after the agencies ( and countless other " insiders " ) have received the choice seats . The investigation by the Internal Revenue Service two years ago served only to send the collusion further underground . The State Attorney General must put a stop to this conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six times the box office price would prefer not to ; and very few.of these people are aware that the agent front whom they purchase their tickets is only one of mans who will receive a part of the money Unless Mr. Lefkowitz starts at the source  --  with those men who receive the " ice " and dictate who will sit where in a theater  --  and unless lit places the proper control upon the sale and allotment of theater tickets any investigation is futile . He will have to seek his fact ) outside of this conspiracy , for n ; one involved in it is going to cut off his nose to spite his face  --  espe daily when all previous investiga tions of this kind have failed to ( have any constructive effect .

Leavens Executive Director of the Citizen ! Budget Commission , published ii your issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $43,800,001 stated by him to have been paid 13 : real estate taxpayers during till year ended June 30 as " water rev enue , " and in describing the excess of the total of such taxes plus the amount paid by water users ove : the operating expenses of the wate : system as a " surplus . " In my opinion it would be mots nearly in accord with generally ac cepted principles of enterprise ac counting and finance to describe th , $43,800,000 paid by taxpayers a " real estate taxes for payment o interest on and amortization o water debt , " and to describe the ex cess of the sum of the operating ex penses and the interest on ant amortization of the water debt ove the revenue collected from wate users as " a deficit of $19,600,001 paid out of real estate taxes . " The Bureau of Water Supply fol lows what has been suggested ahoy , as the correct procedure . In the annual report of the bureau to th ' Commissioner of Water Supply , Ga. : and Electricity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ( which I have had access ) , it wa , stated : " Cost of Water Supply : " The cost of operating and main taining the water supply system fos the fiscal year July 1 , 1960 , to Jun , 30 , 1961 , was $23,766,513.20 . Interest and sinking fund charges amounte ( to $45,229,510.70 . " The total receipts from the salt of water and miscellaneous charge : for the fiscal year 1960-61 amountec to $51,995,444.61 . These figures in ? dicate a deficit of $17,000,579.29 . " MAURICE R. SCHARFF , P.E. , New York . Nov. 29. 1963 . Light at Kennedy Grave To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEs Everyone who saw on television the simple and moving ceremony it which Mrs. Kennedy lighted a flame on her husband 's grave in Arlington Cemetery must have been deeply touched by her desire to mark the spot where his body lies by a symi bol of man 's eternal spirit . We share her feeling and her det sire , but wonder whether thought has been given to what would happen if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or soldier of any rank buried in Arlington Cemetery or any other cemetery , should be marked in a similar fashion . If there is to be an eternal light in Arlington , Cemetery , should it not be reserved ( as it is in France ) foi our Unknown Soldiers , who signify every man wh- ' has died for his country , thus maintaining its universality of meaning . Let the flame burn on President Kennedy 's grave during the official period of mourning , as a most fitting tribute to his memory , bearing in mind that his memory will no more be blotted out at the end of the official period of mourning than will the bright flame of his life be dimmed when the flame on his grave no longer burns .
