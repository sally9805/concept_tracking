THE ROAD A big , ugly , edible lizard called the iguana is , in Mexico , more or less what the Thanksgiving turkey is in the U.S. Mexicans catch iguanas , fatten them up , and serve them on festive occasions . Tennessee Williams ' latest play , now in Chicago and headed for Broadway this month , is called The Night of the Iguana . And from all indications last week , despite impressive performances by Margaret Leighton and Bette Davis , it is indeed a massive turkey . <P> Chicago critics have carved it up . The Tribune , for example , found the play " bankrupt . . . barren . . . bleakly dull . " And the Sun-Times called it " something of a dud ... a swollen vignette . . . vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity , padding for the sake of fill , waterfront humor to patch the gaps and the pulpit for preaching . " <P> " Perhaps I 've tried to do too much too quick , " shrugged Williams . " It 's taken a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think it 's time to let up a bit . I know now that I need a long rest before writing anything more , and then I 'll work off-Broadway. "
