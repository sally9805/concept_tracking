When the stock of the Communications Satellite Corp . went on the market six months ago at $20 a share , demand for it was so great that brokers rationed it to 50 shares or less per customer and only the favored few got their piece of space . But professional Wall Streeters generally stood aloof , willing to sell it but not so willing to buy . Comsat might become the bluest of space-age blue chips , they said , but that was many profitless years away . <P> The professionals failed to assess prop erly the romance of space and , as a result , vastly underestimated Comsat 's continued attraction for investors . The stock has been rising almost steadily for three months , and last week it soared in a speculative orbit all its own . <P> Flabbergasted Street . Opening on Monday at 55 , Comsat danced all over the tape as the week 's most active stock , then closed on Friday at 64 ? . The flood of buy orders twice forced the Stock Exchange to delay Comsat 's opening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Federal Communications Commission ordered an " informal " inquiry to make sure that in the speculative rush foreign ownership had not exceeded its 20% legal limit . The stock hit a record high of 66 after Comsat announced plans to start the first commercial service between North America and Europe next May with its " Early Bird " satellite . Wall Streeters were still flabbergasted . " It would have been unpatriotic to expect it to go down , " said Merrill Lynch <P> Vice President La Rue Applegate , " but we never expected this run up . " One big reason for the run up is the stock 's short supply . Half of Comsat 's 10 million outstanding shares have been held from the start by 163 U.S. communications companies ; the others are held by more than 200,000 individuals , most of whom still own fewer than 50 shares each and who show little inclination to part with them . Mutual funds and insurance companies have been grabbing large blocks when they could . <P> The Street had expected many of the initial investors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six-month tax divide , thus causing a big sell-off and falling prices . Professionals thus sold an estimated 100,000 shares short , borrowing the stock to sell at a high price and figuring to repay it at a lower price . But after Dec. 3 , the first date on which investors could take capital gains , the price went higher in stead of lower , forcing short sellers to scramble to cover their losses and sending the stock even higher . Many bro kers , fearing that Comsat could be riding for a fall , got on the telephones last week to warn their customers away .
