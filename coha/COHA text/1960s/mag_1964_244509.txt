SOUTHERN RHODESIA <P> Southern Rhodesia achieved " responsible self-government " more than 40 years ago as a territorial member of the British Commonwealth . But since then , with the emergence of black-ruled independent states throughout Africa , the definition of responsibility has changed . Under Southern Rhodesia 's constitution , only 60,000 of the na tion 's 3,600,000 blacks qualify to vote , and the government remains under the control of a white minority numbering 224,000 . <P> Britain refuses to grant Southern Rhodesia full independence until this inequity is remedied , while Southern Rhodesia 's " cowboy government " - so named because its ruling , white-supremacist Rhodesian Front Party consists mostly of ranchers - threatens to buck rather than submit to the rowels of a black majority . The cowboys say that they will declare independence from Britain unilaterally if they are not granted it this year under the existing constitution . Last week the cowboys kicked out their old range boss , Prime Minister Winston Field , 60 , in favor of a tougher , younger man . <P> Tall &; Humorless . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win from Britain any concessions on the constitutional issue . Outraged , the Rhodesian Front turned to 45-year-old Ian Smith , a rancher from Selukwe who had served as Field 's Minister of Finance . <P> Tall , humorless Ian Douglas Smith is a rough customer . As a Spitfire pilot with the R.A.F. during World War II , he survived a crash that left the right side of his face paralyzed , was later shot down over Italy and fought for five months with Italian partisans behind the German lines . After the war , under former Prime Minister Sir Roy Welensky , Smith served in the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly . But Sir Roy did not believe in complete independence from Britain , and Smith split with him in 1961 . <P> Tear Gas &; Truncheons . Smith 's first act as Prime Minister last week was to arrest African Leader Joshua Nkomo and three officials of his People 's Caretaker Council , whom the government accused of " dragging the country from crisis to crisis . " The arrest triggered riots that brought white cops with tear gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Township . Before the week was out , more than 250 Africans had been arrested . <P> But , if only for tactical reasons , Smith seemed unlikely to declare independence from Britain immediately . His party holds a wafer-thin , five-seat majority in the 65-man Parliament , and he probably will not get parliamentary support for such a move . Moreover , the British now pay preferential prices for Southern Rhodesia 's staple crop of tobacco ; thus , independence might be costly . Hendrik Verwoerd 's government in South Africa sympathizes with Smith 's policies , but Verwoerd has no desire to take on Southern Rhodesia 's economic and military problems in addition to his own .
