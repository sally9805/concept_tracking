For the better part of two centuries , Australian elections have turned on such burning questions as the " kangaroo menace " or the cost of wool on the world market . Not so this week . As some 6,000,000 Australians go to the polls in the first federal election since 1963 , no less an issue than Australia 's role in Asia is at stake . <P> A slambang , month-long campaign between Liberal Prime Minister Harold Holt and his opposition challenger , Labor Party Leader Arthur Calwell , has focused the country 's attention on the key question of Australia 's participation in Viet Nam . Holt , 58 , has committed Australian draftees to the war and Australian prestige to the containment of Asian Communism . Calwell , 70 , demands an end to the draft , a pullback from Viet Nam and the votes of " 600,000 Australian mothers whose boys could die or be wounded in the long , cruel , dirty war . " <P> New Markets . Australia 's awakening to its position in Asia was slow . Most Aussies tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomacy . " Overseas " was that vague , vast stretch of land beyond the Great Barrier Reef , and Britain took care of it . <P> Then , after World War II when American - not British - naval strength saved Australia from the threat of Japanese invasion , Aussies slowly began to come up from down under . In 1939 , Canberra could boast only one " overseas " diplomatic mission ; today , it has more than 50 - almost a third of them located in Asia . <P> Britain 's changing role in world affairs , as much as anything , has been responsible for the Australian awakening . During the Malaya emergency , and later during the Malaysian-Indonesian konfrontasi , when Britain 's " thin red line " was stretched near the breaking point , Australia sent troops to stem Communist guerrilla activity . Britain 's first moves to enter the Common Mar ket also turned Australia toward Asia : <P> the terms of British membership might have cut off Australia 's biggest export market . Since then , Japan has become a major outlet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian wheat . Australia was a leader in founding the Asia Development Bank ( which will elect its first president and board of directors this week in Tokyo ) , and has broadly liberalized its immigration laws to permit easier Asian entry into a society that was once nearly 100% British . At present , more than 14,000 Asian students are studying at Australian universities . <P> Pacific Man . Prime Minister Holt has done much to sensitize Australia to its new-found Asian responsibilities , since he came to power ten months ago . Holt visited Lyndon Johnson in Washington , dropped in on Australia 's 4,500 troops in South Viet Nam , conferred with Saigon 's Premier Nguyen Cao Ky . At the Manila conference last month , Holt was vigorously visible everywhere . Before that , Johnson helped Holt 's election chances mightily with his own brief visit to Sydney .
