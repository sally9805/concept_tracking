Hitachi , Ltd. , the Japanese electrical giant that is equally adept at making tiny transistor radios and huge hydroelectric generators , last week gave the U.S. electrical industry a stinging lesson in how to get U.S. Government contracts . Hitachi won a $612,659 contract to build two 4,500-h.p. hydraulic turbines for the Interior Department 's Blue Mesa power plant in Colorado , and another $3,221,813 contract to supply eight pump turbines for a federal reclamation project in California 's San Joaquin valley . It won the awards simply because its bids ranged from 5% to 41% lower than those of such competing U.S. giants as Allis-Chalmers and Newport News Shipbuilding &; Drydock Co . Hitachi , whose sales in the past five years have increased 280% to last year 's $1 billion , thus made an important advance in its drive to excel in highly industrialized markets .
