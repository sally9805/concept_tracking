For eleven months , when Turks referred to " The Island , " it was understood that they meant Yassiada island , off Istanbul , where former Premier Adnan Menderes , ex-President Celal Bayar and 588 lesser functionaries were on trial , some of them for their lives . Last week the long proceedings on The Island were over , and the end was grim . <P> When General Cemal Gursel and his military junta put Menderes &; Co. on trial last year after seizing power from them in a bloodless coup , the legal case against the ex-Premier and his associates was based on the Turkish penal code , which can prescribe death for those who " attempt by force to change , replace or abrogate the Constitution . " There is no doubt that by vast , showy projects and wild fiscal extravagance , Menderes had brought Turkey close to ruin , and consistently tried to hide the fact by severe press censorship and high-handed rule . But many Turks wondered whether the death penalty was justified for this offense and for the grab bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . Among the charges : inciting anti-Greek riots in 1955 , threatening the life of former Turkish President Ismet Inonu , organizing a riot to destroy a newspaper , profiting from the sale of a dog received as a gift from the King of Afghanistan . <P> Last week , while jet planes roared low overhead , the verdict was announced : death to Menderes , Bayar , two former Ministers and eleven other former government officials . <P> A Thousand Deaths .

Only a few days before , Menderes had observed to a visitor : " Why did n't they kill me right away at the time of the revolt ? This way I die every day . " <P> Most defendants received sentences ranging up to 15 years in jail ; 31 were given life imprisonment , 123 were acquitted , and charges against five were dropped . The death sentences could be reversed by General Gursel 's junta , and there was considerable pressure for reversal . The U.S. and British embassies told the Turkish Foreign Affairs Ministry that they feared serious repercussions if the death sentences were carried out ; Indian Ambassador J. K. Atal called on ex-President Inonu , leader of the Republican Party , asking him to intervene and throw his considerable weight behind a bid for clemency . Inonu refused to interfere . As for the junta , a spokesman had stated before the verdict : " We are n't concerned about foreign opinion .
