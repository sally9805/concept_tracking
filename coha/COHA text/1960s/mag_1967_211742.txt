A SPORT AND A PASTIME by James Salter . 191 pages . Doub/eday. $4.50 . <P> <P> France 's no-longer-new New Novelists have found few imitators in the U.S. James Salter , 40 , is one of the exceptions . His model seems to be Alain Robbe-Grillet , who labors in his books to " construct a space and time purely mental , that of a dream or memory . " Perhaps in tribute , Salter sets his third book in France . His subject is the love affair between Anne-Marie Costallat , an 18-year-old who looks like a child but eats like a dock hand , and young Phillip Dean , a Yale dropout who has been wandering through Europe with " that touch of indolence and occasional luxury that comes only from having real resources . " <P> <P> The affair is viewed , or rather voyeured , by an unnamed narrator . In the hazy New-Novel fashion , the exact locale is uncertain : it may be Autun , or it may be Auxerre . And the events described may have happened or they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see myself as an agent provocateur or a double agent , first on one side-that of truth-and then on the other . " <P> <P> He is also a shadowless personality , inept in his love life . Thus , to compensate for his own inadequacies , he exaggerates Dean 's qualities almost to the point of inventing a new character ; he fears his creation as he must fear " all men who are successful in love . " <P> <P> This curiously distilled method of storytelling proves effective and makes something lyrical of a rather commonplace romance . Dream-walking , the reader follows the narrator and his lovers through a lightly perfumed garden of erotic nuances . The encounters of Dean and Anne-Marie seem to require not reading but sensing , as if the touch of the eye were almost too much for reality . And when at last the dream breaks , it is not with a shatter but a silent splintering of crystal fragments . <P> A West Pointer who served twelve years in the U.S. Air Force , Salter came late to fiction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " but perhaps I was always becoming one . " There are bestselling novelists who could learn from this cool and quiet book .
