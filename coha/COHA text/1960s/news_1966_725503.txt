Schwulst , Chairman of the Temporary Commission on City Finances , and Joseph B. , member and secretary , stated that the city " will have to borrow another $250 million in less than sixty days for its needs in the current fiscal year . " They were not only incorrect in this amount but also gave the false impression that it is similar to the $241.7-million borrowing of April 20 . Any- borrowing between now and the end of this fiscal year for current budget expenses is not comparable and not related in any way to long-term debt . I must stress that I have always opposed , and will continue to oppose , the " borrownow , pay-later " plan . The only other money to be borrowed this year is strictly short term , and will be obtained at a substantially reduced interest rate , making the cost to the taxpayer considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city must have until it receives the delayed payments in state aid for education , as well as moneys due from uncollected real estate taxes , and to enable it to renew at a substantially reduced amount tax anticipation notes issued for real estate taxes in prior years . To Continue Practice However , in regard to the $56.6-million borrowing initiated last year , I feel that we should continue this practice because it would ease the burden of the taxpayer at this critical time . ' In addition , the relatively low estimated interest costs we would incur for this short-term debt could be offset ten times over by my plan to obtain state and Federal monthly advances instead of letting the city wait for these payments as it has in the past . In the case of higher education , we had to wait as long as nine months to collect $45 million . Let us remember that once the taxes to raise the $56.6 million are imposed , they will never be rescinded . Even the Schwulst letter admits this . I also wish to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mandatory this year . The fund now holds $37.7 million in cash and mortgages . Another $11 million is in the 1966-67 budget . Therefore , by the beginning of the new fiscal year , we will have a reserve fund of about - $48.7 million . The Budget Note Replacement Fund of $26 million is unnecessary because the Mayor has indicated in his Budget Message that he can save $25 million by June 30 by filling as few job vacancies as possible and by a more productive use of personnel . If he can accomplish this in six months , why ca n't he achieve greater results in the next fiscal year with a much larger budget ? If he can do this through economy , why resort to unnecessary taxation ? Factors Considered In arriving at this $101-million deduction in the Mayor 's estimated budget gap , I have given careful consideration to the plight of the overburdened taxpayer and the tremendous demands made on him this year , as well as the credit of the city , and the effect and impact that this additional load would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct your editorial of May 4 in which you said that my plan would tax the Stock Exchange . This is not so . My proposal would call for a maximum of one-half of 1 per cent on the sale of stock , payable by the seller only , not by the Exchange . If the Mayor 's budget gap is reduced by my recommended $101 million , this levy on the sale of stock could be reduced , in proportion , to two-fifths of 1 per cent or one-two hundredfiftieth of a dollar . MARIO A. PROCACCINO Controller , City of New York New York , May 6 , 1966 ? Our Support of Franco To the Editor : The Information Counselor of the Embassy of Spain writes on May 7 that his country has been struggling to achieve a liberalization under the Franco Government . But the struggle has been against , not by , the regime , as the recent student demonstrations in Barcelona and Madrid have shown . That a spokesman for the Spanish Government will defend Franco 's dictatorship is understandable . That our State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American students by Franco 's police is less understandable . Long after the Franco regime has departed , our country 's good name will be tarnished by its support for Franco 's dictatorship . JOSEPH CLARK Brooklyn , May 7 , 1966 ? Accreditation of St. John 's To the Editor : Your characterization of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools continuing St. John 's accreditation aptly characterized that as a Pyrrhic victory . Editorial , May 3 , " Reform Call at St. John 's . " We can not , however , understand why the association decided to continue accreditation , particularly in view of the fact that its own report characterized the summary dismissals as " reprehensible " and that St. John 's " has made grievous errors and refuses to explain publicly the basis on which its actions were taken . " The dismissed faculty members , to this day , do not know the charges and have not been accorded fair hearings . It would have been much more desirable for the Middle States to have lifted accreditation in accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Professors . The A.A.U.P. has asked teachers not to accept positions at St. John 's and has called upon the Middle States Association to take away accreditation . Such action by the Middle States would have compelled St. John 's to concede its " grievous " errors and its " reprehensible " actions . For Middle States not to have done this is an abdication of its responsibility as an accrediting agency , casting doubt upon the entire accrediting proc- , ess , and is an open-sesame for any totalitarian ? college administration to run roughshod over its faculty . Suffice it to say Middle States had not adequately consulted the dismissed faculty and thus its decision could only be based largely upon administration testimony and what appeared in the press . The timing of the release and absence of the faculty 's point of view serve to discredit the association . We urge that the Middle States reconsider its position . ISRAEL KUGLER President ( Rev. ) PETER O'REILLY Chairman St. John 's University Chapter United Federation of College Teachers New York , May 3 , 1966 ? Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from . . a military point of view it was regrettable that our plans for using porpoises for anti-submarine warfare have leaked out . Soon our animal-loving porpoise trainers will have to develop a means of protecting our own ships against similar attacks : that is , they will have to develop an effective antiporpoize porpoise . From the point of view of a " Flipper " fan it would appear that B. F. Skinner 's attempt in his letter of May 5 to justify this latest addition to our ar , imory by comparing it to the conscription of draftees misses the point . Complicated though it may be , the draftee is fighting for his country and his home . He has a measure of representation in that country and bears a measure of responsibility for its actions . But what , pray tell , is the porpoise fighting for ? It is patently obvious that we have taken a moral step in the wrong direction . GLEN E.
