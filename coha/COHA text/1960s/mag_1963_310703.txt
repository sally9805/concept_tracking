THOUGH scholarly Chairman William L. Gary , 53 , hardly seems the reformer type , the Securities and Exchange Commission has not been so active since its founding days in the turbulent early 1930s . Since taking leave from his post as a Columbia University law professor in 1961 , Gary has prodded the American Stock Exchange into overdue reforms , presided over the most sweeping investigation of Wall Street in 30 years . His judicious handling of the inquiry has made the SEC Washington 's most respected regulatory agency-a reputation that does not hurt in Gary 's current effort to shepherd through Congress the SEC 's 3,000-page report calling for a thorough overhaul of the nation 's securities markets . Publicity-shunning Gary 's modest manner belies an inner toughness . A Marine major with the OSS in Yugoslavia during World War II , Gary once produced only a few wilted flowers for decorations at a dinner that his commanding officer was giving for Tito . Dressed down by his C.O. , Gary snapped : " I 'm no damned posy picker . " He still is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family drug firm , but John G. Searle , 62 , the third-generation president of G. D. Searle &; Co. , enjoys the job . Searle started at twelve as a summertime tablet mixer , became the $35-a-week treasurer of the small firm after graduating in pharmacy from the University of Michigan . When he took over as president in 1936 , he prescribed a strong tonic to make the Skokie , III. , company grow . He trimmed its product line from 800 to 16 quality items . The list has since grown to 30 , and now includes Enovid , a contraceptive pill whose booming international sales have also boosted the sale of other Searle products . Last year the company earned $13.8 million on sales of $56 million ; it now sells in 100 countries . Last week stockholders approved the third stock split in 13 years , making a share that sold for $38 in 1950 worth $1,080 today . President Searle still likes to be called " Jack " by his employees ; lunchtime finds him in shirtsleeves taking his place in the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
