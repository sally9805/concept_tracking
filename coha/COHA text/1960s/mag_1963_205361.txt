The Lion in Love , by Shelagh Delaney . When a dispossessed class finds its voice , its proudest possession is its tongue . Everyone must be told-and told off-about how it feels to be an economic , or a racial , or a social , outcast . In A Taste of Honey , Britain 's Shelagh Delaney , then a semiliterate 18-year-old , gave tongue richly and scathingly to her bitterly impoverished girlhood in industrial Lancashire . Out of her background , she dramatically distilled a kind of urban folk poetry , humor and wisdom , and in a candidly observed relationship between a shiftless mother and a rebel daughter added fresh scenes to the eternal duelogue of parent and child . At 21 , she turned again to the short and simple annals of the poor , which , in her vision , are long and squalid . <P> The play 's North of England family relies on the triple diversions of the unblessed poor : booze , bickering and sex . Grandpa belts the brandy . Mum and Dad fight whenever Dad is n't swiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the cooler for disorderly conduct . Their son is an ex-pug , his friend is a pimp , and so it goes . Unfortunately , the play does not go-either toward social comment or domestic disaster , or toward that uncommon probing of the commonplace , the drab and the degraded that unveils an expanse of spirit in a waste of shame . All that remains is slice-of-life realism , which an inept director and cast turn into a slice at life that misses by a Manchester mile .
