txt Presidential hopefuls make tireless travelers . The surest route to Pennsylvania Avenue may be via Nome or Saigon . In this International Tourist Year , Gov . George Romney is treading this well-worn long-way-round . Extensive travel plans of the Michigan Governor now are coming to light . He is tentatively set to visit Europe in May , Latin America this summer , and Southeast Asia probably this fall . It all leads up to that final decision whether to try for the GOP presidential nomination . Richard M. Nixon , already in Europe , is on a springboard trip calculated to provide a fillip for his own possible race for the White House on the Republican ticket . Mrs. Maurine Neuberger is turning out to be an all-purpose ex-Senator . She already wears three hats . Speculation persists the White House may hand her a fourth . The former Senator from Oregon may have quit the Senate , but not the Washington scene . She is special consultant on consumer affairs for the Food and Drug Administration and chairman of the citizens advisory council of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Johnson has nominated her for membership on the general advisory committee of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency . Rumors that he may appoint her United States Treasurer , to replace Mrs. Kathryn Granahan , have not been quieted . Some sources insist she may still get the Treasury post  --  despite her multiple headgear . Presidential commissions generally function in this fashion : They take several months to get organized ; assign experts to do research . Then blue-ribbon members get down to work . The new 15-member presidential commission to study urban problems is breaking the mold . It 's getting under way with a rush almost unheard of in Washington . Chaired by former Sen. Paul H. Douglas , the group was appointed Jan. 12 . In its first two months it will have held three formal meetings ? even though members must travel from all over the country . They have met with top officials in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and conferred at length with Joseph A. Califano , White House Special Assistant . This week the commission will take a firsthand look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commission that 's off to a sprinting start . How and why ... Summer swamps Washington with a flood of tourists . It also hurries in a stream of college students . The government is delighted to hire them . A summer of work acquaints them with federal operations . Hopefully it steers them toward government careers later on . Last summer 51 agencies hired college students . And 28 of them held special training courses . The State Department 's summer intern program is regarded one of the best run of all . The department regularly takes in some 250 summer employees . But interns ? there were 106 last year  --  are in a separate category . They are pitchforked at once into actual diplomatic work  --  under supervision . The day they arrive Secretary of State Dean Rusk holds a reception for them . They attend regional seminars , hear top-brass speakers . Result : Competition to get into the program is fierce . This summer 's group will be limited to those who have passed the tough foreign service written examination . President Johnson has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadvertently but inexcusably offended . It is practice for the White House to invite several hundred federal employees to attend arrival ceremonies for visiting foreign leaders . It 's partly an honor . But mostly to " paper the house " ? have an audience on the White House south lawn to add to the pomp and circumstance of official welcome . Last month those invited to greet Ethiopia 's Emperor Haile Selassie waited in the cold , some in the snow , for more than 11/2 hours . They got only a shivering glimpse of him . Last March outstanding and veteran women government workers were invited to meet India 's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi . After a long wait they were sent away without meeting her . The President was not responsible for these mistakes  --  slips by planning coordinators . But the government workers hope he 'll hear about them and avoid future disappointments . sproduced with permission of the copyright owner .
