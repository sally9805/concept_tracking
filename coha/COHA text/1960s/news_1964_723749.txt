txt Washington , Feb. 4 ? Southerners lost their first effort to narrow the provisions o f the public accommodations title of the civil rights bill today . This section is considered by many Negroes and other civil rights advocates the heart of the legislation , and more than a dozen amendments probably will be offered in an effort to restrict or narrow its provisions . Reject Major Changes The House reached the second title of the big bill at midafternoon after the bill 's supporters turned aside all major amendments to the voting provisions of the measure . In all , 12 amendments were offered to title I , and 10 were rejected . The two that were approved made no substantial change in the voting rights provisions . Rep. Edwin E. Willis ED. , La. offered the first amendment on the public accommodations title , which would require operators of hotels , motels , restaurants , sports arenas , and other places open to the general public to serve all persons without regard to their race , color , or religion . Asks for Restrictions Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hotel or motel " which provides lodging to transient guests " and practices discrimination would come under the bill . His amendment would have made the section apply only to places which " predominantly provide lodging to interstate travelers . " Before the amendment was rejected on a division vote of 165 to 93 , debate centered primarily on the " double barreled " approach to enforce the provisions . The judiciary committee relied on both the 14th amendment and the commerce clause of the Constitution . Southerners asserted the committee knew ; it was not on sound ground in invoking the 14th amendment because in 1883 the Supreme I court held a similar public accommodations law based on the 14th was unconstitutional . Warn of Extension And , they said , that in attempting to stretch the com merce clause to " anything that affects " interstate commerce , Congress would be going much further than it has ever dared go before . The bill 's proponents said ' Willis ' amendment would substantially reduce the effective ness of the title . They said Congress has the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all persons has been a part of the common law since the 18th century . They said also that the present court might hold differently than it did in 1883 , a view southerners share . The session ended with the members defeating 149 to 107 on a teller vote a " simple little " amendment by Rep. Howard W. Smith ID. , Va. which said no one would be compelled to render labor o " service without his consent and that no court could compel him to do so . Celler Hits Back Rep. Emanuel Celler ID. , N. Y.1 , floor manager of the bill , said the amendment would " scuttle " all of title II , an i urged the members " to be careful not to swallow these innocent words . " An amendment by Rep. Patrick M. Martin R. , Cal. which would have compelled the attorney general , if he sought a compliance injunction against one alleged discriminator , to bring the same action against all other similar establishments in the area , was defeated 135 to 62 on a division vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
