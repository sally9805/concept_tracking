txt Americans hunting for a house  --  though still facing the aching feet and agonizing moments of indecision which frequently come with the task ? generally will find the once-onerous problem of financing their new home a relatively pleasant chore these days . Credit restrictions are being relaxed and home mortgage interest rates are dropping  --  in some areas to the lowest levels in more than a decade . These are the findings of a Wall Street Journal survey of mortgage bankers , the men who arrange and service mortgages for big lenders such as insurance companies . " There 's been nothing like this for 14 years . " eselaims Albert A. Hii set/. vice president of Commei - cial Mortgage Co .. Newark . N J. " Interest rates are nose-diving , particularly in the last three months . Not long ago a buyer could n't get a loan here for less than 6 , , Now he sometimes can get a 514 , , , /ate. with a 51 . S , loan no trick at all " Though prevailing home mortgage rates may run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fast-expanding West  --  the trend toward lower interest charges is nonetheless evident in most areas . " Our rates have dropped a half point from early this year . " says Robert Sutro , president of Ralph C. Sutro Co. , Los Angeles mortgage banking concern . . Reflects Tough Competition This good news for house buyers is a reflection of the intense competition which permeates the home mortgage market . Banks , insurance companies , savings and loan associations and other lenders are overflowing with funds to lend on mortg , ages , anti a recent jump in savings is aggravating the problem During September , accounts at savings and loans showed a net gain of 81.1 billion , a 19. , in rease fs urn the net gain posted in September 1963 and the biggest rise ever reported for the month . Industry executives figure the increase will continue and predict the gain in savings this year will top the record $11 billion rise of last year . Other savings institutions report increases , too . Mutual savings banks , another big source of housing funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 ' , - , increase from the rise recorded in the year-earlier month and a September record . Yesterday , the Government reported that Americans salted away 7.5 'S of their disposable income ( after taxes ) during the third quarter . Though this was a drop from the high rate of 8 2S ; in the second period , it still was well above the year-earlier pace of 6.7 ' , and except for the second quarter was the highest rate since the second three month , of 1962 . A Drop in Ifontebuilding Along with the problem of a big rise in savings , lenders find themselves confi onted with a smaller homebuilding market . Housing starts in recent months have been running behind the 1963 rate and the lag is expected to continue for the rest of the year . " Everybody has lots of money and they have to get it invested , " says Robert L. Legg , e'ecutive vice president of North American Mortgage Corp. , St. Petersburg , Fla ? as he talks of falling interest rates in his area . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OW ' lowest was bet/seen 6 ' ; and ( 1 , , ; " Even in the few areas wher , Intel est sales have so far i existed the downtui n. mortgage men are convinced it 's only a matter of time before reductions come . " Home mortgage rates here have n't changed recently  --  but you can gamble that they will in short order . " says Jim Nichols . president of National Mtn 1-gage Co. in Salt Lake City A Lowering of Standards The scramble for mortgages is bi inging benefits to home buyers besides lower interest rates . For one thing , many lenders are loosening tip on the qualifications which buyer s must meet to obtain a mortgage . As a result , many home seekers whose incomes were not regarded as large enough to qualify for a loan or whose blotted credit record kept them from getting a mortgage in the past now find then ' applications meeting less resistance " In the past we had many investors who would not apps ove a loan if the borrower had any sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to pay because of a dispute over merchandise , " recalls Albert Mager , Jr. , president of Mager Mortgage Co. , Oklahoma City . " Far more investors are willing to overlook these bad marks now and make the loan anyway . " Even more noticeable , Mr. Mager says , is that more and more of the loans his company rejects are grabbed up by competitors . I. ; p to 18 months ago , National Homes Acceptance Corp. , financing subsidiary of National Homes Corp. , Lafayette , Ind. , rejected about 20 ' ; of the applicants for Governmentinsured loans as unsuitable because of insufficient income , overextension of debt or a poor credit rating . Now the company approves all applicants and leaves it up to the Government to sort out the bad risks . " The competitive nature of the mortgage business has forced us and most other lenders to he less restrictive in our credit standards , " explains Frank Flynn , president of the National Homes unit , which services more than $600 million in home mortgages . " We found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rejected on a loan for one customer , he sometimes took all his business to a competitor who accepted it . " Mortgage bankers also note the abundance of housing credit is stimulating a trend toward mortgage refinancing , the practice of negotiating a new mortgage to replace an existing ! one Such refinancing generally increases the mortgage and is undertaken by a homeowner to obtain cash . Investors in the past . generally tried to discourage refinancing arrangement , . preferring to keep a homeowner 's equity in his house as high as possible and thus give that much more protection to the mortgage . A Changing View But competition for mortgages is changing this view . " Our investors look far more favorably on refinancing now than they did a few years ago and this aspect of our business is increasing . " says William F. Butler , chairman of H. J. Ludington . Inc .. Rochester . N Y. A clue to the extent of such refinancing can be gleaned from figures gathered recently by the National Industrial Conference Board . a non-profit business research group In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1958 mortgage debt formation closely followed the value of residential building . But then it began to climb above the residential building rate , though slow ly at first In 1960 the excess was less than S2 billion : in 1963. the total had risen to 510 billion . Mortgage refinancing. though not the only reason . is a major factor in the increase , says the study . Much of the cash obtained by refinancing goes Into such non-real estate use as the purchase of a new car or the financing of a college education Demand for More Services As a sidelight to the changing picture in hew sing credit , the mortgage banker has found himself in a financial squeeze . Re 's rimming into increased pressure to cut costs as investors try to reduce the impact of the decline in interest rates . The profits he once made from fees for simply " placing " a mortgage with a home buyer have largely disappeared . and now servicing fees  --  the major source of his income- are being lowered . Traditionally . mortgage bankers have received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unpaid balance of the mortgage , largely for collecting the monthly mortgage payment . Recently , hovsever , they have been asked to shave this commission or risk having the investor take his money elsewhere . Meantime , the mortgage banker is facing sharp increases in his own costs . increases that stern mainly from demands for more services trim investors . " To keep our investors happy , we now have to Inspect 7,209 homes . over half of mut residential portfolio . at least once a year , " complains Edmund Frank . servicing manager for Percy Wilson Mortgage lc Finance Corp .. Chicago . Until recent years . the company examined homes on-which they placed mortgages only about once every three years . The more frequent inspections are aimed at determining if the owner is keeping up the property . The more frequent visas are being demanded by investors because of the rising foreclosure rate the housing industry has experienced in recent years . Mortgage bankers also are finding the collection of monthly payments becoming costlier .
