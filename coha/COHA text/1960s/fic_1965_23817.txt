97 " Watch out for the department stores , " he reminded her . " They can be dangerous . Do n't take any crowded elevators and check the dressing room before you try anything on . " She locked and double-locked the door after him , then fastened the chain before she had her own breakfast . Standing at the window while she drank her coffee , she thought how ridiculous it was the way they went through the same routine each morning as if the very fact that they had to take precautions was making them nervous . When they were first married two years ago , it would never have occurred to either of them that there was any reason for worry . It must be because we 're so much in love , she told herself , stacking the dishes in the washer . Love breeds its own vulnerability , its own fear . When the signal flashed on the wall , Althea had just finished dressing . She watched it for a moment .. It was their code , all right . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the slow , deliberate hold . She pressed the button that buzzed downstairs . " Who is it ? " she said , her mouth against the intercom . " It 's all right , " said a woman 's voice , clear and high and a bit too shrill . " I 've already shown my identification to your doorman . I 'm Sally Milford ? Cary Milford 's wife . My husband works in your husband 's office . " " What do you want ? " said Althea cautiously . " I 'm much too busy to see anyone this morning . Besides , I 'm on my way out . " She bit her lip . George would be right if he scolded her for being careless . Why had she told this woman she was going out ? " I 'll only take a moment of your time . It 's im-portant . " " Ca n't you tell me what it is over the intercom ? " " If I wanted to talk this way , I could have called you on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " said Althea , reluctantly , knowing she was being foolish , " you can come up . " She checked her own gun even though she knew it was loaded and she palmed the small dagger  --  the one her mother had given her as a wedding present  --  the one with the jeweled handle . " Things are so different now , " her mother had said , sighing . She had lifted the dagger from the tissue paper and had studied it for a moment before she handed it to Althea . " In my day we could walk the streets without this sort of thing . " " That 's not true , " Althea reminded her . " You told me you used to wear stilt-like heels and you always carried a whistle in your purse . " " But that 's not the same . It still was n't like this , " said her mother . " Did you know we were n't allowed to carry weapons ? " " You were n't ? " said Althea , startled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind our customs and public opinion . That was before the Citizen 's Defense Act was passed . " " There is only one crime , " Althea said firmly , " and that is to be a victim . Nothing makes sense otherwise . " " I suppose not . " Her mother shook her head . " I guess I 'm just being sentimental , " she added wistfully . " Sometimes I miss the policemen we used to have . They would wear blue uniforms and they would drive around with sirens blaring and lights flashing . It seems a shame they became obsolete . Why I can even remember the time when we could take a walk in the park . " " In the park ? " said Althea , incredulous . " You could actually do that ? " Now Althea bit her lip . There was no point in daydreaming . She stationed herself at the one-way peephole . The woman who now came within her range of vision was thin of face and well-dressed . She blinked her eyes nervously and hesitated before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Althea . She unfastened the chain and the two locks , and then stepped back so that when the door opened she would be behind it . " Come in , " she said . " Where are you ? " " Right behind you , " said Althea , her hand on her gun . " You 're not very smart to walk right in like that , are you ? " " But I know who you are , " said Sally Milford , her eyes wide with fright . " My husband and your husband are good friends . " " The first thing you have to learn , " said Althea , " is not to trust anyone . " She kicked the door shut . " Hold up your hands . " She found a small acid gun in Sally 's purse and a knife in the pocket of her jacket . " Just put them on the table , " Althea directed , " and then sit down . Would you like some coffee ? " Sally shook her head , " Look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't trouble you like this  --  I would n't have come at all if I did n't , in Mrs. Randall returned to story writing after bringing up three children .

" " No , " said Althea firmly , " I do n't see anything . Suppose you tell me what you want . " Sally clasped her hands on the edge of the table . " I have a brother-in-law who knows someone on the Board of Commissioners , " she said , leaning forward in her eagerness , " and we heard that your apartment house has been chosen . " " These things are supposed to he a secret , " Althea said sharply . " No one except the people involved is supposed to know . Do n't you realize what can happen to you if they find out ? And what can happen to me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When I heard about it  --  all I could think was that I simply had to go . I have never been to a performance and , the way things look , I 'll never have a chance . " " Where do you live ? " Althea asked , putting the gun away . " On the East Side . You know how safe it 's getting to be over there . We have n't had an incident in months . " " That does n't mean they wo n't choose your building eventually . " " Do you really think they will ? " " Why not ? " said Althea . " Then , in that case , why ca n't you make believe that we 're visiting you or something ? They do have special passes for visitors and then , when we 're finally chosen , we could reciprocate . Cary and I could invite you and George . That way we could each see two performances . " " It would n't work , " said Althea . " In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . That 's why we picked this particular apartment building . We could have had a much better place to live but both George and I agreed that our best chance was being here . We had to wait two years for this day , and if they ever suspect that this was a put-up thing , you know what would happen to us . " " I suppose I was foolish to even hope . " Sally stood up . " I thought it would work out . " " It wo n't , " said Althea , feeling a sudden pity for her . " Believe me , Sally , it wo n't . I happen to know that Mrs. Tremont , who lives on the third floor , has her sister-in-law staying with her ; that , of course , makes it possible for her sister-in-law to go tonight , but if she had just arrived today someone would be sure to report it and Mrs. Tremont would get into trouble . " " You said you were going out , " said Sally . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going downtown , " said Althea . " I thought I 'd buy a new dress for tonight . " " I have n't been shopping in ages , " said Sally . " Cary wo n't let me go without him and he 's been much too busy on Saturdays . We could shop together and maybe have lunch . " " Just remember one thing , " Althea warned as she reached for her coat and hat . " No matter what you say , I wo n't change my mind . You can spend the whole day with me if you like but I still wo n't change my mind . " " I know you 're right , " said Sally as they pressed the button for the elevator . " It 's just that I 'm glad to have some company on the subway . " " Are you still taking the subway ? " Althea stared at her , amazed . " George insists that I take the bus . Not taxis  --  they 're not too reliable anymore but a bus is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sally . " The subway is much quicker . I have my own system . I never wait on a platform if I 'm alone and I usually ride in the first car where the motorman is and , just in case anyone is following me , I change at every other stop . " " Now , " said Althea , watching as the elevator stopped at their floor , " run ? " They pounded through the corridor and down one flight of steps . Then they rang for the elevator again . When it arrived , it was empty and they rode it the rest of the way down . It turned out to be , Althea told George later , a rather pleasant day . With the two of them together , the shopping proved much easier . Sally stood watch while Althea tried on dresses and Althea stood guard while Sally shopped . When they finally parted , it was after four . Althea took a bus uptown again and got off three blocks before her destination . She glanced behind to make sure she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the meat market . Steak would be the quickest thing to cook for dinner and she did n't want to load her arms with too many packages . It was difficult enough carrying the dress , although she had insisted that the clerk put it in a shopping bag instead of a box . With a shopping bag she would feel less clumsy and have one hand free , The doorman beamed at her when she entered the lobby . " This is a great day for us , " he said . Althea nodded . " I bought a new dress , " she told him happily , " a black sheath . " " I 'll ride the elevator with you if you like , " he offered generously . " Most of the tenants are home by now . " 100 THE WATCHERS " You 're not supposed to leave your post , " Althea reminded him . " Anyone could come in while you were away . You know what happened to the last doorman we had ? " " You 're right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By the way , " she whispered , " do you know who will be giving the performance ? " He shook his head . " No one knows , " he said . " I 've been asking but no one knows for sure . I think it 's a young one . They usually are . " " You 'd think those kids could learn , " said Althea , ringing for the elevator . " My parents were pretty strict with me  --  I can tell you that . " " That 's the best way , " the doorman said . " You have to be firm with them . I always say that from the time they can walk , they can be taught . Now , you take that kid of Mrs. Hammond . You know the Hammonds on the fifth floor ? He got his first slash today and was sent home from school in disgrace . " " Oh , no , " said Althea , in horror . " He 's only eleven . He 's only allowed two more mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll learn , " the doorman said . " That 'll never happen to him again , I can tell you that . " " Who was the other boy ? " " It was a girl , " said the doorman . " A pretty little thing , I understand . Well , she 'll get her first gold star for that . " " I got a gold star when I was twelve , " said Althea , stepping into the elevator . She rode it to the fourth floor and got out . She took the stairs the rest of the way , then stood before her own front door for a moment , listening . When she was positive it was safe , she inserted her key in the lock . At precisely six o'clock George came home and , by seven thirty , they had finished dinner and were dressed . " I 'd like to go now , " said Althea , impatiently . " It wo n't get dark until eight , " George said . " You know how it is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait a while . " " I can see the stands from here , " said Althea , craning her neck as she peered out of the window . " People are beginning to arrive now . Please , darling , let 's go . " " You 're like a child , " he said , hugging her . " Just an anxious little kid . " " I ca n't help it , " she said . " I 'm excited . Are n't you thrilled , George ? " " Come on , " he said , indulgently . He looked at her , chic and lovely in her new black sheath . " Nopockets , " he said , shaking his head . " What made you buy a dress without any pockets ? I did n't know they made them that way anymore . " " I 'll only wear it when I 'm with you , " she said . " Besides , I have a knife in my purse . " " Just see that you keep it handy . " He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used your head this morning . " " For a moment I was tempted , " Althea confessed . " Sally seems like a sweet person and it might be fun if we could go there sometimes , but then I realized we 'd be taking a chance . " " It does n't pay to take chances , " said George . " Otherwise you can end up giving the performance instead of watching it . " " The doorman told me it was a young one . Probably a girl . " " It usually is , " said George . " Do you know what she did ? " Althea asked as they walked through the back of the lobby and out into the courtyard . " No one seems to know what she did . " " Probably something stupid , " said George , looking around and waving to their neighbors . " You know , honey , you were right . The stands are filling up . " The stands had been placed next to their building . They were permanent , sturdily built of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been new , Optimistically every building had its stands ready for the day when it would be chosen , and Althea looked around proudly as she and George found seats in the second row . Mr. and Mrs. Hammond were there and seated between them was their son , Timmy . Timmy 's right arm was bandaged and he huddled close to his mother . " I heard about it , " said Althea , with sympathy . " I 'm sure Timmy will never let it happen again . " " Because she was pretty . Because it was a girl , " said Mrs. Hammond bitterly . " She called to him and he ran right over , leaving his knife in his pocket as if a knife ever did anybody any good in a pocket . Just because it was a little girl , he trusted her . But he 's learned his lesson , have n't you , Timmy ? " she said , slapping him across the face . " No more , " Timmy wept , putting his bandaged arm across his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 'll never amount to anything , Althea thought , staring at him in dismay . Only three chances and he 's used up one already . He 's too soft . When I have a child- She thought about it for a moment , longing for a child but the apartment they were in was too small and they had n't wanted to move until they had a chance at a performance . Maybe now  --  maybe now that they were finally spectators  --  perhaps now that the longed-for , dreamed-about moment had finally arrived , they could move to a larger place and she would have a child . " You have to train them from the beginning , " she whispered to George . " Sure , " he said , knowing what she meant . " It wo n't happen to us . " " It wo n't happen to us , " she agreed , seeing the way George , even now , even at this moment of pleasure and relaxation , kept his hand in his pocket ; George 's hand curled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had known , of course , what the stage setting would he but , just the same , sitting there , part of the expectant , eager audience , she had to admire its reality . It represented a street scene . It could have been Althea 's own street with its middle-class , red-brick buildings , the old-fashioned canopies extending from the wide entrances to the edge of the curb . Behind the lighted windows of the buildings . Althea could see the people , all the families together , having dinner , watching television , reading , talking , laughing  --  all the people of the city settling down for the night . In the center of the stage was a street lamp , still unlit although it was twilight now ; on the far right , there was a fire hydrant . The first floor of the center building was occupied by a shop , The sign said , " ANTIQUES , " and Althea could see the lovely things in the window  --  the paintings in the carved , ornate frames , the delicate crystal goblets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . dominating the center of the stage with its soft , gentle glow . The curtain is rising , thought Althea , taking a deep breath . She always loved that moment in the theater , that magic moment when all the murmuring and the movement and the whispering stopped , the hush and wonder when the curtain rose and the stage lay there before them , the play ready to begin . Someone somewhere in the back coughed and Althea drew a deep , sighing gasp of impatience . The stage became alive . From the center building a man emerged , a nondescript man walking his dog at night . The dog tugged and the man whistled softly between his teeth as the two of them walked down the street . The stage became empty again and Althea clasped her hands in her lap , amazed to discover that they were shaking . Ashadow , part of the shadow of the building , almost part of the square shape of the center building , took on form , and Althea saw that it was a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding there without her being conscious of his presence . From the far right she could hear the clicking of high heels on the pavement . Someone else , she thought , will walk down this street this night . There was a rustle and a stir in the stands . " Please , Mommy , " Timmy whispered . " I do n't want to stay here . " " Oh , you 'll stay all right , " said Mrs. Hammond grimly . " You just open your eyes wide . Yuu watch everything , Timmy Hammond , if you know what 's good for you . " " Be quiet down there , " someone hissed . " Do you want to spoil everything ? " Althea gripped George 's arm . The footsteps grew louder and a girl came into view , entering downstage from the right . The shadow that was the man moved , and then became very still , waiting . The girl moved across the stage . She paused under the street light . She touched the lamppost as if the feel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hesitated , reluctant to leave the light . Althea could see her clearly now .
