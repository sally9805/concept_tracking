The nation 's restive school teachers continue to display their fighting mood . As a statewide walkout in Florida went into its second week , new teacher strikes broke out in Pittsburgh and San Francisco and tension grew in Oklahoma and South Dakota . Teachers in Albuquerque went back to work , ending a six-day strike-but only after winning a commitment from New Mexico officials to seek more money for schools . <P> The Pittsburgh and San Francisco strikes were staged by units of the American Federation of Teachers ( an A.F.L.-C.I.O. affiliate ) in a drive for bargaining rights and school improvements . The walkout of 1,000 of Pittsburgh 's 3,100 teachers forced the closing of all 24 high schools , although 65% of the city 's elementary pupils continued to attend class . In San Francisco , 1,500 of the city 's 4,000 teachers struck , and all the schools were closed . <P> The Pittsburgh strike was a response to Superintendent Sidney Marland 's insistence that there must be " a better way " for teachers to influence educational policy than to join a union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school board to bargain with the union . San Francisco school officials first claimed that California law prevented them from dealing with a union , later relented , but the talks broke off as the union made 92 demands , claimed that Superintendent Robert Jenkins was moving too slowly on the negotiations . <P> One-Day Walkouts . The rival National Education Association was flexing its muscles , too . The Pennsylvania State Education Association called on its 80,000 teachers to shut down the state 's schools for one day this week and undertake a march on Harrisburg to demand higher pay . The Oklahoma Education Association scheduled a similar one-day walkout , urged its 27,000 teachers to attend a rally in Oklahoma City to apply pressure on the state legislature for more school money . In South Dakota , the state 's Education Association declared a " sanctions alert " in a drive to increase salaries and legislative aid to schools . <P> Striking teachers of N.E.A. affiliates in Albuquerque returned to work after Governor David Cargo agreed to appoint a special task force to recommend school improvements to the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign into law a $254 million school-appropriations bill passed by his Democratic-controlled legislature-thus abandoning his promise not to raise taxes . Although the measure provides for $58 million in salary increases , the teachers insist that even more money is needed for new kindergarten classes , more textbooks and additional teachers , want assurances that the state will consider the Florida Education Association the bargaining agent for all of the state 's teachers .
