ROCK ' N ' ROLL <P> Karen Levine , the daughter of a New York radar engineer , goes to sleep at night with her transistor radio pulsating reassuringly beneath her pillow . Her dream is always the same : she becomes a dancer on TV 's Hullabaloo and gaily frugs the night away . Karen , who wears red mesh tights and white Courrges-style boots for real-life frugging , says that rock ' n ' roll really gets through to her , especially those tear-drenched ballads about unrequited love . " I know what it 's like to be blue , " she sighs , " because that 's how I feel when my boy friend talks to other girls . " <P> Karen is now eight . She is typical of what the record industry calls " the nubes " ( for nubiles ) , " the teeny weenies " or " the pre-bra set " - the gradeschool girls who are becoming a major factor in the pop-music market . <P> Bitty Big Market . Once , the movers and shakers were almost exclusively teenagers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at " the four-to-twelve-year-old market . " They may be teeny-weeny , but with their dollar-a-week allowances , the subteens have become big business . Last year they spent $29 million on big beat music , according to Billboard bought 20.8% of all the 45-r.p.m. records sold in the U.S. " Some of them ca n't read yet , " says one Detroit dealer , " but they can tell what they want by the pictures on the record jacket . " <P> The kids get most of their notions about rock ' n ' roll from the radio . One rock radio station offers coloring books as a tie-in promotion for sponsors . Cousin Brucie ( " I really believe everyone 's my cousin " ) Morrow , 31 , top rock jockey for Manhattan 's WABC , has formed a " Cousin Brucie 's Pillow Talk Club " for the station 's 20,000 sub-teen listeners who go beddie-bye with their transistor radios . " They 're my little itty-bitty ones , " drools Brucie . " Kids used to go to bed with teddy bears , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Trouble is , teeny weenies find it difficult to " identify " with the top rock-'n ' - roll singers , most of whom are positively ancient adolescents . As a result , the promoters are busy developing a new stable of pre-teen rockers . Recently , Smash Records signed a four-year contract with three Ohio brothers , the Hornets-Guitarists Greg Calvert , 12 , and Gary , 11 , and Drummer Steve , 6 . Their first record release will be Patty Girl . <P> You 're only twelve years old now , <P> yeah , yeah , yeah <P> But when you grow up , I 'll still love <P> you , Patty Girl . <P> Size-Four Stompers . Motown Records is currently promoting a nine-year-old wailer named Little Lisa , who , they boast , " will become the next Shirley Temple . " Decca Records has a prepubescent dreamboat named Keith Green , 12 , who has been signed to a five-year contract . He has already written 50 rock-'n ' - roll songs , which he croons in a voice trembling with conviction ( " Youuu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems we 're in loove " ) .
