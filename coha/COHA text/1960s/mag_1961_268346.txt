Though Hitler seemed to cover his subjects thoroughly in Mein Kampf , it appeared last week that he wrote a second book . Hitlers Zweites Buck ( Hitler 's Second Book ) was dictated to a sloppy typist in 1928 , but never published . At the time , the Nazi Party and publishing house were ailing , and as the years went by , Hitler 's second thoughts made publication of the second book seem inadvisable . <P> <P> In May 1945 a U.S. Signal Corps captain assigned to collecting Nazi documents received a manuscript alleged to be a copy of this unpublished work . Transferred with a mountain of other captured documents to Washington archives under the number EAP 105/40 , the manuscript was all but forgotten . Scholarly sleuths from Munich 's Institut fr Zeitgeschichte ( Institute for Contemporary History-TIME , Dec. 7 , 1959 ) finally tracked it down , discovered that the University of Michigan 's Professor Gerhard L. Weinberg had beaten them to it . <P> Fearing outcries if Hitler 's heresies were published under American auspices , the State Department decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week an edition of 5,000-in the highly original German-went on sale in West Germany ( the profits go to victims of Naziism ) . <P> The book will do little for Hitler 's reputation . Opinionated , impassioned , implausible and slanderous , the text makes points as only Hitler could make them . When all was said and the typing done , there was little new in it all , proving that even dictators are not immune to secondbook jinxes . Sample excerpts : <P> " Whoever will not be the hammer will in history be the anvil . . . The sword was always the precursor of the plow , and if one speaks at all of human rights , then war deserves in this single case the highest right . . . Every healthy folk sees in the acquisition of territory nothing sinful but something natural . " <P> " A world empire of the size of ancient Rome 's or of Britain 's today is always the result of a marriage of highest folk values and clearest political goals . " <P> In the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of Europe 's " boldest and best " racial elements through emigration , Hitler saw the U.S. as " a new folk community of racially highest value . " In fact , opined Hitler , America was a racist state : " That the American union feels itself to be a Nordic Germanic state and by no means an international stew of peoples is evidenced by the manner of allotment of immigration quotas to Europeans-first Scandinavians , then English and finally Germans have the largest quotas . " <P> Sometimes the author seemed to be admonishing the future dictator : <P> " That is really a sight to see when such a bourgeois patriot begins to become incandescent and one knows it is all merely playacting . Pretending nationalist passions is as appropriate to our passionless lazy burghers as an old whore miming love . " <P> " It gives one cold shivers to think that persons who never intend to risk their own skin and blood deliberately cause a development that in the end must lead to a bloody conflict .
