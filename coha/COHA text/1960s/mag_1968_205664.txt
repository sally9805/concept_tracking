For those whose idea of an oldie is pre-rock ' n ' roll , there is still hope . A record called Love Is Blue has become a hit without any of the ingredients that pop musicians have considered necessary for the past few years : the juggernaut beat , the vocalisthenic performance , and the strain of novelty . <P> Love Is Blue is concocted according to an entirely different recipe . Its rocking rhythm cradles a plaintive , folklike melody swathed in lush strings and horns . It is an all-instrumental number , the first to become a bestseller since 1963 . And it is practically gimmick-free , which may account for its unusual staying power at the top of the charts : this week in Billboard the single release ranks as No. 2 after five weeks in the No. 1 slot , where the average tenure is only a little more than two weeks . The album containing the song is still No. 1 , outselling such redoubtable pop stars as the Beatles and Bob Dylan . <P> It would be hard to find anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record 's success than the man who made it : lean , mustachioed French Orchestra Leader Paul Mauriat , 43 . A veteran of ten years in Paris recording studios , Mauriat has provided suave backgrounds for such singers as Charles Aznavour and Mireille Mathieu , and has turned out hundreds of piquant pop orchestrations for his own instrumental albums . Three of his albums had been released in the U.SL during the past two years , selling moderately ( around 25,000 copies per album ) in the same market that supports such American counterparts as Percy Faith and Nelson Riddle . <P> Wider Palette . Then , early this year , Mauriat 's single of Love Is Blue suddenly caught on . To date it has sold 1,850,000 copies . In turn , his albums took off too : sales of Blooming Hits , the LP that includes Love Is Blue , have soared to 750,000 . Mauriat 's record is also in the top 25 in England and has started to sell briskly in Japan ( though not , as yet , in France ) . Recently he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Sullivan Show and was plied with offers for cross-country personal-appearance tours . <P> It is all very unsettling for the quiet , fastidious musician , who rises by 5 a.m. every day to begin working at an upright piano in his suburban Paris apartment . The son of a Marseille postal inspector , he learned piano and violin from his father , entered the Marseille Conservatory at ten , and soon seemed headed for the life of a concert pianist . Instead , he veered off into a jazz career at 17 , eventually became interested in the wider instrumental palette and richer sonorities of pop arranging . Established though he was in the profession , he remained a blank to the public , since French disk jockeys rarely credit orchestra leaders by name . But that was before Love Is Blue became red hot . Now color him gold .
