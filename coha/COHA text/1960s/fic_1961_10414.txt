of a smile , and a jerky nod of his head , he drove off swiftly down the empty street . After a moment , I went into the rectory , not directly , but through the church , pausing for a quick kneel and a nod and a word . Unlike John , I had no fear of interruption ; the importunateparishioner is hardly a problem in Old Saint Paul 's . .. . In the rectory , Father Danowski was waiting for me . He was standing in the front hall , dressed for the street ; he was on his way to his usual Sunday night supper with his family . His appearance , always neat and unbelievably boyish , was especiallyso on these occasions , as if he took extreme care to scrub up well in order to pass muster before that extraordinary man , his father . It was possibly to atone for this appearance that his manner at such moments became even more elaborate than usual . " Ah , Father ! " he said . Graciously . " Well well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outing . Over the river and through the woods , to Grandfather 's house we go . I said , " Yes , yes . Most enjoyable . " " How glad I am to hear that , " he said . " And what a sight it must have been to sec : old Mr. Carmody surrounded by his well-wishers on his birthday . That remarkable old gentleman ! How I would like to see him again , if only in memory of old times , when I was just a child . Still , I doubt whether he would remember me after all these years . " Every once in a while Father Danowski is impossible to resist , and so , a little unkindly , I said , " I do n't know about that at all . Curiously enough , only this afternoon he said , How I wish I could see young Stanley Danowski again . If only to give him ten thousand dollars for his church . ' " Amazement . Suspicion . Then , more slowly , comprehension and a knowing smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You almostcaught me that time with your little jest ! " And then , allp101unconsciously , he paid me back ; he said , " How good it is to see you so merry ! " Merry ... ! We talked for a bit about parish affairs , the few things that needed to be done ; as I had expected , nothing had happened in my absence . Then , as Father Danowski was leaving , he stopped at the door and said , " Tonight at supper I must remember to tell my father about this birthday party , Father . You know , I believe , that he and old Mr. Carmody used to meet frequently in the old days . On the matter of rent . Mr. Carmody was always a most adamant man , but my father , althoughwithout formal education , is a brilliant debater . How often I heard them crossing their swords , exchanging their little pleasantries . Poor as we were , my father always gave as good as he was given . I can imagine how interested he will be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John and old Charlie , my curate and his father : it was a day for the expression of filial feeling . Of somewhat different kinds ... . Father Danowski left ; the rectory was silent . Old Mrs. Addione , who cooked and cleaned for us , had gone off long ago ; she went to her own home each day after the noon meal , leavingbehind the ingredients for our light supper at night . And Roy , whose hours were at best unpredictable , almost never appeared on Sunday , save during the Christmas and Easter seasons , when  --  much to Father Danowski 's annoyance  --  he abandoned his policy of grumbling evasion and became lively and conspicuous , ostentatiously sweeping and polishing , genuflectingoften , crossing himself piously , and otherwise suggestingthat here was a laborer worthy of far more than his hire . Which , God knows , he may well have been ; we paid the poor fellow little enough . . . . And so , alone in the rectory , I went up to my bedroom . It was by now late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer sun was still high , and it would be a good three hours until darkness . Not that I was especially longing for that to come , although strangers to Old Saint Paul 's often remark  --  usually with at least a little of the air of the phrasemaker  --  that there , darkness undoubtedly benefits the view . Which is true enough , I suppose , but by now I 've grown so used to the parish , both by dark and by day , that it does n't seem to make too much difference . And in any case I spend little time evaluating the view ... . Although now I was doing just that . The large low window at the foot of my bed was open to the late afternoon ; standing by it , almost leaning out of it , I could see that the first shadows had already slipped over the edge of the sidewalk and into the gutters of the street . They were the shadows of buildings . Once along these walks , there had been trees  --  maples , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorly in concrete ; therefore  --  buildings . On both sides of the street these buildingswere uniformly four stories high and were of a pale yellowishbrick which could never have been particularly attractive ; they had soiled easily and had not been cleaned . All had once been private homes ; now they were rooming houses , and many had small shops on the first floor : a Chinese laundry , a secondhandclothing store , a cobbler 's , a dingy grocery . None of these seemed to do too well . Directly across from the church was a religious goods store . Until recently it had been a delicatessen ; then , one day , six months ago , its freshly washed windowhad revealed an assortment of luminous crucifixes and sugary Madonnas . It must have seemed a good idea to someone ; these stores pop up like mushrooms in the neighborhood of churches ; some are wildly successful . Not , however , around Saint Paul 's . Here the consumers had proved peculiarly resistant ; the venture had been a failure from the start . Now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietor had paid me his first visit : he was a pudgy , middle-aged man with harassed eyes . ' When he came into the rectory he wasp103smoking the stump of a cigar which he snuffed out and put carefully away in his pocket . " What do they want ? " he asked , throwing his arms wide ; it was a flourish of bewilderment and despair . " What do they want , Father ? I got all kinds of stock . The best , the latest . I got a one-piece cross . Big . Strong . Like steel . You could chin yourselfon that cross , Father . They do n't want it . I got a special kind of rosary , they make it up in Canada , it 's so tough you could jump around on it , it would n't break ! And you drop it in the water , what happens ? It floats ! They do n't want it . And I 'll tell you what else I got , Father . I got a Mary that cries . Real tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Right ! " he said . " But religious ! Nice ! They do n't want it . Anything I got , they do n't want it . So  --  back to the wholesaler . " Then , looking across at me , he said quickly , " Unless maybe you could help me out a little , Father . You know : maybe drop into the store , be seen a little .... " I said , " I do n't think that would be so good . And anyway , I do n't really think it would help very much , do you ? " " No , " he said hopelessly . " I guess you 're right . They call it a religious country , but they do n't know . I could tell them . " Suddenly he said , " You 're not busy , Father ? I 'm not taking up your time ? " " No . " " I 'm not busy , " he said sadly . " All I got is time ! " And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me all about himself . He talked for a long time ; he was a fatalistic , oddly likable man who had not had much luck in either his home life or his business affairs . He had no plans for the future , but then he had had no plans when , unexpectedly , one morning , he had found himself in the religious goods business . With a somewhat surprising optimism he announced that something would turn up ; it always had . . . . These were our immediate neighbors , then : the glum , mot/tied rooming houses and small shops which bordered this part of the street . The street itself was a long one , and while certainly neither grand nor spacious , it was broader than most in this section  --  in the long-ago residential past , it had been the principal avenue . It was still paved with the old cobble stones , and was seldom entirely clean . Usually  --  any day , today  --  it was covered with its thin litter of newspapers , fruit peelings , candy bar wrappers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a single sneaker , a shirt-tail . The lightest breeze passing over its surface raised its private dust storm . Early each morning the city trucks came around to clean and to sprinkle , and sometimes , curiously , through this early morning dampness there came the unmistakable smell of horses , although there had n't been a horse over here for more than a decade . It was just one of the old smells which often cling to a neighborhood through time , which the years seem to bake into the stones , and which every now and then mysteriously gain fresh strength and come breathing back into life . No doubt just to serve as a reminder ... . But this was the " good " neighborhood , the respectable part of the street ; two blocks away , the bars , the cafes , the cheap wine shops began . Old Saint Paul 's is thus protected by a small buffer zone  --  created , I 'm afraid , by a city ordinance rather than any deep religious feeling . The local Skid Row is well within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long ago , before Father Danowski came , when I was here alone , I used to walk about a good bit at night , more often than not coming back to the church by way of the Row . Sometimes I still do this , although not so often now . But whenever I do , at some point or other during the walk I think of a single scene I once saw in a moving picture , many years ago . It was a scene in which a priest was walking alone at night , through a district which I 'm sure was intended to be very much like this one . It was sordid enough , suitably down at the heels , yet in the film it had an odd liveliness : one had the impression of neon andp105noise and motion . There was a peculiar wailing music in the background , and from the darkness came an occasional scream of violence . Through the shadows one could see the tottering and seedy drunks , the faded streetwalker , the few sharp-eyed hoodlums . And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was quite handsome . He was also obviouslya familiar and impressive neighborhood figure . Although his coat collar was turned up he was recognized at once ; the recognition produced a chain reaction of edifying behavior . The drunks managed to straighten themselves and tug respectfully at their hats ; the streetwalker , suddenly ashamed , turned away , pointedly fingering the medal at her throat ; the hoodlums vanished in their evil Cadillac ; the cop on the beat relaxed for the first time , twirled his night stick happily , and hummed a few bars of " The Minstrel Boy . " The " padre " was passing by , and the district was the more wholesome for his presence . As for the " padre " himself , he continued to walk forward as strongly as ever , something about him managing to suggest , however , that he was in a dream  --  a muscular dream . His smile was compassionate but powerful : one had the feeling that here was a mystic from some ecclesiastical gymnasium , a combination of Tarzan and Saint John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . Well , what bothered me about this  --  and what made it so memorable  --  was not the priest , but the setting . This ludicrous Disney-parson , provoking these electric responses : all right . Or rather , not all right , but at least expected . Any priest in any movie is almost by definition a parody . Which in a way is understandableenough . I do n't think many people know very much about priests  --  I 'm not talking now about anything so complicated as the psychology of the religious , or the motives for vocation ; I mean just the ordinary simple matter of how priests live from day to day , how they fill in their idle hours  --  and those who do know are n't necessarily in Hollywood . Not that this would matter much if Hollywood had n't discoveredp106that the priest can be a useful addition to a good many films . The result has been that extraordinary succession of clerical stereotypes , ranging from the old Galway-born pastor ( cranky but lovable , with the wisdom which seems to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quaint , pipe-smoking sportsman who , but for the unfortunate fact of his ordination , might well have become a fine second baseman .... So then , as I say , the priest was no surprise . But the setting and the people , the whole scene itself  --  this was something else again . For here the material was surely familiar : the slum is no secret , and the phenomenon of Skid Row is unfortunatelyeverywhere . It should have been no great trick to presentthis with some authenticity . Yet everything came out wrong , all wrong , so wrong that it hurt . The pathetic slum street proved to be a kind of cheaper Barbary Coast , a shoddy but still vital enclave . And of course the truth is that a place like this is not vital : it has , in fact , no life at all . ' There is no whirling motion ; there is no clarinet in the background ; the air is not filled with screams in the night . There is no noise . When I walk along this street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see are silent and motionless and wrapped in their own despair . They do n't respond to me ; they do n't even see me ; they do n't see anything . And when , in this terrifying quiet , now and then the siren sounds , it is usually the ambulance , not the riot car , and it means that among these sad men who are so slowly dying , one has gone a little faster than the rest . Actually , crime , sensation , violence are comparatively rare in a place like this ; here , life  --  or the end of life  --  tends to becomea matter of the slow leak rather than the explosion . Which is not exactly an improvement ; of the two , I prefer the explosion . For what is really dreadful , what I find genuinely frightening , is this spreading , endless despair , hanging low like a blanket , never lifting , the fatal slow smog of the spirit.  |p107And  I 've often thought that among all the afflicting sights of the world , none can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city blocks , where night after night it 's possible to see  --  indeed , it 's impossible not to see  --  these faces from which hope and joy and dignity and light have been drainingso steadily and for so long that now there is nothing left but this assortment of indifferent , damaged masks . They belong to human beings who , after a lifetime of struggling to becomeone thing or another , have succeeded only in becoming the rough sketches of their species , recognizable but empty , the bruised and wretched bodies and souls of the saddest peopleon earth : the people who no longer care . This is an awfulsituation about which you know you can do little , but about which you have to do something  --  because of course you are implicated . As a human being . And , more , as a human being who happens to be a priest . And when , moreover , that priest happens to be someone like myself , someone who but for the favor of God 's good grace might not now be discussing this problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the implication , is rather heavily underlined . Yet bow to exercise that responsibility in this situation is one of the great questions . At least it is for me . I 've said , I think , that this is not the kind of parish in which a great rapport obtains between the shepherd and his flock . We are all more or less strangers to one another . And most of all , I 'm afraid , I 'm a stranger in this smallest and dreariest part of my parish where  --  all moving pictures to the contrary  --  I can assure you that the priest is not this legendary , revered , and welcome figure , capable of healing with a glance . Or in any case this priest is not . I 've thought , often enough , that someone else , someone with an easier manner , someone of a more zealous temperament , or  --  of course  --  simply someone holier , a more dedicatedand a better priest , could do far more towards breaking.own the wall . I 'm sure this is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of it . For  --  to put it mildly  --  theyp108do not reach out eagerly . This is understandable enough , too : at a certain stage of misery , the miserable want mainly to be let alone . And yet there 's no hostility , no resentment ; if I 'm noticed at all I 'm sure it 's in precisely the same way that the mailman is noticed : as someone who is occasionally on hand , who is set apart by reason of his uniform , and who has no real significance for them ; over here , they are not deluged with letters from home ... . This sometimes changes at the end . There are those momentsof extremity when , even here , people do suddenly and desperately send for the priest . At this point I respond to the summons , usually arriving in some filthy little cold-water room , where even the cold water is a myth , and where a dying man is surrounded by all those who are closest to him : the landlady , who has seen it all before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young intern from the city hospital , who is beginning his career . These leave the room for a little while , and it is then that I hear the hurried , often incoherent , often barely audiblefinal confession of this lonely , gasping man who , in a matter of hours , minutes , even seconds , will certainly die . In these moments one hears extraordinary things . Not the sins : these people are not monsters , ingenious in depravity ; they offend God in much the same unheroic and uninventiveways that the rest of us do . But there are the other things : strange irrelevancies which would seem to have nothing to do with the solemn fact that death is on the doorstep and pushing hard . I suppose people die in as many different ways as they live , and that in this incomprehensible interval when life is ending and death is slowly moving in , anything is possible . No one can begin to guess what queer churnings go on in the expiring mind and memory ; no one should be surprised that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not always , not even usually  --  for usually , nothing surprisinghappens . I hear a man 's confession , I give him Holyp109Communion , I anoint him for the last time ; there is a silence , an exhaustion , I suppose , and then a soul goes to God  --  one hopes in peace . But sometimes in this moment instead of silencethere is a kind of bubbling turbulence , and I find myselflistening to words that seem to come driving out of this dying man . He has to tell me this story . And what is the story ? It can be the oddest and most unimportant fragment from the man 's past , fetched up to the surface for some unfathomablereason to completely engulf the final , fading attention . I can remember that at such a moment a man told me , in tones of the greatest urgency , of a Laurel and Hardy movie he had once seen : fat Oliver once again discomfited by thin Stan . Anotherman , in obvious pain , suddenly broke off in the middle of a groan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong , he had had a dozen suits made for him . They had been cheap , but all had been short in the arm . And an old woman whom I had thought dead suddenly popped her eyes open and said loudly , " Listen to me , Father : listen to me ! " Then with great logic and lucidity , and for perhaps two minutes , she told me of the occasion on which she had shaken Al Smith 's hand in 1928 . She finished this story in a strong voice , looked at me with clear , bright eyes , and died ... . And one ca n't help but wonder at a time like this whether they know what 's really going on , whether they know that within a very few minutes they may die . I do n't know ; I think they do , in a way . But there 's a clue , perhaps , in the loneliness of these people . Some of them who have drifted into a place like this , after having lived God knows where and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unhappylives for so long that for years they have n't talked  --  I mean , really talked  --  to another soul . Now , suddenly , there is this moment and the sense that time is closing in on them ; they see the priest , and perhaps memories of other and happier days may come back , and they may want , more thanp110anything else , just to talk to tell someone of something , anything , that once happened in a better time , before the bitter , recent , isolated years ... . As I say , it may be something like that . Or it may simply be that among people who have lived  --  as many of these peoplehave  --  close to death for a long time , who have faced it obliquely every day , there is developed an instinct for postponement , like that of a child who every night delays the hour of his bedtime by standing in the center of the living room and saying desperately to his parents , " Wait , wait , wait , I want to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , but meanwhile , if you can just keep talking , it might not come so fast ... . In any case , this is what happens from time to time , as the people over here die . And something else happens as well . Anotherreaction , of a quite different and more positive kind : one which takes place often , and one which , although given emphasisin a place such as this , is by no means restricted to the deathbed in the slum ; sadly and ironically , it happens frequentlyand everywhere . It 's happened to me most often in this way : as I 'm bending down over a bed to watch the tumbling , muttered recitation of sins , to hear what may be the last words on earth of some poor soul who , for most of the years of his life , has been hungry , dirty , battered , harassed , pursued , and lacerated by every sort of pain and humiliation , he may now , upon suddenly realizing that all this will soon be over , shoot bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panicky lips say incredulously , " I 'm not going to die , Father ? I 'm not really going to die ? " And by this question he establishes his one last tie with most of the rest of us . Because the truth seems to be that no matter how bad life has been for us , we do not leave it willingly . And this is not simply out of any uncertainty of what 's to come , or a fear of punishment , or a dread of the void . I believe with all my heart in the mercy and providence of God , and I believe inp111a future unimaginably brighter and better than anything I have known here  --  and yet of course the whole difficulty is that I have known and have loved " here . " Very much . So that when the time comes for me to go , I know that I will go with full confidence in God  --  but I also know that I will go with sadness . And I think for no reason other than that . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest who was dying , one of the saintliestmen I have ever known , one of those who had greatest reason to expect God 's favor , many years ago surprised me by telling me , with a little smile , that now that he was going , he wanted desperately to stay . " A single memory can do it , " he said . And I suppose he was right . The memory of an instant  --  of a smile , of leaf-smoke on a sharp fall day , of a golden streak across a rain-washed morning , of a small boy seated alone on the seashore , solemnly building his medieval moated castles  --  just this one , single , final flash of memory can be enough to make us want to stay forever ... . Which is just another curious part of the human predicament . And which is also a fairly elegiac strain to be inspired by a long glance down a slum street . And which is hardly why I came up here to my room in the first place . For what I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind  --  this afternoon about which I had had such misgivings , but which had developed into a warm , funny , richly satisfying day of a kind I had n't known for years . In old Charlie 's dining room , I had felt at home . And I came up to think about this , and about the Carmodys themselves : about Helen and John in particular , and the various small ways in which they , like all of us , had changed , and the ways in which they had remained just the same . This , as I say , was what I had intended to do ; what I had done instead was to forget them all in an instant . Charlie 's party had served as little more than an excellent springboard into the familiar world of my own affairs.  |p112So  then , back to the Carmodys  --  except that this was not to be . For the telephone rang at this moment ; it was for me . Not for me personally ; for " the priest . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for the rectory . A great many of the calls received here are misdirected ; most of them are for a cigar store , run , apparently , by one Andy . ( Same number ; slightly different exchange . ) Can so many people really want cigars ? No . Andy has a sideline . He is a bookie  --  a fact revealed by some of the more explicit calls . I 've been meaning to have our number changed for some time now ; Father Danowski counsels this vigorously . He has had the bad luck on several occasions to be called by some of Andy 's less satisfied clients . Each such experience leaves him outraged ; each brings him posthaste to me . " Again , Father ! Yes , again ! I tell you , Father , in my opinion this may be quite deliberate . Even over here , and in this day and age , the Church is not without its enemies ! " A revival of The Terror , its spearhead the off-the-track bettor . . . ? Still , the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Father Danowski had rushed in to announce a triumph . " I brought him up with a word , Father ! I cut right in upon him . I said to him , " he said , his voice swelling with heavy irony , " I said , I am afraid I must inform you , my good sir , that you do not happen to be speaking to " Deadbeat . " And that you do not happen to be speaking to " Welsher . " You happen to be speaking , my good sir , to the Reverend Stanley C. Danowski of Saint Paul 's Church . That is whom you happen to be speaking to ! ' I think I can promise you , Father , " he said complacently , " that the person who made that call today will not do so again in a hurry . " I think that Father Danowski is really my only reason for not having this phone number changed . But today the call was not for Andy . It was a sick call , and I went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thep113opposite direction . It was here that most of the small group of recently arrived Puerto Ricans had settled ; over the phone , a frantic young voice , which urgency and accent had left almostincomprehensible , had informed me that Mrs. Sanchez was dying . Mrs. Sanchez was not dying . Mrs. Sanchez was very far from dying.When I went in to her she was lying on her bed , a huge rosary in her hands . The room was small and dark ; on a table by her bedside was a large and vivid picture of the Virgin , beforewhich a blue votive lamp burned . Mrs. Sanchez was praying rapidly and audibly ; the look she gave me was one of extreme annoyance . She was small and brown and very old ; she looked rather like an unkind monkey . I might have seen her once or twice in church ; I could not be sure . At any rate , we were strangers to each other , and Mrs. Sanchez , her moment of fright over , was not disposed to be cordial . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leavingas I had arrived . He had spoken of his patient without great sympathy . " Epilepsy , " he said shortly . " I 've seen her before . And I 'll see her again . She has medicine but she wo n't take it . Right now she 's as cranky as a bear , but she 's perfectly all right . There was no reason to drag you over here , Father , I told them all that , but they were running around here like squirrels , scared blue . I do n't think they even heard me . So she 's all yours . " Clearly , there was no need for the last rites here . But I could at least hear her confession ; somewhat grudgingly she agreed that this might perhaps be done . I talked haltingly to the old lady ; she had no English , and my Spanish is primitive , barely sufficient to cover the minimum needs of these occasions . However , Mrs. Sanchez 's confession was not a complicated one . It developed that she was conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few were venial ; as she spoke of her blamelesslife I found myself distracted . Something in her tone re/minded me , more than anything else , of old Archbishop Gartland , a severe and autocratic man , who was once asked by a bold reporter what he considered his besetting fault to be . If , that is , the Archbishop considered himself to have a besetting fault . The Archbishop did . " I am rather too lenient with people , " he said . The Archbishop and Mrs. Sanchez : there was a distinct link here . When I left her , before the door had closed behind me I could hear her voice , already raised once more in sighing , sputtering prayer . She was resuming the devotions into which the intruder had so rudely broken . Outside , I was in the one remaining room of the apartment . It was clean enough , but unbelievably crowded . Two small windows were open , but the room was airless , and although the day outside was cool and pleasant , here it was stifling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago had battled its way in and had stubbornly refused to depart . There was a faint and probably permanent smell of gas  --  the small stove in one corner was old and looked dangerous . Clutteringthe room were improvised partitions of blankets and beaverboard ; a pile of mattresses ; cardboard boxes from the supermarket ; the stove ; a sink ; a crisscross of clothesline . Wedged in among these was the family of Mrs. Sanchez . It was huge . Or at least so it seemed in these close quarters : a regiment , an all-Sanchez regiment , of every age , of every size . And while by this time conditions over here are hardly new to me , neverthelessI told myself once more that so many people could not possibly live in so small a space . Yet I knew that they could , somehow , and that they did . They came towards me , smiling , obviously grateful , embarrassingly grateful , for I had done little enough . As , certainly , the old matriarch would have readily agreed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , pieces of cake , a bottle of wine . An elderly man  --  Mr. Sanchez ?  --  held out his hand , in it was a dollarbill . And the problem was how to refuse all this without wounding feelings , without hurting sensitive , decent people who have quite enough to put up with without encountering even unintentional rebuffs . And so , rather clumsily , I explained that I could n't take anything , that it was impossible for me to stay , that I had the Blessed Sacrament with me , that I had to go now . They seemed to understand , and then I was reminded that of course the younger ones , at least , knew English , for a pretty dark girl said to me , " Thank you , Father . Mama will be all right now ? " I said , " Mama will be fine . " Which was true enough : Mama would probably outlive us all . Then we stood staring and smiling at each other , no one saying anything . There are these moments over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when , in other words , I have n't the faintest notion of what comes next . At such times I feel that my parishioners and myself are separated by a gap miles wide and unmeasurably deep , and yet I also feel , curiouslyenough , that so simple a thing as just one word , if it were the right word , could throw a bridge across the gap . But now , as always , the right word did not occur , and so , rather awkwardly , I said goodbye to the smiling Sanchezes and the small , steaming apartment , and drove back to the rectory . It was almost dark now . I sang Benediction in the church , as I do every Sunday night . A few people came  --  not more than half a dozen . Mr. Yee was among them . Then , back in the rectory , I sat in the kitchen and ate my supper . It was a smaller supper than usual , for I was not hungry ; Charlie 's midday feast had taken care of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mrs. Addione keeps on the kitchen table . It is her great companion . As she peels , cooks , and cleans , she listens to all those serial dramas of domestic distress ; every day this simple , healthy , long-married old woman is washed with fresh waves from the fascinating , storm-tossed sea of divorce , disease , and mental imbalance . Often , in my room or in the rectoryoffice , I can hear the sounds of the broadcast sobs , and I know that all is well . Now , on the radio , a man was talking : the talk was inspirational . Almost evangelical . A minister ? A rabbi ? A priest ? No . Somewhat surprisingly , a vice president of a great air line . He was talking about brotherhood . Some years ago , it appeared , his air line had flown him to Africa , a land largely inhabited by . . . whom ? Black men . Or so he had always believed .

In India he had seen a so-called brown man , wearing a pure brown blanket ; in Japan he had seen a so-called yellow man , eating a piece of pure yellow fruit ; in our own Far West he had seen a so-called red man silhouetted against a pure red sunset . The contrasts had been startling , the lessons unforgettable ....

' The strangest things come out of Mrs. Addione 's radio . . . .  |p117Usually  , after supper , I go to my room and read until bedtime . I suppose I read now more than I ever did . Nothing particularly new or adventurous , but all the old , well-worn trails : Saint Augustine , Gibbon , War and Peace , Newman . Familiarenough territory for a priest who likes to read and who spends a good bit of his time alone . Tonight I picked up The Grammar of Assent , as I often do  --  Newman in particular is an old hero of mine , who gets no less so with the years . I read him over and over again , always with pleasure , always with benefit , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I had picked it up . Because I was n't really readingat all ; old Charlie and his world kept crowding in , and the strong , lucid , flowing prose faded before the recollections of the day : Charlie whirling around his living room in that queer , astonishing kewpie-doll dance of welcome ; Helen coming smilingacross the room ; John , lean and impatient , one eye on his watch , the other on the exit ; Bucky 's belligerent little face working out its wrathful patterns ; P.J. seated at the table with his look of ancient , chalky calm ; Ted and Anne , so new , so young , so attractive , so different from us all ; poor anxious Mary ; Agnes with her tray of sherry ; Julia with her memories of saintly , undernourished Martin ; and Saint Raymond 's itself , its soft bricks trapping the sunshine of the afternoon ... . I kept coming back to them all , but mostly , I 'm afraid , I kept coming back to myself  --  just as I had earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , I do n't habitually sit here night after night , systematically reviewing the past and thinking about what is as contrasted to what might have been . The truth is that I almost never think about it any more . But today had been different ; today the past had been all around me , I 'd been swimming in it , and so I suppose it was inevitable that now , for the first time in months , I began to go back , once again , over all those years which were quite long enough in fact but which seemed even longer than time itself , those yearsp118which I can look back on with no pride but only the deepest shame , those years which nevertheless turned and shaped and fixed my life as no other years have done ... . It 's hard to tell when anything really begins , impossible to pinpoint a particular instant and say that before this everything was light , and after it , dark . Personal histories have no such neat boundaries . But in my own case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond 's were all light and no darknessat all . For I came here on my first assignment as a young priest ; here , to my own boyhood parish . It was an assignment in which I rejoiced , for I had none of John 's glum feelings about " coming home . " And so both of us were satisfied : he because he was to be kept at the seminary to teach , I because I was coming to Saint Raymond 's . To me , it was the best possible beginning , the luckiest of breaks : I was delighted to be here , working among the people I knew and liked so well . Even in the rectory , where so many young priests come up against their first stumbling block in the presence of capricious authority , life was close to idea , for the old Monsignor , although crotchetyand even maddening at times , was nevertheless a good pastor , showing a surprising understanding of , and kindness towards , his younger curates . So then , I was happy in the way that young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a special kind of happiness , one perhaps peculiar to the priest , and , moreover , to the priest when he is just beginning , when lie 's in the very morning of his new life . Which is not to say that happiness must fade as the priest grows old : it can change its quality , it can deepen , ripen , becomericher . But this kind of happiness will fade , because it belongs to the young : a mixture of innocence and awe , of freshness and wonder , of reverence and excitement , of joy and of a disbelief , almost , that , for example , it is really you who , in this church and on this altar and before these people , are now at last to have the great privilege of consecrating the Body and Blood of our Blessed Lord . Here the miracle and mystery ofp119God 's grace strikes home so overwhelmingly , with such freshnessand clarity , that it stuns your heart and fills your whole being and nothing else matters at all . And these moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be really forgotten . Never , never , never ... . Although of course it 's not quite this unmixed ; one 's day is not filled with moments like this . You 're not unaware that the Roman collar has given you new significance in another sense ; I think it 's a rare young priest who could remain entirely unaffectedby the deference which is now suddenly paid him . Particularly when , in his new role , in his new vestments , so to speak , he comes back to familiar surroundings and finds that an old woman who a few short years ago would have cracked him over the head with a thimble now flatteringly solicits his judgment . On what subject ? On any subject . Probably in no other walk of life is a young man so often and so humbly approachedby his elders and asked for his advice . Which , by the way , is almost always received gratefully and forgotten promptly . Although the young priest , at this stage of the game , mercifully does not know this ... . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a parish like Saint Raymond 's , a parish usually described as " up-andcoming , " there can be a truly staggering list of parochial activities . In no time at all I was deep among them . In addition to the regular duties of any priest anywhere , I was organizing baseball teams for the altar boys and choir boys , dances for the young people , father-and-son outings , bridge parties , picnics for the Holy Name Society , lectures , concerts . I regularly gave talks in the parish hall ; I liked to talk . My Sunday sermons in those days , while far from rivaling the Monsignor 's stupendous productions , were fairly elaborate and , I 'm afraid , rather long . I can remember my father coming , Sunday after Sunday , to whatever Mass I said , sitting there and listening to what his son  --  the priest  --  had to say . He always sat in the same place , and I always saw him from the pulpit ; I was happy hep120was there . He was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also mildly anticlerical . And I wonder now what he must have thought of a good many of those sermons , spoken so zealously , and with such assurance . But he said nothing ; I think he was proud of me . .. . I was active ; I was talked about ; I think it was generally agreed in the parish that I would " go far . " I think I may have been in some accord with the general agreement . But it made no great difference , for fifteen years passed by in this way so busily , so happily , and so quickly that at the end of the time it literally seemed as though it had been only a matter of weeks since the Bishop , before the main altar of the Cathedral , had placed his hands upon my head , and I was made a priest forever . I suppose that in this time I must have changed in a hundred ways : we all do , fifteen years are fifteen years , after all , no matter how short they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy of twenty-five . But I felt unchanged ; I was working as hard as ever ; my enthusiasm was still strong ; and when I looked about me I was supported by the comforting signs of some accomplishment : a new parish hall , an improved choir , a disciplinedcorps of altar boys , more weekly communicants among the men , a greater number of boys bound for the seminary . Not all my doing by any means , but I had had a hand in much of it , and if I was n't satisfied , still , on the whole , I think I was fairly well pleased . Then , suddenly , I left Saint Raymond 's . Not of my own volition ; I was transferred . I was , in fact , promoted . I was given what every curate looks forward to ; I was given a parish of my own .... This was Saint Stephen 's . It was not an enormous change ; as such changes go , this was a slight one . For Saint Stephen 's , locatednot far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat poorer Saint Raymond 's . That is , it was anotherof the old Irish parishes which had not come along quite so fast or so far as Saint Raymond 's , and although it was farp121from being in distress and , indeed , enjoyed its own measure of modest prosperity , still , there was a chip on the parish shoulder whenever Saint Raymond 's was mentioned , an instant racial readiness to suspect patronage from this slightly more elegant neighbor . It was good Saint Stephen 's practice to speak of the parishioners of Saint Raymond 's as being " high mucky-mucks "  --  a derisive reference to the latters ' supposed wealth and burningsocial aspirations . Yet I liked Saint Stephen 's . It was not the flourishing parish that I 'd grown used to , the work was hard and required more than a little tact  --  for after all , priest or no , I had come from Saint Raymond 's  --  but after a cautious beginning on both sides I got along well enough , I understood the people and their problems , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enjoyed being the pastor , the boss , and I suppose that at the back of my mind there was always the feeling that this was somehow temporary , a stage on the road , and that one day , if all went well , I would be back in Saint Raymond 's , this time as the pastor . A simple enough ambition , surely . Too simple ? A little too parochial , too snug ? Not entirelyconsonant with " Going therefore , teach ye all nations " ? Yet there it was , something to be considered . I considered it often . It was five years after I came to Saint Stephen 's that my father fell ill . This was sudden . He was a man who was never sick ; then , one day , he was . After some argument , he was persuaded to see a doctor . There was an examination ; there were tests ; there were more tests . And when the tests were completed , the results were given , not to my father , but to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for some time . It was not curable ; it was not controllable . It was as simpleas that . The doctor who told me this was a kind man who spoke gently , but what gentleness of speech can cushion such a verdict ? " I 'd say six months , " he said , concluding . " Maybe a littlep122less , maybe a little more . I wish I could tell you something quite different , Father , but I ca n't . It goes without saying that we 'll do all we can for him . " I said bitterly , " Which does n't sound like much , does it ? " A disagreeable and an unfair thing to say to a perfectly good man who was doing his best , and whose only crime had been a failure to produce a miracle . But I think he understood ; at any rate , all he said was , " No . No , it does n't Father . And I 'm afraid it is n't . Nevertheless .. .. " And we continued to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sensible , even consoling . I do n't know . I did n't hear a word . Or if I did I do n't remember it . For what was there to hear ? He had given me his message in the first few minutes ; after that , what more could be said ? That could make any difference , I mean ? But I do remember that as I was leaving his office I said , just as if the possibility had not occurred to me until that last moment , " The pain : will there be much ? " The kind voice said , " It 's probably something we should n't even speculate on now . IIe may very well have none . " " But on the other hand . . . ? " He hesitated for just an instant , then looked directly at me . " But on the other hand , " he agreed , nodding . " Yes . It 's a possibility , Father . We ca n't tell in advance . You see , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't know about . We 'll have to wait and see . " And so we waited , and my father began to die . When you are every day with someone you love and whose death you know is very near , you find that the emphasis is alwaysshifting : what is important now becomes not so importanta week from now ; two weeks from now it may not count at all . In the beginning , when my father was still fairly active , when he looked precisely as he had looked for years , when there was not a mark of his illness upon him , when his only complaintwas a rare , puzzled confession of having felt " a bit queer "  |p123a  day or so ago , I worked furiously to collect and nourish all those thin , pathetic , isolated shoots of hope which always sprout up , however wanly , at a time like this . And it seemed absolutely vital that I keep downing the old placebos : doctors make mistakes , no man who looked and moved and talked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Yet all the while I was terrified that he would somehow discover how close he was . Fortunately , he seemed to have no suspicion . The doctor had spoken to him in the most general terms of a temporary stomach upset , and my father , who had had so little personal experience of sickness , had accepted the vague diagnosis without question . He trusted the doctor . " A nice lad , " he said to me . " I knew his father well . A good smart man who kept a drugstore and had two wives . The first was this lad 's mother : a fine little blue-eyed girl who was great for the dancing . She died young , and then what do you think ? He married another , the very image of the first ! God knows where he got her from ; I always thought he might have advertisedin the papers . You know , with a snapshot of the first wife , and saying underneath , If you 're a Catholic girl that looks like this , then I 'm your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes about it at the time . But the joke was on us . She turned out to be a grand girl , just as grand as the first . And so he had two good wives . That 's very rare . " He came to Saint Stephen 's regularly now : to Mass on Sundays , dropping in on me at odd times during the week . And I began to call on him more often , taking care not to be too attentive . Even so , this was remarked upon late one afternoon as we were in his kitchen , and he was standing in front of the stove , making tea for us . He drank numberless cups of strong tea , the color of Burgundy , every day of his life . Now he said conversationally , " I see more of you now that you 're pastor over there than when you were one of the hired help next door . How is that , I wonder ? I was always told that pastors were verybusy people , with great responsibilities . Although now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that were mostly pastors themselves . " So then , it probably was n't suspicion , but just another stroke in the old game he loved to play . Relieved , but still cautious , I said , " I 'll tell you a secret about the successful pastor : he discoversvery quickly how to delegate these responsibilities . That 's what I do . I leave everything in the hands of those two extremely capable curates I have . The hired help , as you so reverently call them . This leaves me plenty of time to come calling on the more rebellious laity . The curates really run the parish ; I 'm needed only for certain decisions . " " Such as will we have the fine big sirloin steak with the fresh asparagus tonight ? Or will it be the rib roast with the strawberriesfor dessert ? Oh , " he said , " I know those big decisions you lads have to make , all right . It 's a great wonder any of you live to be fifty . What with the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word of your digestion . Will you have a cup of tea ? It 'll help to case your difficult life . " So spoke the ferocious anticleric . It was familiar talk and good to hear , but as I looked at him , and listened to his voice , and took the cup of tea from the old , slender , strong hands , it almost broke my heart . .. . This was the calm period , relatively easy on my father , which rather quickly came to an end . Iie grew weaker ; he came to Saint Stephen 's less frequently ; his appetite was poor ; and he spent a longer part of each clay lying down . " I 've no more strength than a chicken , " he said . " I do n't dare to blink my eyes for fear it will tire me out . Denny Callahanwas in here yesterday afternoon and said that he felt the same way a while back , but a good big meal fixed him up fine . It might fix me up too if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , I 've no appetite at all . It 's a very queer business in-deed . " Then , slowly , the pain began . As the weeks went by , it be/came clear that there was no reason for even the most carefully hedged optimism , for the pain did not lessen . It was not constant , but the bouts came more often and with increasing severity ; my father was now in bed most of the day , much of the time under sedation . He complained very little , but I think it was now that he realized how seriously ill he was , for , quite suddenly , he stopped talking about it . Whenever the doctoror I tried to support him with the usual bedside reassurances , he smiled , agreed , and very soon changed the subject . And one afternoon as he was lying there , awake but with his eyes closed , and I was talking to him in a way that was intended to be encouraging , his eyes opened , and he gave me a slow and weary wink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Hughie ? " he said . It was the saddest question I had ever heard . But for the most part his spirits were good , surprisingly good , and in pain-free intervals he would talk at length of days gone by . He was a man who had always taken great pride in keeping up to the minute , in reading all the papers , in knowing what went on in the world around him , but now the present no longer seemed to interest him , and he talked only of the past . He talked especially of my mother , and this was unusual with him . My mother had died in an influenza epidemic when I was very small . I had only the faintest recollections of her , and here my father had been of little help : on the subject of my mother he had been curiously reticent . I wondered about this often , of course , although I never questioned him . I think , now , that the truth was simply this : that her death had been without question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harshly and with such finality that he never really got over it , and could not bring himself to talk about her as she had been , not even after all the years , not even to me . And while he spoke of my mother often and fondly to me , he always did so incompletely , in a strangely peripheral way , so that I grew up with a picture of her which was really little more than anp126outline . Was this unfair , an injustice to me ? It must seem so , and I suppose in a way it was . And yet we all have within ourselvesthose private spaces which are uniquely our own , and which we can not share . This was my father 's : the heart of his grief which he chose not to expose . It was only now , in these last months before his death , that the outline was filled in , that , without preliminary or explanation , my father suddenly began to talk of my mother as he had never talked before , in words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been stored up and held within him all this time , and which was now released because , I think , he knew his own time was so short , and because he did not for a moment doubt that very soon now he would be joined to her again ... . So there was a feeling of joy here , and there was joy too when he talked of his boyhood days in this city which by now had changed so greatly , and when he talked of the good old times which must also have been fairly hard old times , but from which a kind memory had removed the sting . And , of course , when he talked over and over again of the old friends and the old enemies , the varied , picturesque dramatis personae who had always been the great stock company of his anecdotes , led always by the chief protagonist , old Charlie . It was in these days that my father balanced the books on Charlie for the last time , and I remember his final verdict well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . My father was sitting up in bed , backed by numerous pillows . He had had a fairly good day , he had talked somewhat more than usual , and Charliehad evidently been on his mind  --  at least , the talk today had been about no one else . My father sat now , poking withoutinterest at the small tray of bland and negligible food before him , and looking with preoccupied eyes out the window at the still and darkening evening . Two fire trucks went screamingby ; my father said absently , " I wonder where that one would be ? " I went to the window and looked , but I could see nothing ; when I told him this he merely nodded and went onp127thinking whatever it was that he was thinking . The moments went by slowly , as they do in a sickroom ; then , suddenly , out of the silence , and as if to himself , my father spoke aloud his last opinion on this man he had known and studied with such fascination all his life . " Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man as ever robbed the helpless . " The last view is not always an indulgent one . Although my father continued to talk and to reminisce in the days ahead , he did not mention Charlie again . As he grew sicker the anecdotes grew fewer , and were more frequently punctuated with pain . My father required greater care now , and this was not always easy to provide , because he remained at home , refusing to go to the hospital . The doctor had tactfully suggested such a switch for , as he put it , " a few days ' checkup . " But on this point only my father had been stubborn . This was his home ; this was where he would stay . And so he stayed , under conditions which were not ideal , but which were the only ones possible . This continued for some weeks , then came sharply to a halt . The illness now entered a new and terminal stage ; the hospital , which so far had been little more than a suggested alternative , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home at last . He did not protest ; he could not . For by this time the disease in its wild progression had reached his brain , and now my poor father no longer knew where he was , nor  --  mercifully  --  did he care . It was an agonizing time  --  although when I say this I 'm speaking selfishly , because what I really mean is that it was an agonizing time for me . ' What it was for my father no one could tell . It may even have been a time of some relief : the long periodsof mental wandering , of mumbling oblivion , of not rememberingat any one moment what the last moment had been like , must at least have interrupted the continuity of his pain . I do n't know ; I hope so . But I could reach him only rarely now , and everything , even the hospital room itself ,  |p128seemed  to contribute to this sense of separation . Sickness had changed my father 's appearance  --  he had lost a great deal of weight , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming , impersonal , almost polar bleakness of this strange setting , he seemed further altered , reduced , lost . There were times when , sitting by the side of his bed , I would shift my position and look away for a bit , thinking of something else , and when I turned back to him again it would be as though something had blinked behind my eyes , destroying recognition , and on the white trim bed I would seem to see a total stranger , a small and shrunken figure in a vast , shapeless nightgown of hospital flannel , staring at me with great , glazing , senseless eyes , and talking on and on in an endless sad parade of urgent , crazy words . And I would have to remind myself that this was my father , and then I would close my eyes and tighten the agony one turn more by trying desperately to recall him exactly as he had been , down to the very last detail ... . And so my father died . All through his illness I had said my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night I had prayed that he might be allowed either the miracle of recovery or the blessing of a happy death . These prayers were not answered . My father did not recover , and he died witless and in pain . And why this should have been I have no idea at all . He was a very good man who had lived a very good life  --  yet he died a very cruel death . This is the hardest sort of thing to accept ; for some , it 's impossible . Because here is the old , baffling problem which has always been with us and will be until the end of time : the problem of reconciling pain and suffering with an omnipotent and merciful God . There are all sorts of answers suggested to this problem , most of which are as old as the problem itself ; some are foolish , others are as reasonable as the mind of man could possibly devise . But here it seems to me we deal with something reason can not reach , and with that part of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed and helpless before another 's suffering  --  espe/cially in those cases when those who suffer are plainly innocent of any guilt  --  then the cool light of reason may not be of much help . A syllogism does not support a mother who has seen her baby burned . And here , I think , faith comes in . I myself believe that there is no such thing as purposeless pain or suffering , although I must confess that for much of it I can see no purpose at all . But the point is that if one accepts God , one accepts Him totally , accepts what He does and what He permits . One accepts it , but one does not necessarily understand it . Surely it 's a question of vision , for as we are , we can see , but only to the corner ; we can not begin to see the whole design .... But this is not a theological treatise , or a piece of apologetic . What I 'm saying is really a preliminary to an explanation  --  or rather , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own behavior after my father died . For I saw him die , I sat through the two days of his wake , I said his Requiem Mass , and I buried him by my mother 's side , and while there was ache and grief enough , there was certainly never the slightest thought of personal rebellion , of a turning away from God becauseof an unanswered prayer . No , what happened , happened much more slowly and subtly , and without my quite realizing , for a long time , that anything was happening at all . But shortly after my father 's death my life began to change , and it was now that I began to do heavily and steadily what before I had done lightly , occasionally , and in a very different spirit , that I began to drink seriously , and to my own danger , and to the danger of my parish . This is not a pretty story , and I have neither the intentionnor the desire to go back over all the details  --  details which even in memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are infinitely more so when that man is a priest . For here there is a double betrayal : of the dignity of a man , of the sacredness of a vocation . In any case , it was in these weeks following my father 's death that I began to spendp130most of my time by myself . This was a great departure for me ; as I 've said , I had always been a gregarious and an active priest . For example , ever since I 'd become the pastor of Saint Stephen 's , I 'd kept up my old ties with Saint Raymond 's ; there was considerable visiting back and forth . This now stopped . Not all at once , but it stopped . And it stopped because .. . well , because I stopped , and when one way of a two-way exchangestops or dries up , the other invariably does , too . So , loyally , they continued to come over now and then , and the visits were always pleasant enough , no one was ever not cordialto the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection going was lacking , and by-and-by all visits ceased . It was in this way that over a period of time I came to lose all touch with even the Carmodys . Within the parish the situation was different ; the results were the same . Here I was bound by duty as well as friendship , yet without deliberately planning it , without ever waking in the morning and announcing to myself that this day I would remaina little apart , I began to withdraw from my parishioners . There were of course the parish functions  --  at first I went to them as usual , but now I found myself slipping away at the earliest possible moment , and as the weeks and months passed by , I found myself not going at all . It was n't that I had turned against the people ; it was n't even that I had now anything so positive as dislike for these gatherings which had once been such a part of my parish life . It was simply that somehow they had stopped mattering , and now it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sidestep each one as it came along . In the rectory I built up further insulation . People came , on any of the multiple errands that can bring the people to their priest , and for a while I continued to see them . Somewhat more briefly than before , however ; I managed to discourage the cherished habit of the casual , gossipy , infinitely expanding " as a priest I now regularly sent down word that I was " out , " and passed the problem on to the younger and more willing hands of my curates . And as for my curates  --  these two young men who lived with me , who were in my charge , and for whom I was supposed to serve as some sort of example  --  I 'm afraid it was towards them that I behaved worst of all . Not by harshness or severity , but by apathy , neglect . From me they deserved care and respect ; they received not even attention . They came to me now with parish problems which I settled perfunctorily and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the good reason , I suppose , that I no longer asked them about themselves ; our rectory small talk grew smaller and smaller , then disappearedentirely ; at meals , in the rectory living room , in the sacristy of the church  --  in short , in all the places where we normally met  --  my eagerness simply to get away , to return to the solitude of my own room , was all too unconcealed . Before their young and puzzled eyes the old , easy harmony of our life together vanished ; a chasm cracked open and was never again bridged by either pastor or curates . All this was my fault , and the fault was not a small one . Because there is a sense in which a priest is dependent upon no one quite so much as another priest , for he has no wife , no child , and  --  in the ordinary meaning of the word  --  no home . His home is the rectory ; his family , his fellow priests . And so while it 's true that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also true that I was guilty of a graver offense . For what I did was to destroy the spirit of their priestly home ... . In this way I came to be alone . I spent most of my time in my bedroom : a pleasant enough room , although this could n't have mattered less ; I was n't there to bask . Just what I was there for remained an unanswered question . It somehow seemed terribly important that I should be there and that I should be there alone , so that I might do . . . what ? Whateverit was that I had to do . An odd restlessness had comep132over me ; I began many things , and finished nothing . I would come into the room , close the door , sit at the table or in the armchair , and begin to read , or to say my office for the day , or to prepare a sermon for the next Sunday . But whatever I began , in no more than a few moments , I would drop the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of my father . And thinking , strangely enough , not of anything big or importantthat he 'd said or done , but of the small things , the little fringe touches : the way his lips formed into a slow , soundless whistle as he went through the careful ritual of filling his pipe ; the slight limp in his walk on a damp day ( he had broken a bone in his foot as a young man ) ; his habit of courteously saying , " Ah yes , that 's a very good point indeed ! "  --  which was his inevitable preliminary to total disagreement . I have an accuratememory , which is not always a blessing , and as these recollections purred soothingly along , they were so fresh and strong in their exactness of detail that I sank into them easily as if they were the only realities that counted , as if they could and would happen over and over again , at any time : now , tonight , tomorrow morning . Then , suddenly , would come the sharp , clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and remember that this was only a memory , an echo of something which was gone and which could never be again . And this would always take me to still one more memory , this one of the memory of my father as I had last seen him : wasted , senseless , unrecognizable . And then ... . And then I would rise , walk up and down the room  --  sheer motion , the great therapy of the restless man , pour myself a small drink  --  which seemed to help , go back to my chair , and begin again the farce of preparing to get down to work . And in a while the whole procedure would be repeated , and then , later , it would be repeated again . The only change was one of emphasis ; as time went by , the small drink got no smaller . Slowly it became more important , and over the months the occasionalhelp came to be the steady necessity . At all hours ; atp133night so that I might sleep ; the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , dull empty ache of the day .... Which is the classic story , of course . It 's been told over and over again , especially in recent years ; the reformed drunkard is a ready raconteur . It 's the familiar story of the trap : does it becomemuch different merely because the narrator is a priest ? Probably not  --  except , of course , that one may wonder why the priest , if caught , stays caught , for surely there must be aids , sources of strength available to him which should be tapped at once . And this is what I tried to do  --  not at once , but at last . For , strange as it may seem  --  especially since , in the confessional , I had heard these case histories outlined a hundred times or more  --  I did n't for the longest time realize just what it was that was happening to me . And then one morning I woke with a clarity rare to me in those blurred days , and suddenly I seemed to see my whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , completewith every certain consequence . I saw this with a sense of shock , and I remember that , heavy-headed , heavy-eyed , I pushed myself up in bed ; I scourged myself  --  with words ; I shook my head clear and reminded myself that this had become a habit , and that habit could be broken with a strong will ; I got to my feet ; I made a firm resolve . This firm resolve lasted for twenty-four hours . It was succeeded , after a while , by another firm resolve , which lasted not quite so long . This was in turn succeeded by another .. . then another . . . and another ... . And then , finally , I did what I should have done from the start . Shame , pride , may have held me back ; I do n't know . But now I remembered that I was God 's priest ; I went for God 's help . I went desperately , because by this time I was badly frightened  --  but the discovery I now made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just when I needed to most , I could no longer pray . I could kneel , I knew the words , I could sayp134the words  --  and they meant nothing . At night , in the silent room , I could hear myself whispering phrases which I had known from the days when I first knew any words at all , which once had been charged with richness and fervor and love , but which now were empty formulae , dry wisps blown up from the desert of memory . I was praying  --  and it was nothing more than a child with jackstones in his hand , singsonging his way through the gibberish of games . And yet  --  how to explain this ?  --  I never stopped believing : in God , in His goodness , in His justice . I did believe , but prayer is always a kind of talking to God  --  and now I could not talk at all . I went through the motions , straining to drive into the lifeless words some breath of hope , of devotion . But you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now prayer was little more than a succession of distractions , and I seemed to be speaking a language which I had always spoken but whose words no longer had reference to anything I knew , and sometimes it seemed as though a part of me had left me and now stood on the sidelines , observing , a detached and melancholy witness , mourning the vain performance , and whispering back to me , " It 's no good , it wo n't work , you just ca n't do it any more . . . . " Then one night , or very early one morning  --  it must have been three o'clock or so  --  I awoke in the darkness and , surprisingly , I was neither drowsy nor fuddled . I was wide awake ; I had come from dead sleep into an almost preternatural alertness : I was trembling . Tills passed , but I could not go back to sleep . I tried what had come to be my unfailing remedy ; it failed . And so I lay there , forced to think , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucidity which now , to tell the truth , I did not particularly welcome . And what I thought about was of course myself : as I was now , nearing fifty , the respectedpastor of his parish who was in fact a solitary drinker in his room , dazed most of the time , indifferent to his people , irresponsiblein his duties , a spiritually arid priest for whom thep135wellsprings had dried up , for whom life had been reduced to a problem of concealment and routine . And then the inevitablecontrast : the young priest of not too many years ago , zealous , devoted , with fresh and unimpeded hopes , whose parish was his life , whose days were active and busy and full of joy . How had the one become the other ? The distance between them was the distance between the poles , yet it had been eclipsed , and in no time at all . How ? Why ? Lying there on my bed in the black and silent morning , in this moment of queer lucidity , I found an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active years , back with the new parish hall , the improved church grounds , the spick-and-span school band , the bridge evenings for the women , the weekly gatherings of men , the outings , the school plays  --  all those things of which I 'd always been so proud , and to which I 'd given so much time . And , suddenly , there was the clue before me : the " so much time . " So much time that there had been no time for anything else , and I saw now , in a flash of long postponed revelation , and with a sense of shock and dismay , how little by little the unimportant had become importantfor me , how those things which belonged properly on the edges of my life had in fact become the center . The young priest , without realizing it , had become little more than a recreationdirector : a cheerleader in a Roman collar . And it had been so easy , so innocent . There are , after all , certain social duties which a priest has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was  --  energetic and gregarious , with an aptitude for such occasions  --  these duties and occasions have a way of multiplying . There 's a great attraction to this : he 's doing what he likes to do , and he can tell himself that it 's all for the honor and glory of God . He believes this , quite sincerely , and he finds ample support for such belief : on all sides he 's assured that he is doing the much-needed job of " waking up the parish . " Which is not a hard thing for a young priest to hear ; he may even see himself as stampeding souls to their sal/vation . What he may not see is that he stands in some danger of losing himself in the strangely engrossing business of simply " being busy " ; gradually he may find that he is rather uncomfortablewhenever he is not " being busy . " And , gradually too , he may find fewer and fewer moments in which he can absent himself from activity , in which he can be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he can reflect and pray . And since these are precisely the moments which are necessary for all of us , in which spiritually we grow , in which , so to speak , we maintain and enrich our connection with God , then the loss of such momentsis grave and perilous . Particularly so for a priest  --  particularly for a priest who suddenly finds that he can talk more easily to a parish committee than he can to God . Something within him will have atrophied from disuse ; something precious , something vital . It will have gone almost without his knowing it , but one day , in a great crisis , say , he will reach for it  --  and it will not be there . And then . . . then he may find that the distance between the poles is not so great a distance after all ... . This was the answer which came to me on that morning . It was not a consoling answer ; is it ever consoling to learn that you 've been most mistaken in something of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desolation than I had ever been before . From that moment on , I grew more desperateand my predicament became more extreme . I did not drink less . Yet how curious it was that , although this went on for a long time , very few in the parish really knew about it . While I was rarely available to them , I was at least visible : I always managed to say my Mass on Sundays , and while they surely must have sensed the change in me , I 've found that towards a priest most people are apt to be either innocent or charitable . Probably a little of both ; at any rate , they do n't readily suspect the worst . I think they thought I was ill ; from time to time I heard reportsof their concern . The curates , of course , were anotherp139matter . They knew . They could not help knowing . They lived in the same house with me , and in any case priests always know about another priest who drinks . It must have been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But they said nothing ; I 'm sure the poor fellows had no idea of what to say or do  --  nothing in their seminary training had prepared them for the drunken pastor . Meanwhile , I grew less discreet . I left my room at night now , and wandered about the rectory . Occasionally I was conscious of the guarded creaking of a bedroom door : my progress was being observed . I did not care . Then , one morning , I was found in a stupor on the hall floor , just outside my room ; I was helped to bed . I was now becoming more public , and it was only a question of time until what had to happen finally did happen . I was summoned before the Bishop . At this time the Bishop of our diocese was not the man who had appointed me pastor of Saint Stephen 's . This Bishop was new . He had arrived fairly recently to take charge of the diocese ; none of the priests knew much about him . He had come here from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , as bishops go neither young nor old  --  roughly the same age as myself . He had come to us preceded by none of the usual tendrils of advance clerical intelligence  --  for once , the reliable diocesan grapevine appeared to have broken down  --  and he continued to remain a mystery to most of us . He was certainly a mystery and a stranger to me as , on that morning , I stood before him , in disgrace . He said only , " Sit down , Father . " His voice was low , and suddenly it occurred to me that I had never heard him speak before except on public occasions . Now , here in the privacy of the room , his voice seemed curiouslyuninflected , without expression of any kind . I sat facing him across the old Bishop 's desk  --  a great mahogany lake ; the wide gray eyes were heavy and as expressionless as the voice . So far , there had been no touch of anger or reproach . Or  --  lessp140now . That 's all I say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And very simply and directly , he said , " Will you ? Can you ? " Again , easier said than done  --  especially since the doing was up to me . But I said , " I think so . I give you my word I 'll do my best . ... " It seemed inadequate , thin : like a Scout 's brave pledge at a troop meeting . But he made no comment ; he said only , " This problem of yours : I have n't asked you to tell me about it in any detail . Not because I 'm not interested . But because I thought you might find it difficult . " He said objectively , " I 'm not the easiest man to talk to . Also , there are others who know far more about this sort of thing than I do . Experts . They might be of some help . You might want to talk to them . " I mentioned my confessor ; he said , " Yes , obviously . But you might also try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different approach . Do you know Father Luke Leary ? " " No ....  --  " Alcoholics Anonymous , " he said bluntly . There was anotherof the pauses ; he said , " Does that shock you , Father ? " " No . " Although this was not quite true ; it did , a little . I said tentatively , perhaps defensively , " It 's just that I 'm not quite sure I fit the category . " " No . I do n't say you do . But I think it does no harm to talk to someone who understands drinking . A doctor . Or Father Leary . He 's a sensible man . Not brilliant , but sensible , practical . I have the feeling that he knows what he 's talking about . He drank heavily himself at one time . A bad situation . But he got out of it and since then he 's been helping a few of the priests here in the diocese . You see , you 're not unique , Father . " The low voice seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things happen . Why , I do n't know . Loneliness , I suspect , as much as anything else . They forget what they . . . Well , " he said , coming back to me , " think about it . Your confessor , prayer , yes , of course . But I would n't ignore the other.  |p141The  two go together , I 'd say . At least they do in my experience . " He stood ; the interview was over . " Goodbye , Father . 1 ' 11 give you my blessing . " I knelt for the blessing , and kissed his ring . When I rose , I said goodbye , and thanked him once more for his kindness . Ile said thoughtfully , " I do n't know that it 's kindness . It 's more a matter of balance . I ca n't let anything happen to any of my parishes . But on the other hand I ca n't afford to lose a good priest . I think the second is as important as the first . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father . Do well . Keep busy . " I had almost reached the door when he said , " Father ? " " Yes , Bishop ? " " But not too busy , " he said . " Too many things go on . Save a little of yourself , Father . For what really counts . " It was a shrewd and unexpected stroke . Once again I was reminded that this strange man , so short a time in our diocese , had informed himself surprisingly well . And now I left him and returned to Saint Stephen 's : relieved , even happy in a way , somewhat apprehensive , a little uncertain of what was to come , but above all full of high resolve . The second chance had been given , and given with the greatest generosity ; from now on , I would make the most of it ... . So much for good intentions . Two months . Two months in which I had not the slightest trouble with my parishioners ( there had never been public scandal ; news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Two months in which my curates were nervously eager to demonstrate to me that nothing , really , had happened at all . Two months in which I talked to my confessor ( a stern and careful old man who sat in his chair , his long old body bent forward , his head supported by a veined , translucent hand , his eyes closed ; from time to time he would sigh deeply and murmur " Yes yes , " with a kind of discouraged impatience which suggested that he had heard this same dreary tale manyp142times before and knew far in advance of the telling exactly what the next detail would be ) . Two months in which I did not , despite the Bishop 's urging , call on Father Luke Leary ( for I had no wish to approach the peculiar apostolate of the confessedalcoholic  --  mainly , I suppose , because of the obvious implication ) . Two months in which I prayed and tried to recoversome sense of dedication ; two months in which I stopped all drinking ; two months in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a confidence that at last a corner had been turned . In short , two solid months of progress and of hope : the prelude to the quick collapse . Because it was quick . Quick  --  and mortifying : I capitulated in an instant . There was , one night , after a good day , a sudden onslaught of depression  --  why , I do n't know . I found myself for the first time in weeks smothered by this unaccountable sadness ; it seemed to me that everything I 'd done for the past two months was purposeless , foolish : the steady strides forward were in fact the steps of an ant up the side of a mountain . It was a mood of despair I could n't shake . The more I looked at myself and what I was doing , the more it seemed to me that everything I 'd prized most belonged to the past , that my father , my own hopes , my life as a priest , my friends , were all gone or damaged forever , and that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would slog along the treadmill , whistling to support the delusion that I was coming ahead by leaps and bounds , while in reality I was moving nowhere : a gray , pathetic , neutral figure , kidding himself until the end of his time ... . Bleak moods assail everyone ; most of us have our defenses . That night I had none , and as it grew worse there came a moment when suddenly , automatically , without any sense of arrivingat a decision , I walked quickly out of my room , and out of the rectory , and down the dark night streets to the familiar door of a neighborhood package store . And so it was that , within the matter of an hour , the hope , the optimism , the con/fidence , the accomplishments of the past two months were gone , and I was back where I started . Or rather , much farther back than that : before , I had always had at least a measure of discretion ; now , I seemed to have none . My audience was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I had broadened my field . Now , restless and foggy , I not only left my room at night but I left the rectory as well , and often very late at night  --  or very early in the morning , long before dawn  --  I walked and walked  --  alone , aimless , slightly unsteady  --  through the streets of the parish . The darkness was some protection , but not much ; of course I was seen and of course I was recognized . The rectory secret was now a secret no longer . The whispers began and spread and grew louder : the pastor became the public scandal . I did not even spare myself the authenticcomic touch : very early one morning , on the front porch , as I was fumbling for the key , I was discovered by whom ? The milkman ! The traditional encounter : the pure farce . I did not laugh ... . Nor did the Bishop . This time the summons came quickly ; within a few weeks I was back in his office . He was as expressionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a decision ; he said at once , " It was a mistake . And not only on your part , Father . But now we have to do what some would say we should have done immediately . Perhaps they 're right . Although I do n't know . . . . " He looked at me and said quietly , " I 'm appointing Father Molloy administrator of your parish . " And so I had lost Saint Stephen 's . But of course by now this was inevitable , so much so that even when I heard it announced in so many words , I felt no new pain . I said , " He 's a good priest . They 'll like him . " There was a pause  --  an awkwardone . Then I said , " I 'm sorry , Bishop . Genuinely , sincerely . . . . " And what I meant was a sorrow , not at having lost my parish , but at having failed it . I 'm sure he knew this ; his head movedp144forward in a slow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he said thoughtfully , " I think most people who do something they know is wrong are sorry afterward . And genuinely so . The sinner who rejoices in his sin : that must be fairly rare . Everybody 's sorry . I 'm not trying to cut you off , Father . Or to minimize the value of your sorrow . But I am suggestingthat sorrow by itself does n't really help much . It 's too easily neutralized . It does n't last long . Something else is needed if anything is to be done . " The low voice said unexpectedly , " Do you know The Ccnacle , Father ? " Or not so unexpected , because this , too , was inevitable . I knew The Cenacle  --  or more accurately , I knew about it . Located in the desert country of Arizona , it once had been the home of a national figure wealthy enough to be called eccentric ; twenty years ago it had been purchased by the Church and had become . . . what ? A retreat ? A rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time or another over the years I had heard it called all these things , but whatever the euphemism , The Cenacle was in fact a way station  --  and , in some cases , a final home  --  for the errant priest . To be sent to The Cenacle was . . . well , it was not exactly a boost to one 's self-esteem . Was the Bishop at this moment thinking of my self-esteem ? I thought it unlikely . I looked at him , and once again I saw the slight nod . " Yes , " he said . " There are alternatives . But I think this is best . All things considered . " And then this strange disciplinarianasked , " Does it appeal to you at all ? " And what could I say ? That I was overjoyed to join the company of broken clerics like myself ? I hesitated , then said , " Not very much , I 'm afraid , Your Excellency . Although I would n't have thought that was a particular consideration at this point .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , " You may feel differentlyafter you 've been there awhile . It 's not a penal colony . It 's a place where you can be put on a decent program . Andp145work with intelligent people . People who understand what it is you 're up against . People who can help you . That 's what 's essential . Independent effort is all very well , but if you 're really in trouble , I think it 's seldom good enough . We depend upon each other , Father . All of us . We 're meant to . In a way , that 's what it 's all about . " There was another of those extraordinary pauses , in which he seemed to be communicating with himself . Then he said , " But you know all this . I think most people know it . And I think that a man who does know it and would let his pride , for example , stand in the way of such help would have to be a very short-sighted man . Almost a foolish man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this last remark to suggest the special pointedness  --  yet there was no mistaking that it was there . It was the closest the Bishop had come to the direct rebuke . He stood now ; another of our interviews had ended , this one far less happily than the last . He gave me his blessing again ; he wished me good luck again ; and as I left his office he said again , " Father ? " I turned ; he said simply , " Goodbye . And remember , it 's not forever . We 'll have you back with us again . " It was on this vague note of promise that I left the diocese and went to The Cenacle ... . I was not there forever ; I was there for four years : a long time . Yet it was a good time . Not always a happy one  --  particularly in the first few months  --  but in the end a deeply rewardingone : far more so than I could ever have expected . Because , for one thing , it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , I suppose , a desert reformatory  --  a queer sprawl of adobe building , stripped of the lunatic splendors of its former owner  --  among a fellowship I had joined with reluctance , with resentment ( for it 's quite possible to resent what you admit to be just ) , and with a sense of shame , I did what I could not have done alone : I came to terms with myself ; I came to terms with God . It 's pointless to go into any step-by-step account of what happened  --  although I remember it all , every bit of it . It 's easy enough to say , I think , that from the beginning I was given every help by a few compassionate and knowledgeable men . One was a layman , a doctor who had been out there for some years ; one was a priest who , although still fairly young , had in fact started The Cenacle , nearly two decades before ; three or four more were priests who had no connection with the staff , but who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had come to be cured . And so , professionals , or merely those who had been through the mill themselves , these men were there to help . The odd thing is that I do n't think any of them were what would ordinarily be considered wise men . I look back on our conversations , and I remember little that was at all remarkable : certainly no one was conspicuous for his piety or learning . Yet they had what I needed : they had their experience , they had a clear , hard , practical view of my problem and position , and with an odd combination of bluntnessand delicacy , they managed to point out to me just where I stood and what I was . Moreover , they made themselves available to me at any hour , and for what was I think the first time in my adult life I came to have no hesitation in calling on someone to help mc , if only to talk to me , when I was at my lowest , when sometimes it seemed as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still came , but now I was no longer allowed the reliable obliteration . And so there was nothing else to do but face them . They were endless , and they were awful . Even with every kindness and encouragementfrom those around me , it was a bitter and a desolate business .... And yet this bitterness and desolation did not last . Gradually I began to improve , to respond , to notice and even to take an interest in this new world in which I found myself . It was a world completely new to me ; everything about it was different , even the setting . Especially the setting . I woke each morning top147the bright heat of the desert day , to the pale high sky without acloud . The house was cool , protected by its thick adobe walls . I could look from my window across the enormous sweep of silent space and watch the play of the morning light on great and distant mountains ; at night the sun went down at once , and from a window in the west I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky before the instant , final drop of darkness . It was all strange and completely fascinatingto me . I had grown up in the East and had never left it ; I had grown accustomed to the smaller scale , the close horizons , the crowds and the places where crowds live , and the sudden spiteful turns of weather . Out here there was none of that : only a vast , unbroken grandeur , the majestic monotony of the hot and brilliant days . I never got used to it ; I never got tired of it . I would sit for hours by the window , motionless , thinking , watching , listening to the immense , sunbaked stillness . I suppose it was all a part of the therapy that was going on every day ; in any case , it worked wonders for me . At this time there were perhaps twenty priests at The Cenacle . In addition to the staff , that is , but including the three or four priests I 've already mentioned as being especially helpful . During my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long one : I could have left earlier , and in fact the Bishop once suggested it , but this time I wanted to be sure  --  this number varied : sometimes there were more , sometimes less . They came from dioceses all over the country . Like me , most of them were middle-aged , and had come here for the first time and for the one reason ; again like me , they had arrived filled with shame and the desire to keep to themselves . But there was in this house an atmosphere  --  an atmosphere of help , really  --  which broke down exclusiveness , and this , plus our common bond of all having failed in the same way , sooner or later brought each one into contact with the rest . I came to know them all and to hear their stories  --  just as they came to hear mine . We talked freely , even insistently : after all , our Topic was there . As in any institutionp148where all the inmates suffer from the same malady , we comparedour notes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I found to my surprise that there was a great similarity to all these stories ; in every one , I saw somethingof my own . As the Bishop had said , I was hardly unique . The telltale thread wound its way through all : the slow neglect of the nourishment of the spirit , the failure to realize that unlessthis is daily deepened and enriched , then , when the fervor and the drive of the young priest fade  --  as they must  --  there will be no replacement by a living , ever-growing love , and then , when the aging priest going through the years meets the **25;3357;TOOLONG , crises , or sometimes just the sudden burdenof his loneliness , he may meet them with an emptiness where fullness should be , and the result of that will not be a happy one . Because if a priest has not this continuing current of love , he has nothing . IIc can turn to no one ; his marriage is to God , and if he fails in that , his strength is gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? The Cenacle ? The Cenacle  --  if , that is , he 's fortunate . If not , there are other roads and uglier destinations , and the priest , like any other man , is not immune to these ... But the priests who were with me were firm and unanimous in one intention : to return to their dioceses , to pick up their lives as parish priests , never to need The Cenacle again . Most of them succeeded in this ; they did not come back . Yet there were the sad exceptions , and I can remember with great affectionand sorrow one priest who , even during my stay , left and returned four times . He was a small , pale man with a fragile and strangely gay face ; he must have been more than fifty , but there was about him such a persistently youthful air that he might have been in his thirties . Each time he came back he was a washed-out , shaking ruin , but he had an astonishing ability to recover , and in no time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his springy , chipper step , whistling , joking , looking like a mischievous boy . I talked with him often ;  |p149never  once did he admit to being an alcoholic . He never in fact so much as mentioned drink  --  and this , in The Cenacle , was an extraordinary reticence . Instead he spoke in the vaguest terms of a mysterious respiratory ailment which attacked him recurrently and left him drained and helpless . It was , he explained , a matter of climate . " I tell you , Hugh , this place works miracles for me ! " he said enthusiastically . " It 's the steady heat that does it . The bacilli or the viruses or whatever they call those organisms these days simply perish : it 's genocide the moment they hit the Arizona state line . Here is where I flourish , yet there I am , nailed to New England . They say that it 's the tropics that destroy health , but have you ever stopped to consider who the they ' are who say this ? They all come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions the simple medical fact that the month of March in the Massachusetts bronchial belt is infinitely more debilitating than malaria time in Panama . It 's no accident that all the country 's best hospitals are in Boston , you know : they want to be close to the source of supply . " We walked along , and he whistled cheerfully ; every now and then we paused while he traced in the dust with a stick a quick , deft caricature of some diocesan acquaintance . " John Riordan , " he said . " The clumsiest priest in America . For some reason he got interested in Boy Scout work and they appointed him spiritual director . His bishop had to remove him after two months . He 'd go to the meetings and insist on being one of the boys . You know : splitting firewood , hacking away with hammers and axes and knives . After every meeting he 'd come back to the rectory covered with blood . It was wonderful first-aid practice for the Scouts , but this pastor saw that unless something were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thumbs would very soon be no thumbs at all . So the bishop removed him . No , " he said , returning to an earlier theme , " I 'd like nothing better than to get out . Of New England , that is . Would n't you , Hugh ? Do n't you ever get fed up with it back there ? Wouldn'tp150you like a transfer ? Would n't you like to wake up one morning and find yourself the only priest in some impossibly hot , impossiblyarid land ? " " An American Desert Father ? Or someone like Charles Foucauld ? No , I do n't think so . Not very much . Not at all , really . " " Would n't you ? I would . Oh , would n't I ! " We continued to walk , and after a while he said gaily , " I might found a new order : The Congregation of the Little Fugitives of the North AtlanticSeaboard . Do you think that Rome would look with favor on it ? You could join , Hugh . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand celebration on the day the first flake of snow falls in the Berkshires . We 'd burn a rubber boot . Or a ski . I 'm convinced I 'd never know another sick day . " He was wonderful company on these walks : imaginative , witty , lighthearted . IIc was also extremely plausible , and once , early in my stay , when I first met him , I discussed his case with the priest who was the Director of The Cenacle . " But is n't it possible that there 's something in what he says ? I do n't mean that he is n't an alcoholic , but in back of all the excuses , could n't it be true that the climate might have a little to do with it ? I know people up there who sniffle and whoop and cough six months of the year ; I 'd imagine that if he 's at all susceptible in that direction it would n't help his main problem . Probably some sort of transfer .... " " Transfer , " the Director said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be transferred to . He 's told you about the terrible attrition of the New England winters ? Naturally . Did he also tell you that he has n't spent a winter in New Englandfor the past ten years ? Nominally he 's attached to a parish there ; at least I think he still is . But he 's the greatest traveler I know . They 're unbelievably indulgent with him in that diocese . I suppose it 's because he 's so likable . And he is . He 's one of the most agreeable , likable men I 've ever met . But he 's also most unfortunately a drunk . In New England , in California , in Alabama , in South Bend , Indiana , and in a monastery inP151the Kentucky hills . No , climate has nothing to do with it . Our friend does n't discriminate . Hot or cold , wet or dry , he finds his drink . And takes it . " " Then what can be done about him ? Nothing ? " " Well , I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's nothing , all right . We can straighten him out for a few weeks or a couple of months , but that 's about it . You see , he just wo n't play ball . You ca n't treat a man who refuses to be treated . He wo n't tell me the truth and with the others he 's even worse  --  especially doctors , psychiatrists . He 's very charming with them and tells them these fanciful stories . They 're trained men , of course , and naturally they do n't believea word he says : they know right away what they 've got on their hands . But he pays no attention to what they tell him . I once told him point-blank that of course he was an alcoholic and that it was high time he stopped his nonsense and faced up to it . You would have thought I 'd told him he was twelve feet tall . He professed to be astonished ; he cautioned me , in the friendliest possible way , against being ruled by an obsession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist to interpret everyone in the light of his specialty . And he said that while he did occasionally take a drink to kill the pain  --  just what pain he did n't say : that 's usually left rather indefinite  --  that was a far cry from being an alcoholic . Alcoholism , he said to me , was a disease . So there you are . He wo n't admit to a thing , and this stops us before we can even get started . " " Yet he knows what this place is specifically for . And he must know what he 's doing and what he is . Do you think it 's possible that he could not know ? I mean , that he could have talked himself into believing that he 's not really a drinker ? " " No , he knows , all right . He may not admit anything , but he knows . He 's a very intelligent man . " " And he continues to come back , time after time ? Have you ever made any difficulties about taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I ca n't do anything for him , but I 'll alwaystake him in . If I could think of anything better to do with him I would , but I ca n't . So I 'll take him . It 's a treadmill , but where else can the poor fellow go ? Everybody likes him , but no matter where they ship him it 's the same old story . A short , delighted honeymoon , then  --  bang ! No one 's going to put up with that ; no one can afford to . So his bishop and I have a little arrangement , and whenever he goes off the rails they bring him back from wherever he happens to be  --  and it 's not always easy to find him , by the way  --  and out he comes for another stay . That 's all right with me . As I say , he 's a most likable man . And by now a fairly helpless one , in spite of the way he looks and walks around here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ; I would n't be surprised if he 's come to think of it as his home . " A week or so later , the priest we had been discussing and I were taking one of our usual walks . As always , it was clear and hot , and as we walked , little bright-eyed lizards skittered away in the dust before us , coming to a stop yards away , and freezinginto immobility . Ile said , " I 'll miss seeing those lizards . They look like half the people I know . " I was n't paying the strictest attention ; I said drowsily , " There 's no need to miss them . They 'll be here every day . " " Yes , but I wo n't , " he said . " The time has come , Hugh . D day . I 'm leaving on Friday . " This woke me completely . " So soon ? " " It is soon , is n't it ? I take no credit : it 's all due to long walks in magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest has cleared completely . Of course a return to God 's country may fix that , but probably not this time : I hear they 're having the best summer they 've had in ages . Two consecutive days without rain : all that sort of thing . " I said carefully , " Still , it 's unpredictable at best . I should think you 'd be better off if you did n't rush back . Why not stayp153out here a bit longer and give yourself a chance to build up some resistance ? " " Do you know , that 's just what the Director said ? I thought it was extremely nice of him , especially since I must be all kinds of a nuisance around here . Considering , that is , " he explained , " that I have no right here in the first place . This establishmenthas its own special purpose : it 's not at all geared to my kind of trivial complaint . But they 've been wonderful with me all the same . " " Then why not stay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I have to get back . I have so many things to do . For one thing , I 'm anxious to get working on an idea I have for a diocesan pageant . We have one every year , and of course it 's always pure lunacy . You know the sort of thing : your friendly neighborhood dentist suddenly popping out from behind the curtain and announcing that he 's Saint John of the Cross . Is n't that terrifying ? Of course the Episcopaliansgo even more hog-wild ; they 've taken to staging little Biblical dramas in modern dress . There 's one rather fancy divinein California who presents the Twelve Apostles in berets and Bermuda shorts . We have n't gone in for that yet ; at least I do n't think we have . But what I want to do is something quite traditional . You know Claudel 's Le Soulier Satin ? Well . . . . " And , in the highest of spirits , he went on to tell me about his plan , which was , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reach the same stage of completion as all his other plans . The diocesan pageant could much more safely rely on the friendly neighborhood dentist . When he left we said goodbye warmly , promising to keep in touch with one another . The railroad station was some twenty miles away ; he was to be driven there in The Cenacle 's old ranch wagon , and he sat in the front seat beside the driver looking small and sunburned and happy . At the last minute he stuck his head out the window , said goodbye to me again , and then took a slow and last look around the flat , still desert landscape . " Do you know what I 'm doing , Hugh ? " he said dramatically . " I 'm saying a special goodbye to The Cenacle . It 's not like sayinggoodbye to you , because for one thing in the years to come you and I will probably run into each other a hundred times . But somehow , with The Cenacle , I feel it 's final ; I do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a little sad , is n't it ? Because it 's a very pleasant place , and everyone out here was so good to me . But I have to go home , and when I get there I gather I 'm to be given all sorts of new responsibilities : the kind that will keep my nose to the grindstone until even the grindstone is worn out . So I really do n't imagine I 'll be getting out this way again . Ergo . ... " And he waved a great flourishing wave , which included all the premises ; then he drove off , still waving , at me and at The Cenacle . He was back in six months . By the time I left The Cenacle  --  which was a couple of years later  --  be had been back three times more . And always  --  after the first few days , during which he kept to himself  --  he seemed gay and undismayed , althoughat times a little older , a little more worn . And never once did he speak of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or how he is , I do n't know . I 've written to him several times ; the letters were not returned , so I suppose he got them . But I 've never received an answer : not even a card . I pray for him regularly , as I 'm sure many others  --  whom he met as casually as he met me , and whom he never saw again  --  do : he 's not a man who 's difficult to pray for . I hope he 's all right , and that wherever he is or wherever he goes someone will be found to take a little care of him now and then , to occasionally do for this poor , engaging , bright-faced wanderer what another man , not necessarily any better , but maybe just a little more prudent ,  |p155or  even a little more selfish , would by instinct do for himself ... . I left The Cenacle . I left it at last , thanks to the help , the kindness , the example of those I 've already mentioned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left I had been there  --  as I 've said  --  four years , which was far longer than I had expected , and was I suppose much longer than was strictly necessary . But I was cautious , I wanted no mistakes this time , and the Bishop , understanding this , allowed me to set my own pace . And so I stayed on , gradually becoming almost a part of the place , occasionally helping out with some of the new arrivals  --  trying to do for them at least a little of what others had done for me  --  and then too , helping out with the regular , routine physical chores of the place . The staff was small : there was plenty for everyone to do . Then , as time went by , I was quite often sent out from The Cenacle into the surrounding districts to lend a hand wherever a priest might be needed . In that big country there was a shortage of priests , and The Cenaclehad become a convenient supply depot : a kind of clerical replacement pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days assisting at a parish church in one of the towns , or at an army base , or at one of the little Indian missions ( Bucky , apart from his romantic notion of the priest on horseback , had not been far wrong in his suspicions ) . It was work of a kind I 'd never known before , and along with everything else , it helped . Often , driving back to The Cenacle at night , I found that I could think about things I had n't really thought about for years . And there were moments when , bumping along on a bucket seat over a freeway of baked mud , passing through the strange quiet and the clear shining darkness of the desert night , I would suddenly become aware of a stillness which was something quite apart from the stillness of the night . It was an interior stillness , a stillness inside me , a stillness in which there was the absence of all distraction and unrest , a stillness inwhich , quietly and without effort , I seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really present , so to speak , a stillness from which it seemed natural , even inevitable , to reach out , to pray , to adore ... . And this is what I mean by saying that slowly , but at last , I came to terms with myself and with God . In the end , this is what The Cenacle meant to me . I left it with gratitude and regret ; in a way I did n't want to leave at all . But I did leave . I had been there long enough ; it was time to go back to the diocese where I belonged . I went first to the Bishop . Four years had not changed him ; he was as undemonstrative as ever . Yet I knew that he was pleased to see mc , and after a brief welcome he said , " We have the problem of where to put you . I could keep you here in the chancery for a while , but I thought you might like to get back to a parish . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is . " " We 're limited in choice at the moment , " he said . " There are n't many vacancies . A few , in different parts of the diocese . None is as agreeable as your old parish . " Then he said , " There is one vacancy in your own city . How do you feel about that ? It 's a question of whether , immediately , you want to go back . " To the scene of the crime ? It was a question indeed : I 'd thought about it often . For The Cenacle was one thing ; the old home town was quite another . And even though it was n't Saint Raymond 's or Saint Stephen 's , still , whatever parish it was , it was in the same city , people moved about and talked : encounters , awkward encounters , were inevitable . But just as inevitable was the fact that one day , sooner or later , I would go back : I knew that ; postponement was n't much of a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an offer , and I was in no position to go about rejecting parishes . And so I said , " I think it might be well to go back right away , Your Excellency . " ' What did I expect him to do ? Clap me on the shoulder , say firmly , " That 's the brave priest ? " No . Hardly . Which wasp157fortunate , because all he did say was , " All right . In that case ... do you know Old Saint Paul 's ? " I knew Old Saint Paul 's . I think every priest in the diocese knew Old Saint Paul 's  --  or at least knew about it . Just how many of them knew or even suspected that it still survived as a functioning parish was another matter . For the majority , I imagine , it was merely a part of ancient diocesan history ; now , abruptly , it had become a part of my history . I tried to feel enthusiasm . I remembered when I had last seen this church . It was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been driving back across the city to Saint Stephen 's . Normally the route I traveled took me nowhere near Saint Paul 's , but on this day there was a detour , and as the traffic slowly edged its way around through the slum district , I had every chance to take in the tattered neighborhood and the church itself . And just as I was passing the church , a priest  --  an elderly priest  --  came out of the rectory next door . I knew most of the priests in the city , but for some reason I did n't know this one . He was a tired-looking man with a dusty soutane ; as he walked up the church steps he paused and with one foot nudged an empty bottle and a tin can off the steps and out into the gutter . Then , slowly , he walked into the church . I remember feeling a sympathy for him , and wondering who he was , and what he had done to warrant this albatross around his neck . And now the albatross was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bishop said candidly . " It 's no prize . But there it is , and it needs a pastor . You 've been inside the church ? The rectory ? " I said , " Yes , but many years ago . " Did I say this hopefully ? For , after all , there was the possibility that improvements had been made . . . . The Bishop doomed the possibility . " Then you know what to expect , " he said . Now , once again , as on my first visit to this office , he rose from his desk and walked over to the window , where he stood in silence , looking out . Today the windowp158was closed ; there was no sound of the lawn-mower and no smell of cut grass . It was a day in the middle of March , and there was snow on the ground ; a few minutes before freezing rain had begun to drive down . A gray day , suitable for gray tidings ... . The low , private voice said suddenly , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of date . They 've been after me to tear it down . On the ground that it 's a dead loss . They 're right , of course . But I have a feeling for Saint Paul 's . It 's a church that has meant a lot in its time . It stands for something in the diocese . And it 's still needed . People know it ; it 's familiarin a way that a new church could never be . I ca n't afford to restore it , but at least I can keep it together . " He looked over at me and said , " It 's not an additional punishment , Father . I agree it must seem so , but I do n't mean it as such . It wo n't be like anything you 've had before , but I think you may find it has its own compensations . We 'll see . If it does n't work out I 'll arrange something else . But give it a try . " And so at least I had a promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Paul 's . There had been no dramatic changes : that much was clear at once . The whole place seemed exactly as I had remembered it . I went into the rectory and established myself in the pastor 's bedroom ; the priest who had been here on temporary assignment greeted me and shook my hand . He shook both hands . Fervently . I think no man could have been happier to see another ; I think his bags must have been packed for days . He would not stay the night but left immediately , repeatedly assuring me that Old Saint Paul 's was now " all mine . " I 'm sure he thought I was about to bolt , leaving him once more in full and unhappy possession . . . . Alone , I began to walk around the rectory in a slow examination of the premises . It was not a cheering tour . There was dust and dirt and ample evidence of mice ; light bulbs had burned out and had not been replaced ; from old rooms onp159the top floor came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went downstairs and crossed over into the church . It was too dark by now to see what it was really like , but I had a fair idea . I knelt in the sanctuary for a few moments , then I went back to the rectory and into the kitchen . I was suddenly hungry ; I looked for something to eat . Provisions , however , were slim : the priest who had left so abruptly seemed to have lived here as if he were camping out in a haunted house . Butthere were various items scattered around , and from them I put together my first meal as pastor of Old Saint Paul 's : a can of Vienna sausage , a glass of nonfat milk , and an apple . Scenes of clerical gluttony : I thought of my father 's notes on the theme . And then , because it had been a long and not a particularlyexhilarating day , I went back up to my bedroom and there , in the quiet of the rectory  --  or what passed for quiet in an old building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering scurry of small paws behind the walls  --  I finished my office for the day and went to bed . The next morning  --  for no reason at all I remember that it was a Tuesday  --  I said my first Mass in the old and virtually empty church ; there was not even the usual complement of the curious , eager to inspect the new pastor . Here in Old Saint Paul 's , they could n't have cared less . I saw two or three old ladies and , seated halfway back in the church , a Chinese : it was my first glimpse of Mr. Yee . After Mass , I returned to the sacristy to find a thin , dark man with evasive eyes waiting for me . This was Roy , the janitor ; he was making what I was later to discover was one of his infrequent appearances . He introducedhimself to me ; he apologized profusely for not having been on hand to meet me when I had arrived . " Only , " he said , " when you got here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know . " In jail , " he said . " With cops around him . " It was all I needed . The parish , the rectory , the church , andp160now a janitor who had arrived fresh from jail . And , moreover , one who spoke of himself in the third person . He continued , even more alarmingly . " Roy said to them , It ai n't right to keep me here . You got no right to coop a man up unless you got charges . ' They said , Oh , we got charges all right . You know we got the charges . We got all kinds of charges . You 're one smart cookie , Roy , but we got you at last . You pushed it too much this time , Roy . Smart as you are , you ca n't never get away with no kidnapping ! ' What you think of that , Father ? " he said . " A man that works in church every clay and they finger him for a kidnapper ! Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here he is , he should be over at the church to do his work and say hello to his new priest , and where is he ? In jail on a frame ! " At some point in this narrative belief had suddenly collapsed under the burden of absurdity ; I found myself looking at Roy , who had begun to breathe heavily , slap his sides , and stamp on the floor in order to emphasize this account of jailhouse injustice , and all at once I knew that at the moment when he should have been here to meet me he had in all probability been asleep in his bed . There had been no kidnapping charge , no jail , no cops . Roy was , quite simply , embroidering , although with a somewhat wilder hand than most . I congratulated him on having gained his freedom so quickly ; he replied darkly that Roy knew the ropes . " He knows the ropes , " he said , " and he knows his rights . Roy do n't need no mouthpiece , Father . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put them cops right in their place He said to them , Look here , you better let Roy go and be quick about it . You better not keep no man from the Catholic church where he works his fingers to the bone each day . You better not keep him from his new priest or that new priest might get mad and come on over here and blow his stack at you ! ' That 's what Roy told them , Father . So they had to letp161him go . Only , " he said regretfully , " too late for him to be here on time . " " Now that you are here , " I said , and began to talk to him about the many things that needed to be done about the church . He seemed delighted . " Roy 's been waiting to begin , " he said . " Just tell Roy where to start , Father . " I told him ; he nodded enthusiastically . " That 's a good place , " he said . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , he left me , saying that he would return early that afternoon . I did not see him for a week ... . In this way I began my new pastorate . It was more or less the way I had expected ; life in Old Saint Paul 's held few surprises . But it did hold one  --  and that one was the great surpriseof my own contentment here . For in spite of all the obviousdrawbacks , in spite of every sad expectation having been met , I was not unhappy in Saint Paul 's  --  not even in those first hours of glum exploration . It 's not easy to explain , even to my own satisfaction , but for some reason I seemed to feel that in a peculiar way I fitted the parish , that there was some sort of rough equation between Saint Paul 's and myself . I 'd never been in a parish remotely like it before , yet I did n't feel at all strange or in the least out of place here . There was a quality which drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was probably nothing more at first than the sheer calm of the place . It had the quiet , the absence of turmoilatmosphere that seldom visited backwaters often have . It was so peaceful , so undemanding a parish that to have moved here from The Cenacle seemed actually a very slight transition . I had my parish duties to perform , of course , but as I 've said earlier , these were neither many nor arduous . And because my polyglot parishioners kept pretty much to themselves , I found myself with a great deal of time on my hands ; with no curate , I found myself alone for long intervals . But this loneliness nop162longer bothered me . I read more than I had in years , I thought about what I 'd learned in The Cenacle , I began to take the long nightly walks through the district , and I worked regularly around the church and rectory , painting and making a few minor repairs , trying to pick the place up a bit . I was helped in this by the acquisition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , just a week after my arrival , was a major move . I even came to some sort of rather equivocal relationship with Roy : I raised his salary . Not much , but all I could afford ; no matter how little he did , the poor fellow deservedmore than he 'd been getting . Now , in gratitude , Roy came irregularly but more frequently , each time with a differentexcuse , or  --  failing that  --  some fanciful tale from his imaginarypast . He told stories of having been a chef on a transatlanticliner , a professional dancer , the fire chief of a small town in Connecticut , a rum-runner during Prohibition , a newspaperman , a jockey , a Communist . I found these glamorous fictions ingenious and entertaining , but poor Father Danowski , when he came , found them unendurable . He was baffled by Roy ; I think he was even a little afraid of him . Sturdy , even powerful , himself , Father Danowski had the strong man 's fear of the suspected lunatic , and Roy 's sudden plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular one encounter between them ; it took place shortly after Father Danowski had arrived in the parish . Roy had been painting the back of the rectory ; Father Danowski had come out and had been cornered . From my room I could overhear a chilling account of Roy 's career as a middleweight boxer . The career had been a short one , for it appeared that Roy , once maddened by blood , was uncontrollable . The knee , the thumb , the elbow , the savage kick were all vital parts of his fighting technique ; after nearly destroying an opponent twice his size in a memorable bout in San Diego , he had been barred from the ring for life . It was a preposterous story , butp163Roy was a vivid raconteur and told it with great conviction . Father Danowski was clearly impressed . " Well well , " he said nervously . " Well well , Roy . That is quite a horrible tale . I trust that is all in the dead past now . " Then , apparently feeling that a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust Father Kennedy and I may feel safe from your assaults ? Although to be sure you undoubtedly would not commit the sacrilege of striking a priest . " Roy had not been reassuring . " When the mood is on him , " he said , " Roy would strike anything ! " " He is a wild person , " Father Danowski said , reporting this conversation to me some moments later . " A wild and a violent person , Father . Mark my words , we had better have a care or we will all be murdered in our beds ! " But Roy stayed on , and nothing happened . And indeed , in another and larger sense nothing happened : the phrase might almost have been the motto of the parish . For situated as we were , in the middle of the slum , we had few points of contact with the life of the large and active city ; the slum served as an untidy but efficient moat . When I came to the parish all sorts of changes and developments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were blowing , there was talk of urban renewal , one transportation crisis was succeeded by another , civic bankruptcy was said to be upon us  --  yet none of this seemed to penetrate the passive , dusty enclave of Old Saint Paul 's . I was in the city in which I had spent most of my life and in whose affairs I had taken a small but always interested part ; I might have been a thousand miles away . I soon saw that I need have no fear of old acquaintances running up against me bearing fragments of the past in their hands . Now , I met almost no one I had known in the old days . Sometimes an occasional visitor came to the rectory : someone who 'd been one of my parishioners in either Saint Raymond 's or Saint Stephen 's . We talked pleasantly enough , although not for too long ; then they went away and did not return . I wondered at first what was behind these visits . Curiosity ? Kindness ? A little of both , probably . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came casually to this part of the city ; no one " dropped in . " One had to make a special , deliberate point of visiting Old Saint Paul 's , and I think that many of those I had known so well hesitated now to make this point , feeling  --  quite rightly  --  that under the circumstances the first move was surely mine . I realized this ; I knew that for many of them it was their sensitivityto my feelings , their fear of my embarrassment quite as much as their own , which kept them away ; I knew that if any hands were to be extended , it was up to me to reach out first . But this I did not do . For several reasons , I suppose : prudence , a sense of shame , a feeling that to evoke even those few parts of the past which meant the most to me  --  a handful of people , three or four places  --  might in the end bring the whole thing sweeping in on me : the old principle of inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did nothing . I told myself that there was plenty of time , that one day , some day , perhaps I might make the move . But meanwhile , secure in Old Saint Paul 's , I did what seemed best or at least safest : I simply stayed away . Until , that is , today ... . And now it was the end of today , and this  --  not so briefly  --  is what I thought about as I sat by the window in my room , looking up the length of the now dark street , listening to the quiet night , drifting back through so many years in this long , slow flow of memory which had begun with an old man 's birthday party on a summer afternoon . How strange it was that when at last I did go back , it should have been through the unlikely auspices of old Charlie ; I wondered what my father would have said to that . And how strange it was , too , that all the fears and anticipations had been for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt mostly was enjoyment and ap165full , warm satisfaction that I had n't felt since  --  well , since a very long time ago . So long ago that I 'd almost forgotten . And it was only now , I think , as I sat here with so much of the past and present summoned up and laid before me side by side , giving me a kind of comparison test  --  a before-and-after picture of myself  --  that I realized how much I had really changed . For everything that had happened , beginning with my father 's death and ending with The Cenacle , had left me , not a sad man , certainly , but a silent and a solitary one . In the old days , whenever I was with my parishioners , I always felt a sense of apartness , to be sure  --  that apartness which any priest must feel in the company of laymen : the mere fact of his collar alone is an effective badge of separation  --  but at the same time I always felt at home . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those large parish gatherings where throngs of people were squashed into a hall , and I mixed easily and eagerly with them , sharing their high spirits and their stories : I think , at the time , I even had a mild reputation as a neighborhoodraconteur . In other words , the popular priest . Today , of course , I do n't mix , there are no parish gatherings over here , and time has brought a new taciturnity to the neighborhood raconteur : I 'm fully aware that my conversation consists largely of the small , necessary key words and phrases of acknowledgment , plus an assortment of short and noncommittal sentences which really do n't do much to keep talk going . In many ways I 've become a modified and muffled man  --  which , when you consider the unmuffled version , is not necessarily a turn for the worse . And the curious  --  and fortunate  --  thing is that it takes no effort to keep the muffler on . That is , every day is not a heroic struggle against the pull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire at all to do the things I used to do , to live the way I used to live . I suppose this happens to everyone to a greater or lesser degree : as we grow older or endure experience certain parts of us are awakened , certain other parts , which were alert , responsive , gradually become dull or die out entirely . Which isp166all right with me : in this case I do not mourn the dead . Yet all the same , every now and then , a flicker of nostalgia shoots up through : probably a special kind of homesickness reserved for the aging man instead of the boy at boarding school . I 'd felt it this afternoon , with old Charlie and Bucky and P. J. and Helen and John : the dead tissues twitched a bit . All of which is natural enough , probably even inevitable . And does no harm , I think : a one-time visit to old Charlie can hardly upset the balance of my days .. . It was late now ; I 'd been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to get ready for the night . Father Danowski came in , returning from his family evening . He has the habit  --  which I would n't discourage for the world  --  of coming in to sec me every night before he goes to bed , like some big , clumsily formal , obedient puppy . Tonight he was full of the impact of the name of old Charlie upon his father . " Memories , Father , " lie said . " It served to bring them back in a flood . How well my father recalled his many dealings with that shrewd old person ! What tussles they had over the years ! At one point Mr. Carmody sought to intimidate my father by threatening to raise the rent . But he did not know my father . My father said to him , ' Have a care , Mr. Carmody . You are not talking to just anybody . You are talking to Casimir Danowskiwho is quite aware of your many obligations in this matter . And unless you see to it that the kitchen windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you know what will happen to you ? You will be subjected to severe penalties in a court of law ! ' Oh yes , Father , " said Father Danowski admiringly , " my father was almost an attorney in matters of this kind . It is no wonder old Mr. Carmody came to have such a deep respect for him . " He nodded his head wisely , in thorough comprehension of all such merited respect ; he rose on his toes and sank back on his heels ; he looked around my room in his final nightly survey . " Well well , " hep167said , " the end of yet another day . It has been a good day for you , Father ? " " Yes , " I said . " Yes , a very good day . " " A little change , " he said sagely . " Something that is advis-ablefor us all now and then . How glad I am for you , Father ! " That extraordinary expression of ponderous benignity once more clumped down on the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bless me , to tell me to go my way in peace . Still , whatever the manner , there was n't the slightest doubt that he meant what he said , that he really was glad for me  --  which , after all , is all that matters . Or so I remindmyself  --  rather often  --  in my conversations with my curate . He said good night , and then , just before he left the room , he said , " Oh , by the bye , Father : you remember that earlier today I mentioned the possibility of Mr. Carmody 's one day expressing his interest in Old Saint Paul 's ? From a financial point of view ? I wonder if you recall my speaking of that ? " " I do indeed . Vividly . " So then , hope had not died entirely with the appearance of Charlie 's ordained son . . . . " I spoke of it again this evening , " he said . " To my father . " " Ah . And what was his reaction ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Loudly . Almost to scorn , you might say . My father is a man of eloquence , Father , in the tradition of the old country , but I have seldom heard him express himself with such feeling ! He said to me , Stanley , you are living in a fool 's paradise . I will tell you what that old man will give you . He will give you not a thing . Count on yourself , Stanley . Do not count on other people . If you count on Mr. Carmody you are counting on a man who will see you ground to dust in your grave and your church crumbled to little pebbles before he will give you so much as a dime ! ' Am I correct , " he said , " am I correct , Father , in assuming that this opinion somewhat coincides with your own ? "  | " Somewhat , " I said . " Although I think your father 's being just a little extreme .... " Which was a fairly lukewarm defense of the little old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danowski said proudly , " Yes , that is his way . His style , so to speak . But substantially , Father ? In essence . . . ? " " In essence . " And it was with at least a twinge of guilt that I said , " Well , yes . In essence , I think you could say that your father 's not too far wrong . " He nodded , but said nothing . After a moment he said good night once more and left the room with slow steps . He was not easily discouraged , but I think now he saw all too clearly that Charlie had been nothing more than a false dawn , that the brighter , brisker , spick-and-span Saint Paul 's remained as far away as ever . I went downstairs and over into the church ; I usually do this before going to bed . The church now was absolutely still . I prayed , and after a while I went back to my room . I was tired , and I knew that tonight , after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not immediately ; the day was not quite over . Almost as soon as I got into bed the telephone rang , and once again , with something of the surprise I had felt on that morning only a few days ago , I heard the voice of Charlie Carmody . " Father ? You 're not asleep yet ? " " No , no , Mr. Carmody . " I added quickly  --  and , I hoped , meaningfully , " Not yet . " " Ai n't that grand ! " he said approvingly . " Oh , I tell you , Father , it does an old man good to hear your voice : nice and loud and clear as a bell . That 's the way a priest should sound , night or day ! On the job ! If there 's anythin ' I hate is to call up a rectory on the telephone and hear some sleepy little voice sneakin ' out at me from under the pillows ! Oh , there 's a dreadfullot of lazy priests around the diocese today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar , and where are they ? Upp169in their beds , makin ' little tents for themselves under the covers and comin ' out only for meals ! I know them all , Father . They 're a bad bunch ! " I had a sudden and rather frightening vision of old Charlie , clad in his nightgown and posted by the telephone , late at night and very early in the morning grimly dialing all the rectories in the diocese , checking up on clerical sleep . I said , " You 're a hard man on us , Mr. Carmody . " " Not on you , Father , " he said magnanimously . " Oh no , not on you . I make an exception of you . You 're just like your poor pa : up at all hours and ready for anythin ' ! " As a description of either my father or myself this was staggeringlyinaccurate ; I said quickly , " Anyway , I 'm glad you called . It gives me another chance to thank you for today . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at all : the boot is on the other foot . I 'm the one to thank you . That 's what I called you up for now . I had it in mind all the time to thank you for comin ' all the ways across the city just to see an old man on his birthday . But then d'ye know what happened ? I could n't remember ! What d'ye think of that , Father ? I could n't rememberif I did or not ! " Was this credible ? Could old Charlie really have been so disturbed at the thought of not having thanked me  --  or anyone else , for that matter ? I said , " You did , Mr. Carmody . Althoughthere was certainly no need . . . . " " I could n't remember , " he said again , and this time he spoke sadly , and the old voice sounded weaker than before . I recognizedanother of Charlie 's quick changes into pathos . " But I do n't remember anythin ' these days . Not a blessed thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I know what peoplesay . They look out and say , Take a look at old Charlie : ai n't he a livin ' miracle ? At his age with a mind like a steel trap and a memory that forgets nothin ' ! " But they 're all wrong , Father . Lately I forget nearly everythin ' . They do n't know that , and I 'll tell you this : I 'm glad they do n't know . Ip170would n't want to trouble them . I get down on my knees at night and pray to God they 'll never know . Oh God , ' I say , do n't let these nice people know that Charlie Carmody 's an old old man that 's fallin ' apart more every day . Do n't let them know there 's mornin 's he wakes up without rememberin ' who he is or where he is or is he rich or poor . Do n't let them know , dear God , because I 'm the kind of man that bothers no one ! ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I s'pose no matter what , they 'll all get to know sooner or later anyways . I s'pose I 'll get worse as time goes by . I s'pose one day I 'll do somethin ' crazy , like forgettin ' where my own house is , or walkin ' out on the street with no trousers on . They 'll all know then , Father . I ca n't stop them from knowin ' then . And what will they do about it once they do know ? I hope they wo n't poke fun . I hope they wo n't laugh at each other and say , Look at old Charlie , he 's lost his marbles ! ' Oh , I hope they wo n't say nothin ' like that . And I do n't think they will . People are nice and kind , as a rule . I always loved people , Father . That 's the kind of man I am . And so I s'pose when they see me like that they 'll just shake their heads and say , Poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's slippin ' away into nothin ' at all . And what a grand man he used to be ! ' I s'pose that 's what people will say about old Charlie , Father ! " It was a woeful recitation , a far cry indeed from the jubilant account of old age that he had delivered earlier in the day . By now it was almost out of sheer instinct that I said , " I 'd imagine the loss of memory would be an enormous inconvenience to anyone , Mr. Carmody , but especially to someone like yourself . Your tenants must be constantly coming up to you , asking questions about the rent , finding out how much they owe . And I can understand what a predicament this places you in . You ca n't tell them because you really ca n't remember . And so I suppose they slip away , often without paying anything at all . I can see how that would happen . " This personal vision was greeted with a moment of silence.  | " You can see that , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once again I heard the grim , dusty little chuckle . " By God , then , your eyes are better than mine . I tell you they are . Becausecause I do n't see nothin ' like that at all . Oh , they give it a try now and again . They come up to me , shufflin ' with sad little steps , smilin ' the little whimperin ' smile , and sayin ' ai n't it a grand day , Mr. Carmody , and did n't the wife pay you somethin ' on account the twelfth of last month , the day you did n't have your book with you ? Oho , " he cried , " they 're sly ! I 'll give them that , Father . People are sly . Sly and bold . Bold as brass . I know them all . They 're always out to take advantage of a man that 's got a soft heart . But I see right through them . They look different to me than to you , Father , I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their hands folded nice in front of them , marchin ' up to the altar rail , and you say to yourself , Here come the saints . ' But I look at them and I say to myself , There go the burglars ! ' Every damn one of them , Father ! I know them all . I spent my whole life learnin ' about people , and most of them would cut your heart out with a post-office pen for the sake of a ten-cent piece ! And if they know a man 's got a kind heart and likes to do nice things for people , they come runnin ' full speed to him with nothin ' in their pockets and gravy on their chins , cryin ' help , help ! Oh , do somethin ' , Mr. Carmody ! ' they yell . Help us out or else little Nora will have to give up the ice-skatin ' lessons , and the man from the store will be up with the van to take away the grand piano that turns into the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , Mr. Carmody ! Do somethin ' for us ! ' And I do , " he said . " I 'll tell you what I do for them , Father . I hand them a little bill and , nice and soft , I point out the day it 's due , and then I tell them they 'd damn well better pay upand in full , or else little Nora will be out on her backside on II Clancy Boulevard with mud puddles next to her mattress . She can skate on them when they all freeze over . That 's what I do for them , Father , and it 's what I do because I know them allp172like the back of my hand . Swindlers all ! " Then , astonishingly , he added , " But live and let live ! " It was another of the irrelevant but supporting mottoes which apparently served Charlie so well . There was a pause now , and , because it was late at night  --  at least , late for me  --  and because I was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there something special , Mr. Carmody .... " But I doubt that he even heard this , for just as I started to speak he broke in , saying heartily , " Well , good night , Father . That 's what I called you up for . To thank you and to say good night . Pleasant dreams , Father . And say a prayer for Charlie . " And , oddly enough , this seemed to be all he had called for . The mystery of the day remained unraveled , and by now I was too tired to care . I said , " I will , Mr. Carmody . Good night . Sleep well . " " Oh , I sleep grand , " he said . " Like a baby . A little child . It comes from doin ' nothin ' bad , and bein ' a friend to all ! " And was I wrong , or was there once more , at this , the sound of the old dry chuckle ? I do n't know , because as he hung up I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last.  |p175AFTER  CHARLIE 'S party there was an interval of quiet in which I neither saw nor heard from any of the Carmodys . In a way , this was not surprising . For one thing , I made no effort to reach them . Not because I did n't want to , or because I would n't enjoy enormously seeing them again , but because I still felt , really , as I had from the first moment of Charlie 's first call : that in this situation , here in Saint Paul 's , with everything going so well , it was simply safer and wiser to leave the past alone . As for Helen and John and their promises to keep in touch with me from now on , I had no doubt that these promises were sincere and would be kept . But in good time ; after all , they were not adolescents , frantic to communicateevery hour on the hour with their friends . Like myself they were middle-aged ; we had been apart a long time ; we had grown into our own lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there was no hurry . I knew that sooner or later , in one way or another , I would hear from them . It was a knowledge that did not bring me unmixed comfort . . . . Still , while the silence of Helen and John did not surprise me , the silence of their father did . Clearly old Charlie had mysterious business of some sort with me which was yet to be finished , and he was not a man who let go easily . I had expected  --  and half feared  --  a sequence of rambling telephonep176talks , all occurring at times of maximum inconvenience . But I was wrong . The calls did not come at all hours ; they did not come at all . Charlie became a part of the Carmody quiet , and in this quiet I went about my daily duties , occasionally looking back on the birthday , remembering even the insignificant details  --  the boy from the orphanage , greedily savoring in memoryeach taste and smell of the Christmas feast !  --  and wonderingevery now and then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fairly seldom , largely because I suddenly found myself with no spare time . The pace had unexpectedly picked up in Old Saint Paul 's ; two events took place , one immediatelyfollowing the other , which stirred us to unprecedentedactivity . The first of these was the visit of the Bishop to the parish . This was a formal visit ; it called for preparations . Unfortunately , most of these preparations depended upon Roy , but this always unpredictable figure astonished me with furious spasms of scrubbing and sweeping and painting , so that on the day before the Bishop arrived , both church and rectory were , if not spotless , at least at their most presentable . Father Danowski said , " Well well , Roy . You see what can be done if only you give of your best efforts ? " This tribute was not well received . The Bishop came on a Sunday morning , and sang a Solemn Mass at ten o'clock . There was a small , improvised choir ; Father Danowski had relentlessly drilled the altar boys ; and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elaborate , even magnificent . And yet there was one disappointment : although the visit of the Bishop had been announcedwell in advance , the people came in no great numbers . Attendance was adequate , but no more than that ; the old , large , half-empty church was full evidence that the parishionersof Saint Paul 's did not easily respond to the occasion . Mrs. Addione , however , had responded ; after Mass the Bishop came back to the rectory for what was really a hand/some breakfast . He ate slowly and well , and over the breakfast table , while the calm , apart , impersonal manner remained the same , and there was no sudden thaw into chumminess , I found myself easier with him  --  partly , I suppose , because the setting was my own , partly because the circumstances of this meeting were considerably less forbidding . The Bishop talked freely , not at all about the events of that morning , but about diocesan matters in general . There were just the two of us ; Father Danowski , who still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been able to join us for only a moment . When he left he did so in his most formal manner , managing somehow to suggestthe departure of some vast , bulky courtier from a levee in another century . But as he was in the middle of this exit , the Bishop did a curious thing . He smiled faintly and suddenly said something in a language I did not for the moment place . Father Danowski , startled completely out of his disguise , flushed , and stammered something to the Bishop in the same language . He left the room like a schoolboy , his steps awkward , but his round face shining with pride . The Bishop said to me , " My mother was Polish . And my father was German . Born in Milwaukee , but still , that 's Germanenough . Or it was in those days . " The Bishop had a German name , and I wondered now why I had n't thought more about this before , for in this part of the world the bishop who was not drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no good reason for this , other than the reason of tradition  --  that this was the way it had always been , ever since the old days when virtually all the priests and all the people were immigrants from the same land . This had all changed , of course , but traditions last long , and I thought it entirely probable that this present bishop was the first " non-Irish " one the diocese had ever known . I mentioned this to him ; he nodded . " Yes . It 's a precedent . Not a terribly important one , but in a certain sense it is . There are obvious disadvantages . A smallp178percentage of any old guard dies hard . Especially here . " After a moment he added thoughtfully , " The danger of course is narrowness . A confusion of aims .... " It was a cryptic start , but he did not go on ; instead , he broke off and turned to a discussion of the affairs of Saint Paul 's . It was hardly a searching discussion ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of repairs , revenuesacquired , funds needed . But the questions were perfunctoryrather than penetrating ; I even had the impression that he felt no particular interest in them , but asked them only because they were the routine questions which , at one point or another , had to be asked of every pastor . They went on for a few minutes , then abruptly he said , " You 've been here . . . how long ? A year ? A little better than that , is n't it ? How does it seem to you now ? " I told him about the parish , hinting , rather than stating explicitly , at what it had come to mean to me . And I added , " It 's still a little strange , though . I think it would always be , no matter how long I was here . And it 's not just the matter of racial mixtures or different languages . It 's the queer isolation . In a way , it 's like a foreign mission , yet here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and completely cut off at the same time . You sometimes feel that you have no lines out to anywhere . " " Do you find this depressing ? Discouraging ? " " No . I seldom think of it , to tell you the truth . Very little about the parish depresses me ; as I 've said , I get along here remarkably well . However , I could wish I knew the people a bit better . That 's a situation which seems to remain fairly static . " But he made no comment at all on this ; instead , he drank the last of his coffee . Then he said slowly , and as if to himself , " A year . " No more followed ; he sat looking down thoughtfully at the empty coffee cup , and it seemed to me as though the atmosphere was changed ; I had the feeling , almost the certainty , that the Bishop was on the point of saying something ofp179the greatest importance to me . I suppose it was the soft phrase " A year " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of probation ? Was he in fact about to tell me that my stay at Old Saint Paul 's was over ? That I had done well enough , that now a bigger , better parish could be mine ? Suddenly I felt certain that this was exactly what he was going to say , and with this I felt a quick panic : I had no wish , none at all , to leave Saint Paul 's . But I must admit this : at the same moment there flashed into my head , wildly , another thought , and I almost said aloud : Saint Stephen 's ! Not Saint Raymond 's , for John had that , but the next best thing : my old parish . It was astonishing , even impossible : it was the last thing I had wanted . But now it occurred to me instantly , leaping into my mind as an exciting possibility , crashing headlong into all panicky regretsabout Old Saint Paul 's . It lasted for only a second , then went as quickly as it had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed . It was a moment which had taken me completelyaway from the Bishop . I looked at him now and saw that his eyes had left the table and were considering me quietly , and I was suddenly completely sure that I could read in him the very words which would tell me of the change ... . I was wrong . For what the Bishop actually said was , " Spanish . Do you speak it at all , Father ? " Spanish . So much for prescience , my powers of intuition . It must have been a long moment before I finally said , " Some , Your Excellency . Not very much . " If there was a delay he did n't seem to notice it ; he said only , " I would think it might be of some help over here . " But he did n't pursue this ; he went back to talk of general matters , and shortly afterwards he left . In many ways the visit had been a successful one , but for me it had been reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of this moment  --  of that crazy surge of delighted anticipationfor something I 'd convinced myself I no longer wanted  --  came to me often and disquietingly , reminding me that wep180are seldom as fixed and sure as we believe ourselves to be . Sometimes just a puff of temptation , and the backbone cracks ... . However , the visit had no such melancholy effect on Father Danowski . He was ecstatic ; he said to me , " What a remarkable person he is , Father ! How fortunate we are in this diocese , to have a leader of such calibre to guide the reins of our destiny ! " Which certainly may have been true enough  --  although not necessarily because our leader knew how to say goodbye in Polish ... . And now the second of the two events occurred ; this once concerned Father Danowski directly . Less than a week after the Bishop 's visit he was taken to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy . he had come into my room very late one night , gasping for breath , and repeating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a very bad pain ! " I called for an ambulance ; he was taken to the hospital and operated on immediately . He came through with flying colors , and when I went to see him on the following day he was slightly fuzzy from opiates but otherwise in good shape . " Thanks , " he said , grabbing my hand as soon as I came near his bed . " Thanks a lot , Father . " Then , already beginning to recover his dignity even under the fading anesthesia , he said thickly but formally , " Your quick action , Father , saved my life . " " I made a telephone call . It does n't take too much quick action to dial a number ; that 's about what it amounted to . " " Nevertheless , " he said solemnly . " Nevertheless . " And then he went off to sleep . It was in this week that I met , for the first time , that almost legendary figure , Father Danowski 's father . I met him one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he turned out to be a very small man  --  was Father Danowski , I wondered , a physical sport in his family ? Or had he derived both size and strength from his mother ?  --  with a face full of creases and ap181heavy gray brush of a moustache . I guessed him to be slightly older than myself and , far from being the firebrand of his son 's stories , he seemed a mild and even a submissive man  --  althoughthis may have been the effect of his surroundings ; hospitals seem to overpower and diminish people . On that afternoon he said very little , but Father Danowski took in every word with an obvious pride and later , when his father had left , he said comfortably to me , " Well , Father , do you see what I mean now ? " " Yes . Yes indeed . " " How pleased I am , " he said , " that he took to you so quickly . That is most unusual with him . " Another surprise . " You felt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite unmistakable , Father . One could gauge it from his very silence alone . Perhaps you observed his occasional periods of silence ? " " Yes , I observed those . . . . " " Out of respect to you , " he said , nodding . " That is what they were , Father . My father is a talker of great skill , and with those he does not take a liking to , I have often seen him overwhelmthem with his words . But with you he displayed anotherside . " " A becoming reserve , " I suggested . " Exactly . And now , Father , what of the news of Old Saint Paul 's ? I trust your additional labors are not proving too burdensomefor you ? " My additional labors were not proving too burdensome for me , but with Father Danowski missing and no one to take his place , there was no doubt that they existed . Which is why  --  as I 've said earlier  --  I had less spare time than usual for thinking about the Carmodys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , it was always with the feeling that one day , any day now , I would be hearing from them . In this I was right  --  although not quite in the way I had expected . For when I did hear , it was in the form of a visit rather than a telephone call ,  |p182and  my visitor was not Helen or John or even old Charlie : it was Dan . He came to the rectory early one evening , a few days before Father Danowski was to be released from the hospital . I went to the door and there he was , alone , looking sharply pressed and vaguely sporty , something about him suggesting , as always , that he had just left the barber 's chair five minutes before . He said , " Hello , Hugh . Surprise surprise . " It was indeed ; he was a puzzling guest . Still , he was also a welcome enough one ; he came in and after the first words of greeting I said , " I had no idea you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after your father 's party you were moving on to other fields . " " Other and greener fields , " he said , correcting me . " Quite a bit greener , actually . Of course they 'd have to be . There 's not much for me in this city . There never was , come to think of it . I suppose it was a question of temperament and ambition as much as anything else . But I do n't have to tell you that , do I ? You spotted it years ago . I ca n't tell you , Hugh , how often I 've looked back on what you said to me then and wished I 'd had the plain common sense to follow it up . But you know how it is : a crazy kid wo n't listen . Ile knows all the answers ; you ca n't tell him anything . It 's a funny thing , Hugh , but I was talking about it to Flo only the other night . I do n't have many regrets , Flo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing well , and with a good wife . And yet I do n't mind telling you that every now and then I think about what Father Hugh Kennedy said to me when we were still really only boys , and I wish I 'd followed his advice . It would have saved me plenty of grief in the past ! ' " And what was all this in aid of ? What advice ? Had I ever said anything significant to Dan about his life ? No . Had I ever said anything at all to Dan about his life ? No . I said carefully , " You remember my own words better than I do , I think .... " He laughed and shook his head ruefully . " I have more reason to , " he said . " With everything that happened . No , Hugh ,  |p183I  remember it as if it were yesterday morning . I met you one day outside Casey 's candy store ; I think you 'd just come back from your first year in the seminary . We talked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  and then all of a sudden , I remember , you put your hand on my shoulder and said , Dan , take my advice . Get out . Get out while the getting 's good . Get out before we break your heart . This city 's not for you , Dan . We 're a city with a past , but we have no future . ' Whatever you try , we 'll beat you down . We 'll never give you the scope someone like you needs . We 'll never even understand you : " The blue eyes of his father now gazed at me  --  but in the son , they wavered just slightly . " How right you were , Hugh ! " he said feelingly . " Oh , how right you were . If I live to be a thousand I 'll never forget what you said to me that day . Do n't tell me you do n't remember ! " It was incredible ; the conversation before Casey 's candy store was as rooted in fact as those nonexistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not quite in those words . . . . " " The land where time stands still , Hugh , " he said . " That 's what this town is . Conservative , old-fashioned , suspicious . You bring new business methods , new investment possibilities here , and they 're on you like hawks . They hate new ideas , Hugh . They want that good old five per cent . At least a dozen times I tried to show them how they could double , even triple their original investments . I tried to put them on to a few good things I had . And what happened , Hugh ? They misunderstood . They got the whole thing wrong . Once or twice they even got a little nasty about it . You may have heard something about that at the time . " At the time  --  or rather , at the times  --  it seemed to me that I had heard very little else ; old Charlie was among those who had " got nasty . " But this was hardly the moment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind . " There was never anything to it , of course . But it did something to me , Hugh . I ca n't deny that . I got angry . I swore I'dp184leave this town . And I did , right then and there . Ten years after you advised me to , but I finally left . It was the best move of my life . Ever since then I 've been all over the world , I 've met interesting people , I married Flo . I 've been successful , Hugh . Highly successful . Successful in a way I could n't have dreamed of being if I 'd stayed here . And do you know what the key to that success has been , Hugh ? " I had no idea . From the general tenor of his approach to me , it would n't have surprised me greatly if he 'd said , " Prayer . " But when I shook my head , he said , " I 've kept flexible . Flexibility 's the answer , Hugh . Do n't tie yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open ; move around . That 's what I 've done . The result is that when I see a good thing I can jump aboard , right from the beginning . That 's how I happened to get in with this new mutual fund group . " A faint memory of our last conversation rose to the surface ; I said , " I thought you were in wool ? " " That too , " he said instantly . " That too , Hugh . I usually manage to keep two or three balls in the air at the same time . Although to tell you the truth  --  and this is confidential : I would n't want it to get around  --  I 'm thinking seriously about dropping the wool end of it . It 's not what it used to be , Hugh . The new synthetics have hit it hard . No , " he said , " I give most of my time these days to our mutual fund company . It 's a fascinating business , Hugh . Highly competitive at the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit different from the others . Quite a bit different , as a matter of fact . " And although we were alone in the rectory , his voice now dropped into a tone of confidence so low that it was barely audible . " I do n't mind telling you who 's in this with me , Hugh . Although I would n't want it to go any further . " Dramatically he paused , then said , " Will Altgeld " " Will Altgeld ? " " You do n't know Will Altgeld ? " Astonishment . Incredulity . I said , " No . Should I ? "  | " Well , no , " he said , somewhat disconcertingly . " Not really . Because you 're not primarily interested in the Who 's Who of high finance , are you , Hugh ? No . I did n't think so . You never were . I can remember back when we were kids together you were never much for thinking about money ; you used to say , Oh , I 'll leave that to Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for figures ! ' But anyway , " he said , " even if you were interested , you would n't necessarily know much about Will . He 's one of the magic names , but he prefers to remain pretty much of a mystery . He 's an enigma , Hugh . One of the most successfulfinanciers of our time , but an enigma . There are sides to Will that nobody knows . He has a private chapel in his home , Hugh . " An enigma , but a pious enigma ; I said , " Ah .... " " As well as I know him , " Dan said , " he never ceases to amaze me , Hugh ! Here 's the man who in two months , singlehanded , brought off the Farley-Poore collapse . Here 's the man who really engineered the Otis Incorporated  --  Keisler Grain merger , no matter what you may have heard to the contrary . And at the very moment that merger was going through , at the very moment when some of the biggest men in the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , where do you think he was , Hugh ? " " In the chapel ? " " Right ! " he said . " That 's a good guess , Hugh . That 's just where he was . He was in the chapel . I do n't know about you , Hugh , but a thing like that makes me stop and think . About myself . About other people I 've been associated with , socially and professionally . Top men in their fields , Hugh . And what it all comes down to is this : I 've never met a finer man than Will Altgeld ! Or one that I was prouder to know ! " I decided it was time to pull the conversation back into some touch with reality ; I said , " And so now you 're with him in this mutual fund arrangement ? " He nodded enthusiastically . " We 've really got something ,  |p186Hugh  . Something entirely new . As Will said to me about a month ago , Dan , we do n't promise our investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can only promise them two things . One : bigger returns . Two : quicker returns . And do you know , Dan , somehow I have the feeling they wo n't object too strenuously to that ? ' " He laughed and made a motion with his arm ; for a moment I thought he was going to nudge me in the ribs . But then he grew suddenly sober , and said gravely , " Actually , Iiugh , that 's why I 'm still in town . I would n't be too eager to have this get around , but I 've persuadedWill to let me tell a few old friends about our program . So that they can get in on it right from the beginning . " And it may have been that age had slowed me , or it may have been merely that what was happening was so ludicrous , so impossible , that I could n't have anticipated it , but in any case it was not until Dan had spoken these last words , so earnestly , with such an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had really conic to see me for . I said , " Dan  --  " But he had started now ; he was not to be stopped . " NaturallyI thought of you , Iiugh , " he said hurriedly . " I do n't know , I think it 's probably always bothered me that I 've never been able to do anything to repay you for the advice you gave me so many years ago . Oh , I know it did n't mean anything to you , but it meant all the world to me . I do n't forget things like that , Hugh . I mentioned it to Flo only the other night , and what she said nearly knocked me over . She said , If you feel that way , Dan , do n't you think it would be nice if you did something for him now ? ' And as I say , Hugh , it nearly knocked me over . Because it 's so simple : the first thing I should have thought of the moment I saw you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no use ; nothing short of a cannon shot could have stopped him now . The salesman 's pitch had begun . It was something I was fairly familiar with ; any priest who lives in a rectory for any length of time acquires great experience withp187salesmen . They come constantly and in great numbers : the wifeless cleric is a juicy target , an easy mark . They come selling shoe polish , life insurance , Cadillacs  --  anything . Depending pretty much on the apparent prosperity of the parish . Old Saint Paul 's is largely ignored ; the expert knows poor grazing grounds on sight . But in earlier years I must have met hundreds of them , and I suppose I even became a kind of connoisseurof their various approaches ; now , as I sat looking at Dan , hunched forward in his chair , talking too eagerly and too quickly , smiling too confidentially , a natty but vastly imperfect mirror of his father in action , I suddenly found myself wondering if he had ever been able to sell anything to anyone . And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purchasers were evidence of that . But it seemed to me now as step by step the " program " unfolded , and a sunlit pyramid of facts , figures , and tax-free benefits piled up before my eyes , that everything about him must have been a signal to the buyer to beware : the urgent glowing words , the laugh , the manner , each gesture , all suggested the carnival performer in his checked suit , manipulating the walnut shells over the concealedpea . And I wondered , as I listened , uncomprehending , to what he was saying , if there was any truth in it at all ? For instance , was there really a program ? Was there even really a Will Altgeld . . . ? He continued to talk , growing more animated and euphoric by the minute , until finally  --  and loudly  --  I said , " Dan ! " It must have been a shout , for now he did stop , abruptly , a look of bewilderment on his face . " What ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " I want you to do something , Dan , before you say anything more . I want you to look around . Around this room , that is . Take a good look . " Obviously still puzzled , but willing to go along with a customer'swhims , he turned obediently , taking in the small drab office , so poorly furnished , so completely without a hint ofp188prosperity . In short , a promoter 's nightmare . But he turned back to me , smiling doubtfully , and said , " I do n't get it , Hugh . " " You did n't look hard enough , then . I should have thought it was crystal-clear . Dan , we 're a poor parish . I 'm sure your investment scheme is all you say it is , but it could n't matter less . We have n't any money to invest . The plain fact is that we have n't any money at all . " His face cleared instantly . " Oh , " he said . " I see what you mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest parish funds ? " Had I wronged him , then ? I said , " I 'm afraid that 's what I did think . . . . " He laughed . " Come on , Hugh , " he said . " Everybody knows that Old Saint Paul 's has n't had a quarter in twenty years . Why would I be doing that ? No , " he said , settling back into earnestness , " no , what I 'm here for is to give you the chance , Hugh . Not the parish ; you . What I 'm talking about is a surefireinvestment for you personally ! " For me . Personally . Poor Dan . I said , " Look , Dan . First of all , thanks a lot . Its good of you to think of me . But you could n't be barking up a worse tree . I have n't any more money than the parish . I 'm just not an investment possibility at all . " This time the laugh was not free of anxiety . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , of course I know you 're not a rich man and that this is n't what you might call a boom period for you , but still , over all the years .... " " The nest egg ? It does n't exist , Dan . At one time I did have a little money that my father left to me . Not much ; a small insurance policy . But it went . Quite quickly and foolishly . " I added drily , " You may have heard . " " I know , I know , " he muttered hurriedly . " We 're all proud of you , Hugh . Enormously proud . A great comeback . A fine example . But . . . look , " he said desperately , " I may have misledyou . As a matter of fact , I 'm sure I did . You see , what'sp189needed is n't a lot of money . You do n't have to be a millionaire . In fact you do n't even have to have much at all ; I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're letting a few of our friends in for practically nothing ; just enough to get them started .... " His voice trailed away as he saw that I still shook my head , and then , for no special reason other than that he looked so suddenly defeated , I went on to assure him that if I 'd had any money , his proposition would have been close to irresistible . He did not seem cheered . Still , it was impossible for him to stay downcast for long ; a long line of similar disappointments in the past must have fortified a natural resilience . After a moment he said , " Well , that 's that . Although it 's a shame , Hugh . It really is . I could have put you in the way of a firstclassthing . A once-in-a-lifetime proposition . But that 's the way it goes . " He said suddenly , " I do n't suppose , by the way , you know of any other priests around who might be interested ? " Had this become his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I said , " No , I do n't think so . .. . " He continued as if I had n't said a word . " They 'd have to be close friends of yours , of course . I could only take them in on that basis . As a personal favor to you . " " I ca n't think of a single soul , Dan . " As a precaution against any further relaxation of standards , I added , " Close or other-wise . " " I see . " There was silence . " Well , " he said , " that 's the way it goes . " And I remembered that on at least two occasions I had heard old Charlie breathe approximately this phrase : was it a family formula of resignation ? Except that Charlie remarkablycombined it with his victories ; Dan , more traditional , used it in defeat . There was a difference . But now he got to his feet ; his mission , while unsuccessful , was over . " Well , Hugh , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It would have been a great thing . But it 's grand to have seen you again , anyway . And your place . " Once more he glancedp190hastily around the room in which we sat . " And your place , " he repeated . " Very nice . Very nice indeed . Fine . I have to go along now and tidy up a few odds and ends before I leave town . I expect to be pulling out early tomorrow morning . I 'd like to stay around a bit longer , but business before pleasure . Will seems to need me out there ; apparently everything 's movingalong in a hurry . Bigger and better than we had anticipated , in fact . " Presumably " out there " was headquarters : the lair of Will Altgeld ; I did not ask . I walked with him to the door , and then , just before he left , I could n't resist asking , " You have n't suggested to your father that he come in on this with you ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't done that , Hugh . Dad 's a fine businessman , of course , and he 'd see the potential in a minute , but he 's a little too conservative , a little too inflexible , if you know what I mean , for this type of operation . I think he might very well get the wrong idea . So I do n't plan to mention it to him . As a matter of fact , Hugh , I 'd just as soon you did n't say anything when you see him . " " I wo n't . Not a word . " Then , half facetiously , I said , " Your program is safe with mc . " " Yes , well , I was n't thinking about the program . Exclusively , that is . What I really meant was that I 'd appreciate it if you would n't mention my being here at all . You see , Hugh , I do n't believe he knows I 'm in town at the moment . We had a little talk the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was going off to the West Coast . Immediately . So that if he found out that I was still here he might be a little surprised , do n't you sec ? Not that it matters of course , but he might misunderstand . " I had a sudden hunch : old Charlie had very probably suppliedfunds for the California trip . In the past he had often  --  if reluctantly  --  come through with what could be described only as get-away money for his son  --  had Dan now pretended the need for this once more ? But it was hardly my business . Ip191promised I would say nothing , and he left with a jaunty enough wave and a cheery farewell ; he had quick powers of recovery . He drove off to his greener fields in a new , limecoloredconvertible , and just as he was pulling around the cornerI noted a final and rather characteristic touch : the car had dealer 's plates . ' Was this another instance of Dan 's boasted flexibility ? Or was there merely somewhere in the city an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was highly probable ... . Two days later Father Danowski returned from the hospital : paler , thinner , but otherwise unchanged . And on this day , in the early afternoon , I had another surprise visitor : old Charlie . He had forsaken the telephone to appear in person ; like his son Dan forty-eight hours before , he stood waiting for me on my doorstep . And when I saw him standing there , memory worked one of its queer tricks , and all I could think of was something my father had said many years before . " There are two men in this city that come to your house and they 're always smiling , " he had said . " One is Father Phil Riley from the missions , and the other is Charlie Carmody . I like Phil Riley the best . The smile means nothing at all , but at least a man knows what 's behind it . He 's come to tap you for a dollarand ten cents to help put up a clay statue of some little Italian that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers on the black lads and stole bananas from the baboonsand now they 've decided he 's a saint . But with Charlie it 's not so easy . The smile is on his face , all right , but the minuteyou open the door he 's into his dance , do n't you see , runningup and down the piazza , saying ai n't it a lovely day today , and do you think the tomatoes will get ripe early this year , and do the little children still play hopscotch down by the barn ? I swear there 's times God Almighty Himself could hardly tell what he has up his sleeve ! " But this afternoon the smiling Charlie was a miracle of forthrightness . After the briefest of greetings he said briskly ,  | " Well , Father , they tell me you had a caller the other day ! " So the circumspect Dan had not been successful ; however he knew , old Charlie undoubtedly did know . Still , I had made a promise ; I could at least go through the useless motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " My boy Dan . That 's the caller I mean , Father . Oh , I tell you , Father , you 're a lucky man ! Havin ' Dan come to see you is like havin ' old King Rothschild himself drop in for a cup of tea ! You 'll be a rich man in no time now , Father ! Is it a new way to make gasoline out of pump water he 's got these days ? Or I wonder is it a jelly bean mine ? Whateverit is , put your money in Dan 's hands , Father , and your fortune 's made ! " IIc said sharply , " You gave him nothin ' , I hope ? " But this was an old war , and none of my affair ; besides , I suspected Dan might be having trouble enough without any help from me . I said , " Actually , he just came by to say hello . " " Hello , " Charlie repeated grimly . " Oh , I know these hellos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " More moderately , he said , " But so long as you gave him nothin ' I s'pose no harm is done . Where is he off to now , did he say ? " Solicitude ? Parental concern for a fifty-year-old fledgling ? I thought not ; it was just Charlie , checking up thoroughly . I said carefully , " I think he mentioned something about the West Coast . " " The West Coast , " he said . " Or China . Or the South Pole . It do n't matter much . They all got telegraph offices . I 'll be hearin ' soon enough . Oh , I tell you , Father , there 's a cross for a man to bear ! Along with everything else . I do n't wonder peoplewalk around the city today and say , There goes poor Charlie Carmody . It 's a miracle he ai n't all bent over with all he has to put up with , what with Roosevelt and the big taxes and Dan ! " In all this we had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested to old Charlie that we go inside to the smallp193office  --  where , presumably , we would continue to discuss Dan . But he shook his head and said , " No no , I did n't come to stay , Father . I was just over this way lookin ' at a buildin ' or two I still got in spite of everythin ' and I stopped by here on my way to the hospital . Would you go over there with me , I wonder , Father ? Just for a bit ? To say a few words to Bucky ? " This was a surprise : both the invitation and the news . I said , " Is Mr. Heffernan in the hospital ? I 'm sorry ; I had n't heard . What happened : anything serious ? " " No no no , " said Charlie , almost contemptuously . " Nothin ' like that , Father , nothin ' like that at all . Bucky 's a great man for hospitals . There 's some of us goes through aches and pains every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got to do and say not a word about it . Not a single word , Father : that 's the way some of us do . But if Bucky wakes up with so much as a sneeze in the mornin ' he 's halfway to the private room and the nurse and the thermometer in the mouth like a cigar . And the wife lets him go ; I think she 's tickled pink . She leads a hell of a dull life , Father , sittin ' there every night , hookin ' rugs and lookin ' at Bucky . Well well , " he said expansively , " that 's the way life goes . We must n't complain . " Once again the old refrain . But he had provided an out for me , for while I was used to hospitals , and went to them often as a priest , I was n't especially eager to make a trip to one just to see a malingering Bucky . And so I said , " I 'm relieved to hear that nothing 's really wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case I wo n't go along ; it might be more of an intrusionthan anything else .... " But Charlie was having none of this . " Not so fast , Father ! " he said instantly . " Not so fast , there . We got to be fair . We got to be fair to Bucky ! " Had I been unfair , then ? But Charlie continued , swiftly back-pedaling . " I do n't say for sure he 's got nothin ' wrong with him . I could n't say that at all . I do n't know what he 's got . Oh , he 's always been a great one for goin ' to the hospital for what you might say was the fun of it , butp194that do n't mean he ai n't got somethin ' now . By God , Father , a man could die of a hangnail when he 's as old as Bucky . If someone came up to me on the street and said , Excuse me , Mr. Carmody , I know what a busy man you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heffernan is like these days ? ' , d'ye know what I 'd have to say to them , Father ? I 'd have to say that Bucky was like an old wool sweater that looks fine and that you think could last forever , and then all of a sudden one day one little thread comes loose and before you can say Jack Robinson ' the whole damn thing is nothin ' but a puddle of yarn on the livin ' room floor ! And nobody knows that any better than Bucky himself , Father . I tell you , I would n't be s'prised if that ai n't what he 's thinkin ' about right now , lyin ' there on his back in his little room . A man at his time of life , Father , if he ai n't really dyin ' , is ( loin ' the next thing to it : he 's thinkin ' about it . That 's why it 'd he a lovely thing to go over there todayand say a few nice words to him . Just to cheer the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of Charlie in the sickroom : would he hearten the moribund Bucky by telling him about the puddle of yarn ? The extraordinary thing was that as he talked his voice was hearty and detached , as if , in discussing the thoughts of the old and the possibly dying , he was able to exempt himself completely from any connection with such a fraternity . Ile kept on talking , and in the end  --  which means , I suppose , in a very few minutes  --  I agreed to go with him , although I was by no means convinced that the trip was necessary or even desirable ; invitations from old Charlie had a way of inspiring uneasy reservations ... . I went upstairs to change , and before I came down again I looked into Father Danowski 's room to tell him I was leaving . He was not there ; I had not heard him walking about , but obviously the convalescent was stirring . At the head of the stairs I looked down and saw that he was in the front halland that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ! " Charlie cried , sighting me . " Oh , Ip195tell you , Father , ai n't this one for the books ! Would ye believe this one ? I knew this lad when he was a little feller no higher than a hydrant ! And now look at him : a giant of a man and a priest to boot ! Ai n't that grand ? Oh , do n't that make me feel good ! The very same lad you got for a curate today once upon a time lived in one of my nice houses over in the East End ! There 's a coincidence for you , Father ! What d'ye think of that one ? " " I had begun to walk around slowly upstairs , " Father Danowskisaid sedately to me , " for the purpose of exercising my legs , Father . The physicians impressed upon me the importance of doing this . Suddenly I looked down the stairwell and whom should I see before my eyes but Mr. Carmody ! I recognized him instantly , of course , from former times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just a small boy in those days , little did I dream that he would remember me ! " " Not remember you ! " cried Charlie . " Oh , that 's a good one , Father . Old Charlie not remember little Kazmeer ! " " No no , " Father Danowski said gravely . " Casimir is the name of my father , Mr. Carmody . My name is Stanley . " " Right you are ! " said Charlie exuberantly . " Little Stanley ! Oh my ! Those were the great days . I can remember it all like it was yesterday . In I 'd walk to the East End tenements to collectthe rents , and there 'd be little Stanley and his little Polish pals lookin ' at me with big eyes and sayin ' to themselves , Here comes Mr. Carmody with the penny candy and the gumdrops ! ' " This last had the savor of the myth , but Father Danowski did not comment upon it . Instead he said , " My father is the one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmody . How often , through the years , he has spoken of your visits ! " " Kazmeer , " said Charlie . " There was a fine man for you : always on time with the rent . God never made a finer man . I tell you , the world 'd be a better place today if we only hadp196more Kazmeers . And how long ago was it he died , Father ? " " No no no , Mr. Carmody . You have been misinformed , I see . My father did not die at all . On the contrary , I assure you , he is quite alive . Alive and in the very best of health . " " Ai n't that grand ! " Charlie said . " Alive ! Oh , that 's the way to be , all right . And now you 're over here with the son of my best old pal . Over here with Father Hugh ! Oh , ai n't life funny ? We never know ! I tell you , Father , you 're a lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole diocese than Father Hugh , here . Or a holier one ! " Father Danowski inclined his large head in solemn politeness ; I said quickly , " Will you be the boss yourself here for an hour or so , Father ? I 'm off to the hospital with Mr. Carmody to see a friend . " " To see Bucky on the bcd of pain , " Charlie said . " Yes , we got to be goin ' . " Addressing himself once more to Father Danowski , he said , " Well , Father , you 're in a grand old place here . It might not look like much now , but once upon a time it was the best there was . They came no finer than Saint Paul 's . The showplace of the diocese , you might say . The pride and joy . " And then , with that special gift which must have been literally invaluable to him in his business affairs , that gift of somehow darting instantly at the vulnerable spot , he said musingly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was irresistible bait ; Father Danowski leaped . " Do you feel that , Mr. Carmody ? " he said eagerly . " How happy I am to hear you say so ! If Father will permit me , it is what I myself have strongly felt  --  " " Oh , yes , yes , " Charlie said , and now a soft and decidedly dreamlike expression settled on the old face , " I got a great feelin ' for Old Saint Paul 's . When I look at it today , all run downhill the way it is , I tell you there 's times I feel like cryin ' . I du n no , maybe I 'm too soft-hearted for my own good . I s'pose I am . But nothin ' in the whole wide world would make mep197feel better , Father , than to see the old place neat as a pin , bright and shinin ' once more like it used to , the whole shebang all done over in great style , with the organ boomin ' away , and the crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get inside of a Sunday ! Oh my , would n't that be a grand sight ! Would n't that make me feel good ! " Father Danowski said fervently , " It is truly extraordinary , Mr. Carmody , how close your feelings in this matter are to my  --  " And what would it take ? " asked Charlie rhetorically . " What would it take to make this a grand old place again ? Would it take a miracle ? It would not ! A few buckets of paint , a scrubbin ' brush , a little cement , and a couple of carpenters and there 'd be your miracle for you ! Oh yes , all it would take , " he said softly , " is just a little bit of money ! " There was a hush ; the old , bright blue eyes were fixed upon their object in the gaze which was open , innocent , inviting , kind ; Father Danowski stood there , open-mouthed , hypnotized . All unsuspecting , he had started out to exercise his legs ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was becoming a cruel performance ; I said , " Cash is n't necessary , Mr. Carmody ; we 'll take your check . " The blue eyes shifted quickly to me , and I saw that the guilelessness had been replaced by a look of quite another kind  --  one of shrewd , hard amusement . And was it my imaginationagain , or did one old eyelid drop in a tiny , flashing wink ? In any case he said , " Oh my my . You 're your pa 's son , Father , and no mistake about it . A chip off the old block . I tell you , just hearin ' your voice speakin ' up like that so clear and saucy does me good . " And while he was saying this he had turned to Father Danowski ; before he had finished he was already shaking his hand and beginning his retreat . " Well , goodbye , Father , " he said crisply . " Maybe we 'll meet again some day . " Opportunity was fading , fast ; Father Danowski leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared entirely . He said hurriedly , " Perhaps we could continue to discussthis matter at some other  --  " But Charlie was already at the door . " Goodbye ! " he cried . " It was grand to see you . And give my regards to your dear pa Kazmeer . Tell him I remember him and I 'm tickled to death he 's still alive ! It 's great to be alive ! Come along now , Father . Poor Bucky 's waitin ' for us , and you ca n't say Hold on there ! ' to a dyin ' man . Come along or we 'll miss the visitin ' hours ! " So , with a nod to Father Danowski , I left the rectory with Charlie . And on our way out to his waiting car , it seemed to me that on every step of this short march down the steps and across the sidewalk we were accompanied by my curate 's eyes , following along behind us : large , round , baffled , disappointed , but somehow still lit with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie did not employ a chauffeur ; he drove himself . His car was large , old , and unfashionable ; he drove it slowly and with excessive care . As we rode along , traffic piled up behind us on the narrow streets ; horns blew impatiently ; on those few occasionswhen a car behind did succeed in pulling out and passing us , I saw angry faces and furious eyes ; sometimes there were shouts . To all this Charlie paid no attention at all ; I doubt if he was even aware of it . He seemed in an especially benign mood , perhaps placed there by his fortunate encounter with Father Danowski ; he drove along serenely and talked of the blessings of the automotive age . " You can get from here to there in a minute and a half now , " he said . " If I could of done that when I was a lad just startin ' out , Father , I 'd be a rich man today . But I did n't learn to drive a car until I was near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I did . I took trolley cars and walked . All over the city . I did n't mind . I 'm a great walker , Father . I always was . I walked every inch of the city in my time , keepin ' my eyes open , collectin ' the rents . I bet I got more miles onp199me now than any man alive . Your pa was a great walker , too . D'ye remember that , I wonder ? " I nodded . As a young boy I had often gone on long walks  --  very long walks  --  with my father . They were never walks with any particular destination  --  or at least I never took them to be so . We just walked and walked , anywhere , and then at some point my father would decide we had walked far enough , and we would turn around and come home . But as I remember it , unlike Charlie we did not walk all over the city ; in that day , the city , although large enough , was of course considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of  --  a mile or so from our house , and we were in the country . Not wild country , certainly , but pleasant rural country , with hayfields and farms and barns and cattle and small , unforbidding woods  --  it was here that I remember walking with my father . Charlie must have been reflecting along almost exactly the same line , for he said now , " Your pa was a queer man when it came to the walks . Many 's the time I 'd see him startin ' off by himself , and I 'd say to him , For the love of God , Dave , if it 's a walk you want , why do n't you stop all this foolishness and come along with me and I 'll show you what a real walk is . A sensiblewalk . We 'll go down the Boulevard to Sheridan Avenue to have a look in the stores and see who 's buyin ' what , then over to Division Street down past the depot and see is the rubber company layin ' anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a few little calls , and back up through Little Italy to watch the Eyetalians havin ' one of their nut parades and maybe see if a place or two is up for sale , and then home by way of the car barn . That 's the kind of a walk that makes sense ! ' But he would n't come along , " Charlie said , " not ever . Instead he 'd start off on the railroad ties out to Limpy Coyle 's meadow , and from there he 'd go miles and miles to who knows where . I swear to God where he went there was no place to go . And nothin ' to see . I remember one night I was just gettin ' home to my supper about dark , and I looked downP200the street and who did I see walkin ' along , slow and easy , like they 'd just gave him the Bank of England for his birthday , but your pa . And I ran down from the house to him and I said , I s'pose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , I am . ' And I said , All right . Now tell me this : you been gone the whole of the afternoon . ' No , Charlie , ' he said , I been gone the whole of the day . ' All right then , ' I said , so much the worse : you been gone the whole of the day . And what I want to know is this : in all the whole day , what did you see ? Did you see anythin ' at all ? Anythin ' worth seein ' , I mean ? ' And what d'ye think he said ? He said , I 'll tell you what I saw , Charlie . I saw a couple of cows , a brook , a hawk , a haystack , and a sunset . That 's what I saw , Charlie ! ' And by God , Father , " Charlie said , " I give you my word he meant it ! The whole day , and that 's what he saw ! Oh , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times that Charlie had mentioned my father to me , it was only now that what he said moved me at all , or indeed even made sense to me  --  I suppose because it was only now that what he said rang true . For once Charlie had neglected to supply my father with that absurd dialogue meant to suggest infrangible old palship ; instead , he had dredged up a recollection so genuine that I could hear my father 's voice . Moreover , in the telling of this story Charlie 's own voice and manner seemed to have changed ; it was as if , quite without realizing it , he had succumbed to his own memories . That is , as if he had been so caught up in his reflections that he had temporarily forgotten whatever role it was that he was playing for my benefit and had been , quite simply , himself . For the first time I had the impression that he had said what he would have said whether anyone had been with him or not , and it occurred to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : old Charlie saying exactly what he thought ... . But it did not last ; he said suddenly , " Old Saint Paul 's : it 's a ramshackle old place you got there today , Father . I hear there'sp201those that think the Bishop will tear it down and sell it for scrap . " It was clearly a question ; Charlie waited for an answer . Had we come to the point at last ? Had John been right ? Was his father now about to present himself as the logical receiver of dismantled churches and  --  of course  --  their attendant properties ? Was this really why I had been so suddenly cultivated as a chum ? It seemed so , certainly , and  --  pompously enough , I 'm afraid  --  I said , " I keep hearing that , but I do n't know anything about it . It 's my own guess that the Bishop has no intention of tearing down or selling . " But he surprised me by quickly agreeing with me . " I hope not , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no place in the diocese means more to us all than Old Saint Paul 's . Tearin ' it down would be like tearin ' down half the city . No no , I hope he do n't do anythin ' crazy like that ! " And strangely enough , I believed him . I think Charlie was not often ruled by the softer sentiments , but he had spoken these words with something very close to fervor , and I could only conclude that although the razing of Saint Paul 's might ultimately put money in his pocket , he preferred  --  for whateverprivate and mysterious reasons  --  to see it upright and intact . A small inconsistency  --  as my father used to say , " Like the time Queen Victoria gave five pounds to the Famine Fund "  --  but there it was , and since it was , I was as far away as ever from the secret of what he was really up to with me . I decided now to pursue the theme of Saint Paul 's a bit ; I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent . I think that Father Danowski even had the feeling that you were about to take on the project yourself . " " Little Kazmeer ! " he said enthusiastically . " Oh my , they come no better than Kazmeer . A grand lad . " He added thoughtfully , " But he 's like all the Poles , Father : they got no sense of humor . No no , they ca n't tell when you 're havin ' a little joke with them ! "  |p202Sentiment  stopped , apparently , this side of madness ; Charlie had been saved by his sense of humor . Poor Father Danowski . We reached the hospital . As we rode up in the elevator Charlie said , " I s'pose P. J. will be here . He do n't do much these days , so he comes in and spends his time with Bucky . Mostly he goes to sleep . And then there 's the other feller . Bucky could n't get a private room this time ; they were all full up . So he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I du n no is he a dummy or not . By God , if he ai n't Bucky 'll drive him dumb with his line of gab ! " He chuckled happily at the thought ; we got out of the elevator and walked down the corridor to the room of the ailing Bucky . When we entered he was sitting up in bed , his chin in his hands , his elbows supported by his knees , his attention fixed on a television set located some ten feet away . My immediatethought was that the sick man looked remarkably well . As predicted , P. J. was in the room ; as also predicted , his eyes were closed . The silent roommate I could not see , yet I knew he was there , for in the second bed was a curled and invisible figure , sheet and blankets pulled up tightly over his head . Was he so ill as to want only this dark , small isolation ? Or was this rather a protest against the television set , which seemed to be turned up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to shout to make himself heard . " Here we are , Bucky ! " he cried . " Here we are ! Myself and somebody else you did n't expect to see in a month of Sundays ! Hello , P. J. Look who I brought along with me today , Bucky ! Look who I brought all the way over here to have a word with you ! Here 's Father Hugh Kennedy himself ! Ai n't that grand ? Speak up , Bucky ! Say hello to Father , here ! " It was a boisterous entrance to a sickroom . P. J. opened his eyes , murmured quietly , and smiled slightly . Bucky , however , looked up , frowning , and said shortly , " Hello , Father . For the love of God , Charlie , quiet down ! Be fair ! Be considerate to all ! " Was he concerned about his roommate ? His fellow pa/tients ? Apparently not ; he said , " I 'm watching my program . " Charlie said nothing , but raised his eyebrows at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would endure much to humor a sick friend . We sat down and watched the final moments of Bucky 's television program . It was lugubrious entertainment . A stout , plain-faced , middleagedwoman was standing on a stage , a false tiara perched ludicrouslyon her head ; she was weeping . By her side a small man was jumping up and down , winking and laughing ; he was like a demented puppet . From time to time he addressed the weepingwoman facetiously as " Your Majesty . " Suddenly he began to push gifts at her . Piles of gifts : flowers , fruit , furs , candy , articles of clothing , a portable radio , a food freezer . " She 's the winner , " Bucky said superfluously . There were greater rewards which would come when the program was over : a tour of night clubs ; dinner with a film star ; a ride in a helicopter . Each new item of largesse was proclaimedby the small man in an exultant , bullying voice ; he continued to wink , jump , and laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , and I wondered why . Hysteria ? Sheer joy ? Did the puppet and his presents stand for dreams come true ... ? The program ended ; Bucky sighed and said , " That 's a grand program . One of the very best I watch . Turn it off , Charlie . There 's nothing on now but the cowboys . " P. J. opened his eyes again and said unexpectedly , " I like the cowboys . The daughter has a television and I watch the cowboys all the time . It 's very easy to tell the good fellers from the bad . The good fellers wear white hats and eat apples . " Charlie , snapping the set off , said with some irritation , " That 's the damnedest thing I ever saw , that program there . What in the name of God was all that nonsense , Bucky ? " " No nonsense at all ! " Bucky said sharply . " There 's no nonsenseto a program where people do grand things for other people , free and for nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole wide world is against you thel e ! I leave it to Father if that 's not so ! " The arbiter . I said , " I saw so little of the program I do n't think I 'm quite sure what it was all about .... " " Do good to your neighbor ! " he said . " That 's what it 's about , Father . The women come up to the man there with their hard luck stories every day and he helps them out . " " I see by the paper Rose Gormley died the other night , " P. J. said . " There was a woman had hard luck . D'ye remember Rose ? She married Funny Phil Hanrahan that sold the soda ? A very homely man . I do n't s'pose I ever saw a homelier man than Funny Phil . But a beautiful singer . He had a lovely voice . That 's the only reason Rose married him . She was very musical . And then what happened ? She went deaf ! A year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That 's hard luck . " " One moment there , P. J. ! " Bucky said . " Do n't make too much of Rose . She was a hard luck woman , yes . We 're agreed on that . I knew her well . But she was n't in it with these women on the television . These women have all got husbands that left them or they 're sick and they 'll never get better or somebody swindled them out of their last nickel or their house got smashed to bits in a hurricane . And the man on the programhelps them out ! The one that wins he gives grand things to ! " It was the pictorial version of Mrs. Addione 's radio ; I said , " And the winner : how is she chosen ? Is she the one who 's had the hardest luck of all ? " " That 's it ! " he said approvingly . " You 're getting it now , Father ! The hardest luck of all is the thing ! " He went on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very close . Sometimes you ca n't tell at all . Oh , I 'd hate to be the judge on some of them ! But today it was easy . Today you could tell from the start . The woman that won is a widow that 's got bad sugar diabetes and her daughter got hit by a bus . "  |p205Charlie  snorted . " So they give the woman a box of candy and a ride in an airplane . By God , that 'll make everythin ' fine ! Maybe she 'll have more good luck and fall out of the plane . Then she can come back on the program again and win more crazy stuff ! " " That 's it , Charlie ! " Bucky said angrily . " That 's the way ! Be like you always were and always will be ! Laugh at things you do n't understand ! Like giving away things for free ! Be careful , Charlie ! Do n't laugh at charity ! The wisest men we 've got do n't dare to laugh at charity ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own kids dimes to ride downtown with him in his automobile ! " It seemed a time for intervention ; I was about to break in with at least an intended pacifying word when Charlie made another of his sudden switches and said soothingly , " Now now , Buck , do n't get all riled up . I meant no harm . Old Charlie do n't visit his pals in hospital to pick fights with them . ' Watch the television as much as you like . I do n't give a damn if they hand out diamond stickpins to every bum in the park with a bellyache . If it helps an old pal in hospital get well , I say good luck to them , Bucky ! I take my hat off to them ! " Bucky looked at him with some suspicion ; after a moment he said grudgingly , " All right then , Charlie . There 's no offense taken where none was meant . Forgive and forget ! We ca n't do better than that . " Charlie moved to another plane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he inquired solicitously . It was the first time the sick man 's health had been mentioned . Bucky nodded and said , " I am . Dr. Dan Doyle was in the first thing this morning . He said I can go home tomorrow . Or any time I feel like . " " Ai n't that grand ! " Charlie said admiringly . " Well well well . As quick as that ! And at your age , too ! I tell you , Bucky , there 's not many people could do that . You 'll live way past us all ! "  |p206With  no pause , and in the same tone of high compliment , he said , " There 's no trouble , I s'pose , in keepin ' the hands and feet warm ? They do n't take cold at the tips of a sudden ? " " No no . Nothing like that , " Bucky said . He seemed now faintly condescending . " You 're way off on that one , Charlie . What I had was nothing like that . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong , Mr. Heffernan ? " He smiled . " All , " he said . " What was wrong ? That 's the question , Father ! " " I met Johnnie Corrigan yesterday , " P. J. said thoughtfully . " In front of the paper store . He looked very bad . I think he might of had a stroke or somethin ' . When he talks he makes faces . " " He had no stroke ! " Bucky said indignantly . " Talk sense , P. J. ! I keep hearing that Johnnie Corrigan 's had strokes ! He 's had none ! Not a single one ! I know ! I talk to all the doctors ! He makes faces because he always made faces ! Even when he was a little kid ! Did anyone say he was sick then ? No ! But now he makes faces and pretends he 's had strokes ! " " They 're different faces now , " P. J. said . " Oh , very different ! " Bucky was not persuaded . " Everybody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And that 's the same as it 's always been : nothing ! Not a blessed thing , P. J. " He turned to me and said , " But they did n't know what was wrong with me , Father . They did n't know that . They tried to find out but they could n't . I 'm a great puzzle to the doctors , Father . " " But you 're all well now , " said Charlie . During the precedingexchange he had been patiently silent ; now he said , " That 's the thing that counts , 13ucky . That 's the thing I like to hear . All well ! And goin ' home tomorrow ! I tell you , that makes me feel good . Was it just Dan Doyle said you could go , Bucky ? He did n't bring in some big doctor to see was he right ? " " They come no bigger than Dan Doyle , " Bucky said flatly . " A good man , " Charlie agreed . " Old , but good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be all well again . The head is nicep207and comf'table , I hope ? No cracks when you switch it from side to side ? No stabbin ' pains in the back of the neck , there ? Right over the collar button ? " Bucky looked at him ; he said shortly , " Why would there be pains where I never had a pain in my life ? " Charlie 's head bobbed up and down ; the answer seemed to delight him . " Ai n't that grand ! " he said . " And no little sweats ? You do n't feel clammy at all ? " " No ! " Bucky said , his voice suddenly very loud . " No I do n't have little sweats ! No I do n't feel clammy ! No I do n't go blind two hours each day ! No I do n't swell up at night ! I 'm sorry to have to tell you that , Charlie , but I do n't ! Now what else is there ? What else would you like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and that 's A-Number-One ! That 's the way I feel ! " We were nearing another danger point , obviously , and again I went to cut in , but again this was unnecessary , for Charlie abruptly stopped his little game . So abruptly that I somehow had the feeling that his heart had n't really been in it , that the needling of Bucky had been enjoyable but more or less automatic  --  just another of the little bonuses  --  but that his main purpose in coming here today was something quite different . He said now , " Easy , easy , Bucky . Is that a way to act when an old pal asks a few questions to find out are you as good as new ? And when Father here comes all the way across the city just to see are you livin ' or dyin ' ? " From my point of view this was something less than the ideal approach , but it seemed to work . Although not completely : when Bucky replied it was obvious that a few feathers remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight ahead , giving the impression that he was addressing the now inactive television set . " Father knows I thank him , " he said . " He 's not the kind of a man that has to be told every little thing . He knows I feel all the better for his fine visit today . And he knows that , not justp208because he 's a priest , but because he 's a decent sensible man that knows how to behave himself in a hospital ! Not like some people that come in here and run around and yell and treat a man 's sickroom like it was a zoo ! Not like some people that could give a man a bad relapse ! I mention no names , but they better be careful , those people ! The doctors have been told ! The whole hospital knows about them ! They better mind their manners and be more like Father , here ! There 's the kind of a man does you some good when he comes to see you ! " The visitor whose very presence heals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said ten words ? No . Still , I had my uses : the wall off which all shots could ricochet . Charlie gave no sign of having been hit . " Right you are , Bucky ! " he said heartily . " Oh , right you are on that one ! A few minutes with Father Ilugh is like a month in the country ! He 's just like his pa for that . No one knows that better than me . Did n't I realize it today when I went over to Saint Paul 's to pick him up , right when he was havin ' one of the very busiest days of the year ! " This was quite untrue , but it was only the beginning . For now , as Charlie continued to talk , invention took over altogether ; he reached new heights of fantasy . " Oh yes , " he said , " I went over in my car to pick up Father Hugh . I like to give him a little ride , a little fresh air , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parish there , and he do n't like to leave because he 's so busy . But he comes out every now and again for an old pal . I remember when I had the birthday , he said to me , I do n't go many places these days , Mr. Carmody , because I got so much to do , but I 'll come to your party if it 's the last thing I do . I know that 's the place my pa would want me to be on a day like this . Right by the side of his old pal Charlie ! ' I tell you , I damn near cried when he said that to me ! Was n't that a grand thing for a man to hear ? But I hear lots of nice things from Father . Oh yes , I tell you we have the great talks about his dear pa and the good oldp209days . And when I went over there today and said to him , I 'll tell you what 's let 's do , Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to see Bucky instead . What d'ye say to that ? ' , well , I tell you , he had the coat and the collar on before I finishedgettin ' the words out of my mouth . Let 's go , Mr. Carmody ! ' he said . Let 's be on our way ! Anythin ' you say is all right with me , just like it would of been with my pa ! Besides , ' he said , with his grand little smile , I 'd like nothin ' better than to go over there and cheer Bucky Heffernan up ! ' So over we came , Bucky , the two of us . And oh , ai n't we glad we did ! Ai n't we glad to see you up and around and lookin ' so well ! And to hear you 're goin ' home first thing tomorrow ! Oh my , wo n't that tickle your lovely wife ! I 'll have to bring Father over to say hello to her one day soon ! Oh , yes yes ! " Unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they now starred me , as well as my father . A wildly unrecognizable picture was emerging : a picture of me in my shabby rectory , drudging away like a dedicated mole , pausing only to glance anxiously at my watch  --  surely it must be time for my father 's old pal to arrive to take me for my weekly ride ! Charlie talked on ; the picture grew in definition . The pal of the father had become the pal and patron of the son , and although Charlie did not say so explicitly , one somehowhad the feeling that all this was in response to a deathbed request . I was , then , an inherited responsibility . But I was more than that ; Charlie did not sell me short ; our association was no mere one-way street ; I too had something to give . Examining the dialogue assigned to me in this improvised reminiscence , I saw that I was insipid , yes , but I had my qualities : I was obliging , attentive , cheerful , consoling . In my grand little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was maddening . Comic , too , I have no doubt , but at this moment mainly maddening  --  if only because I felt so helpless . Obviously I should do something  --  but what ? Should I protest ? If so , to whom ? Bucky ? P. J. ? The roommate under thep210blankets ? And against what ? Charlie was committing no crime ; at most he was intimating rather strongly that we were far closer friends than actually we were . Which was annoying , but hardly actionable . And against which  --  especially under the circumstances  --  the protest would have the rich ring of the fatuous : " Excuse me , gentlemen , but as a priest I am compelledby duty to inform you that the claims of this eighty-oneyear-oldman to that most highly prized of commodities  --  my friendship  --  are in fact quite without foundation ! " No matter what the words , this was what was bound to come through ; I was sure of it . And so I could do nothing . Nothing but sit and wait for the farce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count upon it ? I was certain that he did . The certainty made me feel no better . And of course  --  once again  --  there was the question of motive . Why on earth was he going through all this ? ' What possible end could tlicse absurd stories serve ? Because the fact that they were n't true was no doubt reprehensible , but it was not , after all , so astonishing . Charlie notoriously rode truth with a relaxed rein , and while fictional autobiography may not have been a family habit , it was a habit shared by at least one other member of the Carmodys : earlier in the week I had been a conspicuous figure in Dan 's faked recollections . But that had been different ; there was no mystery to that . Less gifted than his father , Dan could keep nothing up his sleeve ; his purposes were crystal-clear and always the same : he wanted money . That was simple . But what did old Charlie want ? That was not simpleat all ... . I watched him now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the clear old face shining with enthusiasm , the bright blue eye occasionally turning to meet mine in a candid , fond , paternal gaze , without wavering an inch , without even the faintest touch of shame , I found that in spite of everything my annoyancebegan to disappear , and I began to feel not only a wry and slightly uncomfortable amusement , but also  --  I 'm afraid  --  a kind of awful , guilty admiration for the sheer unblemished gall of this incredible old man and his whole preposterous performance . What P. J. and Bucky felt it was impossible to say . P. J. had closed his eyes again , and Bucky , who at first had been , if not fervently attentive , at least passive , now began to give every sign of a growing impatience . " All right , all right ! " he said at last . " All right , Charlie ! One moment there ! Hold on ! There 's other people besides yourself that knew Dave Kennedy . For the love of God , the man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mountain in Zanzibar ! The man lived here every blessed day of his life ! Right here in the city ! There 's plenty of people that knew him and liked him ! Just as much as you . And there 's plenty of people that know and like the son . Just as much as you ! " Charlie gave him a soft , almost a pitying , smile . " It ai n't the same thing , " he said mistily . " No , it ai n't the same thing at all . I 'd explain that one to you , Bucky , but you would n't understand . No no no . Not in a million years you would n't . But I do n't blame you for that . It do n't matter now anyways . All that matters now , " he said , his voice suddenly springing out of the soft mists and ringing with bounce , " is that you 're all well and goin ' home tomorrow ! That 's what matters . That 's what makes me feel good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal is good as new again ! " And for a moment I thought he was going to circle the sickroom in one of his bounding , enthusiastic dances , but insteadhe remained by the bed and contented himself with pumping Bucky 's hand vigorously . This terminal heartiness , if it did nothing else , at least forestalled further battle ; a moment before Bucky 's face had begun to darken again at the suggestion of mysteries he could not comprehend . Now , however , he seemed mollified , and when , a few seconds later , he thanked Charlie for coming in to see him , he did so in an almost effusive manner.  | " You make a man mad at times , " he said , " but you 've got your good points , Charlie . I 'm one man that says that ! " To me he said , " I thank you for coming here today , Father . I 'll be over to see you one evening at your place as soon as they let me . " He added significantly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter I mentioned to you before . A matter one certain priest in the diocese wo n't be too happy about when he hears what I plan to do . One certain priest we all know well . I mention no names . " John and the grave ; it was a talk to look forward to . I said goodbye to him and went over to say goodbye to P. J. , but the old man rose from his chair and said in a thoughtful voice that since he had been here all afternoon , he now supposed that it was time for him to go home , too . And so the visit ended ; we all said goodbye to Bucky once more , and then we left the room . Or rather P. J. and Charlie left the room ; as I was leaving , something curious and totally unexpected occurred . I was walkingslightly behind the two old men , and as I came to the door , and as they were already in the corridor outside , I heard someone in the room behind me say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Bucky 's . I looked back and saw that the roommate , whom by now I had completely forgotten , had emerged from under his blanket and was sitting up in bed . He was a man in his late fifties , I should guess : thin , mostly bald but with patches of dusty gray hair that had been mussed by the blankets , and with a great pale dome of a forehead that bulbed out prominently over the bony , rather pointed face below it  --  so much so that one 's first impression was apt to be of the skull rather than of the man . Around his neck he wore scapularsand a medal on a silver chain ; on his pajamas was pinned a small badge of the Sacred Heart . The pajamas themselves , I noted , were not hospital issue ; they were blue pajamas on the right breast pocket of which had been stitched , in red thread , the single word George . I could n't remember ever having seenp213him before , but he nodded at me and smiled in an oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beckonedme over to his bed . " Hello , Father , " he said . " How come you 're over here , hey ? " So I was known , at least  --  but who was he ? I said carefully , " Hello . How are you these days ? " But it was not enough . He looked at me anxiously , and said , " You do n't know me ? From the parish ? " So he was from Old Saint Paul 's , which was n't too much of a help : one more among the many , rather than the few , whom I still did not know , not even by sight . And of course the intelligent thing , the only thing , to have done was simply to admit this , but he seemed to want so badly to be known , and there was , after all , that clue on the pajama pocket : the irresistibletemptation to the smooth deduction . I said , " Yes , of course . How are you , George ? " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " George ? " In that case , whose pajamas ? It did n't matter ; he said urgently , " I 'm Albert . You know me , Father . You know me good . Albert Savastano ? The fruit stand ? Up by the swill trucks ? " It was pinpoint identification : up by the swill trucks . Still , it did the trick : I knew who he was now . About a mile from the church , at the northern end of the parish , there was a side street where a row of empty sanitation department trucks usually stood parked ; apparently they were now  --  at least to judge from Albert  --  a neighborhood point of reference , like a monument , or a cathedral . At the corner of that street there was a small fruit stand : a pushcart , really . It was filled with fruit which looked good and was good ; often , in walking by , I had stopped to buy an apple or a pear . I must have passed the time of day fifty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of this cart , yet it never would havep214occurred to me to connect him with the man in bed before me now . True , I had at least some excuse : at his trade he wore , always , a great , broad-brimmed felt hat which concealed his mighty dome ; without it he was to me unrecognizable . And then of course there was the old difficulty of coming upon the familiar object in unexpected surroundings . But excuse or not , the simple truth was I did n't recognize him because I 'd never paid any attention to him ; I 'd never even bothered to find out his name . And so all I could do was to hope to ride over embarrassment , and to say , " I 'm sorry , Albert . I did n't expect to see you here . What have they got you in for ? " " Stones , " he said succinctly . " Look , Father : how you like that for a stone ? " He pointed to the white table at his bedside . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar was a round , grayish , granular object about the size of a golf ball . Someone  --  a nurse ?  --  had fixed a large gummed label to the jar and on it had drawn a crude picture of the stone . In the tradition of perky , postoperativehumor , the stone was smiling ; underneath it had been printed simply : Albert . It was more reliable , at least , than the pajamas ... . There was a pause ; he was waiting . I said  --  warmly , I hoped , " That 's some stone . " " You bet , " he said proudly . " How you like to have a stone like that , Father ? No good , hey ? Like a rock . The biggest stone they had all year . The doe told me . " He reached over and took the glass jar from the table ; he held it up before him , inspectingit fondly . " You know what I do with this stone , Father ? I keep it . The doe , he say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' So I bring it home and put it somewheres . " He laughed and said , a little abashed , " And why ? What do I do with a stone ? " I said without thinking , " You could put your name on it . " And as soon as I said this I was sorry , because I did n't want to make fun of him , or hurt him . But it was all right ; he merely nodded and said seriously , " Or paint it , maybe . Differentp215colors . " He put the jar back and said , still looking at it , " That 's a real big stone , all right . " I said , " But you 're feeling better now , Albert ? " " Oh , sure , sure , " he said . " Real good . In two days , three days , I go home . Hey , Father , you been up by the stand lately ? You 're surprised I ai n't there ? You miss the good pears , hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days before ; I had n't missed the good pears ; I had n't missed Albert . I had n't even noticed they were gone . I said lamely , " You 'd better hurry up and come back . " " Sure , " he said . " You bet . Do n't worry , Father . Real soon . You come up the first day , I give you a pear free ! The kind you like : Cornice . Good , big , juicy ! On the house , Father ! " I thanked him , and promised I 'd be there . I stood there , and there was another of those awkward pauses as we looked at each other in silence : with the fruit stand and the gall stones , we had exhausted our topics of common interest . From the corner of my eye I was suddenly aware of Bucky . He was leaning forward in his bed ; without turning , I could just manage to glimpse the expression on his face . He was attending this scene with an incredulous and rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroachment ! And this made me think in turn of P. J. and Charlie ; I said , " Can I do anything for you here before I leave , Albert ? " " No , " he said . " No thanks , Father . It 's nice here . Real nice . " And then , not that it made any sense , because he was getting out himself in a day or so , but because , I suppose , I still felt a little guilty , I said , " Do you want me to deliver any messages for you ? Tell anyone I 've seen you ? " He shook his head . " No , " he said . " I got nobody . " He said it cheerfully enough , and certainly did n't appear distressed ; all the same , it was a sad and lonely thing to hear . Had I been his only visitor , then ? Even if an unintentional one ? Very probably ; almost certainly . So I had performed a kindness as well as a pastoral duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and as I went out of the room I was careful to say goodbye to Bucky again  --  but in pantomime only this time : a smile and a wave . It seemed the more prudent thing to do . Out in the corridor I saw P. J. and Charlie ; they had apparently been waiting impatiently at the nurses ' desk , down by the elevators . " Here he comes ! " cried Charlie , in his voice not meant for hospitals . " Here he comes , P. J. By God , Father , we were just goin ' to send the police out lookin ' for you . We thought you might of got lost ! Or that Bucky maybe threw a fit in there ! " I explained about the roommate ; Charlie professed to be greatly impressed . " Think of that ! " he said , as we rode down in the elevators . " The first time the man 's said a word since he 's been in there ! Ai n't that wonderful , Father ? Do n't that show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me with an innocent eye ; I said nothing . " From Old Saint Paul 's , " P. J. said musingly . " Savastano , is it ? I s'pose there 's more Eyetalians in the city today than anybody else . " " There was one time , " Charlie said , " I had nothin ' but Eyetalians in my tenements . They 're a bad gang , the Eyetalians . Great big families , singin ' and stampin ' around all day and night , wearin ' the buildin 's out . The kids tear hell out of the plaster with their fingers ! " P. J. nodded . " Eyetalians have very strong fingers , " he said . " That 's why they make such good cobblers . Savastano , " he said again , slowly . " I do n't think I know him . There was a man named Sebastiano once lived over there . He used to play the comet and dance in hotels . He called himself Don Peedro or some such name as that . So they 'd give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charlie shook his head impatiently . " I do n't know the man , " he said , dismissing the subject . " I never heard of him . " " He died , " P. J. said . " Very young . He was dancin ' aroundp217one night in cheap stockin 's and got a blister on his heel . After a while poison got into his blood and he died . The boys and myself buried him . " " It 's a hell of a note , " Charlie said , " when a grown man can make a livin ' runnin ' around the city doin ' crazy dance steps and callin ' himself fake names ! " " Well , " said P. J. , " he 's dead now . " Just deserts ? We had reached the ground floor ; as we walked out of the hospital to the car , Charlie said , " I 'll ride you home , P. J. I 'll drop off Father here on the way . " But I had decided against riding ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rectory , and I felt like walking . I told this to Charlie ; it met with his approval . " Just like his pa ! " he said . " And just like me ! A great walker . Not like the rest of these young bums today . No no ! All right then , Father . Have your walk and I wish I could join you . It was grand to see you anyways , and we 'll be gettin ' togethersoon . " In an even louder voice he added  --  obviously for P. J. 's benefit , " As usual . As usual . Goodbye now , Father . And do n't forget the prayers for Charlie . He needs them all ! " And so we all repeated again the formulas of farewell , and Charlie and P. J. , in the huge old car  --  like themselves , I suppose , the survival of a more spacious age  --  rolled down the drive in slow monopoly , and I began my walk through the late summer afternoon , a walk away from old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictability of home , of Father Danowski and of Old Saint Paul's. . . .  |p218FALL  CAME : always a lovely season in this part of the world . Old Saint Paul 's was hardly the ideal observation post from which to glimpse its glories  --  the first frost brings no riot of color to the neighboring delicatessen  --  but the weather was clear and perfect , the days seemed to ring with the sharp autumn light , and all the smells of the season were in the air . In this section of the city we were virtually treeless , but all the same , every day , towards late afternoon , invisible smoke from burning leaves drifted in from somewhere . It was the time of year I 'd always liked the best , and I suppose I still did , but now my ground had shifted slightly : as the pastor of Old Saint Paul 's , I thought of the fall in terms of the coming winter  --  and I thought of the coming winter in terms of tons of coal . The rectory , with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least relatively so  --  to keep warm ; the church was something else again . It was only during the winter months that I became really aware of the sheer size of the place : the huge , drafty nave would have been a challenge to any heating system and was an outright defeat to ours . The old furnace was enormous , cumbersome , inadequate and voracious ; coal disappeared like snow in May ; fuel costs mounted at a staggering rate and easily became our most considerable parish expense . Despite this the church remained uncomfortable , and from mid-Octo/ber until late in the spring pockets of damp , frigid air , seeminglysucked from the stones and impossible to dissipate , lurked in corners , the slightest opening of a door sending them swirlingaround the interior . Veteran parishioners knew the location of every steampipe ; this did them some good , but not much . And , at the altar , saying Mass , I think I was never quite free of the anticipation that at any moment now the next bone-chilling assault would begin , as the frontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards my ankles , my neck , the small of my back ... . Which is something less than martyrdom , but which makes its impression all the same ; at the beginning of the new winter I find I have no difficulty at all in remembering the old . Yet now it was still early in the fall , the days were pleasant rather than cold , and in those moments when I thought of thermostats and coal trucks and heating bills , I was content to think of them as being still some weeks away . Not everyone was so dilatory . Roy , whose working tempo was ideally suited to the hot and drowsy days of summer , distrustedand feared the sharper months to come ; by the end of September he had begun to plump for the heated church . " Because why ? " he asked rhetorically . " Because the doc said to Roy , he said , Roy , a man like you , he 's a tiger , but his blood do n't run in cold weather . That 's what you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That blood just lays around , froze . You better be careful of that froze blood , Roy . ' That 's why , " he said , " Roy dropped that great big box in church this morning when you was saying Mass . Whang on the floor from his cold hands ! You hear the crash , Father ? " I had heard the crash all right , but when Roy was puttering around the back of the church , crashes were no novelty . I said unfeelingly , " I doubt that it would be the cold this early in the season . It might be some sort of circulatory condition that a minor operation could clear up nicely . I 'll tell you what : why do n't we run you over to Saint Vincent 's Hospital some/time today ? They could probably fix you up in no time at all . " So that stopped all complaints for that morning . But three days later he was back again : same thing , different tack . " You know what Roy saw on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , meeting me in the front hall of the rectory . " On a puddle ? Ice ! " " On the first of October ? " He was prepared for disbelief ; he threw up his hands dramatically . " October one , " he said , in an awed voice , " and ice . Boy ! Do n't that make you flip your lid , Father ? Ice ! Right there on the sidewalk . Roy put his feet down on it and crunched it . " With his heel , on the front hall rug , he demonstratedthe crunching of the ice . " And then , " he said , " Roy said to himself , Roy , you better get on in there as fast as you can and tell Father about that ice . Else he ai n't going to know why it was so cold in church this morning ! ' " " Cold ? " said Father Danowski , coming in , and overhearing this . " Why , Roy , it is sixty-nine degrees on the thermometer just outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Danowski had just finished his breakfast : he looked well fed , contented , warm . Roy scowled fiercely and stared down at the floor . " And yet , " said Father Danowski , " it is curious how little we know about cold . Iiow little we understand of the manner in which it affects different individuals . Some of us feel the cold greatly . Some of us do not . As for myself , ever since those days when I was a small boy I have seldom worn an overcoat . Today I do not even own one . In the depths of winter I will wear a topcoat , yes , but that is all . That is no credit to me ; it is simply that I am not affected by the cold . I was reading a most instructive article on this very topic in the National Geographic magazine only the other evening . Perhaps I have spoken of it to you , Father ? " " No .... "  | " It was absorbing , " he said . " It appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South America who are positivelyimmune to the wintry blasts of that forbidding region . They are clad in savage nothingness , yet on the coldest nights they sleep out of doors and on the bare ground , their bodies exposed to the driving snow and the wildest winds ! How remarkablethat is ! Reflect on that , Roy : how much it teaches us of what the human being is capable ! " " Roy ai n't no Indian , " Roy said sullenly . " There was no implication that you were , Roy , " Father Danowski said , with that dreadful benignity again . " No no , that was not my point at all . We know that you are not an Indian , Roy . We know full well what you are . Here in the parish of Old Saint Paul 's , you are the good right arm of Fatherand myself . That is what you are ! " Roy responded to this tribute by scowling more fiercely than before and rolling his eyes in his most threatening manner . Then he left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head ; as he passed the bottom step he kicked it , hard . Father Danowski watched all this with the greatest satisfaction . He had recently decided that he understoodRoy , and had taken to viewing him in a more indulgent light . " Look at him , Father , " he said complacently . " See how embarrassed he is : it is unmistakable . And why ? Because a few kind words were unexpectedly addressed to him . How wrong I was , Father , in once suspecting him . He is like a child : a great and awkward schoolboy ! " The schoolboy disappeared around the corner of the church ; we did not see him again for nearly a week . He returned to the rectory rumpled , red-eyed , and still shaking ; he had an explanation . He had been stricken by a sudden and paralyzing disorder . " From his hips down to the ground , " he said , " Roy could not move a muscle ! "  |p222Father  Danowski returned to suspicion . " If you ask me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The fine weather continued ; in spite of this , so did Roy 's complaints against the cold church ; I was not moved . Meanwhile , parish life went on , and the Carmodys began to become a part of it . Or , more exactly , not of the parish life , but of mine . Old Charlie came at least once every ten days or so , sometimes alone , sometimes with Bucky or P.J. He would talk at great length , always of my father and the old days ; then , abruptly , he would rise from his chair in the little reception room and he would leave , the mystery of his visits still unsolved . And John came : he had telephoned once or twice , and then , one Sunday morning , and at his suggestion rather than mine , he came over to Saint Paul 's to say Mass . I mention that it was his suggestion , not because I was n't pleased to have him , but because the timing was so odd : both by custom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own parish on a Sunday morning . John knew this , of course ; he referred to it when he telephoned to arrange for his coming . " My flock can get along without their beloved pastor for a day , " he said briskly . " It will do them a world of good . Not to speak of what it will do for me . As a matter of fact it all works out rather nicely : there 's an extra hand staying in the house for the next week or so . A touring English cleric . A convert . Naturally . He 's too good to be true , Hugh . He really is languid , loose-jointed , and impenetrable of speech . The absolute archetype . And with a wonderful chumminess about the Church ; he speaks of the Apostles as if they 'd just borrowed money from him . So I 'll let him take over for me this Sunday . My only regret is that I wo n't be there to see my father 's face as my replacement starts talking about Queer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have everything . So I 'll be over . Besides , it 's important I come on a Sunday ; I want to see your place at its peak . "  |p223And  so he came , to say the eight-thirty Mass on Sunday . The church was perhaps a quarter full ; this  --  whether he knew it or not  --  was the peak of which he spoke . A change indeed from jammed Saint Raymond 's . I watched him from the sanctuaryas he said his clear and beautifully articulated Mass : nota word slurred , not a movement slighted . I think that , in aIq way , I would rather have watched John Carmody say Massthan any other priest I knew . He was entirely at his ease in Latin  --  he had been from his earliest days in the seminary  --  and he had a swift , delicate dexterity which is rare and which is not at all the mere facility which can come with time and practice . And which can be dangerous : a certain glibness on the altar is more than just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , over and over again , when by repetition we reach the point where we could do this thing without thinking , the danger is that we will do it without thinking . The result is that sometimes we will pray to God , say , in the same automatic way that we will tie our shoelaces . I mentioned prayer because it 's so peculiarly liable to this sortof thing . We know our prayers so well and have said them so often that before we know it we 've said them again  --  and again without a shred of thought or meaning . I suspect it 's very hard for most of us to pray  --  to pray well , that is . The mechanical act of falling upon one 's knees and saying The Lord 's Prayer every day is one thing and a simple thing , but to say even the first half-dozen words of that prayer with the attention they deserve is quite another and not at all so simple . I think every prayer well said is a shot through a barricade  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The priest saying Mass knows exactly what he is doing , he knows that the words he repeats day after day are the gravest words he will ever speak , that they are in fact the very core of his belief and of his being , yet in spite of this there comes that moment when , with a sudden shock , he realizes that his mind has been wandering  --  for exactly how long he does not know  --  and that the words of the Divine Sacrifice have been little more than a buzzing background blur . Which is a strong signal to keep his guard up in the future . But because the dangers of routine are what they are , and  --  more important  --  because we are what we are , this is easier said than done , and so , sometimesand unhappily , there are priests who unintentionally but carelessly begin to elide , to speed up , even to skip , until in their hands the Mass becomes a lightning travesty of itself , and startled parishioners find that they are out of church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never guilty . Judged by the standards of the stop-watch , his Mass was undoubtedly what could be called a " fast " Mass , yet what counts is not minutes and seconds , but one 's attitude , and his was one of reverence and attention . I think it was here on the altar that he was really at his best as a priest , for it was here that one could see a side of him that was nowhere else revealed , and it was here too that one had not the slightest awareness of the brusqueness or impatiencethat otherwise trembled almost visibly beneath the surface of his skin . His sermon that Sunday was on actual grace . It was a crisp and intelligent sermon ; it would have gone over extremely well in a seminary classroom . I-Iere , in the decidedly nonacademic atmosphere of Old Saint Paul 's , I had my doubts . So did John . Back in the rectory after Mass , he said , " Hardly a turnaway crowd , would you say ? " " No . But then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as turnaway as we get . " " I was devoured by a pair of Chinese eyes , " he said . " I spotted the owner right at the beginning of the sermon ; he stayed with me to the bitter end . Very flattering . Is he one of the regulars ? " " Oh yes . That 's the invaluable Mr. Yee . " Should I tell him of Mr. Yee 's unfortunate limitation ? I thought not ; under the circumstances , surely , this detail was better omitted.  |p225But  I need n't have bothered even to think about it , for he said immediately , " Mr. Yee speaks no English , I imagine ? And understands none ? " I said , " I 'm afraid that 's about it . " But all he said was , " Lucky man . " He finished his coffee and said , " Thanks for the hospitality . Now , where 's my coat , and I 'll be on my way . " " So soon ? " He had said nothing of his plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer visit . I said , " Do n't rush off . Stay a while ; savor our local scene . Saint Raymond 's can wait for an hour or so . " " Or forever , if it were up to me , " he said . " But I 'm not going back to Saint Raymond 's . Not right away , that is . I thought that as long as I was taking the day off I 'd drive out to Deerford . I have n't been back there since I was transferred . By your omnipotent friend , His Excellency . " I passed this over and wondered : a sentimental journey ? A pilgrimage back to happy days ? It sounded unlike him , and indeed it would have been ; he explained by saying , " Actually , I 've got to go out there sooner or later . I left some things  --  books , etc.  --  that I need , and then I ought to look in on this doctor . " " Doctor ? " This seemed even more unlike him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shrugged . " Neither old nor new . I 'm not ill , if that 's what you mean . I had a little stomach trouble a couple of years ago and this doctor came in to the rectory to see me . He made me promise to check with him every once in a while . And so I do . From the health point of view it 's absurd : I never felt better and the entire physical examination takes about a minute and a half . But I promised and he 's a decent enough fellow ; I think he simply wants someone to talk to . Deerford 's not Paris , you know . If you 're hard up for conversation you talk to the squirrels . And if you 're really desperate , you try the natives . So it 's not everybody 's cup of tea . But , " he said , withp226a grim wistfulness , " it suited me . Right down to the ground . " I said , persisting , " You 're all right , then ? " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about health . But I got no immediate answer ; all wrapped up in his thoughts of Deerford he seemed not to hear me until , with a little start , his head snapped up and he said , " What ? " I repeated the question . He looked puzzled , as if I had just asked a question rooted in lunacy : had he grown any feathers lately , had he walked upon the waters ? He said , " Of course I 'm all right . Why ? Do I look all wrong ? " He did not . Ile looked fine , first rate  --  so much so that it suddenly did seem an impertinence even to inquire . I told him so and he nodded . " Well , there you are . I 'm good for anotherfifty years at least . The only trouble is that every last one of them is apparently to be spent in Saint Raymond 's . A prospect of pure enchantment . " He got up and said , " It 's a good three-hour drive ; I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to his car . I thanked him again for coming and saying Mass ; I half promised I 'd do the same at Saint Raymond 's one day soon . Half promised ; that 's all . And before he drove away the last thing he said was , " I hear my father 's been favoring you with his little courtesy calls . In fact I hear that he practically comes in with the morning milk . " " Nothing as often as that . He does appear from time to time . " " I 'll bet he does . ' What 's he up to ? Have you found out yet ? " " No , I have n't . I 'm not even close . If he 's really up to anything , that is . I 'm beginning to think that he is n't . " " Famous last words , " he said . " Stop talking like one of your altar boys . I still say that what he wants is a few thousand square feet of metropolitan land , at present inconveniently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day of the bulldozer is close at hand . Or so my father profoundlyhopes . " He spoke with conviction ; he was sure that he was right ; Ip227was just as sure that he was wrong . I felt that whatever Charlie wanted , it had nothing to do with Saint Paul 's . And there were even those times  --  few and far between , to be sure  --  when I almost felt that it had nothing to do with me . The point is that Charlie 's mystery , the great conundrum which had puzzled me for so long , had now begun to lose its edge . I still thought about it , of course , but it was no longer a matter of daily speculation , and Charlie himself I received , not without suspicion  --  I had been far too well brought up for that  --  but with a first quick leap of wary wonder which then was apt to fade entirely until he came the next time . I suppose the truth was simply this ; I found that in a way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my days were trouble-free and agreeable enough , heaven knows , but even with Father Danowski and Roy on hand to provide minor variations , the pattern was admittedly something of a monochrome ; Charlie brought me a touch of color that I may have missed more than I had known . In any case , I came to welcome the sudden , frequent , and always unannounced appearanceson the rectory doorstep , and it was never hard for me to watch and listen as this little , incredibly lively old man bounded about the rectory reception room , bubbling out his exuberant monologues , each one a virtuoso 's grab bag of gossip , extravagant self-praise , spurious compliments to me , crocodiletears , unlikely reports of kindly deeds performed , and  --  above all  --  eloquent recollections of the vital , parochial , picturesqueand vanished world in which he and my father had been young ... .

" ... the time they were after your pa to go into politics . They wanted him to run for the Council against Silly Jack McCoy . There was a man I never liked , Father . I 'm a man that likes most everybody , but I never liked Silly Jack . A big tall clown of a feller with a face like an ash tray that was alwaysgoin ' around laughin ' at nothin ' and whackin ' people on the back . He was in the Council twenty years and gavep229out free beer at all the picnics and wore a fireman 's hat in the parades and kissed all the old ladies ' hands and sang O Sacred Heart , 0 Love Divine ' in the Cathedral on Sundays and sold me a secondhand car that the motor fell out of in two weeks . Oh , I tell you , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he was born ! Well , in the end he went crazy , the way a man like that would , and got all soft in the head and started doin ' mixed-up things like handin ' out cigars to little babies and cherry lollipops to grown-up men . That was when they decided to get rid of him and asked your pa to run . But he would n't . Not even when his best old pal asked him to , he would n't . I said to him a hundred times , I said , For the love of God , Dave , get on out there and run and save the city from that dirty cheat . He was always a dirty cheat and now he 's a crazy dirty cheat ! ' But he would n't . He said that if he had to sit in the City Council for as much as two weeks he 'd be crazier than Silly Jack . Besides , he said he liked the man . Your pa was a queer damn man with some of the people he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And not only Charlie , for by now I had another caller : this was Bucky . He had come with Charlie once or twice , but on those occasions he had for some reason been a subdued and subordinate figure ; now he came by himself , perhaps half a dozen times in all . Unlike Charlie , he did not come unannounced ; each visit was preceded by a telephone call . Each call was guarded , faintly conspiratorial : the tone of the first set the pattern for the rest . " You 'll be at home tomorrow night , Father ? " " Yes , I expect so , Mr. Heffernan . I 'm here most nights . " Then , as a prudent addition , I said , " I 'm afraid I go to bed rather early . " " I 'll stop by . For a minute or two . If I may . I do n't like to intrude . I 'm not like some people I could name . Some peoplenot a million miles from here , Father . Some people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . "  |p230No  comment ; I said instead , " There 's no intrusion , Mr. Heffernan . None at all . " " I have this certain matter to discuss with you , Father . A very confidential matter . I 'll say no more about it on the telephone . I think you know what I mean . " " I understand , Mr. Heffernan . Come along , by all means . " So he was still at war with John ; from now on he would discuss the question of his remains with me . A signal honor . . . ? On these visits , he came always at night , usually arriving just as I had finished dinner . The signal for this arrival was the sound of the Warren Avenue bus , making its way with difficultyaround the sharp corner ; two minutes later the doorbell would ring . ( Bucky had no car ; during the next few weeks I was to learn that he was a patron of , and an authority on , the city 's bus lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with time on his hands , he had apparently taken to buses as other old men take to their beds . It was not unusual for him to spend a good part of the day simply riding around in these buses , going nowhere in particular , but transferring from one to the other with the ease and finesse of the accomplished traveler , and finally , at the end of the day , winding up near home and Mrs. Bucky and his supper . ) Here in the rectory  --  again , quite unlike Charlie  --  he wasted no time on preliminaries ; there was no conducted tour of the church for Bucky ; he made none of the customary regretful comments on the transient glories of Old Saint Paul 's . He was a man with businesson his mind , and he got clown to it at once . It was fairly astonishing business  --  even though I 'd been warned about it , and even though I 'd imagined I knew what it would be like . For very old people sometimes talk about death with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those younger than themselves often find this unsettling , even ghoulish . I suppose it is , and yet one 's ideas of what is or is not ghoulish undoubtedly change as , gradually ,  |p231the  obituary page comes to replace the front page as the main attraction in one 's morning paper . In any case , it 's a common approach among the old , and I was prepared to meet it in Bucky . But Bucky surprised me . He was concerned neither with death itself nor his preparation for it ; he was concerned only with the little niceties to follow . " It 's all here , Father , " he said , producing a thick , sealed , and rather soiled envelope from his coat pocket . " All written down . In black and white . In the Will . Be prepared . Leave nothing to chance . The greatest generals in all history are with me on that one . " He did not open the envelope ; instead , he replaced it in his pocket . " I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his coffin . He had already selected this . Nearly a year ago he had gone shopping with P.J. , who had supplied invaluable professional advice . The coffin had been bought , paid for , delivered . It was now in Bucky 's basement . Waiting . " Very handsome , " he said . " Dignified . All walnut and the very finest steel . The kind of a coffin a man can be proud of . Yet only half of what you might expect to pay . On account of the shopping around . And P.J. 's discount . " He had chosen his undertaker . " Arthur Dacey and Son will do the job . When the time arrives . There was a little argument at first on account of my alreadyhaving the coffin but that 's all fixed up now . They have their instructions , Father . Down to the very last detail . They know just what to do . I told them , I 'll have no silly smile on my face ! Remember that ! ' Friendly but solemn , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear the navy blue suit , the dark blue tie with the little white dots , a white carnation on the lapel , and the black kangaroo leather shoes with the plain toes .

" He explained why he had taken this upon his own shoulders.  | " The wife is a fine woman , " he said , " but you could n't trust a woman with a thing like this ! " He had drawn up his specifications for the funeral : a High Mass from Old Saint Paul 's at eight o'clock in the morning ; myself to sing it ; a quartet in the choir loft ; eight bearers , chosen by name : Charlie and P.J. led the list . There were also substitute bearers , in the event that any or all of the originals should predecease him . He went on . There was to be a two-grave lot in Saint Paul 's cemetery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the feeling that he was currently spending hours wandering through the cemetery , his sharp old eye on the watch for prime sites ) . His tombstone  --  like the coffin , alreadypurchased and delivered  --  was an enormous rectangle of white polished marble . He produced a small card and showed me , in printed letters , the epitaph which he had composedand which would be incised upon the stone : HERE LIESA MAN BELOVEDBY ALLCORNELIUS J. HEFFERNAN And underneath : AND HIS LOVING WIFEMARGARET B.A strange final equation , surely : short shrift for poor MargaretB. ! He talked with special zeal of the care of his grave . It should be perpetual ; he had read only recently of a new grass admirablyadapted to this purpose : green the year round , it requiredlittle mowing . He had already written to inquire if this grass were suitable for these latitudes.  |p233There  was more , but at last he finished . He breathed out hard , then sat back in his chair , clearly waiting for his due . I could at least be truthful ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heffernan . " " I left out nothing , " he said with satisfaction . " Did you notice that , Father ? " " Yes . Yes indeed . " " All tied up in a bundle , " he said . " No loose ends . Neatness counts ! That 's what they used to tell us in school and that 's what I 've always believed . I 've lived neat and I 'll die neat . No man can argue with that . But what 's the good of it all , Father , unless you can trust people ? To carry out the plans . Just as I made them . Right to the dot . That 's the question the whole wide world asks , Father : Who can you trust ? The big books all ask that one . And I ask it too . Who can I trust , Father ? Some priest who 's so busy trying to get out of the room the moment he sees you coming in he ca n't hear a word you say ? Some smart-aleck priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes before you say it ? No no , Father . I 'll trust no priest like that . No matter how well I know his pa . I say it now for one and all to hear : If a priest has got no time for Bucky Heffernan , Bucky Heffernan has got no time for that priest ! Alive or dead . Not after all the trouble I took to make everything come out nice . And that 's why I 'm here tonight , Father . Right here . In Old Saint Paul 's rectory . I 'm here to get a priest I can trust ! " And then he actually said the words ; he said , " Will you bury me , Father ? " It was both a compliment and a request  --  of a somewhat special kind , to be sure . And how to respond ? What in the world could you say to this ? Because the whole thing was so close to farce , so divorced from the meaning of death , so wildly , comically out of proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kind , to suggest little graveside ingenuities of my own . But then I looked at Bucky and saw his eyes staring at me with passionate earnestness , and I sud/denly realized that , despite all the ludicrous trappings , here was an old man who really was going to die soon simply because he was that old , who wanted terribly to have everything " come out nice , " and to whom it was a matter of the most enormous importance that Bucky Heffernan , once he had ceased to be Bucky Heffernan , be borne in glory to the ground and treated grandly every day . A queer piece of terminal vanity , and hardly the ideal obsession before the fact of death , yet there it was , obviously  --  all too obviously  --  the spark or the vision that kept him going , the object which entirely filled his skies . And so , in a situation like that , do you try to shoot the object  --  however preposterous  --  out of an old man 's skies , or do you try to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the man himself ? I said carefully , " Look , Mr. Heffernan : I 'm sure you know what the Church has to say about something like this  --  " But these were unfortunate words , probably  --  inevitably , come to think of it  --  suggesting censure , or outright prohibition . Or so he apparently thought , for instantly he raised his hand to stop me . " One moment , Father ! " he said triumphantly . " I have you there ! The right is on my side ! One hundred per cent ! I can go where I want to be buried from ! I 've looked it up in the books ! Popes and bishops back me up on that one ! " A new side of Bucky : the canonical side . I said , " Yes , I know you can . You can be buried from whatever parish you like . It 's your privilege , Mr. Heffernan . And if you really want to be buried from Saint Paul 's , whenever the time comes , of course you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Mass , of course I will  --  " " That 's it ! " he cried . " I thank you , Father ! Those are the words I came to hear ! Those few words ! From a priest I trust ! " And he shot to his feet ; he had all the appearance of one who was about to leave at once . I said quickly , " I even have a few words more . " And the question was , of course : Where to begin ? With a short catechetical talk on death ? Hardly . A tryp235at an apologia for John and Saint Raymond 's ? I said , " You know , I would think you might want to give another thought to your own parish , Mr. Heffernan  --  " " Aha ! " he said scornfully . " That 's all they 'll get . From now on . They 'll get Bucky Heffernan 's thoughts , yes . But they wo n't get Bucky . " I 'd never before met anyone who had such a fond appreciation of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a casket of rare gems . I said , " Yes , but listen , Mr. Heffernan . In the first place , if I were in your shoes , and looked as well as you do now , I would n't be thinking of my burial as being imminent . But when it did come , I think I might want it to come from a place where everyone knew me , from my home . And after all , Saint Raymond 's is your home , is n't it ? You 've lived there all your life ; all your friends are there . I should think a man with your sense of the fitness of things would prefer to be there . " Was this effective artfulness ? I looked at Bucky . No . I went on to the nub of the matter . " And as far as your plans  --  these arrangements you 've so carefully made  --  are concerned , surely no one could handle them better than Father Carmody . He may seem a bit brisk or preoccupied at times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he 's an extremely efficient man . You could be sure that your instructionswould be followed to the letter . " Pacifying words . Which failed to pacify . " He 's had his chance ! " Bucky cried . " And passed it up ! Too busy ! Too busy to spend a few short evenings with Bucky ! And now Bucky 's too busy for him ! Opportunity knocks but once ! We all know that ! The boot 's on the other foot now ! And one day he 'll know it ! One day , " he said , excitement and delight running across his face , " that certain priest will get what 's coming to him ! One day when the people start coming back and asking why they have to go clear across the city to look at Bucky 's lovely grave ! One day when the Bishop calls him up on the carpet and wants to know why a man with ap236grave like that was n't buried in his own home parish ! And then , " he chortled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho ho ! Then he 'll have to speak up ! For one and all to hear ! He 'll have to say , Your Excellency , I 'll tell you why he 's not buried at home . In his own parish . Where every man belongs . He 's not buried there because of me ! It 's all my fault ! I was too much of a smart aleck for my own good ! Too high and mighty ! I see it all now ! He came to see me ! Of his own free will ! To discuss the matter man to man . And what did I do ? I thought I had him all sewed up . I was too cocksure . I gave him no time . So off he went to Old Saint Paul 's and never came back ! That 's what I did , Your Excellency ! I drove Mr. Heffernan away . I confess it all . The whole works ! ' " I did it with my little hatchet ... . And the curious thing was that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanity , some small sense of proportion , to the evening . So much for good intentions . We had arrived at a vision which , however incredible it seemed to me , clearly left Bucky in near-ecstasy . As he contemplated each savory detail of John 's glorious abasement , he chuckled and his shoulders shook ; his eyes bulged ; his face was red and smiling ; he was breathing happily and hard . And once again there was this peculiar swelling of his whole being  --  I had noticed the phenomenon before , at Charlie 's birthday dinner , although then the cause had been a different emotion . It did not matter : he seemed to inflate equally with rage or joy . He seemed also , now , to have no disposition to leave ; apparently in the last few minutes he had changed his mind ; he sank comfortablyinto a chair and seemed ready for a fine , full , macabre evening .. . Still , it did n't turn out quite that way ; he stayed , but not too much longer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not  --  change the subject ; every once in a while I made my bid for a slight shift of emphasis . Not on anything central or theological  --  this , with luck , could come later  --  but on cer/tain small practical points which , to put it mildly , stood in some need of revision . There was the matter of the epitaph , for instance ; subtly , I plumped for greater justice for MargaretB . On this and other points Bucky paused to listen with an appearance of solemn attention , the way old men sometimes do when they 're catching their breath ; I do not think that he was deeply moved . By the time he left , a great deal had been covered and as far as I could see , absolutely nothing had been changed . In short , an ideal evening for Bucky . He shook my hand warmly at the door and professed to be enormously satisfied ; he hinted strongly that this was by no means the last of such visits . I believed him ... . Yet the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of Bucky . Maybe it was that my long stay in such a placid pool as Old Saint Paul 's had dulled my reactions ; maybe it was that my infrequent and irregular contact with old men like Bucky had somehow softened me , brought me to a kind of rosy romanticism  --  in any case , it was n't until I woke the next morning that certain suspicions began to suggest themselves , suspicions which , in years gone by , would have arisen the instant Bucky had opened his mouth . And so I called John , partly because I thought he ought to know what was going on , but mostly because I was sure that by now he already did . In this I was entirely right . " He 's been here , " he said . " Bright and early this morning . Dripping with triumph . I could n't get rid of him . You 've got a great supporter there , Hugh . He kept following me around and telling me that at last he could die in peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't suppose you 're interested in winning back my greatsupporter ? Somehow I have the feeling that it could be done . " " Yes , " he said drily . " Somehow I have that feeling too . " " Bucky has made his approach ? " " Oh yes . I was given to understand that while you had thep238inside track at the moment , all might not be lost if I played my cards right . Of course the truth is that much as I want to , I have n't a hope of losing him . No matter how I play my cards . That coffin in the basement will wind up here , come hell or high water , and all the talk is just that : talk . In the good old Saint Raymond 's tradition of meaningless eloquence . He 's here , and here he 'll stay until the end of time . Or at least until the end of his time . You could n't blast him out of Saint Raymond 's . " Which was perfectly true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . In a way I felt relieved : it was where he belonged , obviously . Yet at the same time , rememberingmy own careful attempts at persuasion last night , I also felt a little foolish . I said to John now , " So it 's all Bucky 's little game , then ? " " Entirely . Pure pingpong . Back and forth . As fast as the buses will carry him . It must hardly have seemed worth his while when he had just me to annoy , but now that he 's got you too , everything 's fine and dandy . That 's the great principle of life over here : the more people you bother , the better you feel . A little lesson I absorbed at my father 's knee . No , your only defense now is to hide , Hugh . Or better still , pray for a bus strike . That would do it . " There was no bus strike ; I could not hide ; Bucky continued to call . He talked ; I talked ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept in , inevitably , for , our single subject was not without its limitations , and Bucky as a narrator believed in repetition . Still , I was neither annoyed nor bored . Like Charlie , Bucky brought a peculiar zest , a flavor , to the day , and if much of his talk meant nothing at all  --  speculationsabout that cataclysmic shift which would never occur  --  still , there was a kind of fascination in listening to a man who could with such enthusiasm and in such detail outline the blueprint for his posthumous disposition , and who could seep239in his own grave nothing short of a civic monument . But beyondall this there was something else , something which did not belong in never-never land  --  not a dream or an antic fantasy , but a fact which belonged to the here and now . This was the plain fact of death itself , the sober side of the picture , which I sometimes forgot even existed as I listened to Bucky , but which  --  I 'm convinced  --  he never forgot , not even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he talked , underneathall the complicated and grandiose plans , I caught a note of uncertainty and fear , and after a time I was sure that this was what he was really talking about , and not at all the burial or the dramatic transfer of his bones . I may have been all wrong in this , reading too much into a tone or a look in the eye , but I do n't think so , and in any case the least I could do was to listen . And perhaps now and then to offer a suggestion , a word of reassurance , some small help : you never know ... . But I was not Bucky 's only audience in the rectory ; there was also Father Danowski . He had never actually met or talked to Bucky  --  on all his visits , Bucky made a great point of his need for privacy : " Strictly between ourselves , Father ! There 's certain people would love to know my plans ! "  --  but even in these moments of high confidence Bucky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Father Danowski , located a floor away , could often hear bits and pieces of what went on . He spoke of this to me , apologizing elaborately for having overheardanything : it was by no means , he assured me , by no means to be construed as eavesdropping . Which was true enough , certainly : one might as well have spoken of eavesdroppingon a peal of thunder . As he went on to tell me just what he had heard , I discovered that he had at first been bewildered , then horrified by Bucky 's zealous approach to his own interment . Suddenly , however , the mists had cleared , and in a flash he had understood everything . Bucky was joking . It was all in fun.
