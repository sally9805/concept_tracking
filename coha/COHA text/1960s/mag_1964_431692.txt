 | Thank God I really listened to her . I might not have had a second chance . I was stirring soup , keeping an eye on dripping snowsuits , and hurrying the baby with his fruit , when Janet asked : " Mommy , what 's a French kiss ? " Janet 's nine . She talks all the time . Everything is drastically important to her . Sometimes when I 'm behind with my work , I just ca n't pay attention to what she 's saying . To make up , I try to keep a special time for her each clay , but you ca n't expect human problems especially a child 's ? to stay on a schedule . I was annoyed with her question , about to dismiss it as some fresh showing-off of dirty talk , but some overtone reached me . I thought quickly , but turned and said : " It 's when you kiss on both cheeks like this . Frenchmen do that when they give medals . " But my dear little blue-eyed , freckled Janet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . Her eyes seemed old and wise and she answered , " No , it 's not like that . Is it ? " I caught my breath . I turned off the stove , gave the baby a chocolate cookie ; took Janet 's hand , and as calmly as I could , took her upstairs to sit on my bed . And all the time I was silently praying . " Why did you ask me about a French kiss , dear ? " " It 's like this , is n't it , when you open your mouth and ? " " And who told you that , Janet ? " " Jimmy Curtis . " " But he 's a grown man , is n't he ? " " He loves me , he said . " Jimmy Curtis . Age twenty-five or so . Tall , lanky , grown son of the nice Curtis family down the street . His sister Sarah was in Janet 's class in school . I had never met Jimmy . He did n't live at home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A touch of irony made me shiver . Usually when Janet skated on the pond I went with her , but when I heard that Jimmy Curtis was there , keeping a nice fire going and an eye on his little sister , I was sure Janet would be safe and did n't go . " Mommy , he is n't a stranger . You told me never to trust strangers , but I know Jimmy . " Now the story tumbled from her lips . Jimmy thought she was the most beautiful girl in the world . Jimmy was lonely and no one understood him . Jimmy wanted her to marry him when she grew up . And Jimmy asked her to stay behind with him when the others left for home in the twilight . He told her he could keep her warm in the snow , and he lay down with her behind some bushes , and taught her the meaning of French kisses . Oh , my skinny , gawky Janet with the funny gaps where teeth have come out . She has the promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she does not yet know she will be lovely . She is vulnerable in the special way of little girls growing up . Her  | brother tells her she is a pest . She works hard at her baseball , and makes like a tomboy , and in her ski pants with the big skating sweaters she looks a healthy , wonderful mess . Thank God for snowpants , and all the bulky clothing she likes to wear , I thought . The color in her cheeks now was not from the skating cold . Her hands twisted in her lap . " Shall I teII you all the things he said ? " She blinked away tears . I had no voice . I did not yet know what to say . I simply listened . He had poured on this child of mine all the endearments and flatteries men have used since time began . Told her she was wonderful , told her he just wanted to be near her forever . These she repeated now , and I could see that like older women before her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interspersed with these came obscenities , stark and horrid in the honest straightforward report of a child . He had told her of seeing his mother naked , and the thoughts in his mind . He had excited her with kisses , complained a bit about the clothes she wore , told her she must be more lovely without clothes , as God made her . I stared at her . I thought how glad I was that she was telling me this , not hiding it . But at the same time a question echoed in my heart : How can she not feel this was wrong ? How can she talk about it with so little shame ? I have tried to teach her what she needs . . . . Should n't she know , even by instinct , how wrong this was ? But maybe she did know . She had been picking at the tufts of the bedspread , studying her bitten nails . Now , when she mentioned God , her voice broke . She turned an anguished little face to me . " Mommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " My face must have shown the beginning of horror . She grabbed my hand . " Mommy , I thought it was wrong . I kept thinking it was horrible and dirty and wrong , but he kept talking about God so I did n't know what to think . He goes to the same church we do , Mommy . And he 's older and knows a lot more than I do . And he kept saying God made my body , just the way you tell me . And he said I should believe the way my body feels . " Suddenly I saw the twisted wickedness of it all . He had used his age and his religion , to bewilder the child . " He made a date with me , " Janet went on . " He said he would come and sit beside me in church tomorrow , and pray with me , only no one should know that we were in love . And after you had taken me home from church , I was to meet him for a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kill me maybe , if I told you . And he meant it . He 's awful strong . " I was crying , and she cried , and we hugged each other , and I kept telling her that telling me was the best thing she ever did in her life . Downstairs I could hear our baby  | banging on the high-chair , and the television show Janet 's brother was watching . Soon my husband , Bud , would be home looking for his dinner and a quiet evening . Janet 's sobs stopped , and she looked straight at me . " Was it wrong ? Was it ? He does love me ; he said so . " " It was very wrong . Not for you , but for him , " I began . How could I make little Janet understand the evil that had threatened her , tell her enough so she would know and be afraid , yet tell it in such a way that she would not be afraid later when true love came ? Only a few weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts of life . We 've never believed in feeding them stork stories or telling them lies , but have tried to build a natural knowledge of sex . I remember Bud said ? and I agreed ? that there was no point in rushing children out of their innocence ; that when ours reached their teens there 'd be plenty of time for detailed information . Meanwhile , unless they asked specific questions , we 'd continue as before ? stressing modesty without making the kids self-conscious or prudish . Both Janet and her brother had long since been taught never to go off with strangers . We 'd talked to both of them about the ordinary experiments of little girls and boys playing . But Janet had not met a stranger or a curious little boy . And Janet , because she knew the man , and because of his age and piety , did not have enough specific knowledge to back up her instinctive feeling that something was wrong . I know now that we parents must give our little girls more information . We must specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch their bodies . We must differentiate between the affectionate family kiss and any other kind . We must give them inhibitions and standards of right and wrong to prepare them to live in a world where many adults have neither . What I had given Janet in sex education up to the age of nine was a general description of where babies come from , the idea of an egg and a seed , a mother and a father , and a lot about love and marriage and God . It was all true . and pretty , but it was not enough . If a pervert gets hold of a child ,  | she must have more than generalizations to protect her . Then and there I knew I had to give Janet a thorough grounding in sex , under very difficult circumstances . She had to know a lot if she was to understand my reaction and be forever sure she had done right to tell me and to know why something had to be done about Jimmy Curtis . She also had to understand the questions she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been raped . I had to know exactly what had happened . And so did she . As I talked to her , I could n't escape the nightmare thought of what tomorrow after church could have brought to this child . Nor the haunting awareness that the way I handled this emergency might affect her whole life as a grown woman . Humbly , I asked God to guide me , that she might be left emotionally unscarred . And what was to be done about Jimmy Curtis ? My husband , my Bud , would know what to do . " I have to tell your father about this . Janet . " I said . " Oh , no ! " She was terrified . " He 'll be angry at Jimmy , wo n't he ? And he 'll do something , and Jimmy will know I told . " " He has good reason to be angry at Jimmy , " I said . " But he wo n't be angry at you . And he will have to do something . Whatever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or gets you . " When Bud got home . I somehow got the family fed , the baby to bed , and kept up a semblance of normalcy in front of Janet 's brother . Later , when the three of us were alone upstairs , I told Bud in front of Janet what had happened . His first reaction , like any man 's , was to get a gun . or throttle Jimmy barehanded . His wrath frightened Janet . Neither of us had ever seen Bud like that before . But in a way it was good for her to see how strongly he felt . Soon , though Bud being Bud he got a grip on himself and sat own to think . He asked Janet questions , soberly , quietly . Gradually , the way he was askng the questions made me woner : could he possibly think she as making it up ? As for me , I as sure she was telling the truth , ut , though Bud was n't badgering er . I sensed something was bothring him about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nderstood what and why . " Now , Janet , " Bud said finally , I am  | going to call the police . What Jimmy was doing is wrong and dangerous . You are afraid he 's going to kill you because you told us , and you wish I would n't get him in trouble . But the truth is we have to get the police because a man who does things like this is sick , and he will do it again , and he will hurt some other little girl very badly sometime if he is n't stopped and helped now . " " I 'm scared . I wish it never happened and I never told you . " " No , darling . You do n't need to be scared because I will be with you and the police wo n't let Jimmy hurt you . This is the only way to help him . The greatest handicap police have with this kind of thing is that people are scared of making trouble , so the first few times a man does something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stopped . Sometimes little girls even get killed . " She nodded . I looked away , thinking how awful it was for Janet to take all this . " You will have to talk to a policeman . He will ask you questions , just the way I did . You answered very well , and so you will not have trouble with his questions . And he will be kind . " Bud went to the phone , and for a long time I sat talking with Janet . Trying to tell her about love , my love for her , her love for us , and the different love of a man and a woman . I told her that she already understood about fire , how fire could be very good or very bad , depending on where it was , and what it was used for . Love , I said , was like that . In the right place and time it was wonderful . And I promised her that someday the man she truly loved , who truly loved her , would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good burning beauty of that moment , this ugliness would have no part . And , because Janet is nine , we stopped being serious soon , and even laughed while she took her bath . I read her some Mary Poppins stories before she fell asleep . I knew that much as I shrank from the thought , Bud was right that it was necessary to call in the police . My own impulse was to talk to Jimmy 's mother . I kept feeling that if I were she , and Jimmy my son , I 'd appreciate hearing it from another mother . I wanted to let her know I did n't hate or condemn her . Later Bud and the police convinced me it is better for such news to be broken by impersonal authorities . Parents get defensive even over small things when confronted by other parents . Personal feelings run high . It was kinder to let the police handle it their way . The police were wonderful . They were grateful we had the courage to call them . They told us how lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tell us what had happened . They described how the case would be handled , what protection we would have , how they would put Janet at ease during the investigation . The next morning , Janet was not at church . Unobtrusively my little girl and her father met with the police , took them to the pond in an unmarked car , showed them the marks in the snow behind the bushes . Then Janet had to go to the police station , answer questions , sign a statement . She kept her composure , mostly because everyone was gentle , friendly , kind . " Will she have to testify in court ? " I asked . " Not if he admits it . Only if his story does n't agree with hers . " She came home feeling safe . But I did n't feel safe at all . Suddenly the road on which we lived seemed fraught with evil . No longer could I let my child wander from yard to yard , or play in the little woods by the brook . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me nervous . I understood why people hate to call the police . I thought : if he is arrested and convicted , he will someday get out of jail , and maybe he will come back . I thought : his poor mother ! I thought : will his little sister Sarah know ? Will other people know ? Will they gossip and make scandal so Janet will never forget ? He admitted everything and was placed under psychiatric care by the court . We learned that he had been a retarded child . Now as an adult he posed problems his parents could not face . They knew he had dangerous tendencies , and had lived for years in fear of what he might do , without being able to bring themselves to do anything about him . They had tried keeping him far away , getting him jobs . . . . Now that something had brought matters to a head , and the problem was out of their hands , they were  | almost pitifully relieved . I hated them for not having taken the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . And surely they were suffering now . We were able to let them know , through their lawyer , that we held no personal animosity for them , or for their son . The thing that had puzzled Bud , and the police , about Janet 's story was that it did not follow the deepset pattern of perverts ' attacks . It did n't make sense to them , though they had believed her . " You mean you almost did n't believe her because it was n't horrible enough ? " " That 's about it , honey . She was lucky . He was n't the run-ofthe-mill pervert . Being retarded and childish , he let her off easy . " An odd thing to be grateful for , that the man who had done this dreadful thing to Janet was n't the monster he could have been . Today our road is again a quiet , half-country sort of place with nice homes and families . The Curtises are still neighbors . The children run about freely . Janet seems to have recovered perfectly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across this country , in city streets , anywhere , the same thing may be threatening another child ? at the hands of someone worse . I hope by sharing this story , to alert other mothers to the danger and to pass on what I 've learned about how to protect children from it . First , parents should strive for such a loving and trusting family relationship that no matter what happens their children will not be afraid to confide in them . Second , that since both boys and girls run the risk of encountering perverts anywhere , any time , specific instructions should replace vague warnings against strangers . Even little children must be informed clearly that no one except a doctor or parent should touch their bodies with any intimacy . And that no one , including relatives , has the right to more than a kiss on the cheek . And children should be told why . Third , that if anything should happen , parents must have wisdom and courage to call the police at once , in spite of embarrassment or fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
