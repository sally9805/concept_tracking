Advancing on Manhattan last week to accept the New York Board of Trade " Business Speaks " award , Michigan 's Governor George Romney admitted that he had a problem . He wanted to avoid all discussion of himself as a possible candidate for the G.O.P. presidential nomination , he said . But how was that possible ? <P> Romney confided that he had put his research staff to work for three weeks , digging in search of strictly non-political material . So what happened ? " They went through all of the newspapers carefully in search of material , only to find that when they excluded everything that Barry Goldwater , Nelson Rockefeller and President Kennedy had said the day before , all they had left was the comics . The truth is that everything is political these days , and it 's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a public figure to give a nonpolitical talk . " <P> Romney pretty well got through the needle 's eye by talking about the economy . Said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation , be taken out of the shadowy category of a doubtful social and economic asset . The question we need to ask today of automation , as well as all other elements of technical change , is not ' Is it really good ? ' but ' How can we accelerate its application and make it work more bountifully for everyone ? ' " <P> U.S. economic problems , Romney said , are attributable to the inability of both labor and management to cope with automation 's promise . If automation were truly accepted , he argued , the economy would be able to achieve a 5% annual growth and create " the millions of new jobs needed for our burgeoning population . " The key to that growth lies in resolving the basic conflicts of economic power . " Competition and cooperation will achieve it ; vast power conflicts and growing governmental power to control such conflicts will not . "
