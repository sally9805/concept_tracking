txt // to get good malted milks or hamburgers and there were no barbecues . " The food selection of most people depends on habits , many of which may have developed in childhood . People tend to be guided automatically by these habits . They like the foods to which they are accustomed . Most people either do not know , or do not care , that the body has certain requirements which must be satisfied by foods . If some of these requirements are not met , disease can develop . Our health depends on the satisfaction of these requirements . The intelligent way to select food is to know about the requirements and to know which foods we should use to meet the needs . There is a widespread impression that the selection of food on the health basis causes meals , and the eating of them , to be unpleasant and a kind of penance . That is , of course , not true . We can have very pleasant , attractive meals ( just as tasty as our present ones ) by selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eating foods on the health basis . Even more important , we can develop that kind of food habit in children . // The Choice of Foods for Health and Pleasure The food we eat must serve a number of purposes in the body if health is to be attained and maintained . One of the main difficulties is that most people do n't know about the real needs , or , if they do know , they eat as if they did n't care . The needs are very simple to understand and they can be explained easily . A. Growth Obviously , food is needed for growth . A house can not be constructed without building material . Our bodies can not grow unless the substances which form the body are supplied . No miracle is involved ; the needed substances come from foods . The hard framework of the body , the bones , contain a great deal of calcium and phosphorus . So do the teeth . 21 // These two nutrients are required as soon as bones and teeth start to develop in the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby by the mother who , in turn , must obtain them from foods eaten by her to prevent her own body being deprived of them . After the baby is born , calcium and phosphorus will continue to be supplied by the mother , if she breast-feeds her baby . As children grow , the increase in the size of the bones makes continued supplies of calcium and phosphorus necessary , if the bones are to be healthy . We might decide that the need for calcium and phosphorus would end when growth stops . This is not true . Calcium may not stay put in the bones even if it does in the teeth when they are fully formed . Calcium serves purposes other than the building of bone . A fairly constant amount of calcium is maintained in the blood and in all of the fluids of the body since calcium in the blood is essential for blood-clotting . Calcium in fluids bathing the nerves has a marked effect on the activity of the nerves . If we do not take enough calcium in food , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant . To add to the need for calcium , a small amount is lost every day in urine and in feces . What this all adds up to , is that an intake of calcium is needed throughout life to keep the body from developing a deficit . Of course , the need is greatest when growth is taking place . The greatest need for calcium is in adolescence , since bones increase markedly in size during teen-age growth . Like calcium , phosphorus serves purposes other than bone formation : it is needed to help move fat around the body and for the utilization of carbohydrate ( starch and sugar ) . As in the case of calcium , // some phosphorus is being lost every day ; there is need for a continuous intake throughout life . Those of us who are not engineers regard with great admiration and respect the construction of a large building . The work seems so complicated that we wonder how it is done without mistakes . The formation of bone is a complicated business also . A variety of substances is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the vitamins are necessary for the formation of really healthy bones . In the case of any nutrient , we must be concerned not only with the quantity in the meals we eat , but also with the amount absorbed and used in the body . The absorption of calcium and of phosphorus may not be particularly efficient . Sometimes people absorb only about one-fifth of the calcium in eaten food . Vitamin D has a very beneficial effect on the absorption of calcium and may cause the amount absorbed to double . Of course , this makes more calcium available for building into bones and teeth . Another matter of concern is whether the incorporation of calcium into bones and teeth goes on normally , producing healthy structures . Both vitamins C and D help the building of bones and teeth . It follows that we should be sure that ample supplies of these vitamins are available during growth . Any wise father or mother would wish children to have healthy , properly formed , bones and teeth . To ensure this , it is necessary to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vitamin C , and to ensure an adequate supply of vitamin D. Practical ways of ensuring such supplies will be described later . The soft parts of the body ( muscles , liver , heart , and so on ) contain a great deal of water . Muscle contains // water to the extent of three-quarters of the total weight . Blood and other fluids in the body contain a high proportion of water . Ordinarily , people do n't think much about the need for water unless they have to do without it , or with very little . Then it is realized how important water is . We can live for a much longer period without solid food than we can survive without water . A man of average weight needs two to three quarts of water a day . The amount needed depends on how hard he works , climatic temperatures , and how well kidneys are functioning . Next to water , the chief constituent of the soft parts of the body are substances belonging to a group called protein ( this word means " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proteins in the body , and in food . They are grouped together because they are formed from simpler units called amino acids . There are nineteen of these amino acids , and proteins differ from each other in the assortment and the quantities of the different amino acids . If this sounds complicated , think of building brick walls with nineteen kinds of bricks available . One wall could contain all nineteen different bricks in certain proportions , another might be built from different proportions of the nineteen bricks and would look entirely different from the first wall . A third wall could be constructed with fifteen kinds of bricks . We could build many different walls using varying assortments of nineteen kinds of brick . " There may be fifty different proteins in the foods we eat . During digestion the food proteins are broken down to the amino acids and these are absorbed . The body uses these absorbed amino acids to build a variety of different proteins to serve special purposes . There is a catch in this building of proteins in // the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supplied by food , if the body is to remain healthy . The body gets along without a food supply of the other eleven amino acids because they can be produced in the body . Obviously , proteins are required for growth and an adequate supply of the proteins which will furnish the essential amino acids is all-important during growth . The protein supply situation is further complicated because the proteins in our body do not stay put . The body proteins are constantly wearing away and there must be a continuous new supply ( particularly of the essential amino acids ) throughout life . Food proteins which contain all the essential amino acids are called complete ? that is an easily understood name , is n't it ? Food proteins which lack some of the essential amino acids are called incomplete . The simplest way to obtain a supply of all of the essential amino acids is to select foods which contain complete proteins . Animal-source foods like meat , fowl , fish , eggs , milk , cheese , contain complete proteins . Proteins in grains and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the essential amino acids is to eat foods which contain complete proteins , we can get the same result by eating a variety of foods with incomplete proteins . The essential amino acid missing in one food will be present in another food . If we do rely mainly on incomplete protein-foods , we have to use a larger total amount of protein . Vegetarians can get all the essential amino acids without eating meat , fish , or fowl . In some countries this is necessary because these foods are not available . If meat , fish , or fowl are available , why be a vegetarian ? // B. Energy Humans arc warm-blooded animals living in a cold environment . It is necessary to keep the body warm to maintain life . Just like a radiator , the body is continuously losing heat to the surroundings ( have you been in a crowded bus lately ? ) . Actually , it is necessary to have the body temperature kept fairly constant . This is done by generating heat in the body and by controlling the heat loss by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tends to keep the body from becoming too hot . Two hundred years ago it was taught that body heat was produced by the friction of the blood moving through the blood vessels . The famous French scientist , Lavoisier , demonstrated that heat was produced in the body by a chemical reaction ( oxidation ) between food substances and the oxygen from the atmosphere . His observations clearly settled the function of food in providing heat in the body . To maintain life , energy is expended for more than heat production . The beating of the heart , the work of the lungs in breathing , the activities of other vital organs , all expend energy . Like heat production , the energy for the vital functions is produced in the body by the oxidation of food substances . When exercise or physical work is done ( if we ca n't help it ) , energy is expanded . Again , this energy is provided by the oxidation of food substances . The amount of energy depends on the severity of the exercise or work . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy used in work is only a fraction of the total energy need of his body . Since a great deal of the energy produced in the body // is used for heat , it is reasonable that the energy production should be measured in heat units . The unit used is the calorie and it is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram ( 2.2 lbs. ) of water 1 ? C ( 1.8 ? F ) . This is the " large " calorie ; the " small " calorie , not used in nutrition , is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water 1 ? C. The energy values of foods are also expressed in calories . The constituents of foods which can be oxidized to provide energy are : carbohydrates ( starch and sugar ) , fats , and proteins . Proteins are used as constituents of soft parts of the body and also to furnish energy . Equal weights of carbohydrates and of proteins have equal energy , or calorie , value . Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbohydrates or proteins . It is useful to remember that fats are concentrated sources of energy , especially if you wish to reduce your calorie intake . Maintenance-energy needs ( body heat plus vital organ activity ) vary from person to person , and in the same person from time to time . Maintenance-energy needs vary with the size ( or weight ) and in adults they can be expressed as twelve to sixteen calories per pound of body weight . Sex has no effect on these maintenance needs , but women generally weigh less than men . Age does effect maintenance needs since they decrease as we become older ; activity also lessens in most people as they grow older . During growth some of the food substances are used to increase the size of the body and hence can not be used for energy . Per pound of weight the total calorie intake of children should be greater than for adults ? especially so in adolescence . // C. Other Varied Needs Blood is normally red because it contains a red substance called hemoglobin . This substance in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body and in moving to the lungs carbon dioxide ( a product of the oxidation of food substances ) so that the carbon dioxide can be got rid of in expired air . Hemoglobin is continuously breaking down in the body and the loss must be made good ; otherwise , an anemia will develop . To produce hemoglobin , iron must be available . Normally there is very little iron lost from the body unless there is a loss of blood . Men can get along for a fairly long time without an intake of iron , if storage of iron is good at the start , and if there is no hemorrhage . Women , between puberty and the menopause , lose sufficient blood during menstruation to make necessary an intake of iron . The thyroid gland is in the neck , straddling the windpipe . This gland controls the rate of oxidation of food substances in the body . The control is brought about by a substance , the thyroid hormone , which is produced in the gland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant amount of iodine and this nutrient should be available in adequate amounts to enable the thyroid gland to make the hormone . If the supply of iodine is insufficient , the gland tries to make up for the lack of iodine by increasing in size . This increase in size of the thyroid gland is called goiter . There are several kinds of goiter ; the kind resulting from a lack of iodine is known as " simple goiter . " Simple goiter can be prevented by making sure that the intake of iodine is adequate . // A series of vitamins is needed by humans , generally to serve purposes specific for each vitamin . It has been pointed out that vitamin D improves the absorption of calcium and its building into bones and teeth during growth . Nature did not intend us to obtain vitamin D from foods . When the skin is exposed to sunlight or to an artificial source of ultraviolet light , two substances ordinarily present in the skin are converted into vitamin D , which then is available to increase the absorption and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold climates , the amount of sunlight is reduced and clothing reduces the amount of skin exposed to sunlight . This lessens still further the formation of vitamin D. In many cities the amount of ultraviolet reaching the skin from sunlight is reduced by the smoke and dirt in the air . Under these circumstances an external supply of vitamin D is needed in persons in whom growth is taking place . The oil from cod , halibut , and some other fish livers is an excellent source of vitamin D. This vitamin can be made industrially and concentrated products are readily available . The strength of vitamin D preparations is expressed in units . Some seven or eight vitamins are definitely needed by humans to preserve health . Originally , these were named by using letters of the alphabet . In some cases , the letters are still used . For some of the vitamins more explicit names , based on chemical composition , are now in use . Such names will be used here because they are becoming familiar , even to children . The proper name for vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this vitamin helps the building of calcium into teeth and bones and is very much needed during growth . However , this vitamin serves other , and quite different , purposes . It helps // to keep the walls of the small blood vessels ( the capillaries ) in a firm , healthy state . When insufficient ascorbic acid is available , the walls of the capillaries are weakened and rupture easily , allowing blood to escape . The hemorrhages thus produced are characteristic of the disease , scurvy , which is caused by a deficiency of ascorbic acid . It has been known for over two hundred years that scurvy can be prevented by rising fresh fruits and vegetables ( or fruit juices ) . Under most modern circumstances , adults in North America do not develop scurvy , but in some cities in the past few years a number of babies have had scurvy because their mothers did not give them orange juice . Vitamin A , for some years , was referred to as the growth vitamin and some people called it the anti-infective vitamin . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for growth and , in this respect , vitamin A is no more valuable than complete proteins , or calcium , or most of the other vitamins . If we fail to take in any essential nutrient in needed amounts , it is likely that our resistance to infection will be lessened . In this respect , also , vitamin A is no more valuable than any other essential nutrient . However , this vitamin does serve at least two real functions in humans . In the back part of the eye there is a substance called visual purple . This substance consists of vitamin A linked to a special protein . During the process of vision , visual purple is used up . The supply can be replaced if vitamin A is available . 11 there is not enough vitamin A on hand , the quantity of visual purple needed for full vision can not be maintained . This situation shows up , particularly , when people are exposed to bright light ( as on a clear , sunny day ) and a great deal // of visual purple is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be badly affected . This is called night-blindness . It should be noted that night-blindness can be produced by an abnormality in the structure of the eye ; not all night-blindness is due to a lack of vitamin A. This vitamin is connected with another eye disease , one given the complicated name , xerophthalmia . In this disease skin surfaces about the eye are weakened by a lack of vitaman A and an infection may get established in the weakened skin . If that is the case , blindness can be produced . This disease occurred in children living in areas where the supply of vitamin A was meager . Some foods contain vitamin A and others contain a substance , carotene , which can be turned into vitamin A in the body . Either source is satisfactory . A group of vitamins , frequently called the B complex , contains a number of different substances . At least three of these are needed by humans and it is guessed that several others may be essential , also . The three known to be required are thiamine , riboflavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins are quite different from each other in composition and they serve distinct functions in the body . The oxidation of carbohydrates , fats , and proteins is brought about in the body , not in one stroke , but by complicated , step-wise processes . The B vitamins are accelerators for particular steps in the complicated oxidative processes . Thiamine is an interesting case ; it helps at one step in the utilization of carbohydrate . If thiamine is lacking , this step is prevented and the utilization of carbohydrate can not go on by normal processes . Naturally , this failure has a marked effect in the body and there develops a disease known as beriberi . There are two types of beriberi . In the dry form the legs become // paralyzed and walking is difficult and finally impossible . In wet beriberi an accumulation of water causes swelling and puffiness . This disease is hardly ever seen in the United States , in Canada , or in other highly developed countries . It has been far too prevalent in Eastern areas where food is scarce . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not clear how much harm is caused by a deficiency of riboflavin , but a long-standing lack of niacin produces pellagra . Pellagra , in the period between 1900 and 1940 , was a very serious problem in the Southern states . Pellagra is characterized by a rash on the portions of the skin exposed to sunlight . Diarrhea is commonly present . In severe pellagra mental conditions develop . The increased use of meat and other foods supplying niacin , owing to an improvement in economic conditions , has caused the almost complete disappearance of pellagra . The disease still occurs in other parts of the world and it could reappear in North America if care is not taken . There are several important points to remember about the vitamins . A prolonged failure to obtain adequate intake of many of them will cause deficiency diseases . However , the really important thing about the vitamins is that they are required for normal functions in the body and are essential for health . ' I'lhis does not mear that intakes in excess of healthful amounts will produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other infections . If we take excess amounts of ascorbic acid , of thiamine , of riboflavin , or of niacin we will not have super health but we will enrich the sewage because the excess amounts will be excreted in the urine . Excess intakes of vitamins A and 1 ) are not got rid of but acThe // cumulate in the body . Very large intakes of these two vitamins will cause damage and are not only not beneficial but are harmful . Massive doses of vitamin D will not prevent colds or cure arthritis . In prosperous countries , adequate supplies of all the vitamins except vitamin D can be easily obtained from foods . In later chapters , the dependable food sources of vitamins and of other nutrients will be described . It pays to eat wisely and not waste money on pills . // The Dairy Foods : Milk , Cheese , Butter One of the advantages of living in one of the prosperous countries is the general ? and generous ? availability of milk , cheese , and butter ( or margarine ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize the marked improvement in the safety and in the distribution of these foods in the past fifty years . When I was a youngster in a small Canadian city , milk was delivered to our home by the farmer who owned the cows . He brought a can to the back door and measured out the desired amount into a pitcher . The milk was cheap , in comparison to present prices , but it was not safe to drink . No one in our family contracted tuberculosis or undulant fever , but we could have . At that time , certified or pasteurized milk were both unheard of in our area . Now , no milk may be sold in all Ontario ( an area larger than Texas ) unless it has been properly pasteurized . This process , in which bacteria in milk are killed by 84 // heating milk to a suitable temperature , causes milk to be safe when it is obtained by the household . Pasteurization does not harm milk and it should be compulsory everywhere ? even in farm households . I would prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milkcarried infection . Milk In the United States , in Canada , and wherever available , milk is a valuable and economical food . Milk contains a complete , high-value protein . Two quarts of milk contain the same amount of protein as does one pound of average beef . Use this information to do a bit of simple arithmetic . Compare the cost of protein from milk and beef in your own area . When that is done , remember that protein is needed at any age . Milk is an excellent source of protein for older people , who may not get enough if they stop eating meat because of chewing difficulties . Protein is not the only reason for using milk . It is our most convenient , excellent source of calcium for day-to-day use . If we exclude milk , and eat little cheese , our supply of calcium will be low . This is just as true for adults as it is for children . Expectant mothers should have a liberal supply of calcium during the last third of pregnancy to make sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest way to get a liberal intake of calcium is to drink milk . Sometimes , pregnant women are advised to take tablets of calcium gluconate . Milk is a cheaper source of calcium and also supplies protein needed for the growth of the baby . Milk is an excellent source of the vitamin , riboflavin . There is a resemblance to the situation regarding cal36 Foods Without Fads cium . Only one other food is a top-grade source of riboflavin ; that food is liver . Many people find it easier to drink milk than to cat liver . To add to the three nutrition reasons for using milk , it should be noted that it is an easily digested food , suitable even for " delicate " stomachs ( whatever they are ) . You may have heard the statement that " milk is a perfect food . " That is not true . Raw milk contains a small amount of ascorbic acid which is destroyed by pasteurization , but even raw milk is not a good source of ascorbic acid . Milk contains very little iron . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convenient , economical and very useful source of high-quality protein , of calcium , and of riboflavin . Those three constituents make milk an important food which should not be neglected . Should skim milk be used ? Yes , if you are concerned with keeping down your weight . Cup for cup , skim milk has about half the calorie value of whole milk . Cup for cup , skim milk supplies the same amounts of protein , of riboflavin , and of calcium as does whole milk . The use of skim milk may save money , also . Removal of fat from milk , however , lowers the amount of vitamin A because that vitamin is dissolved in the fat . Do n't worry about that ; vitamin A can be obtained more cheaply by eating a number of vegetables . Dry skim milk is a very economical method of providing the values of fresh milk . Made up with the right amount of water , the reconstituted skim milk , cup for cup , supplies as much protein , riboflavin , and calcium as does fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family does n't like the taste of milk made from dry skim milk , try letting it stand in the refrigerator eight to ten // hours before use . Another expedient to save money is to mix reconstituted skim milk in equal amounts with fresh whole milk . Dry skim milk is excellent for cooking . The milk from different animals is not entirely - the same . But for all practical purposes it does n't matter whether we use milk from cows , goats , or buffaloes ( if we are in India ) . The fat in goats ' milk is present in very small droplets which do not separate out , and this makes goats ' milk easily digestable . Human milk does not have the same composition as cows ' milk . Breast milk was designed to nourish the human baby . It is true that cows ' milk can be modified by adding water and sugar . The best food for the human infant ? and the safest ? is breast milk . If the sight of a mother feeding her baby were not taboo in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so selfish , babies would be a great deal better fed . How much milk should we use ? The following quantities are the least which should be used , every day , to ensure suitable intakes of protein , of calcium , and of riboflavin : Children , up to about 12 years : at least 1 pint . Adolescents : at least 11/2 pints ( more calcium is needed ) . Adults of any age : at least i , pint . Expectant mothers : at least 11/ pints during the second half of pregnancy . The frequently used slogan , " a quart of milk a day " is a bad one which should not be repeated . Young children can be given too much milk . When that happens , children are unlikely to eat suitable amounts of other needed foods . A child of five or six can not hold a quart of milk a day and other necessary foods . // There are some silly notions about milk . Pasteurized milk is a safe and very useful food . It does not cause phlegm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a valuable food at any age and not just for children . It is important to start the habit of drinking milk in childhood and to continue it as long as life lasts . Cheese Essentially , cheese is the protein from milk . However , most of the calcium remains with the protein , except in cottage cheese , which is low in calcium . An appreciable portion of riboflavin from milk is present in cheese ? but not the full amount . There are many different kinds of cheese . Cheddar cheese is a commonly available one , widely made and used in the United States and in Canada . Cheddar cheese may be ripened or cured by storage . Such " old " cheese can have a most satisfying flavor , at least for older people . Cheddar cheese is generally an economical source of protein and of calcium ? one ounce of Cheddar cheese furnishes about the same amount of calcium as do six ounces of milk . While Cheddar cheese is the main kind used in the United States and in Canada , a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported originally from Europe . Roquefort , Camembert , Edam , and Swiss cheeses were in the luxury class . These kinds of cheeses are now made in North America . Some cheeses are altered in flavor and appearance by allowing particular bacteria to grow and even produce mold . Roquefort , Blue , Camembert , are of this type . If you are not a connoisseur of cheese , you may never have tried some of these varieties . If you are a connoisseur of cheese , I hail The Dairy Foods : Milk , Cheese , Butter . $9 you as a kindred spirit . I feel sorry for the people who do n't like cheese . By itself , cheese is a grand food . Think what a generous piece of old Cheddar will do for even homemade apple pie ( the pie should be warm , should n't it ? ) . Netherlanders may be accustomed to having cheese for breakfast . That sounds like a queer custom until it 's tried . An addition of cheese can do a great deal for a number of foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of good cheese is tasty , cheap and nutritious . What would spaghetti , or even onion soup , be without cheese ? There are a number of different kinds of processed cheese and cheese spreads . In general these are not economical because they contain more water than does Cheddar . A true lover of cheese would not use them because of flavor . It is a very good plan to use at least three ounces of cheese a week to increase supplies of protein and of calcium and to have a really tasty food or food combination . I feel particularly sorry for the people who are convinced that cheese should not be eaten because it is constipating or because it is indigestible . Neither statement is true ; both are old wives ' tales . Butter ( or Margarine ) People who eat bread do not usually like it without a spread on it . The two spreads commonly used are butter and margarine . Since they are largely fat they do add calories . If you are interested in weight control you will cut down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no proved harm from eating butter or margarine . In the past few years there has been a great deal said // about fat intake in relation to heart disease . As we shall see in Chapter 14 , there is no certain evidence to prove that there is a relation between heart disease and fat intake . For some years there was a great disturbance , mostly political , about margarine . Dairy people opposed the sale of margarine , for reasons which are quite obvious : margarine can be made and sold at prices generally much lower than can butter . The early kinds of margarine were not satisfactory from the viewpoints of taste or of nutritive value . Both situations have been cleared up . Modern margarine is a satisfactory food and is useful for families who can not afford butter . Butter contains vitamin A , but the amount is variable . This vitamin is now added to margarine so that it is at least equal to butter as a source of vitamin A. For some time it was claimed that margarine is not digested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the aspects of digestibility and absorbability , butter and margarine are equal . If it is wrong to color margarine it is wrong , also , to add color to butter ( a common practice ) . The controversy about margarine has now largely disappeared . It is unlikely in the future that professors in state-supported colleges or staff members in experiment stations will be dismissed for daring to state that margarine is a satisfactory food . // Fruits A high school student in our city told a teacher of physical and health education that the reason for eating oranges for breakfast was to counteract the taste left in the mouth from the previous night . That could be an advantage for some people but it is not the main reason for eating fruit or drinking fruit juice . The real reason was established in 1734 by James Lind , a surgeon in the British Navy . Lind was concerned with the cause and the prevention of scurvy , a disease then common among crews of ships on long voyages . Lind showed that scurvy could be prevented by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prevention of scurvy in babies is still important but everyone needs the vitamin known as ascorbic acid , supplied by many fruits and vegetables . Not all fruits are equally good sources of ascorbic acid . The really dependable sources are oranges and grape-41 // fruit or their juices . The simplest way to ensure a decent intake of ascorbic acid is to have a medium-size orange , or half a grapefruit , or four ounces of orange or grapefruit juice every morning with breakfast . The fruit or fruit juice does taste pretty good ; maybe the high school student had a valid reason . Some other fruits are excellent sources of ascorbic acid , also . Strawberries arc a good example . An average serving of fresh or frozen strawberries will supply about as much ascorbic acid as will a medium-size orange . Cantaloupes are another excellent source . Some fruits are poor sources of ascorbic acid : peaches , pears , and popular varieties of apples . Apple juice contains little ascorbic acid . However , ascorbic acid can be cheaply produced commercially and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in-between excellent and poor , as suppliers of ascorbic acid . Such fruits as limes , tangerines , pineapples , watermelons , come into this category . Of course , there is a simple method of getting a greater amount of ascorbic acid if we are using such fruits , and that is to eat more . Ascorbic acid can be lost to a greater extent during cooking than can any other food constituent . This vitamin is soluble in water and can be extracted from food which is cooked in water . Moreover , ascorbic acid is oxidized easily ( a chemical reaction between ascorbic acid and oxygen takes place and this chemical reaction destroys ascorbic acid ) . The oxidation of ascorbic acid can take place at room temperature but it is increased by heat . The loss of ascorbic acid during cooking can be decreased by some easy-to-use precautions which will be discussed in connection with vegetables ( next chapter ) . // Of course , the most ascorbic acid can be obtained if the food containing it is not cooked . This is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapefruit regularly . They are not usually cooked . Some people liked baked oranges and baked grapefruit . Those fruits are so good , as is , that any cooking is unnecessary and unwise . What about canned juice or concentrated juice ? During the process of concentrating juice or of sterilization , a great deal of the natural ascorbic acid may be destroyed . Commercially produced ascorbic acid is available readily and can be added to make good the loss . This is now common practice , and canned citrus juice and concentrated juice are practically always dependable products . There is a question about the retention of ascorbic acid in citrus juice left over and saved for use later . If the juice is kept in a refrigerator , preferably in a closed container , no loss will occur within at least twenty-four hours , and the juice is likely to be satisfactory for two or three days , if it is kept cold . The habit of having citrus fruit , or juice , for breakfast has spread widely in recent years and people do get the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter what time of the day we use citrus fruit to be sure of a supply of ascorbic acid . It is just as good for dessert at any meal or even in the evening . Citrus juice is refreshing at any time of the day , especially in hot weather . There is a very good reason for thinking about fruit for dessert , particularly for people who wish to reduce or to keep from gaining weight . Practically all fruits have low calorie values and give a pleasant ending to a meal . // A fruit salad is low in calories unless it is smothered with whipped cream . In several cities in North America in the past few years an undue number of babies have developed scurvy . Human milk contains ascorbic acid and the amount supplied by breast milk is generally sufficient to prevent scurvy in the baby . Feeding formulas made from cows ' milk will not contain sufficient ascorbic acid to prevent scurvy , and babies fed such formulas need a special supply of ascorbic acid . The easiest and the most sensible way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount necessary to prevent scurvy is two ounces a day . Most babies tolerate orange juice without trouble if it is started slowly in small amounts . The orange juice habit is a good one to start because it is one which should be continued through life . Ascorbic acid can be obtained in tablets or in various vitamin products . It seems silly to start a baby on a habit of obtaining this essential vitamin from vitamin products when it is easily obtainable from foods . It is much better to start habits which can and which should be continued to old age . Many fruits have values in addition to ascorbic acid . Fruits are likely to contain cellulose . This substance is a complicated relative of starch . Unlike starch , cellulose can not be digested by humans . Since cellulose is not digested , it supplies bulk in the intestines . Hence fruits , and vegetables , which contain cellulose have a laxative effect . This is another good reason for the generous use of fruits , especially by older people . Fruits , particularly acid ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people refuse to believe . There is a notion that acid fruits like oranges and grapefruit increase the amount of acid in the body . // The actual effect is the opposite to this notion . In the body , the fruit acids are converted to bases ( the opposite of acids ) and these bases neutralize acids from other sources . It is likely that you know elderly people who will not eat oranges or grapefruit because they are sure that the acid in the fruit increases the amount of acid in the body and consequently will either cause rheumatism or make it worse . Rheumatism , or arthritis , is not caused by the use of any particular food ; it can not be prevented or cured by using or refraining from eating any particular food . There is yet another notion about acid fruits . This notion is that we can not drink milk in the same meal with acid fruits because the acid from the fruit will curdle the milk . The digestive juice , normally found in the stomach , is more acid than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach juice is necessary for the part of digestion which takes place in the stomach . Incidentally , the acid in the stomach juice curdles the milk and that is an aid to the digestion of the protein in milk . There are a lot of very foolish notions about foods . We should attempt to get reliable information and not believe the notions . // Vegetables One of the real delights in a modern supermarket is the wide variety of fresh , frozen , and canned vegetables . It is a great pleasure to look at all the different vegetables . They are very nice to look at and they do add interest and health properties to meals ? if they are used . One of the bad features of life is the rigidity of the habits we began to form in childhood . Some of us grew up at a time and in areas where only potatoes and a few other vegetables were available from late October until the next summer . We became accustomed to eating only those few vegetables and we do not want to try vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of pleasure . What is just as important , we deprive ourselves of the healthful values of the vegetables which we will not try . In refusing to eat unaccustomed vegetables men are generally worse than women . In our city the various men 's service clubs have very similar menus for lunch-46 // eons . The vegetables can be predicted in advance : potatoes and peas , or occasionally green beans . The reason for this monotony of vegetables is that most men will not eat any others . It 's easy to trace this self-imposed restriction back to childhood . In a school lunchroom beets were served one day . Most of the children , having been brought up in an approved modern manner to express themselves , threw the beets on the floor as a protest against the effrontery of serving a new vegetable . That tells a great deal about home conditions , does n't it ? Vitamin A is needed by babies , children , and adults . We can obtain vitamin A from whole milk , from butter or margarine , and in generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do contain a related substance known as carotene . This carotene is yellow-orange and is responsible for the color of carrots , of squash and of most yellow vegetables . Carotene is also present in green vegetables , but we are not aware of it in those vegetables because the color of the carotene is masked by green . Carotene can be changed into vitamin A in the body after it is absorbed . This way of obtaining vitamin A is important and useful because most of the vegetables which contain a lot of carotene are generally cheap . It is more economical to use these vegetables and get needed vitamin A by converting the carotene into the vitamin than it is to buy the vitamin already formed in animal-source foods . Some vegetables will furnish us , in one average portion , sufficient carotene to give the vitamin A needed for a day . These vegetables are : carrots , collards , kale , squash , turnip greens , sweet potatoes , and yams . Do you notice two types in this list , yellow ( carrots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( collards , kale , turnip // greens ) ? You may have heard the advice to use yellow and green-leafed vegetables frequently . The reason for the advice is the carotene content . Unfortunately , not all green vegetables are valuable in this respect . Asparagus , peas , cabbage , tomatoes , are only moderately good with respect to carotene . This does n't mean that these vegetables are not worth eating . To go back to fruit for a moment , there is one fruit which contains a large amount of carotene . That fruit , dried apricots , could be guessed because of its color . A number of vegetables contain generous amounts of ascorbic acid . Here is a list of some which are particularly useful in supplying ascorbic acid : asparagus , broccoli , Brussels sprouts , cabbage , collards , green peppers , spinach , turnip greens . In this list , green-leafed vegetables are predominant . This is another sound reason for the advice about using yellow and green-leafed vegetables frequently . If you can not or will not use citrus fruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetables are sensibly selected and properly cooked . Several other vegetables are moderately good in supplying ascorbic acid . Two of these are important because they are used frequently . These are potatoes and tomatoes . People who eat potatoes every day can get a good deal of ascorbic acid if care is taken with cooking . If we relied on tomato juice as the only source of ascorbic acid , it would be necessary to drink twice the quantity as of orange or grapefruit juice . Some other vegetables which are moderately good sources of ascorbic acid are : beans ( snap or string ) , beets , parsnips , peas , sauerkraut , sweet potatoes , turnips . In connection with vegetables giving ascorbic acid , it // is essential to remember that this vitamin can be extracted from the vegetables into cooking water , that it can be destroyed by oxidation , and that this oxidation is stepped up by heat . Losses of ascorbic acid from vegetables can be reduced by a few precautions : 1 . Obviously , if a vegetable is not cooked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raw cabbage makes an appetizing salad , liked by most people , and most of the ascorbic acid is retained . There will be a small loss since the exposure of cut surfaces to air at room temperature does bring about some oxidation ; such loss will not be important during an hour or two . 2 . The amount of extraction and the amount of oxidation varies with the amount of surface exposed to water or to air . The amount of surface can be kept down by leaving vegetables in the largest sized pieces that can be cooked . 3 . The smaller the amount of water added for cooking , the smaller will be the extraction loss . It is better to bake vegetables than to boil them in water . Baked potatoes retain more ascorbic acid than do boiled or mashed potatoes . 4 . If vegetables are allowed to stand after cooking and are kept warm , a great deal of oxidation goes on and there can be a really significant loss of ascorbic acid . The flavor deteriorates , too . 5 . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give an appetizing product . Careful consideration of these precautions will show that procedures which reduce losses of ascorbic acid will // give more appetizing results . Drowned , overcooked vegetables are not tasty for most people . Even the appearance suffers . Some vegetables are useful as sources of other vitamins , in addition to vitamin A and ascorbic acid . Asparagus , collards , peas , potatoes , are moderately good foods in supplying thiamine and Ma ( in . These vitamins , like ' ascorbic acid , ate soluble in water and can he extracted by cooking water . The precautions suggested for the retention of ascorbic acid are useful for thiamine and niacin . Some of you will remember Pop-Eye , who ate spinach to obtain iron . Spinach is not the only vegetable which is a good source of iron . Several other green-leafed vegetables supply as much iron as does spinach . Collards and turnip greens are two such vegetables . Cabbage and cauliflower are medium sources of iron . There are at least two good health reasons for using generously a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable foods in giving carotene ( to turn into vitamin A ) , ascorbic acid , and iron . Several other vegetables are useful sources of thiamine and niacin . These are not the only health reasons for using a variety of vegetables . Let us list a few more reasons . Some vegetables , like some fruits , contain appreciable cellulose and have a laxative effect . Potatoes are economical sources of energy ? if you do n't need to cut down your energy intake to lose weight . While it is true that the proteins in vegetables are incomplete , lacking some of the essential amino acids , bean protein is nearly as good as the protein in meat . People in northern China , who have used soya beans as a main item of food , have had a good reason for doing so . Beans are often described as meat alternates and can be used if meat is // scarce , or if it is advisable to save money in buying food . New Englanders , brought up to eat baked beans , are using an economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not potatoes ) have low energy values and can be used in generous amounts when weight reduction is desired . Green-leafed vegetables , with so many other virtues , have low calorie values . The cellulose which they contain supplies bulk . We can eat a lot of these vegetables , without having too much effect on energy intake and on weight . If you are bored with this discussion of the healthful properties of vegetables , let 's get back to thinking about their pleasurable character . The variety of colors makes meals look more appealing and attractive . A plateful of food does not need to look drab . That may seem to be a poor reason for eating vegetables . There are better reasons . Vegetables have a variety of flavors and they can be cooked in a variety of ways . Vegetables can be used to make meals more interesting , more appetizing , and less monotonous . Boiled carrots are all right , but carrots do not need to be always boiled . Even if they are boiled they can be served with a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor . This is getting close to the troublesome point about vegetables . Most men , and , indeed , many women are stick-in-the-muds when it comes to trying unfamiliar vegetables . They do lose a lot of pleasure . This writer is strongly in favor of healthful and interesting meals . One dodge helpful in getting the family to try a new vegetable is to serve small portions along with a well-accepted food . This works pretty well with children ? of any age . Parents should do all they can to accustom children to a variety of foods . A variety is more likely to give all the // health values , and a variety does make life more interesting . Of course , parents know that example has a good effect , if the example is sensible . Example can have a bad effect if father refuses to try a different vegetable and ridicules it . If kale cost you your first husband , cheer up . Maybe the second will eat kale. // Meat , Fish , Fowl , and Eggs Meat is probably the most generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the United States , in Canada , and in other " have " countries are concerned . At present , people in many other areas are vegetarians , or nearly so , because they are compelled to be by a combination of scarce supplies and economic circumstances . In a few countries meat is not eaten because of religious reasons . Over a period of years many prominent persons have been vegetarians for humanitarian reasons ; George Bernard Shaw was an interesting example . It was reported that Hitler was a vegetarian ; if that was true , it could hardly have been for humanitarian reasons . Unless compelled to do without meat when it is not available or when it can not be afforded , most people like meat and eat it generously . Over a period of some years two entirely opposite questions have arisen regarding the eating of meat . It has 53 // been claimed that meat has harmful effects ( some presentday vegetarians say so ) . The opposite contention is that meat should be eaten generously and that we might be better off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables and cereal products . These two opposite arguments have been advanced for years and are still being advanced , vigorously so by a few people . Under the circumstances the only sensible thing to do is to consider the evidence , preferably that of a scientific and not hearsay nature . The composition of various kinds of meat , of fish , and of fowl and the nutritive qualities of these foods are , in the main , very similar . True , there are some differences but they are insignificant in respect to whether or not these foods should be eaten and with regard to suitable amounts . For practical purposes we shall lump all of these foods together for the time being and refer to all of them as meat . In the next few paragraphs , this word will be used to cover various kinds of meat from animals , and fish and fowl will be included . The two main constituents of meat are protein and fat . Water is , of course , also present but it will be ignored in the present discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat to another . An average figure for protein content is twenty per cent of the total weight , but the amount of protein in various kinds of meat may range from ten to twenty-eight or even thirty per cent . All the different proteins in meat are complete and of high-nutritive value with the exception of gelatin , which is an incomplete protein . The principal value of meat , in meeting nutrition needs , is in supplying high-quality protein . The proportion of fat in meat is highly variable . We tend to think of fat in meat in // terms of what we see . In addition to the visible fat , there is likely to be considerable invisible fat , even in lean meat . Beef tongue has little or no visible fat yet it contains about twenty-three per cent fat . Lean beef liver has about sixteen per cent fat . The white meat of poultry contains comparatively little fat . Some commonly used fish have a low content of fat ; others contain a great deal . Canned salmon may have ten to twenty per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a considerable bearing on tenderness and palatability ; meat low in fat is likely to have less appetite-appeal . In the past few years , people have been urged to use less fat because of the alleged , but unproved , effect of fat intake on the development of one or more kinds of heart disease . The increasing emphasis on the desirability of staying slim has induced many people to go easy on fat . For these reasons there have been developments in the production and use of meats having less fat . Time will tell whether these developments are a good idea . It is obvious that meat is an excellent source of highquality protein . Meat is , also , an excellent source of iron but it is a poor source of calcium . If we use milk and cheese in suitable amounts , we will not need to worry about meat not providing calcium . Some meats are excellent sources of vitamin A ; this is true of liver . Muscle meats ( the kind most often eaten ) contain much less vitamin A. Practically all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liver contains considerable riboflavin ; most other meat could not be classed as an excellent source of this vitamin . In addition to a very popular palatability and excellent nutritive value , meat has at least one other virtue . Meat contains some substances which are soluble in // water and which are easily extracted . These substances are called extractives . They help to give meat its distinctive flavor and they have another effect not always recognized . These extractives stimulate the flow of gastric juice and may increase appetite . Cubes made by concentrating beef extracts have been sold for many years . The impression used to be given that " beef tea " or bouillon made from these cubes was highly nutritious and excellent for invalids . It may contain some iron and some vitamins , but it is not a good way to obtain protein . How much meat should people eat ? A sensible recommendation is one average-sized serving of meat , fish , or fowl a day . This amount , along with suitable quantities of other good foods , will ensure sufficient protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than is currently used by a considerable number of people in the United States , in Canada , and in Britain . It is more than is available in many areas in Africa and in Asia . Is a generous intake of meat harmful ? Some of our vegetarian friends claim that the eating of meat has bad effects because it overworks the liver and kidneys . There is no scientific evidence that the liberal use of meat is harmful , at least in reasonably normal people . There is a large amount of evidence from human experience that the generous use of meat is not harmful . Should we eat meat in very large amounts ? Two main arguments are being used in attempts to have people eat larger amounts of meat . One argument has been advanced by Stefansson , the Arctic explorer , and it has been taken up by others . To put the contention in simple terms , it is stated that Eskimos under primitive conditions , before they were " ruined " by contact with white men , lived entirely on meat and fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given , perhaps unintentionally , that the Eskimos had sufficient sense to decide to live on meat and fish of their own accord . I have not yet seen it made clear that the Eskimos had to live on meat and fish ; they could n't help themselves . Just try to grow wheat , or apples , or potatoes in the Arctic . There were n't any supermarkets , even in driving distance . The question can be asked , but of course not answered , what sort of meals would primitive Eskimos have had , if foods other than meat and fish had been available ? A partial answer can be attempted because , now that the Eskimos have been " ruined , " they are using other foods . The claim is made that the level of health has markedly deteriorated . Unfortunately , there is very little sound information available about the health of Eskimos of fifty years ago . One point seems fairly clear : Eskimo men lived a very hazardous life and were likely to die fairly early in life because of accidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because life for them was much less hazardous . The claim is made that men who have tried living on meat alone while remaining in " civilized " areas remained in health , or even showed improved health . There is evidence , however , that attempts to maintain soldiers on meat alone had to be stopped within a short time because of adverse effects . One thing is clear : most of us can not afford , financially , to live on meat as the only food . It 's much too expensive . Another contention about the generous use of meat involves the fat content and other food fats . This contention is that a very substantial increase in the use of meat and other fats is a good way to lose weight . This contention will be discussed in Chapter 12 . One aspect // can be pointed out : it is likely that people who have a very large proportion of fat in their meals may eat less food . Despite the high energy value of fat , the reduction in food intake may be so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in weight . One of the problems related to the amount of meat which should be eaten is the high cost of meat . When there is a limited amount of money available for food , and for other necessities , it is advisable to get the most value possible . From the viewpoint of personal pleasure and of current habits , many people tend to spend a lot of money on meat , leaving less than suitable amounts for buying other foods . From the aspect of health , a variety of foods is advisable . When money is scarce , people should not spend more than one-fifth of the total food budget on meat , fish , and fowl . They should spend as much for milk and cheese as for meat , fish , and fowl , and an equal proportion should be used for the purchase of fruit and vegetables . This is not an argument for vegetarianism ; it is intended as an argument for sensible food purchasing . The major reason for the expensiveness of meat ( excluding fish ) is not the profit made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by the butcher . Beef , pork , mutton , and poultry can never be produced cheaply because the production of meat is wasteful and expensive . Only about ten per cent of the food value of grain fed to meat-yielding animals is present in the meat as finally eaten by humans . If the grain were eaten directly , the human consumer would receive all of the grain 's value . The high cost of meat can be explained in another way : if land is used to produce grain or vegetables to serve directly as human food , about eight times // as much can be produced as when the crops are fed to animals to yield meat for human consumption . The high standard of living , with plenty of meat , is a wasteful business in so far as land is concerned . It 's no wonder that meat is an expensive food . In Britain , in most parts of the United States , and in Canada beef is generally the most popular meat . The proportion of beef to pork depends to a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada mutton is not popular ; it is used to a much greater extent in several other countries . Chicken and turkey were eaten some years ago on festive occasions . The eating of chicken and turkey has become much more general in recent years . While the various kinds of meat , of fish , and of poultry can be grouped together for a general discussion of their value , there are some separate characteristics which should be mentioned : Beef and veal : Veal is the meat from young calves ; by law calves may not be slaughtered for use as meat until they are over three weeks old . There is an old story that veal is not as digestible as mature beef , but there is no evidence to support the notion . Baby beef from yearling cattle ( about one year old ) has become popular recently . Lean veal or beef is a very satisfactory source of protein . Pork : While a considerable amount of fresh pork is used as chops or roasts , there is a larger consumption of cured ham and bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fat scattered through the lean ; for this reason pork is said to be less digestible than beef . This is probably true for people who have difficulty with fatty foods . Many of us can eat pork without difficulty , provided it is well cooked . Pork is noteworthy for con60 Foods Without Fads taming a large amount of thiamine . Two pork chops will supply sufficient thiamine to meet the day 's need of an average man . Mutton and lamb : Lamb will be eaten with relish by many people in the United States and in Canada but they will refuse mutton . This is largely a question of habit . In other countries mutton is regarded as highly desirable meat . In nutritive value it resembles beef . Poultry : The quality of the protein in poultry is as good as that in beef or pork . The contributions of iron and of vitamins are also about the same . White meat of chicken and of turkey is low in fat . There is a notion that dark meat may be harmful to people who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can not be substantiated . The only real reason for a choice of white or dark meat is a matter of personal choice or habit . In recent years chickens have been raised by mass production methods and have become about as economical as most beef . Fish : Modern methods of quick-freezing and of treatment with an antibiotic substance to prevent bacterial spoilage along with modern methods of shipping , have enabled us to enjoy fish the year round and in areas far removed from lakes or ocean . Canned salmon , canned tuna , and canned sardines are generally popular . Fish is just as good as beef or pork from the viewpoint of health values and is often cheaper . Good quality crabmeat and shrimps have become much more generally available and much more popular . They do add interesting variety to meals . Several other sea foods , like oysters and lobsters , are widely thought of as luxuries . They may be so from the standpoint of cost , but what delectable luxuries they are . // There was a remark above about the digestibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowl are thoroughly digested without difficulty by most people . Shortly after slaughter , beef is tough and not easily digested . If allowed to " hang , " beef becomes more tender and more digestible . Cooking has an effect on the digestibility of meat . Rare beef is not as digestible as moderately done beef , and prolonged cooking can lessen digestibility . There can be some destruction of vitamins in meat during cooking ; destruction is least when meat is cooked at high temperature for short periods . Roasting is likely to cause more destruction of the vitamin content than frying or broiling . A problem frequently encountered in feeding older people is a meager intake of meat . Various reasons for the small intake of meat may exist . Some older people are convinced that meat is harmful . Dentures which fitted nicely when they were made may no longer fit , and chewing may be really difficult . Some senile people will no longer use dentures and may take them out and hide them , or just put them in handbag or pockets . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minced or finely cut-up form . Older people , living alone , may have very poor meals for a variety of reasons . It is n't much fun to cook for one person . If the person is living in a single room , cooking equipment may be pretty sparse . Buying food for one person can be an expensive business . Some years ago the eating of eggs became a controversial subject . The reason : Eggs contain considerable cholesterol , a substance normally present in many parts of the human body and always present in the blood , where it serves useful purposes . The deposits which form in the blood vessels in atherosclerosis contain a // great deal of cholesterol . These deposits hinder the flow of blood and may have something to do with the formation of the clot which causes stoppage in blood flow ( this is what happens in the type of heart disease called coronary thrombosis ) . It was thought that the development of the deposits in the blood vessels would be speeded up if the amount of cholesterol in the blood were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration of cholesterol in the blood depended on the amount of cholesterol in eaten food . Hence , the eating of eggs was considered to be harmful . The difficulty is that the amount of cholesterol in the blood is influenced only to a very limited extent by the amount of cholesterol in the food . The body can , and does , make cholesterol from starch and sugar , and the amount thus made varies inversely with the cholesterol intake in food . There is no sound reason for not eating eggs unless the individual happens to be one of those rare persons who is allergic to egg protein . As a matter of fact , eggs are a very desirable food not only because they are palatable but because of what they contain . Eggs are an excellent source of high-quality protein , just as valuable as the protein of meat , fish , or fowl . Eggs contain considerable thiamine , riboflavin , and niacin , and indeed several other vitamins . The iron supplied by eggs is a substantial amount , in comparison with a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eating eggs and there is no sound reason for not eating eggs , except that of allergy . Most people do n't need to worry about that . We should have at least three eggs a week , and an egg every day is a good idea . Eggs are easily digested . Eggs make a very good alternative for meat . Eggs are acceptable to most vegetarians. // Grain Products : Bread , Breakfast Cereals , Corn Meal , Rice From an international viewpoint of feeding the world 's population , grains and products made from them are the most important foods . They are economical because the yield of human food per acre is much greater than is the case for meat , milk , eggs , and a number of other foods . Those of us who are able to have liberal supplies of meat , milk , eggs , fruits , and vegetables have difficulty in understanding that grain is the main food of a large section of the world 's population and that even it may be scarce . Those of us who use wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our view is so narrow that we do n't see why rice is the main food for about half the population of the world . We even think people who eat rice as the principal food must be queer . We do not realize that rice is eaten in many 63 // areas because it is the grain which can be grown in these areas . If we are interested in disposing of surplus storage of wheat , we think that people who have eaten rice for many generations should give up rice and eat our wheat . It never occurs to us that people who we think should cat wheat may not have facilities for milling wheat or for baking bread . We are sure that people who will not help us to get rid of wheat must be queer . Perhaps you have heard , as I have , a statement by a traveling evangelist that we should be Christian and help rice-eating peoples by giving them wheat . It might be more Christian to try to understand the viewpoint and the habits of rice-eating peoples . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for food . Corn ( or maize ) can be grown to advantage in some areas and hence it is popular in them . Rye is used by many people in Central Europe . Other grains , like millet , are used in certain districts because they will grow under the local conditions . The grain seeds which are used for food contain three main parts . On the outside are several layers of bran , a hard , outer , protective coating which contains considerable cellulose . This bran coat is likely to contain thiamine , other vitamins , iron , phosphorus , and , sometimes , some calcium . The cellulose in bran gives it laxative properties , but bran can be irritating in some young children and in some elderly people . Bran should not be eaten as a laxative unless it is known not to cause irritation in the particular individual . At one end of the seed is the young plant or germ . The germ contains an oil which generally has dissolved in it , appreciable amounts of vitamin E ( of value to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carotene. // The germ is likely , also , to be a good source of thiamine , other vitamins , iron , and phosphorus . The main part of the seed , called the endosperm , contains starch and protein , designed by nature to nourish the young plant as it grows . The protein is not high-quality protein and generally lacks one or more of the essential amino acids . In the germ there is a smaller amount of better quality protein . When grains are prepared for human food , the bran and germ are commonly removed , no matter which grain is used . The endosperm , eaten by humans , is a very economical source of starch and incomplete protein , but it is not a good source of vitamins , or of nutrients like iron and phosphorus . In 1918 a committee of the Royal Society of Britain reported that , if ninety per cent of wheat were used by humans in place of eighty per cent , people would receive thirty-four pounds of additional protein and nearly three hundred thousand additional calories from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional quantities of vitamins , of iron , and of other nutrients . The use of an increased proportion of wheat would result in dark flour , which is not popular . While greater nutritive value and more economy would result from the eating of the whole grain , there are some practical points to consider . Whole grains and whole grain products ( whole wheat flour , for example ) do not keep as well during storage as do refined products ( such as white flour ) . Whole grain products are not digested as thoroughly as refined products , and the contained bran may be an irritant in the intestines of some people . We should face the fact , also , that a great many people do not like and will not eat whole grain foods ; // this is as true of rice as it is of wheat . Those of us who have liberal intakes of meat , milk , and eggs , do not need to be concerned about the nutritive value of bread . In areas in which grain is the main food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great importance . It is of advantage to consider briefly the nutritive value and the usefulness of various grains and of foods made from them . Wheat Most of the people in the United States , in Canada , in Britain , and in several European countries regard wheat as the food grain . Bread , made from wheat flour , has been in use for many centuries , and it has been labeled the staff of life . In recent years , the consumption of bread has decreased ; it is not as important a food as it used to be . There are various kinds of wheat and the composition is not entirely uniform . On the average wheat contains about seventy-five per cent starch , about twelve per cent protein , and about two per cent oil or fat . Hard wheats contain somewhat more protein than soft wheats and are more useful for bread-making . Durum wheat has more protein than either hard or soft wheat and is used for the production of macaroni and spaghetti . The grains of wheat contain the three main parts described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ , and endosperm have been noted . To produce flour , wheat kernels are ground and the ground material sieved . Authentic whole wheat or graham flour contains the entire kernels and hence the full nutritive value of the kernels . Whole wheat flour is brown , has a characteristic flavor . White flour ( to produce white // bread ) became fashionable in the nineteeth century and white bread became the acceptable kind . The bran and germ are removed in the production of white flour and , with them , a considerable portion of the nutritive value of whole wheat . In recent years , factory-made vitamins have become available at such low cost that three vitamins can be added to white flour to counterbalance some of the losses brought about in milling flour , Flour with added vitamins is called " enriched . " A more accurate name would be " partially restored , " since not all milling losses are made good . Over a period of some years there was considerable excitement about the nutritive value of white bread . People were urged to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some human ills are caused by eating white bread instead of whole wheat . Admittedly , the nutritive value of authentic whole wheat bread is greater than that of white bread , even when enriched flour is used . The consumption of bread has declined ; it is now used to a fairly small extent by many people . These people are eating generous quantities of meat and eggs . To them the nutritive value of bread is of slight importance . Bread is an economical source of starch and hence of energy . The protein in bread is obtained cheaply in comparison with protein from meat and eggs . True , the bread protein is not complete and does lack some essential amino acids . The incompleteness can be taken care of by eating proteins which supply the missing amino acids . Proteins from meat , milk , and eggs have this effect . Bread-and-milk is a good food . In modern society bread has one very real advantage ; it can be used to make sandwiches . A lot can be said in praise of a good ham sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one fell swoop we obtain an economical source of energy and a good source of protein , if a decent amount of ham or cheese has been put into the sandwich . As a consequence of economic prosperity and also because of an increasing emphasis on getting weight down , bread has become an unfashionable food for many persons in the United States and Canada . We have money available to buy extravagant cars and extravagant foods . No wonder people in the underdeveloped countries envy us . There is still a good argument for bread and a sensible bit of advice is to eat four or more slices of bread a day , unless we are engaged in rapid weight reduction . Of course , wheat is used in foods other than bread . Some of these with flour as a major ingredient are pretty well akin to bread . Personally , I like hot biscuits , especially homemade ones . Perhaps you are familiar with cooking in the Southern states and know all about the kind of hot biscuits I mean . Macaroni , spagetti , vermicelli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high content of protein necessary to give body to these foods . These foods are economical and can be made not only tasty but nutritious by adding generous quantities of cheese and meat . 1 favor a mixture of macaroni , milk and a lot of cheese . That mixture is a cheap source of many nutrients . In addition it has a grand flavor . I do not own stock in any macaroni company or in any dairy or cheese company but I do like good food , especially when it is also economical . Corn The use of corn for human food has been both damned and praised . This grain is called maize in Britain , in // which country corn is a name for wheat . Corn is a very important crop in the United States but not for direct use as food for humans . The main use of corn is to feed to farm animals . Most of the corn raised in the United States is turned into beef , pork , eggs , and milk . Like other grains , a kernel of corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , not by milling as in the case of wheat , but by soaking . The germ of corn contains about thirty per cent oil which is separated and sold as corn oil . Corn endosperm has about the same proportion of protein as does wheat endosperm . Corn protein is more incomplete than wheat protein . When whole corn is softened by steaming , the hulls removed , and the germ loosened in a hulling machine , the horny , starchy part of the kernel is left in coarse pieces . This is called " hominy . " Hominy is ground to make " grits . " Hominy and grits are popular foods in the Southern states . Corn meal can be made by grinding the entire kernel to give old-style corn meal , or by grinding the endosperm to make new-style corn meal . Corn meal can be used to make a number of very appetizing foods ( corn bread , spoon bread , corn-meal mush or porridge , to name a few common ones ) . Corn has been praised because it is an economical food with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn as a " vegetable " should not be overlooked . Corn-on-the-cob is a very pleasant food , at least for people in North America . Canned corn and frozen corn are useful " vegetables . " In many areas corn is a prolific crop providing an economical food . The Mexican tortilla , made from corn , is the bread of many families in that country . Corn has been damned because of its relation to // pellagra . Its prevalence was so often associated with reliance on corn as the main food that pellagra was labeled the " corn-eater 's disease . " Pellagra is caused by a lack of the vitamin , niacin . This vitamin is supplied by meat , eggs , and some other foods . The corn-eaters who developed pellagra had small intakes of foods which are excellent sources of niacin . The body can obtain niacin pre-formed in certain foods and in another , indirect way . One of the amino acids , tryptophane , can be turned into niacin in the body . Corn contains very little niacin and little or no tryptophane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals lacked both niacin and its precursor , tryptophane . The deficiencies of corn are of minor importance if meat and eggs are available and are eaten . Pellagra disappeared from the Southern states because improvement in economic conditions made possible the more generous use of meat and other foods which supply both niacin and tryptophane . Rye This grain is hardier than wheat and can be grown in Northern Europe where wheat can not be raised . The food value of rye is very similar to that of wheat . Rye bread is , of course , a staple food in countries in which rye is grown as the principal grain and rye bread has become very popular in the United States and in Canada in recent years , especially with salami or with cheese . There is no sound reason for urging people who are accustomed to rye bread to replace it with wheat bread . Rice To most North Americans rice is a food to be used occasionally in place of potatoes or as a dessert , particuBread , // larly in institutions and in boardinghouses . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main food . Rice kernels have an outside husk which is removed before rice is used as food . Inside the husk but on the outside of the kernel is a brown layer of bran . If this is left on , rice is called " brown rice . " Removal of this layer of bran gives white or " polished " rice , the kind that most of us are familiar with . The bran layer contains a good deal of the vitamin , thiamine ; the endosperm ( polished rice ) has a very low content of thiamine . When people live on polished rice as the main food and foods containing thiamine are scarce , they develop a deficiency of thiamine . The resultant disease is beriberi . Brown rice has a distinctive flavor , not liked by people who have been accustomed to polished rice . Moreover , brown rice deteriorates more quickly in storage . Thiamine can be added to white rice and trials of such treated rice have shown that its use can prevent beriberi . Breakfast Cereals Scottish people reading the previous part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made of oats . This grain is used mainly as a breakfast cereal and this food has many virtues . Oatmeal or oat flakes have a good content of thiamine , of iron , and of several other nutrients . Oatmeal porridge is a healthful , tasty , and economical food . A wide variety of breakfast cereals is available . Many different prepared ones can be purchased , with or without space-ships or other premiums . They are not identical in nutritive value or in cost . Breakfast cereals can be divided into two main groups : ( 1 ) Those with the nutritive value of whole grains , such as oatmeal or oat // flakes , wheat flakes , shredded wheat ; ( 2 ) those having less nutritive value than whole grains . A good example is corn flakes . Corn flakes are made by rolling thin the softened endosperm of corn and toasting the thin flakes . Many of the prepared cereals in the United States have added vitamins . Prepared cereals are likely to be much more expensive than those which arc bought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of thiamine and of iron , and they arc cheap . Bran breakfast foods are often used to combat constipation . The safe thing to do is to see your doctor to find the cause of the constipation . Bran may be irritating to the intestinal tract of young children and of elderly people and should be used with care . Other cereals may be used for breakfast . I realize that corn-meal mush does not have as much nutritive value as oatmeal but I like it occasionally for variety . By the way , variety is a good idea even in breakfast . We do n't need to have the same food every morning . Breakfast cereals provide intriguing examples of silly advertising . A sedentary person , like a professor , can not be turned into a champion athlete , or any kind of an athlete , by eating a particular cereal . Recently , people have been urged to eat a special cereal to obtain protein . One ounce of the cereal in question ( an average serving ) contains about as much protein as four ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it is complete ; the protein in the cereal is incomplete . Pops and crackles may be entertaining but they do not add to the health value of breakfast . The old motto , Let the buyer beware , is useful to remember when shopping for breakfast cereals . // Sweet Foods : Nice to Eat , but People in the United States and in Canada eat about one quarter of a pound of sugar per day . Sugar is a cheap food but it is not eaten primarily as a food . It provides the most universally used flavor . Whether it is a flavor or not , the average per capita consumption of sugar provides about five hundred calories a day ? and nothing else . Refined sugar is purified carbohydrate . It is a source of energy and as such is useful . But sugar has no other real nutritive value . Energy can be obtained from a variety of foods and many of these will supply protein , vitamins and various nutrient elements . Ordinarily , we do not eat sugar by itself . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar is put into tea or coffee , it is used to sweeten candy and ice cream , and it is added , again for sweetening purposes , to cake , pie , a variety of desserts , and also to or with breakfast cereals . It is a main ingredient in soft drinks . 73 // Sweet foods have an advantage which has been recognized for many years . They give a feeling of satisfaction . This is the reason for ending a meal with a sweet dessert . Sweet foods contribute sugar to the blood quickly and the increase in the amount of sugar in the blood lessens or stops hunger . This effect can be of value to people who are on reducing diets . Meals in reducing diets may be pretty meager . A dessert with some sugar and yet not too high in calories can provide some satisfaction . However , the satisfaction value of sweet foods can be unfortunate , particularly in the case of children . If sweet foods are eaten shortly before a meal , hunger for the meal can be reduced so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the reason why it is unwise to give sweet food to children in the hour before a meal . It might be better to say it is one reason , since there is another . There is a great concern about the terrific amount of tooth decay . The reasons for the prevalence of tooth decay are not completely clear but there is a good deal of sound information which should be known to parents and to children . Tooth decay is caused by an attack on tooth enamel by acid . The acid is produced by bacteria living in the mouth . The bacteria produce the acid from starch and sugar used for food by the bacteria . If starch and sugar are close to the surface of the tooth , the acid which the bacteria produce is handily located to attack and dissolve the structure of the tooth . A number of things can be done to prevent the formation of the acid or to lessen its effect . If we could prevent bacteria from living in the mouth , the problem of tooth decay would disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is obvious that keeping starch and sugar // from sticking to teeth or remaining between the teeth would help greatly . It is hence obvious that the teeth should be cleaned and the mouth rinsed shortly after eating . This practice should be taught to children at an early age and should be encouraged so that it becomes a persistent habit . Another very useful procedure for help ing to prevent tooth decay is to reduce the amount of sugar-containing foods given to children . During the Second World War sugar was scarce in Britain and in most European countries and sugar was rationed so severely that its consumption was greatly reduced . In those countries tooth decay was sharply decreased . There is a large amount of evidence that a reduction in the use of sweet foods by children helps to lessen tooth de cay . It has been said that children must have a need for sugar in their bodies because they crave it . They are not born with that craving ; it is created by unwise feed ing . Sticky candy is particularly bad because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium for the formation of bones and teeth . The milk does not have to be flavored with chocolate and sugar . Breakfast cereal does not need to be flavored with sugar . Tooth decay can be decreased in another obvious way by bringing about the formation of teeth which are harder and more resistant to the attack by acids . Four nutrients are needed for the formation of teeth : calcium , phosphorus , vitamin D , and ascorbic acid . The forma tion of teeth starts before the baby is born . Children will have stronger and better formed teeth if supplies of these nutrients are available to the mother in the four months before the baby is born and to children until all the second teeth have erupted . These nutrients are not provided by cake , pastry , candy , and soft drinks . Calcium // is furnished by milk , phosphorus by milk and a number of other foods , ascorbic acid by fruits and vegetables ( especially citrus fruit ) . In recent years it has been proved that harder and more resistant teeth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luring the period of tooth formation . In a few districts there is sufficient fluorine in the soil to contribute fluorine to water in an amount adequate for the formation of resistant teeth . In such areas there is much less tooth decay . Fluorine can be added to community water supplies . Tests of the procedure have shown that a very marked reduction in tooth decay is the result . The fluoridation of water supplies has been opposed and one of the arguments is that fluorine is poisonous . Sodium fluoride ( a compound used to raise the fluorine content of water ) is called " rat poison . " It is true that sodium fluoride can be used to kill rats and other pests . In the amount used in fluoridated water , sodium fluoride is harmless ; it is even beneficial . A large dose of caffeine ( the stimulant in tea and coffee ) will cause death but a great number of people drink tea and coffee . Many other examples could be given of substances which are harmless in small amounts and lethal in large amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportions which reduce tooth decay have been very thoroughly investigated in several countries . These studies have proved that fluoridation of water is harmless and that it is beneficial . There is only one catch to the fluoridation of water supplies . What about farm children ? A safe method for supplying fluorine to children living in areas not having community water supplies is needed . Parents who wish their children to have strong , healthy Sweet Foods : Nice to Eat , but ? 77 teeth protected against decay should do these things . 1 . See that mother has good intakes of calcium , phosphorus , vitamin D and ascorbic acid during the second half of pregnancy . Such intakes can be assured by the mother taking 11/2 pints of milk a day , citrus fruit or juice once a day , 400 units of vitamin D a day . 2 . Do not encourage children to want sweet foods . The use of cake , pie , candy and soft drinks should not be encouraged but should be discouraged . 3 . Help children to develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth if cleaning is not possible . 4 . Support the fluoridation of water supplies . Tooth decay is far too prevalent . We can all help to prevent it . There is another aspect to the use of sweet foods . It is true that they do furnish energy , that sugar is cheap , that sweet foods at the end of a meal give a feeling of satisfaction . It is true , also , that sweet foods are not good buys from the viewpoint of meeting needs for various nutrients . Milk , cheese , fruits , vegetables , eggs , are much better buys in the long run . When there is need to economize in food purchases , it is sensible to get the most value possible . Cake , pastry , candy , soft drinks , are not economical . Buying them wastes money which could be better spent . A rather prevalent illusion about many soft drinks is that they do not contain much sugar and are low in calories . Teen-age girls will refuse to drink milk but will use soft drinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , many soft drinks contain // more sugar than might be suspected . A serving of eight ounces of a popular drink contains one ounce of sugar and has a calorie value of 100 . This is the same number of calories provided by eight ounces of orange juice , which is an excellent source of ascorbic acid and other essential nutrients not present in the soft drink . It should be noted that eight ounces of skim milk , containing calcium , riboflavin , and high-quality protein , has a calorie value of 87 . If you want to think about the costs of foods , try comparing the cost of skim milk , orange juice , and a popular soft drink . In the city in which this is written and at the time of writing , skim milk delivered to the house in quart bottles is one-half the cost per ounce of the soft drink in question bought in a carton of six eight-ounce bottles ( if the bottles are returned and the deposit collected ) . It 's a good plan to get your money 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing weight and in staying slim , you had better know the calorie value of some commonly used sweet foods , especially when the small contributions of other nutrient values is remembered . Here are the energy values of some frequently eaten sweet foods : Table These few calorie values carry a moral : These foods , and others like them , must be avoided if you are concerned with losing weight or if you are anxious to stay slim . Sweets are a cause of obesity. // In recent years spurious claims have been made for several sweet foods . Blackstrap or crude , dark molasses has been claimed to prevent or cure arthritis and a variety of other diseases . The molasses story seems to have been started by a pianist , and pamphlets , said to have been written by this pianist , were circulated from stores selling " health foods . " There should be question marks after both " health " and " foods " ? those shops are made possible by gullibility and ignorance . The molasses story was widely touted by Gayelord Hauser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the B vitamins . So do many other foods . Crude molasses has no special virtue . At the peak of the craze for molasses , a drug firm seeking to sell molasses without committing fraud , put out bottles of molasses labeled : " This molasses is good for any condition for which molasses is beneficial . " There 's a really truthful claim . The expression , " quick energy , " is used frequently in advertisements for certain syrups and breakfast cereals . The meaning is doubtful but the impression is given that the use of these foods will give people a lift in a few minutes . Solutions of sugar are quickly digested and absorbed , but whether that will produce suddenly a feeling of elation and a capacity for doing work or exercise is not so clear . This expression is a kind of half-truth intended to give a false impression of the value of a specific product . Despite the prevalence of the " sweet tooth " possessed by many people , and despite the feeling of satisfaction provided by sweet foods , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sweet foods and using foods which give better value . Fruit is satisfactory for dessert and is preferable to a food which supplies only starch and sugar , as is the case with puddings . // Good Meals for Health , Pleasure , and Economy Many people have the notion that the selection of foods to meet health needs makes meals unpalatable and that eating for health is a kind of penance . That notion is so false that it needs to be dispelled . Meals should be enjoyed . They should be pleasant interludes in life . What sort of meals should we have ? In Chapter 3 the needs of the body were discussed and in six subsequent chapters various kinds of foods were described in relation to meeting needs . Let 's summarize those needs : 1 . We need food to supply energy to keep the body warm , to enable life to continue , to give growth . 2 . We need protein for growth and to maintain the body . 80 // 3 . We need calcium , phosphorus , vitamin D , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calcium , phosphorus , and ascorbic acid are needed throughout life . Adults , except pregnant women , do not need vitamin D. 4 . We need iron to maintain the blood in a healthy state . Do n't worry about " tired " blood ? whatever that is . We need iodine for the work of the thyroid gland . 5 . We need a number of vitamins for normal functions in the body . All of these needs , except for vitamin D , can be satisfied by eating commonly available foods . To meet these needs , we should use the following foods : Milk : At least one half pint a day for adults . At least one pint a day for children ( up to 10-12 years ) . At least 11/2 pints a day for teen-agers , for expectant and nursing mothers . Milk contains high-quality protein , calcium and riboflavin . Fruit : At least one serving of fruit a day plus one serving of oranges , grapefruit , orange juice , or grapefruit juice . Fruit , particularly citrus fruit , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one serving of potatoes a day and two servings of other vegetables a day . Vegetables supply ascorbic acid , iron , vitamin A , and other nutrients . Green-leaf and yellow vegetables are cheap sources of vitamin A. Meat , Fish , Fowl : At least one serving of meat , or fish , // or fowl a day . These foods give high-quality protein , thiamine , niacin , iron . Bread and Cereals : Four slices of bread a day ? or more , if needed . One serving of breakfast cereal having wholegrain value . Bread and breakfast cereals are cheap sources of energy , of thiamine , riboflavin , niacin and , in some cases , iron . Eggs : At least 3 eggs a week , because eggs contain highquality protein , iron , thiamine , riboflavin , and niacin . Cheese : At least 3 servings ( an ounce or more ) a week since cheese is a cheap source of high-quality protein and of calcium . Vitamin D : Children , teen-agers , expectant mothers ( in the second half of pregnancy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount is not needed . Vitamin D is added to evaporated milk and can be obtained from drug preparations . The quantities of foods specified above are for normal persons of " ideal " or less than ideal weight . The total quantities , as advised for adults , will give 1700-1800 calories a day . If you need a greater supply of calories you can use larger servings . Three meals a day has been the custom for most people for many years . These meals may be breakfast , lunch , and dinner , or breakfast , dinner , and supper , depending on which arrangement is convenient . Social prestige frequently enters into the matter and some people think it is more elegant to have dinner in the evening . Changes in the character of meals have occurred in recent years and some of the changes are undesirable . Forty years ago meals were family affairs and they could be eaten // leisurely . In recent years this pattern has been altered , at least in cities and suburbs , to gobbling hurriedly prepared food placed on counters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " eating areas . " Cooking is no longer a fine art , to be cherished and passed on to daughters . What is the use of bothering about cooking ? Anyway , we just have to heat up prepared and packaged foods which have no distinctive flavor so they must be covered with catsup ( or ketchup , if you prefer ) . A lot of people seem to have lost their sense of taste . I am in favor of home-cooked meals , nicely served , eaten leisurely with conversation with the family around the table . This is awfully old-fashioned , is n't it ? It can be done if there is any interest in a good life . The prevalent meal pattern is little or no breakfast , a light lunch , and a heavy dinner . Most people would feel better , physically and mentally , if the total amount were divided more evenly and if meals were pleasant and more leisurely . We hurry like mad to get somewhere ? what do we do when we get there ? Breakfast is the meal most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , we need a decent breakfast . It is worth while to get up fifteen to twenty minutes earlier and have breakfast . Why leave home in such a frightful rush ? It 's a great advantage to health and to peace of mind to get up a bit earlier , dress more slowly , eat a good breakfast with the family . Choose the nearest exit ? walk ? do not run is good advice at home too . Those of us who read the comics are accustomed to Blondie handing Dagwood a cup of coffee in the hall ? poor Dagwood . Here is my idea of a good breakfast : // An orange , or half a grapefruit , or at least 4 ounces of orange or grapefruit juice . A healthy serving of porridge ( oatmeal or wheat flake ) with a lot of milk . A poached egg on toast . A cup of good coffee . A food rich in protein is advisable with breakfast . Such foods as eggs , meat , fish , or cheese are useful protein sources . Cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't tried it . You may like fish for breakfast ? so do I , but not every morning . We do n't need to have the same foods every morning . Variety for breakfast is a good plan . Citrus fruit or juice at the start is pleasant and it does whet the appetite . One of the undesirable features of European travel is the so-called Continental breakfast . For one thing it is n't enough food for a morning of moving around and where does the coffee come from ? Coffee as served in most hotels in Paris seems to have been made the night before , grounds from several days mixed in , and the mixture heated . French people may be good cooks but what about breakfast coffee ? I realize that the preparation of a good breakfast takes time . Well , it 's worth it . If breakfast has been nicely prepared , it should be savored . That ca n't be done standing up . Let 's start the day peacefully and in comfort . Dividends will be evident all morning . City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of lunch , with catsup on it , at a lunch counter is a sorry business . Is it really necessary ? One of the advantages of living on a farm or in a small town is that it is possible to go home and have a nice meal at noon . The noon // meal should be more than a hamburg on a bun or a malted milk , or even just a cup of coffee . The make-up of the main meal ( dinner ) eaten at noon will be considered presently . If the noon meal is lunch , what should it be like ? If lunch is brought from home it is likely to contain sandwiches . They should have a protein-rich filling such as cheese , meat , or eggs . A carbohydrate filling like jelly with bread is not a good combination . With the sandwiches a jar of vegetable salad is a help . Fruit , with or without cookies , is a good dessert . The beverage should be milk , or , in cold weather , cocoa made with milk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat or fish or fowl , but they should not be regarded as essential . A bowl of hearty vegetable soup , a sandwich with a cheese or meat filling , fruit and milk is a good lunch but not too substantial . Lunch should include a good source of protein and that source need not be meat . In cold weather one hot dish is pleasant and the hot dish could be macaroni and cheese ( plenty of cheese ) or even baked beans . Milk should be the beverage for lunch . If you are interested in weight loss , a salad , vegetable with some meat , or fruit is useful . Lunch can be nourishing , pleasant and restful . Taking just a bit longer for lunch instead of gulping it can make lunch a rest before the afternoon . Dinner , whether at noon or in the evening , is likely to be a substantial meal . It 's really better to spread food a little more evenly through the day . If a man comes home tired and worried , it 's a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promoting relaxation is to sit down in a comfortable chair and sip a glass of sherry or a moderate amount of alcohol in some other // form . This lowers the blood pressure , gives a feeling of comfort , and stimulates the feeling of hunger . The mainstay of dinner is likely to be meat , fish , or fowl with vegetables . Dinner can be started with soup ; if made with meat stock , soup may promote hunger . Desserts of wide varieties can be used . Extra milk can be introduced in custard or in ice cream . Fruit makes a good dessert , particularly if the person is concerned about weight . Tea or coffee may be the beverage , but for children it should be milk . Of course , it would be an advantage for children and for adults if the whole family drank milk . These recommended meal patterns are not strange and they can be appetizing and pleasant . Some of you may regard a substantial breakfast as either unobtainable or unsuitable . Try it for a while and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals than it is to purchase nonessential foods which waste money . Many families spend considerable money in buying cake , pie , candy , and soft drinks . These foods furnish energy but do not contribute appreciable protein , vitamins or other nutrients . The foods recommended above are essential because they satisfy our nutrition requirements ; they give good value for the money spent on them . A wise housewife plans meals several days or a week ahead to ensure that they are attractive and healthful . Such planning saves time and money in shopping and in meal preparation . When shopping , it should be remembered that foods in bulk packages are usually cheaper than those in small , fancy packages . The most expensive grades of canned foods are not likely to have any more nutrition value than cheaper grades . Cheaper cuts of // meat are as nutritious as more expensive ones and can be made just as palatable by proper cooking . Foods in season are a good buy because they are at their cheapest price and possess their greatest food value . Leftovers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing aid in having good meals . Meals can be made more interesting by using a greater variety of foods and even more variety in methods of cooking , as we have suggested earlier . It 's a good idea not to have a particular dish on the same day each week . Monday should not be a stew day or meatloaf day . A wide variety of meats and meat products is available . One kind of food likely to be too much restricted is vegetables . Meals can be more interesting if a wide variety of vegetables is used . If the family rebels about a new vegetable , do n't give up . Not only does variety make meals ? and life ? more interesting , variety increases the likelihood of getting needed nutrients . The palatability of meals depends largely on cooking . Cooking is an art and good cooking should be encouraged before it is forced off the scene by living in a hurry with factory-prepared , ready-to-serve foods and meals . The main reason for cookery is to make food digestible , palatable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw meat or overcooked meat . Cooked starch is more digestible than raw starch . Cooking can cause a reduction in nutritive value . Some nutrients are destroyed by oxidation and this process is accelerated by heat . Nutrients which are soluble in water can be extracted from foods when they are cooked in water . Losses in nutritive value caused by cooking can be re88 Foods Without Fads duced . Sometimes it is necessary to work out a compromise . Meat cooked slowly at low temperature is more tender and generally more tasty ; however , the prolonged exposure to heat increases destruction of thiamine , riboflavin , and niacin . It is probably better to guard the palatability and tenderness of the meat . In the case of vegetable cookery , no compromise is needed . Measures which help to conserve nutritive value also conserve appearance , taste , and general attractiveness . There is nothing worse than overcooked , drowned , brown cabbage . When vegetables are cooked in water , the smallest possible quantity of water should be used , vegetables should be left in fairly large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender enough to eat . Cooked vegetables should be served and eaten as soon as possible after they are cooked . Water should be boiling before vegetables are placed in it and the utensil should be covered . The steam-cooking of vegetables is better than cooking in water , so far as nutritive value is concerned . If you are interested in a different method of cooking cabbage , try cooking it in fat or oil . A thin layer of oil or fat on the bottom of a saucepan with the cabbage resting on it will do the trick . Foods can be selected for health and for pleasure at the same time . Meals can and should be attractive . Good cooking is of prime importance . The notion that meals will be unpleasant if we select foods to meet nutrition needs is ridiculous nonsense . The attractive meals which can be prepared from a variety of good foods will make life more pleasant , more interesting , and more healthful . It may be necessary to give up some silly notions and to change food habits a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meals for Betty and Tommy Betty and Tommy are nice children . You probably know that there are two kinds of children ; our own little angels and the neighbors ' little devils . We want Betty and Tommy to grow up normally , to be healthy , fond of exercise , and top-grade mentally . Of course , we also want them , Betty especially , to be good-looking . Let 's hope that they got off to a good start . If mother ate sensibly during the last four months before the babies were born , the babies were healthier at birth . We do hope that Betty and Tommy were breast-fed , for six months , anyway . Breast milk is the best and the safest food for babies . Incidentally , a mother who is breastfeeding her baby needs extra calcium and extra protein for the production of milk ; both nutrients can be obtained by drinking at least 11/2 pints of milk a day in addition to good meals . Even in breast-fed babies , and always in babies who are 89 // not breast-fed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need protection against scurvy and rickets . The first disease is prevented by a supply of ascorbic acid , obtained in orange juice . Rickets is prevented by a supply of /100 units a day of vitamin D. Concentrated preparations of vitamin D are available ; a few drops of a concentrated preparation placed directly into the baby 's mouth will do . The giving of both orange juice and vitamin 1 ) should be started when the baby is two weeks old . At three months of age most babies are ready for cereal in addition to milk feedings . Usually one of the many brands of precooked , infant cereal is used because of convenience . The cereal is mixed with cooked , boiled milk , feeding formula , or water to make a thin gruel . As the baby becomes older the cereal feeding can be made thicker and a greater amount fed . Milk , even breast milk , contains very little iron . When born , the baby generally contains a store of iron , sufficient for several months . By the age of five months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now common practice to give babies a variety of pureed vegetables , eggs , and finely chopped meat . These foods supply iron and other essential nutrients . Their use provides , also , an introduction to a variety of foods needed for growth and needed throughout life . By nine months of age most babies have adapted themselves to three meals a day and within a few months will be attempting to feed themselves . In the second year the rate of growth is much less than in the first year and food needs are consequently reduced . Parents may not realize this change in growth rate and in food needs . They become disturbed about the unwillingness of the child to // eat as much as they think is necessary . For this reason , feeding problems , created by parents , start to develop . Attempts to force the child to eat more food than needed leads to trouble . In this second year it is an advantage to have children eat by themselves to avoid distractions and to help them to give attention only to eating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these : Table During the second year children should not be given ice cream , candy , soft drinks , nuts , popcorn , cucumbers , corn , pastry , pickles , spices , or seasonings . Between the end of the second year and by the time the child has started to school , parents should foster and encourage by example and by tact the formation of good food habits . Some food habits can be called not only // desirable but essential for healthy growth . The daily drinking of milk and the development of a regard for milk as the beverage is an essential habit . Children are unlikely to want milk if father thinks of milk as food for babies . A highly desirable outlook toward food is a willingness to try new foods and to eat a variety . It is useful to encourage children to like the natural flavors of foods : cereal without sugar ? milk without . sugar and chocolate ? eggs without catsup . A question which is asked very frequently is , How do you get children to eat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one answer . Putting the eating of a particular food on a basis of " it 's good for you " will not only not help , but may keep the children from eating the food in question . Making food the basis of either punishment or reward is inadvisable . This is true particularly of sweet foods . The giving of candy as a reward for good behavior is a simple method of developing a sweet tooth . Badgering a youngster about the use of food gives the youngster a weapon to wield against parents . The child soon realizes that he can agree to cat something if a concession is provided in return . It is easy to see where this leads . Whether a child develops good habits depends on the attitude of the parents . To start with , we provide for children foods which are selected on a health basis . We set an example by eating those foods ourselves . We give the child the impression that he is expected to eat those foods and we are surprised if he does n't . Sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ate when they were young ? which may be quite different from modern methods of feeding children . It is never wise to make an issue of a child 's reGood // fusal to eat . Good food habits should be a matter of course . As children become older they should be given information about the reasons for sensible food selection . All too frequently this has to be done in school because many parents do n't know or do n't care . An understanding of bodily needs and how those needs are met is essential to ensure suitable choice of foods . Children should have a good breakfast before they go to school . The breakfast should be more than a hurried snack and it should include citrus fruit , or juice , cereal having whole grain value with plenty of milk , a good source of protein ( such as an egg ) , bread or toast and milk . While it is essential for children to have a suitable amount of milk , too much milk may keep youngsters from eating other needed foods . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much at the start of a meal . It 's a good plan to give not more than half a cup of milk with a meal and then let children have additional milk after the meal is eaten . It is now common practice in most areas to provide noon meals in schools . However , if lunch is taken from home , real thought should be given to its make-up . Lunch , carried or secured in school , should be attractive , appetizing , and should contain foods needed for healthy growth . The mainstay of lunch from home may be sandwiches . The filling should be an excellent source of highquality protein , such as meat , fish , poultry , eggs , or cheese . Peanut butter is fairly satisfactory ; jelly is not . Variety in sandwich fillings makes lunch more interesting . Raw vegetables in salad in a jar , or in segments , have several advantages . They provide ascorbic acid , iron and other essential nutrients , and they encourage // chewing . Fruit is much better than cake or pie . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with milk . Parents should be concerned about school meals . Menus should be based on the selection of foods to meet the needs of health . Candy , gum , and soft drinks should not be on sale in school cafeterias or lunchrooms . Kitchens should be clean , food should be properly prepared and properly cooked . If nutrition is included in health education in the school , the school meals should be the practical demonstration of classroom teaching . Children can not be expected to drink milk in a school cafeteria if the teachers , after urging milk in the classroom , drink coffee at noon in sight of the children . Adolescents generally need considerable food , and boys especially eat amounts which seem to be terrific . About the time of puberty there is a spurt in growth and this increases food needs . The real needs will not be met unless they are understood and unless foods are selected to meet the needs . Increases in height and weight are accompanied by increases in the length and thickness of bones . Consequently , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk and cheese . If Tommy , now fifteen , drinks a quart of milk a day , do n't be alarmed . He needs at least 11 pints of milk a day to supply calcium . If Betty is fourteen , she has an increased need for calcium , too . Unfortunately , she may not drink milk because she thinks milk is fattening and she is anxious to stay slim . Milk is less fattening than cake or pie , and is a needed food . Betty 's interest in keeping slim is understandable ; she wants to be attractive . This desire to stay slim can be satisfied and , indeed , encouraged . The prevention of // overweight and obesity is much easier than the cure . The main point to emphasize with Betty is that food can be selected to meet essential needs for protein , for vitamins , for calcium , and other nutrients and still not be excessive in calories . A number of suggestions can be made to Betty to help her keep slim and healthy . There are foods which she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health needs . These foods should be regarded by Betty as essential : Table These foods are essential for Betty because they can be used to give three attractive meals a day , and because they contain protein , vitamins , calcium , iron and other nutrients . The total calorie yield from these essential foods will not exceed 1,400 a day . This will not be enough for Betty 's needs and would constitute a reducing diet , bringing about a weight loss . Therefore , two other foods should be included . Betty should have at least three eggs a week , and preferably one egg a day . Betty needs iron , and eggs are a useful source . Having // one egg a day will add about one hundred calories . Cheese should be used to the extent of at least three ounces a week , particularly if Betty does not use the advised amount of milk . The calorie value of one ounce of Cheddar-type cheese is about 100 . Betty can remain slim and healthy if she uses all of these essential foods in advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does not use soft drinks . It is a big help to Betty to understand that she will be a better and healthier mother if she eats the essential foods during adolescence . She does need sympathetic and understanding guidance . Habits formed in childhood persist and become more fixed as we grow older . When we help children to form good food habits we are helping them to become healthier adults with reasonable habits . The best time to start preparing for old age is in childhood . Adult life would be more interesting and healthier if we became accustomed in childhood to liking a wide variety of foods and if we developed a willingness to try new food or even familiar foods cooked and served in new ways . There are periods in childhood when problems of food use and food habits are particularly worth watching The second year is one such period and this has beer discussed . Another time is around the age of ten oeleven . Youngsters feel that they are growing up ant : becoming adult . At this time we see all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are thought to be childish . If we want children to grow normally and to become healthy adults , we should be concerned about the development and preservation of good food habits as part of the general health picture . // We Do n't Need to Be Fat So much has been written and said about overweight in , the last few years that there may be not much left to say . On the other hand , there is still a terrific amount of confusion and misunderstanding . What follows is an attempt to set down what is known in as simple a manner as possible . First of all , what is meant by overweight ? How is overweight determined ? Various tables of weight and height in respect to age are available . Older tables and some modem ones are averages for groups of people . If , many people in the group are fat , the average for the group will be greater than if the majority of the group were thin . The expression , " normal weight , " is used to designate these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their weight exceeds the normal weight plus ten per cent . To put the thing simply : suppose you are a man aged forty and your height 97 // is 5 feet 8 inches . If you look up the height-weight table which has been in use for the past forty years you will find that the " normal " weight for men of that height and age is given as 158 pounds . If you increase that by ten per cent , you get 174 pounds . If your actual weight is 180 pounds , then you are " overweight . " There are several catches in this way of deciding if people are overweight . If you look at the old , commonly used table ( it will likely be labeled as coming from the Life Extension Institute and will be based on height and weight figures published in a report in 1912 ) , you will find that " normal weights " of men and women are shown as increasing with age . To use one example , the weights of men 5 feet 8 inches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 163 pounds at age fifty-five . That is what actually happens with most men but it is not what should happen . Not only is there no real biologic reason for increase in weight with age , but such an increase is undesirable . It happens in most people because they keep on eating as much food when they become older and less active as they did when they were young and active . It is now recognized that weight should not increase as we grow older and that we would be better if the increase did not take place . Another difficulty in using a height-weight table is that the frame of some people is heavier than the frame of other people . Some people are stocky in build and will be heavier than slim persons of the same height . This is no proof that the stocky people are overweight . In one respect it might be better not to mention this because some people who are truly overweight claim that they are stocky in build and use that as an alibi . However , differences in body build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken into account in deciding if a person is overweight . A new type of height-weight table has come into use in recent years . It was published by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1942 . Copies of the complete table are available from a number of sources . A simplified form of the table is used here . The table was prepared by considering heights and weights of people who were showing extended life expectancy . No increase in weight is regarded as desirable after twenty-five or thirty years of age . Instead of one single figure of weight for a particular height , ranges of weight for three different types of build are given ( small frame , medium frame , large frame ) . This sounds complicated and it is complicated , unfortunately . How do you know whether to say you are small or large frame ? To get away from this complication , the following simplified table is given : Table These are wide ranges in weights . If your weight is in the lower half of the range given for your height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
