DECEMBER 18 , 1965 Often , white Southerners of varying attitudes to ? ward the Negro ? from the " racial moderate " to the most blatant of racists ? say : " We understand our Ne ? groes . " This implicitly means that " we can therefore outline the responsible boundaries of their aspirations . " Couple this with the fact that they have the author ? ity and legitimacy to impose their " understanding " at all levels of their Southern way of life , and it demon ? strates a kind of racial and geographical consensus as to where and how the problems raised by the Southern civil rights struggle should be handled . Central to this consensus is that Negroes are not included except on terms defined by these people ( look at the failure of so many biracial committees , or ap ? pointed Negro " leaders , " and the concept of " white folks ' business " ) . The racial moderate feels that Negroes can not be CHARLIE COBB is working in Mississippi with the Stu ? dent Nonviolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one year . included in this consensus because they are not yet " ready , " or that immediate and across-the-board inclu ? sion of Negroes in this consensus about the shape and direction of the South , would be too disruptive to the framework of Southern society that they have already constructed . The overt racist feels that Negroes are inherently unable to move into , and function within , whatever existing construction of society they along with the racial moderate have built . Both positions deny any complete or immediate feeling of common human ? ity with the Negro and reinforce slavery by designating as illegitimate and disruptive , motion geared toward a more complete human freedom in which their control ( as expressed through the consensus they control ) would be minimized . Both positions are couched with ? in explanations as to what 's good for the " realistic " progress of the South and human freedom for the Negro . Freedom as we articulate it in this country be ? comes peculiarly absurd from this perspective of ex ? clusion and certainly very narrowly conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right ? fully yours , " on the condition that they do not take what 's rightfully white . For example , while within the narrow consensus that exists in the South in regard to the Negro there might be general agreement as to the miserable conditions of sharecroppers , the boundaries for their dealing with the problem seem laid out along two lines : The land belongs to the plantation owner , and con ? sequently sharecroppers can not decide to use the land in other ways . Strikes hurt the sharecroppers as they are not needed anyway and are kept on the land through the goodness of the plantation owner . In fact , this means that the needs of the sharecrop ? per as defined by the sharecropper , must meet the " in ? terests " of the landowners ; for consider the implica ? tions of the big landowners no longer being able to control how the land they claim to own is to be used . So , when sharecroppers strike against their miserable conditions , they usually do so within the framework of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as they move within that framework , they will be defeated . After all , the landowner does n't need them to do what he intends to do with the land ( about 30,000 workers used in the cotton fields this year , only about 8-io,000 expected to be used next year ) . Mech ? anization . The landowner is so upset at the chal ? lenge the strikers make to his " goodness , " that he ex ? pels them into an even more complex society that does n't need them either , because of what it is geared to do . What " qualifications " do the sharecroppers have ( education , economic influence , etc. ) to suggest that their needs ( making a living , not being given a sub ? sistence ) be met ? Where is their authority to command the resources that exist in this country ? Whatever au ? thority they have as human beings seems to get lost in state/national priorities and responsibilities , and they are excluded from whatever decides these , for they do not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there , a consensus in this country favorable to so ? cial progress ? Drawing from my Southern experience , part of which has been sketched out in the preceding paragraphs , the need for " social progress " seems only considered in terms of " the direction the country must go , " and as is particularly the case with the Vietnam war , most people are not considered qualified to exer ? cise any real influence over that direction . If " social progress " is now happening in terms of what the country needs , then we have to look at who in fact can determine " what the country needs . " It cer ? tainly is not the people who live geographically within the borders of something called the USA , but more a set of interests that belong to a very few . So , as in the South , where the important thing in regard to a mean ? ingful political franchise for Negroes lies in dealing with the factors that give white people the authority to teach , and enforce the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nation we have to deal with the factors that allow some people the right to define Amer ? ica for most people . For if President Johnson decides to end the war in Vietnam tomorrow ( for his reasons even if they are in response to demonstrations ) and still has the authority and legitimacy in the eyes of the peo ? ple in this country to start another one for " freedomand democracy , " we are still in trouble . How do we begin to deal with this ? Perhaps we could frame a set of general questions : What kinds of things could people decide about if they were n't afraid to decide and taught not to decide ? If people started deciding about these things , could they implement their decisions ? If not , why not ? If everybody started deciding about things that were usually decided for them , would things be done differ ? ently ? Why ? What about the people who usually decide things for people ? What do you think they would think and say and do , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why ? Raise these questions with most anybody , and he will say " we ca n't , it 's not practical , " or " we do n't know enough " ; which is exactly right from the stand ? point of what we have been taught the country has to be ; and exactly wrong in terms of any kind of real par ? ticipation by people in shaping the direction of this country . Not " practical , " for who receives all the in ? formation that the government receives about Viet ? nam ? Certainly not me , except in terms of what the government has decided is " practical " for me to know and do . What information does the government have to fill the gaps of my confusion over what moves Ne ? groes , and white racists , to fight for " freedom " in Viet ? nam , and yet fight so over " freedom " in the USA ? The government is the government , and the people of this country have been taught to be responsible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people when " practical . " Until then , the people have to be patient ( $z million a day in Vietnam ) . You know , like the Negroes and their equal rights . Other ? wise , the government will be disrupted , which would threaten the " national security , " which would put our government 's ( substitute country 's ) freedom in jeop ? ardy . I have become afraid of this concept ( and reality ) of what America is . It conflicts with what I am . I am not the government ! Because of my illegitimacy ( as far as having any influence over what the government is to do in my name ) , I am being destroyed in this conflict . And I raise in the light of that destruction : what are the implications for other people ? But then , I am black , so I may not be people . What am I to do ? Work , but I demand that it be mine . Somehow , I have to shake free enough to determine and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work that is mine , implies living a life that is mine ; a living that only I can make if it is to be mine . The living that I must do , can not be given to me in any sense , unless I am willing to accept the terms of the giver . I have found space to do that in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , and in that sense , participate in what SNCC is to be , since it is people doing work . The fact of the organization , SNCC , pro ? vides a visibility to other people doing this kind of work , which is key to sustaining me through day-to-day resistance and pressure to stop ( after all , things are opening up for " qualified Negrdes " ) . I suspect that the extension of this kind of working lies in this visibility that sustains the individual , and gives him the strength to continue to try and touch other people . Hope and change ( for people , they are intimately connected ) lie in what can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms ) , and sustained . For even as the " niggers been kept in their place , " so have peo ? ple . The V'order " of the country is based on people being taught to relinquish the right to order their own lives . The claiming of this right is disorderly ; disorder which has to be , if real order is to happen . It is pretty difficult to come out against greatness . No ? body wants to be thought small , or petty , or narrow . I would not have the nerve , therefore , to come out against the Great Society . Nevertheless , between the great and the grandiose is a hair's'breadth . It is an in ? visible boundary that can be passed over without no ? ticing it . The man or the society , however , that passes over it is on the road to destruction , for grandiosity is great ? ness without realism , without tenderness , without sen ? sitivity , and it produces a frame of mind that eventu ? ally becomes deaf to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is frighteningly close to this boundary , a Rubicon that Caesar crossed , Napo ? leon crossed , Hitler crossed , and from which there is no return save through disaster . Whether we have crossed this boundary , I do not know . It is , of course , our image of ourselves not only as a great power but as the great power that is at the root of all our grandiosity . Ca n't we have a Moderately Great Society ? One lesson of history is that nothing fails like success , for the successful do not have to learn anything . By almost all the world 's standards , the United States is an inconceivable success . We have attributed this largely to our virtue and good management , not wholly without reason , but a certain amount of it is due to luck ? the fact , for instance , that we have so often done the right thing for the wrong reasons . What is dangerous , however , is that because of our success it is hard for us to learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world that has in fact passed away . The conditions of success in the future are not the same as the conditions in the past . What we do not understand , and seem almost incapable of learning , is that in the long run , legitimacy is much more impor ? tant for survival than either wealth or military power ; and that though up to a point , wealth and military power create legitimacy , beyond a certain point , they destroy it . It was Stalin at Yalta , we may remember , who sneered at the Pope for having no divisions , but Stalin 's divisions did not save his good name for posterity or his monstrous statues from destruction , while St. Peter 's still stands . In the international arena , then , the United States has delusions of grandeur . We spend $5o billion a year to impose our will on the world and we find that we are impotent in Vietnam because we have no legitimacy . Even if our napalm and airborne terror produce " vic ? tory , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we have become a monster . Our wealth and military power produce affability on the world 's face and curses in its heart . We are incapable of organizing the world in our own image , and in the course of trying to do this , we are destroying ourself . The military-industrial complex is eating the heart out of American life and seriously reducing ? perhaps in the long run fatally ? its potential for economic prog ? ress . In the 1950 's , for instance , there were 45 countries
