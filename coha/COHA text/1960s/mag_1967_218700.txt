UP on the edge of Viet Nam 's DMZ last week , TIME Correspondent David Greenway , like the Marines whose activities he was reporting , found himself spending much of his time hunkered down in foxholes . The way to stay healthy was to steer clear of incoming artillery shells . <P> Once , while he and a sergeant major waited for a lull in the firing , Greenway experienced what he says was a moment of total recall . " There I was , covered with mud , sweaty , nose pressed into the dirt , and I suddenly remembered that almost exactly a year ago to the day I was sitting in our plush Boston bureau trying to get a call through to Harvard 's President Pusey for a story about the divinity school . I thought : ' If I walked into President Pusey 's office right now , he would call the police . ' " <P> Greenway found the very thought of making a phone call particularly ironic . For communications in South Viet Nam are so bad that reporters often spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Saigon . Until he choppered back to Saigon , in fact , Greenway did not know that the files he was writing in the battered outpost were to become a key part in a cover story . <P> Greenway 's colleagues in TIME 'S Saigon and Washington bureaus filed a great deal about other aspects of the cover story , but his eyewitness reports , made under almost constant enemy fire , were the basis for the part on Con Thien . The conditions Greenway was forced to work under were a measure of Greenway the man . He is well known at TIME for his sartorial splendor and neat English accent , polished during two years of graduate study at Oxford and subsequent world travels . Tigers and elephants , which he sometimes sees on operations in Viet Nam , make Greenway think he would like to go hunting there some day " if the war ever ends . " And he some times muses on the fact that his father , an ornithologist , made several field trips to Indo-China 30 years ago . " Here I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Born in Boston 32 years ago , Greenway graduated from Yale and filed his first story for Time Inc. as a campus stringer at Oxford . The story , for SPORTS ILLUSTRATED , was about the price of wolf 's urine at the London Zoo . " It seems , " he recalls , " that the Oxford drag hunt used wolf 's urine for the drag and they were upset about a sudden price hike . " <P> Subsequent adventures have taken Greenway from hunts near 19,565-ft. - high Kilimanjaro to 520-ft. - high Con Thien , which , as our cover story notes means roughly " place of angels , " but is " more akin to hell . " How does he like his new assignment that calls for so much time on the muddy , bloody " roof " of South Viet Nam ? <P> " Covering the war here is often agonizing , " he says , " but I suppose the appeal of it is that it 's such a complicated war , and such a difficult war for both the United States and Viet Nam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
