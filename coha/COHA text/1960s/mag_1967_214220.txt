Because of the Northeast 's blizzard , the New York Stock Exchange held an abbreviated session one day last week , with the result that trading for the day amounted to only 6,400,000 shares . <P> Even that would have been unusually brisk as recently as 1965 , but not any more . In the early weeks of 1967 , Wall Street has seen Big Board stocks change hands faster than ever before . <P> Trading , merely hectic last year , has turned almost frantic . So far this year , market volume has averaged 9,900,000 shares a day v. last year 's record daily average of 7,500,000 shares . In all , volume has reached 10 million shares on no fewer than 18 of the year 's 29 trading days . <P> The upsurge in trading is in part a seasonal phenomenon : because of year-end tax-loss selling and bonuses , many investors are left with money for buying stocks . And last year 's stock-market plunge left a number of issues at bargain prices . Showing renewed confidence in the economy , large institutional buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has encouraged individual investors to do the same . <P> In the long run , there is little doubt that the U.S. public 's affluence , population growth and ever-increasing interest in stocks have made big-volume trading more or less permanent . At least Wall Street is acting on that assumption . Bache &; Co. , for example , has acquired a Univac 494 geared to a 20 million-shares-a-day market . When that day comes , it will be interesting to see how the New York Stock Exchange itself chooses to cope with it . On busy days , its two-year-old ticker already flashes stock transactions as fast as the human eye can read them - and yet this year it has run as many as 19 minutes behind .
