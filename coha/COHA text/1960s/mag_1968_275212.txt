After 166 years , the Disciples of Christ last week conceded that they are , in fact , a Protestant denomination . In Kansas City , at the Disciples ' annual convention , 4,700 delegates overwhelmingly approved the principles of a new constitution that will transform the movement from a loose grouping of autonomous congregations into an organization with central direction and authority . The change was symbolized by dropping two letters from the Disciples ' proper name . Previously , they were members of the Christian Churches ; now they will be known as the Christian Church . <P> The Disciples were organized at the beginning of the 19th century as a backwoods ecumenical venture that sought to do away with denominational differences . The founder was the Rev. Thomas Campbell , a Presbyterian minister from Pennsylvania who wanted to unite all men on a few basics of belief . Christianity , he argued , is " essentially and constitutionally one church made up of all those in every place who profess their faith in Jesus Christ . " <P> Inefficient Omission . Unfortunately for Campbell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a more-or-less Congregational theology and structure that united a number of like-minded churches in a voluntary association . But as the Disciples grew in numbers ( membership is now about 1,250,000 ) and expanded their activities , they found it difficult to get along without some kind of central authority . Today the churches operate 117 autonomous missionary and social agencies and 23 colleges , all of which are supported by voluntary contributions . Leaders of the Disciples have long deplored the lack of a policy-making body as highly inefficient . <P> Last week 's decision came after a decade-long battle in which 2,000 of the Disciples ' 8,000 churches broke away . Many of the dissident congregations affiliated with the conservative Churches of Christ , which separated from the more liberal Disciples at the turn of the century . Among other things , the dispute involved the question of whether organ music in church had scriptural justification ( the Disciples said it did ) . <P> First proposed in 1958 , the reorganization plan allows the local congregations considerable autonomy . They will keep title to their property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on membership requirements , hire their pastors . Central policy , however , will be decided by a new general assembly composed of 5,000 delegates elected by the congregations , which is expected to meet every two years , and a 400-member general board . A new general minister and president " and a 47-member administrative committee will carry out the decisions of the assembly and board . <P> Putting on Bonds . Opponents of centralized authority denounce it as a betrayal of the movement 's tradition of local autonomy . At last week 's meeting , the Rev. Robert Burns of Atlanta , spokesman for several hundred churches , asked : " Why is all this control from the top necessary ? There has never yet been an organization that , given power , did n't use it . This is no less than incipient dictatorship . " Another dissident , the Rev. Rex Miller of Jewell , Kans. , complained that " at a time when the Roman Catholic Church is loosening the bonds of its hierarchy , we find ourselves putting them on . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
