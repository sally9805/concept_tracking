4 THE CASTLE AT ARUNDEL A Story by Arthur Heiserman Drawings by Arthur Shilstone I SP E N T the night at Chichester and in the morning hitchhiked to Arundel . Chichester Cathedral , with its dumpy exterior and futile transepts folded against its sides like ostrich wings , kept me only twenty minutes . So by nine o'clock I was bouncing in a small truck full of sacked potatoes toward Arundel Castle ten miles away . " You 're from the States , I fancy , " said the elderly driver , who had not looked at me since hearing my American " Thanks a lot . " " Yes , " I said . " A group of you chaps uprooted my niece 's picket fence in 1943 . No sense at all . " He had a beefy nose and needed a shave , and in his cap rested a small package of cigarettes . I thought he might put me out , but he said nothing more and squinted into the sun . The summer of 1949 was dry , and the downs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunlight three figures pitched hay into a baler . Spears of loose hay trailed each forkful through the air , giving the group an instantaneous arrest and form which it itself could never see . " You in the Army ? " " No . Just sight-seeing . " " I fancy you 'll be seeing Arundel Castle . " " Yes , " I yelled . We jerked over an arched stone bridge . " That will be the River Arun , " he said . " That bridge has been widened six times since sixteen hundred and fifty . " When he grinned , I noticed he had several teeth missing . " Shows we make progress too . " " Will you have one of my cigarettes ? " In those clays a Lucky Strike could knock down any barrier , anywhere . " Thanks , chum , " he said , without taking his eyes from the road . I put two cigarettes into his hand and lighted one of them for him . " But there 's one thing I keep telling Alice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from a group of thatched buildings . " You Yanks know how to deal with them Russian chaps . My wife 's uncle lived in California , " he roared . " I 'm from Chicago , " I said . His face suddenly became thinner , and his thatched eyebrows leveled off . He seemed surprised to find himself alive when he set me down half a mile from Arundel . " I 'll be turtling here , " he said , racing the motor and staring at my new suitcase . " You 'll see the castle from the top of this hill . It do n't open till noon , and it 'll cost you a shilling . " " Thanks a lot , " I shouted , and the little truck scuttled away into a long orchard . My pair of respectable shoes for the boat ride home made the suitcase too heavy . Mounting the hill with it , trying to ignore the early heat , 1 deliberately recollected the one part of Chi-74 THE CASTLE AT ARUNDEL chester Cathedral which had not been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxon relief carving in which the Jesus-troubled Lazarus kneels before his tiny tomb , lifts his head in rigid profile , his features geometric with astonishment . Immediately behind him bends an ancient woman , mourning still , her cheeks carved downward , furrows of grief dropping through her robe ; her head and that of the woman behind her tilt stiffly onto their clasped hands in a primitive gesture of despair . About the active Jesus , who holds his fist high before him , are grouped the gaping elders , their beards ridged deeply below their open mouths , their brows arched , their long old hands pitched suddenly to shoulder height , palms outward . They seem engaged in a pantomime of surprise . And in the distance , above a tiny thatched cottage , three small birds fly away in one precise line , their wings stretched wide with haste . The carving had been fixed like a tablet in the wall , and its lines were static , yet they flowed . Climbing the hill , preparing myself for a disappointing view of the castle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carving with the sight of my Army surplus shoes stepping over and over into dusty weeds , and my shoes with the world of the truck-driver which was now dead to me forever . But the view of the castle was not disappointing . I looked up , and there it stood just one valley away . Straight and tall and white , it spread its walls over an entire hill in a delirium of power and stone . It was lifted high at the center , turreted at its angles , and tied to the earth only by a thick Norman keep at the gate . Nothing had prepared me for it . It was more outrageously powerful than Gloucester 's syllogistic choir , for it was fixed upon profane emotion alone . It floated on the green froth of its park , splendid as war in a tapestry , terrible as a fairy tale . Its battlemented chapel , which thrust southward on a spur into die outworks , sparkled in the morning . To one who for weeks had been immersed in car after car , nibbled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was physical comfort . I PICKED up my suitcase , and noticed a man seated before an easel . His black Jaguar crouched off the road a bit down the hill , and he sat between it and half-a-dozen plum trees . 1 walked down toward him . Even though he was seated on a stool , his back was straight and neat in its dark-blue jacket . Absurdly enough , he wore a beret . I put down my suitcase quietly . The Jaguar should have frightened me off , for they despise hitchhikers . But the day was early , the castle did n't open till noon , and the town which filled the valley where I would have to wait seemed merely eighteenth-century slate and brick . The man turned around slowly , as though he were tired , watched me a moment , nodded , and returned to the tiny picture on the easel . He was a small , hard man , tanned with the lucid tan of the rich . His eyes and his neat mustache had been gray . I picked up my suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , touching the chapel with a minute brush , " but it 's the sort of thing I want this morning . " 1 could think of nothing to say . He put the brush into a cup between his feet . " I understand Cromwell placed a battery just over there . " The beret jerked to the right . " In that pasture . No wonder his shot barely chipped the stone . But nothing was too trite for Cromwell . " He sniffed briefly , and I laughed on that cue . " Every morning at dawn the defenders dropped their dead into the Arun . From that escarpment there below the chapel . " Would it be more polite to walk around and face him ? / put down my suitcase . " I 've done it two dozen times from up here , you know . " I walked up to his shoulder . " Use my own mixture of pigments and eggs . Mixing them is half the fun , you sec . " " It 's very well done , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joint . " Thank you very much . That 's very kind , but I 'm only an amateur , " he gave it the French pronunciation , " and I 've painted only the castle , so I 'm afraid one ca n't ask for too much . " When he bent to the little rack of cups on the grass , his hand shook . Straightening formally , he smiled at me . " Are you in the Army ? " " No , I 'm just hitchhiking . " His accent , his blue serge , his silver mustache , made me regret the dust of ten shires in my hair and on my unpressed jacket . " I 'm a student . " " Ah , " he said , returning to his miniature . " A student abroad . What university ? " " Chicago , " I said . " Ah yes , where the gangsters come from . " His narrow face creased handsomely about the mouth and eyes . " Well , you must n't miss Cambridge Arthur Heiserman is director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , " Skelton and Satire , " will be published by the University of Chicago Press in July . either . My university and my son 's . Were you in the services ? " " No , I was too young . " " How old are you ? Twenty-two , - three ? " " Twenty even . " He looked up at me . He was older than I had thought , and his leanness was not the leisurely leanness of his class . " Incredible , " he said , and looked out over the sweetly antique meadows . Eng/Mullen were not supposed to ask such personal questions , nor to imply that one was lying , unless one were an inferior . I picked up my suitcase . " Where did you stop the night ? " he asked . " In Chichester . " " What did you think of our cathedral ? " " T thought it was pretty bad . " " Quite right . It 's monstrous . One of those things which are wrong from the start . Reminds one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not yet met a high bourgeois since coming to England , so I put down the suitcase . " Did you notice the link Saxon tablet ? " " Yes . That 's a beautiful thing . " " The best thing in Sussex . And the misericord of the violinist kissing the dancer , in the choir ? " " I could n't get into the choir . " " Really ? That 's outrageous . " He looked up at me . " I must take you back there after lunch to see it . The bishop says the violinist is simply a violinist , but of course the violinist is Death . Always is in that period . Or any period . " He daubed . An eccentric , I thought , a real English eccentric . " Well , " he sighed , " let 's be off . There 's no more helping this thing . " He began to put his brushes and cups of paint into a metal box . " I very much want you to meet my wife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not otherwise engaged ? " " No , " I said , " thank you very much . But I do n't .. . " " Nonsense . I 'm only sorry we did n't know you were in the area . You could have stopped the night with us . " It seemed absolutely impossible that he was a homosexual . " Well , " he said , " we paint and we paint and we never seem to discover exactly what we feel . Here it is , more than a hundred pictures in five years . And there it stands , basically unchanged since the Wars of the Roses . " He stood up oddly , all his weight on his left leg , and held the tiny board straight out before him . His castle seemed to be toppling in all directions . I saw that he might be a little mad . He collapsed his easel and the stool . As he started for the car , I noticed the peculiar swing and jerk of his right leg . He was shorter than I had imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he moved with great dignity . Before I could stop him , he had picked up my own suitcase and was lifting it into the car . " Here , " I said , " here . " Too late . " All right , " he said , " hop in . " He opened the door and I got in . We drove down the hill , but the castle did n't scent to get any nearer until we entered the town . Then , when 1 glanced up , it disappeared behind the truncated belfry of a church . It was so huge and high that I could no longer see it from the narrow streets . We drove through the town , crossed an Arun just deep enough to float a corpse , and threaded into the hills between tall , ancient hedges . We passed small cottages with leaded windowpanes . An old woman in a bonnet stared at us from between rows of roses . " Was the red rose York or Lancaster ? " I asked . " I can never remember which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yin and Yang . " We looked at one another . " Do you find hitchhiking tiring ? You look exhausted . " 76 THE CASTLE AT ARUNDEL " Oh , " I said , almost ready to apologize , " I guess so . You have to climb in and out of so many people 's cars in one day . And in a foreign country , .. " Maybe I was about to be rude . " I see . " " Well , it 's better in the early morning , if you 're going east , or at sundown , if you 're going west . That way the sun goes right through a windshield and you can see people very well before you get in . Or the windshield is completely glazed with the sun , and you ca n't sec them at all . Either way it 's better . " " I see . It 's a question of identity . " " Yes , I guess it is . " F IN ALLY we turned into an orchard , crossed a grassy brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with brown timbers supporting the dormers . A picket fence surrounded a yard full of flowers , some of which climbed straight up the front walls , leaving only the small-paned windows free . We turned around the cottage and stopped where a tangled hill rose steeply from the back door . " Can you see those stones tumbled about up there ? " asked my man , squinting up the hill . I could . " Those are the remains of the original farmstead , mentioned in the Doomsday Book . My wife has a copy of the entry . " I put the folded easel inside the back door . A small , wrinkled woman began to grin and rub her apron when we entered the kitchen , but we took no notice of her and walked up two steps into a large dining-room roofed with huge black beams . My man moved silently before me , then paused before a low arch , pulled at his lapels , and took me by the elbow . " My dear ? " he whispered , and we walked into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airy curtains , and white wood . It mellowed rough ceiling beams and sturdy furniture and the navy-blue dress of the woman who sat by a mahogany escritoire . She stared out into the dark-leaved orchard , her lips drawn in and her straight profile hardly weakened by the pince-nez on her strong nose . " My dear ? " whispered the man , giving my elbow a squeeze . He had begun to shrink even before the woman turned toward us . Her head moved back with a controlled jerk . She took off her glasses and stood up , supporting herself slightly on the escritoire . " My dear , may I present Mr. . . . ah , good Heaven ! I do n't believe I know your name . " I told him . She moved toward us slowly from the window , her handsome head still back to correct her vision of me  --  dirty and uncombed  --  who had suddenly invaded her parlor . She topped my six feet by perhaps a quarter-inch , and her skin was remarkably clear and pale for her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gray hair been more neatly combed , she would have looked more like a countess than the headmistress of a puritanical girls ' school . We shook hands . There was whiskey on her breath . " This young chap and I share an admiration of the castle . " " Indeed . " " And the true opinion of the Chichester minsten He is making a tour of the southern cathedrals , and intends to devote this afternoon to our castle . " The man had moved me to a cane-bottomed chair by the fireplace and was limping nervously between his wife , who stood erectly by the archway , and the glass-doored bookcases . " He is a student , I believe , at Chicago . " " Where the gangsters come from , " I said , trying to banish something which hovered in the air . " Yes , and the atomic bomb , I believe , " laughed my host . He swept off his beret , revealing a head much balder and older than I had imagined . " I felt we could repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country by asking him to share our little lunch . Here , my dear , sit here . " The pince-nez dangled on her austere bosom as he settled her in the sofa across the hearth from us . " I thought you would certainly think it most unfortunate should he leave our islands without having met you . " " Yes , thank you very much , Henry . Yes . " Her voice , though it was deeply modulated , lacked the crispness I would have expected from her profile and parlor . " Yours is a German name , is it not ? " " Yes , " I said . " My family settled in southern Ohio after the political difficulties of 1848 . " I had kept just enough self-possession to feel ashamed of trying to make something of the bakers and clerks in my family . " I see . That 's extremely interesting . You served in the Pacific , I imagine . " " No , I was never drafted . " " He 's only twenty , my dear , " laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . She continued to fix me with her gray eyes , keeping her head tilted slightly back so that her roll of gray hair frayed against the bright window behind her . " How interesting . And how are you traveling now ? " " He 's hitchhiking , my dear . Proper student fashion . ' Wonderful kind of ... " ( he walked be-tween us and leaned upon his left leg ) " elan , spirit , to come all this way alone to visit us . He came trudging up behind me while . . . I say ! You did n't walk from Chichester did you ? " " No , " I laughed , " a farmer who does n't think much of Americans gave me a lift . " " Really ? " said the woman . " What did he say ? " She seemed amused for the first time . " Oh , nothing . I encounter all sorts of opinion . " There was a pause . I had thrown up a barrier . But the man pierced it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dole , no denying that . Perhaps we 're far too accustomed to taking what we want . But the magnificent display of generosity which the United States . . . " The woman arose . " I must see to Wilson , " she said , taking her eyes from me for the first time . " Yes , " said the man , watching his wife 's hack , " she 's a bit demented since the war . " I was so relieved that the woman was no longer staring at me that only then did I notice that the smell of whiskey pervaded the room as thoroughly as the sunlight . A N D at lunch , as soon as we had sat down to the large round table , the whiskey smell entered the dining-room too . The woman 's spectacles clanked against her plate and she stared at them . The man fussed over the food , laughed uproariously at everything , and darted glances at his wife , who stared at me near-sightedly all the while . The man 's brother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his London garden , and I described the variety of dishes possible with it . " Do you have a pressure cooker ? " I asked the wife . She looked at me a moment , her head much higher , it seemed , than mine . " I think it would blow up and destroy both the kitchen and Wilson , " said the man . Though his eyes were moist , he laughed again . " America is very adept at producing explosives , " the woman remarked , casually enough to seem polite . " Edith , would you care for tea now ? " whispered the man . " No thank you , Henry . " She had eaten nothing . " Are your parents still living ? " " Yes , " I said . " Do you have any siblings ? " " 1 have two older sisters , " I said . " My two sisters were killed in London with my mother in 1944 . " " Yes , " said the man , running his palm back over the veins on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hated to give up old London , but my office had been bombed out , and I left this on the Somme in 1916 , " he tapped his tight leg beneath the table , " and there was nothing I could do . " He smiled , avoiding his wife 's stare . " One can always purchase new limbs , " she said . I looked at the chewed ear of corn on my plate . I was thankful that I had shaved that morning . " What is your sport ? " asked the man , touching his little mustache . " What ? " " Do you practice any athletics at school ? " " Oh . Well , no , I do n't . " " Come along , " said the woman , putting both palms on the table to push herself elect . She was immense , and her beautifully straight features looked down upon me without emotion . I stood up . " Edith , " said the man , calmly . " Come along with me . " I followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall lined with closed white doors , up three steps over a stairway landing , down seven steps into a small room which had once been a storage room , for it was paved with stones and had only one small window . It contained nothing save a writing desk and dozens of pictures , hanging on the wall , stacked against the walls , propped against the desk  --  every size and color from airy miniatures to gaudy oils . All of the pictures depicted the castle . Here the castle floated off into a sanguine sunset . There it gleamed like bones in moonlight . Over here the fortified chapel smothered the foreground . Over there the heavy Norman keep gloated above the wintry park . No human figures strolled its 78 THE CASTLE AT ARUNDEL battlements or peered from its wicked archery slots . " Well , " coughed the man by my shoulder , ' these are the fruits of my five years ' labor . " " It 's really overwhelming , " I said . The woman had bent over the desk and was opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the case for an instant , then showed it to me with a noble smile . Inside , on vermilion velvet , rested a purple ribbon and the silver arms of the kings of Great Britain . The lion snarled haughtily , the unicorn 's lips rolled back over beautifully cast teeth , and the motto furled below was so delicately made that I could easily read the Honi sod qui nuri y pence . " It 's a beautiful thing , " I said . " Is it ? " she asked . " Take it . " I took it . " Turn it over . " Little lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth . I turned it over . RUPERT HANLEY SACK .. VILLE BURDEN . 30 MAIUS . MCMXXXIX . " Victoria Medal , " said the man . He limped past me and , finding himself hemmed in by his pictures , stopped in the center of the room . His wife towered over me between us . " Our only son won it in 1939 . Best athlete in the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my wife . . . " " His wife hates it , " said the woman . There was a pause . She was not at all nasty , but spoke very quietly . " And she hates these pictures . Typical old man 's obsession with beauty and death . " " Edith , " said the man , as though from a great distance behind her . " My son was butchered in Africa in 1941 . I had given him the best body and education in the world , and the woman who had given life to i  --  e was murdered in her bed in the very room next to mine . " The whiskey smell was making me dizzy . " Have you ever seen the dead ? " " No , ma 'm . " She had bent forward to inc. but straightened up again now . I still held the medal , and I looked down at it to avoid her eyes . " No , " she said beautifully , " and now you want to make war on Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty years old . My son never saw twenty-one . " The man stepped between us . " Put it back , please , Edith , and go to your room . " His face was scarlet . She handed the medal 's box around him to me , " My husband considers the castle to be beautiful . " " Edith . " " Do you know why my husband brought you home to me ? " For the first time , she tottered a little . Her shoulder dropped . " No , ma'am . " " You look .. . your hair and your eyes and your mouth are those of my son . You did n't know that , did you ? " " Come along now , Edith . Would you walk back into the parlor , please ? " I turned . " Yes , do get out . Go back to your German mother in Ohio . Could you leave your address ? " she asked from behind me in the hall . " I should very much like to write to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " Then I heard her walk straight up the stairs , sounding evenly on the treads . I WAS lifting my bag from the Jaguar when I heard the man limping behind me . I turned and he looked up his hill toward the stones . " I 'm terribly sorry , " he said . The skin on top of his skull was webbed with scarlet capillaries , and his mustache seemed smaller in the sunlight . He did n't look up at me , but leaned on his good leg , hunched up his shoulder , and put one hand into his pocket . " Do you need money ? 1 daresay you do . " " No , no , thank you very much . " 7 handed him the box and medal . " Yes , of course , thank you . Do you mind terribly if I do n't drive you out ? The main road to Brighton is at the bottom of the drive .

" " Certainly , " he said . He put out his hand . " Well , I 'll love you and leave you , my friend . You do look astonishingly like my son . I thought you might perhaps help out the . . . situation here . Very stupid of me . I do hope you do n't mind ? " " No , " I said . " I 'm sorry- " There was nothing else to say , so I walked back through his pleasant orchard . The house was not visible from the road . I had to think a moment which side of the road would take me on to Hastings , and which back to Arundel , because I never really got accustomed to that **25;1671;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle that afternoon .
