The Dominican government of reconciliation led by Hctor Garcia-Godoy is now seven weeks old , and thus far it has reconciled no one . In the bullet-pocked capital of Santo Domingo ex-President Juan Bosch , in whose name the original civil war was launched returned home talking about " strikes demonstrations and appeals " to " drive out " the 10,300 U.S. paratroopers and Latin American soldiers of the OAS peace-keeping force . Bosch 's presence has inflamed the left and enraged the right-to the point where the only thing that stands between Garcia-Godoy and renewed civil war is those same 10,300 foreign soldiers . <P> Two weeks ago , a band of leftist students started demonstrating outside the National Palace , taunting loyalist Dominican army guards . With anger and bitterness all around , one soldier shot an 18-year-old in the back , killing him instantly . That led to a series of flash-fire fights between rebels and loyalists resulting m four dead , 14 wounded . Last week the city rumbled with bomb blasts five in all , damaging a bar popular with U.S. troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive-in movie Death toll : another two Dominicans . <P> Despite all appeals , the rebels have openly defied Garcia-Godoy 's order to surrender their stolen arms . In turn the President is under increasing pressure from the loyalist military , which is talking coup and accuses him of loading his Cabinet with leftists . The President does not deny that he has leftists in his Cabinet-along with conservative bankers , engineers and landowners . " We have had a revolution , " he says , " I must reintegrate the country , so I use so-and-so , and people cry , ' My God , he 's a leftist . ' Of course he 's a leftist . I want him to do a job no one else can . " <P> For the moment , Garcia-Godoy is determined to do the job of " reconciliation " his way-with one hand on his hot line to the U.S. 82nd Airborne .
