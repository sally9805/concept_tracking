To Bed or Not to Bed is a sly Italian comedy that says the Swedish women are as frigid as the Swedish climate . The hero ( Alberto Sordi ) is an Italian fur merchant who goes to Sweden to pick up some mink-and any other skin he can lay his hands on . <P> First night in Stockholm he takes a cute little trick ( Barbro Wastenson ) to his hotel suite , plies her with Vat 69 , shows her his war wound , edges toward the bedroom-as she eases out the door . <P> Next day he meets a rich and beautiful woman who assures him her husband wo n't mind if she does-but then she does n't . Next day he is seduced into a sauna by a luscious young thing who romps with him stark naked in the snow-and calmly walks off to meet her boy friend . The only time he finds a willing woman , she turns out to be 13 . The joke is pretty obvious , and To Bed could easily have been just one more priapicture . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story with sophistication and restraint . They suggest much more than they say . They suggest , for example , one good reason why so many Swedish men like to take their vacations in Italy . <P> <P> The Doll is a Swedish picture about a young man who finds Swedish women so forbidding that he falls in love with a plaster manikin . One night he steals the manikin , takes it home to his crummy garret , puts it gently in his bed . " Are you comfortable ? " he tenderly inquires as he tucks the covers in . Then he goes respectfully to sleep in a chair . Next day he brings flowers for the object of his affections , kisses it passionately on the lips , begs it to come alive and be his lady love . <P> So it does-or anyway he thinks it does . Before his eyes it becomes a living woman who speaks to him , caresses him , says she loves him and thinks he 's wonderful . His face brightens , his mind darkens . Insanely in love , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be apart from his imaginary inamorata . But the idyl is soon over . The man in the next room comes snooping and discovers what the hero is keeping in his bed . Mockingly he strokes the lifeless body . In a rage the hero shoots him and then smashes the manikin to bits . But one of the bits is her head , and there it sits in the middle of the floor , looking up at him and smiling , smiling . <P> Director Arne Mattsson ( One Summer of Happiness ) has fashioned The Doll with skill and care . He clearly expects it to be seen as an accurate case history and a serious work of art . But the sight of the man and the manikin together is too absurd to be taken seriously . Maybe Sex in Sweden should never have been taken seriously anyway .
