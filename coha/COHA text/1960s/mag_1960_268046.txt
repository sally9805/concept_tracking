<P> Reading his newspaper one morning recently , Lawrence A. Harvey , 48 , chairman of the West Coast 's Harvey Aluminum Inc. noticed a story that a competitor was about to make a big sale of aluminum to a new customer . With only 2% of U.S. aluminum output , Lawrence Harvey has to scramble fast to compete against the giants . He grabbed his telephone , learned the contract had indeed been agreed upon , but was not yet signed . He summoned a family conference in the company 's executive suite : Father Leo M. Harvey , 75 , company president ; Uncle Herbert Harvey , 65 , engineering vice president ; and Brother Homer M. Harvey , 36 , administrative vice president . Together they quickly decided what price they could offer the buyer . By that afternoon the deal was signed-with Harvey Aluminum , not the competitor . <P> Such tactics , backstopped by one of the most efficient aluminum plants in the world , have made Harvey Aluminum the bright spot this year in a generally tarnished-profit industry . Aluminum 's Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an average of 83% capacity , and profits are down in the cost-price squeeze . Harvey has been operating at 100% capacity all year , this week reported record profits of $5,000,000 for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 , despite the fact that sales slipped 1.1% to $59.7 million . <P> The Family Went Along . Harvey Aluminum is an outgrowth of the Harvey Machine Co. , which was founded by Leo Harvey in Los Angeles in 1914 . At the start , it made everything from corsage pins to racing cars . Later it turned to making special machinery , and by World War II was the biggest such manufacturer on the West Coast . Young Lawrence had learned metalworking on vacations in his father 's shop , had rushed through the University of Southern California , the California bar exams and Harvard Business School by the time he was 22 . In 1946 he cut loose from the family circle to buy a war-surplus aluminum-extrusion plant in Torrance , Calif . He soon persuaded the rest of the family to go along , and the Harvey Machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance refurbishing of the Torrance plant . <P> The young company 's biggest problem was assuring a steady flow of raw aluminum for its fabricating plant . In 1955 that problem was solved when the Government , which wanted to increase aluminum capacity outside the Big Three , guaranteed a $40 million bank loan to Harvey . To assure Harvey a market , the Government also agreed to buy up to 54,000 tons a year for five years , beginning in 1959 , of Harvey 's primary aluminum output for U.S. strategic stockpiles . Since the reduction plant 's capacity is only 60,000 tons a year , this was a healthy demand-cushion for Harvey . In 1959 the company asked the U.S. to buy only 19,500 tons , this year will offer only 12,000 tons . <P> The Small Asset . Like other aluminum companies , Harvey prods manufacturers into finding new uses for aluminum . When a truck manufacturer scoffed at the idea of aluminum truck beds , Harvey helped build some to prove the point . Today 85% of all truck beds and semitrailers are aluminum , v. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harvey recently had built an all-aluminum 85-ft. railroad car , now has constant requests for its use , hopes orders will follow .
