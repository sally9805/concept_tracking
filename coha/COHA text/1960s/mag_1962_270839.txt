ANOTHER COUNTRY ( 436 pp. ) - James Baldwin-Dial Press ( $5.95 ) . <P> James Baldwin is one of the brashest , brightest , most promising young writers in America . A New York Negro whose early novels won him a series of money grants to live and work in Europe away from race pressure , he discovered that despite everything , he had more in common with Americans-even white Southerners-than with Europeans . He came back five years ago to face again what it is to be a Negro in the U.S. <P> Since then , as a lecturer and essayist ( Nobody Knows My Name ) , he has proved himself willing to step on anybody 's toes-black or white-in order to get said what he feels must be said about his country . As social commentator , he insists that whites , in hiding behind public matters of housing and civil rights , have failed to face the real issue of racism-private human hate , which can be atoned for only by private human love . As literary critic , he has judged Negro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin 's new novel . Now out , it proves a failure-doubly disappointing not only because it does not live up to advance hopes , but also because it so clearly has tried to be an important book . <P> Chosen Identity . In one fictional fling , Baldwin has tried to unburden himself of all his feelings about racism and homosexuality , about the cacophony of despair and misunderstanding that he believes America to be . But in Another Country this is projected on a wholly inadequate fictional frame : six characters in search of love and self-knowledge in a Dostoevskian substratum of Greenwich Village . Each has been chosen as a representative of melting-pot America . Negro Rufus Scott , a jazz musician from Harlem , has never been able to learn his identity as a man because he could never forget his identity as a Negro . His sister Ida battles the white world too , but ends by yielding to the love of her brother 's best friend , an Irish-Italian from Brooklyn named Vivaldo Moore . Blonde Clarissa Silenski , a Boston aristocrat ( Puritan uprightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of her husband Richard , a teacher and writer of Polish immigrant stock . Actor Eric Jones ( the American South ) has had to quit Alabama for Europe , less because he is a homosexual than because he is fond of Negroes . But like Author Baldwin he courageously comes home to live with the truth about himself . <P> It is James Baldwin 's point that these people , hopelessly intertwined past all concern for sex or color , are interesting individuals out of whose actions the meaning of the novel must emerge . But Baldwin 's writing skill , adequate in simpler novels , is not up to maneuvering so complex a collection of people . The dialogue , in which all women are referred to as " chicks , " is sometimes sharply comic , often hopelessly wooden . The action , which is slight , drags . The characters ' inner soul searchings too often lapse into a kind of interchangeable interior recollection that seems to be carried on not by individuals but by Baldwin himself .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
