The U.S. Office of Education is formed " for the purpose of collecting such statistics and facts as shall show the condition and progress of education in the several States . . . and of diffusing such information . " <P> - Act of Congress , March 2 , 1867 . Despite that century-old charge , the Federal Government has never diffused , much less collected , any meaningful facts on the quality of education put forth by U.S. schools . Against strong opposition from local school officials , who remain fearful that federal testing means " federal control , " the Carnegie Corporation , with Ford Foundation and Government backing , has now embarked on a national assessment of school performance . <P> The assessment program was unveiled by former Education Commissioner Francis Keppel at the 1965 White House Conference on Education . He argued that " the nation 's taxpayers and their representatives in Congress have every right to know whether their investment in education is paying off . " In agreeing to finance pilot tests , Carnegie said that " a nation that has hitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars into the enterprise is collectively crazy if it does not try to find out the result of all this effort . We do n't know whether most ninth-graders can read and comprehend a typical newspaper paragraph , whether most high school graduates know more or less about more or fewer things than high school graduates did 20 years ago . " <P> No Invidious Comparisons . To frame the tests , Carnegie set up an exploratory committee of educators and executives , headed by Ralph W. Tyler , director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto , Calif . The committee decided to examine 256 population groups , broken down into four age levels ( 9 , 13 , 17 and adult ) ; four geographic areas ; two income levels ; sex ; and urban , suburban and rural divisions . This would be done by sampling techniques in which only 5% of an age group would be tested and no single student would be likely to encounter more than a single half-hour test and then only on a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be pinpointed by school districts or by states ; thus no single teacher would have any feedback on the performance of the one or two pupils from her class likely to be tested . This , Carnegie contends , means that no " invidious comparisons " would result , and no teacher would be under pressure to " teach for the tests . " But the broad-brush group results could provide some facts which might help resolve the endless arguments on how well , or poorly , the schools are doing . <P> This month three school districts co operated in trying out the first pilot tests on 700 fourth-graders . The students were asked to read a clock , show the meaning of numbers by using colored rods or an abacus , pick similar pictures from a group of four . Later this year , up to 50,000 children and adults will be sampled . High school seniors may be asked to fill out a driver 's license application , while adults may be quizzed about their reading habits and asked to demonstrate skills with simple tools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
