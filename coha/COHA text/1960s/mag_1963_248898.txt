A CHILD 'S GUIDE TO FREUD by Louise Armstrong . Drawings by Whitney Darrow Jr . 60 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $2.95. - <P> Freudian expertise has long since reached down through the cocktail party into the children 's playroom , but there are still enough happy , balanced , unsavvy five-year-olds around to justify this narrative lexicon of Freudian terms . <P> It gives kids a working familiarity with the Grandma Moses of the modern mind . For adults , it 's a hundred laughs , the sort of cartoon book to read while you 're coming back from insulin shock . <P> " This is Daddy . He sleeps in the same room as Mommy . Call this a Meaningful Relationship , " says Author Armstrong to the little boy that she and Cartoonist Whitney Darrow feature as the book 's whiz id . " If you beat your Daddy at Chinese Checkers , call this Healthy Aggression . If he decides to get mad about this , call him Insecure . If he changes his mind and smiles , call him Unstable . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title it Daddy , this is called Sublimation . If you do n't paint a picture of a dragon and title it Daddy , this is called Repression . The picture itself is called a Symbol . This means Daddy is not really a dragon . If you insist he is , this is called a Delusion . " Altogether , the book is enough to make Karl Menninger nostalgic for phrenology.
