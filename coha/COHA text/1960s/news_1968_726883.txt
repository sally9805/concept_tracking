txt Every small boy knows . When the doubtfully hoped for bicycle becomes practically a sure thing , some of the surface excitement goes out . It has happened at the arms control conference here . But the bicycle is still important . Barring some sudden East-West crisis , the next several weeks in the Geneva meeting of the 17-nation disarmament committee will be given to unspectacular but specially serious work . The next big event is likely to be an agreement among all the 17 nations here ( France is absent by President de Gaulle 's order ) . Text approval expected This agreement is expected to approve a text for a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons beyond nations which already have them . The approved text will then go to the United Nations General Assembly . Favorable action is probable at New York . This would give most of the world a long-awaited " nuclear nonproliferation " treaty . ? In this treaty the Soviet Union and the United States , as the major nuclear powers , would promise not to give nonnuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nonnuclear states would promise not to ask for or to accept such weapons or help . French Armed Forces Minister Pierre Messmer , answering questions at a Foreign Press Association luncheon in Paris , said France was ready to associate itself with genuine nuclear disarmament but wanted no part in the Soviet-American draft treaty , Reuters reporte Goal at last in sight He described the draft as " a bad treaty doomed to failure . " He said it would " give a legal basis to and consecrate privileges of nuclear powers over nonnuclear powers . " In Bonn , Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger said that despite improvements , the new treaty draft does not have West Germany 's unqualified support . He said , however , his government hopes the present draft would " lead to an acceptable solution . " " So a goal we have been aiming at for several years is now in sight , " a Western diplomat told this writer . " And none too soon , " say the nuclear-weapons experts here . The amount of nuclear materials , already being produced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . So there is urgent need for an agreement of the kind being worked out here . Without it two dangerous things can happen . ? Many nations which at present have no nuclear weapons of their own would be tempted to use some of their nuclear materials to make weapons . This , the experts // *A-control draft milestone for the world // say , is all too easy to do , once the materials are on hand . ? The existence of these materials could be kept secret . They might be stockpiled for conversion to atomic weapons without the world community being aware of what was going on . That is one reason why the new American-Soviet agreement for policing a pact against nuclear weapons dissemination is seen as a major event of the new year . The agreement was announced here Jan. 18 , weeks before the arms-control conference as a whole had expected it . Caught by surprise , the nonnuclear states here find themselves under added pressure to come to agreement among themselves . They must now formulate their demands promptly for whatever changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and the Soviet Union have presented . The General Assembly has requested the Disarmament Committee to send a complete treaty text to New York by March 15 . Whether or not this proves possible appears to be largely the responsibility of the smaller states here . Their objections to the present drafts should be minor , some conference leaders say . Leaders broadly advised The drafts are mainly the work of the two cochairmen of the committee , America 's William C. Foster and the Soviet Union 's Alexei Roshchin . But in this work these two leaders and their own delegations and experts have been aided by advice from many smaller states in the committee and at the United Nations . Several changes have been made in the draft treaties which were presented by the American and Soviet delegations last August . These originated with proposals from smaller states . The result is an expanded treaty , with 11 instead of eight articles . But the new American and Soviet drafts have been presented : here in a manner to encourage the widest useful debate here , There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We want a real debate on the treaty as a whole , " one Western diplomat told this writer . " We want to avoid any possible future feeling that the treaty was foisted upon the smaller states by the larger ones . We assume the nonnuclear states will still have proposals to make and may offer further text changes . " Blackmail ' preventive Further discussion may well occur on several points . One of these is the problem of assuring the security of nonnuclear states against future aggression or blackmail by nuclear powers . The United States and Soviet Union think this can be worked out outside the main treaty . But some wording in the draft may be necessary to satisfy the nonnuclear states that a security agreement will actually be forthcoming in the not-too-distant future . The Czechoslovakian delegate , Pavel Winkler , Jan. 23 came out strongly for the new drafts . He said security guarantees would come for nonnuclear states , but he did not suggest that the nonproliferation treaty should contain them . These state also want their right protected to develop means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader right to develop " peaceful uses . "
