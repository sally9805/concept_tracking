In Nicosia 's Government House , under an outsize painting of Aphrodite rising from the foam , pens scratched for almost an hour last week as British , Greek , Turkish and Cypriot delegates initialed the 87 separate documents making up the draft treaty for an independent Cyprus . Britain rushed an independence bill to Commons , while Archbishop Makarios , the President-elect , called the first parliamentary elections for July 31 and looked forward to freedom by mid-August . <P> Britain got most of what it wanted : complete sovereignty over two air and sea bases totaling 99 square miles , plus the use of 31 sites and installations outside the base areas . But the military usefulness of the bases , Makarios warned , will depend on " the friendliness and cooperation of the Cypriot people .

Under terms of the London agreement that ended the fighting , the Turkish population ( 20% of Cyprus ' 500,000 people ) gets 15 Parliament seats and 30% of all civil service jobs . Last week the Turkish Cypriot leader , Dr. Fazil Kuchuk , threatened to delay the treaty signing unless all the jobs were handed over at once . Only an appeal from Turkey 's Acting President Cemal Gursel , who was anxious for a settlement , brought Kuchuk to the table . <P> But during the long months of truce and wrangling negotiations , passions have subsided , and Turk and Greek seem ready to accept coexistence out of sheer weariness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek Cypriot majority and a $40 million going-away present from the British . He will use it over the next five years to build roads and try to get Cypriot agriculture out of the wooden-plow stage . Simply by signing the treaty last week , Makarios guaranteed that the island 's 12,000 restless unemployed will soon be at work on new base construction that the British plan .
