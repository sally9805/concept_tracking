" Everything is rosy in Rosebud. " insists the official slogan of Rosebud , Texas-and the town newspaper proclaims it in each weekly issue . But Rosebud is really rotting . Along the main street , a dozen business places have shut up shop ; the owners of many others would gladly sell out if there were any buyers around . A longtime Rosebud resident , Mrs. Howard Linn , recently showed a trace of the old " everything is rosy " spirit . " We 've got a brand-new rest home , " she said . " We 've got two good hospitals . We 've got two good funeral homes , one of them remodeled last year . " Then she saw the drift of what she was saying . " Yes , " she admitted . " It 's a dead town . We know it . " <P> Rosebud is just one among hundreds of similar towns , for across the U.S. the small town as such is dying . Only a few years ago , Niland , Calif. , proudly called itself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican growers , using cheap labor , invaded the U.S. winter tomato market , and Niland 's prosperity collapsed . Since 1956 the number of tomato growers in the area has plunged from 300 to 28 . Cars , trucks and farm equipment were abandoned by their owners , are now rusting into worthless junk . One of Niland 's remaining tomato farmers recalls that during the peak of the season he used to put $20,000 a week into the bank . Now , even the bank is closed . <P> Going Nowhere . The towns most vulnerable to devastating declines are those that , like Niland , depend upon a single basic source of income . The classic case is the mining community whose veins of ore play out . Although Arizona is booming , and the population of Phoenix has quadrupled during the past ten years , at the edge of the once bustling Arizona copper town of Jerome* stands a sign proclaiming it a ghost town ( see cut ) . <P> For many a little town across the U.S. , the basic economic resource was the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneconomic for railroads , and many small-town stops have been abandoned . The Central of Georgia used to stop at Coffee Springs , Ala. , and the town made a living by ginning and shipping cotton . But the railroad ripped out the tracks that ran through Coffee Springs , and today weeds grow in what used to be busy streets . " We 're going nowhere , " says a longtime Coffee Springs resident . " There 's nowhere we want to go . " Similarly , the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad drastically curtailed service to New Ulm , Texas . The town , which once had 800 residents , now has only 350 . Says George Miete , owner of a butcher shop : " Doctor died in 1950 , have n't been able to get a replacement . Barber died three years ago . Ca n't get a new one to come in . " <P> Still Breathing . Hard hit , too , are towns that depended on farming for their livelihood-selling goods to farmers and handling farm products on their way to urban markets . The emergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers . And the ever expanding network of highways has made it possible for farm goods in trucks and farmers in automobiles to bypass formerly flourishing small towns .
