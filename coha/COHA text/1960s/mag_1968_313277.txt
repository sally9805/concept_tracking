" Will you trust my judgment , Mr. Fortas ? " , asked the salesman at Welch 's Hardware Store in Westport , Conn . Dubiously , the Chief Justice-designate of the U.S. fingered the new , chemically treated dustcloth , examining it carefully by sight and feel . Finally , aware perhaps that this was a matter beyond his competence , he concurred with the clerk 's opinion . Tramping around the narrow streets of Westport , accompanied by TIME Washington Bureau Chief John Steele , Fortas was enjoying the scruffy anonymity of any other summer refugee from the city . In baggy grey pants , a flame-red cardigan sweater , scuffed brown shoes ( one with a tongue missing ) and a floppy white yachtsman 's hat ( a 58th-birthday present from his wife ten days earlier ) , he carted three bags of soiled linen to the laundry , then , pausing occasionally to consult a neat shopping list , picked up gold-covered paper matchbooks , a dustpan , a broom , clothes hooks , cleanser and a package of frozen pureed spinach . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rambling summer house atop Minute Man Hill , which has an enormous veranda with a view of Long Island Sound when the sun breaks through the mists . Fortas kept busy scrubbing the winter 's grit off the windows . Now and then , he would wheel a load of manure to his wife , Carolyn , who was working on the garden , soggy from the unseasonably heavy spring rains . <P> The scene was a long way from the day next October when Fortas , given Senate approval , will take his place in the center of the Supreme Court bench . Yet , even now , as he talked with Reporter Steele , the bench was never far from his mind . <P> He foresaw new challenges , new problems for the court-the Fortas court . " It was one thing to have enunciated great principles , " Fortas says of the Warren era , which he admires greatly . " But it is another thing to make them come alive . " There would be new concerns as the Justices explored the terms and conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguous laws , and there would probably be a re-examination of the relationship between the courts and the federal regulatory agencies . The operation of the federal courts themselves is a matter for concern for the man who , as Chief Justice , would be charged with the overall administration of the entire federal judicial system . With ever-lengthening dockets , there are long delays in reaching decisions , long delays in rendering justice . <P>
