IT was a scene reminiscent of 1829 , when Andrew Jackson 's mud-booted backwoods supporters swarmed into the White House for Old Hickory 's Inaugural Day reception . Celebrating his election last week as West Germany 's first postwar Socialist Chancellor , Willy Brandt invited all comers to his official villa on Bonn 's exclusive Venusberg , overlooking the Rhine . <P> Brandt and his flaxen-haired Norwegian wife Rut were at the door to greet the crowd . More than 500 ordinary Germans , who normally would have been held back by police lines , trooped into the splendidly furnished 14-room residence . Stiff at first , they gawked at the Gobelin tapestry on the wall and perched awkwardly on the edge of burgundy settees and easy chairs . But the uneasiness quickly wore off . Soon workingmen in open shirts , longhaired youths and nurses from a nearby hospital were helping themselves to cigarettes , guzzling beer and surveying the place as if they owned it . <P> Loyal and Uncomfortable . It was a fitting if highly unorthodox way for the new Chancellor to commemorate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt whether there would be a Brandt government at all . After last month 's national elections , Brandt made a daring grab for power ( TIME Cover , Oct. 10 ) . Neither his Social Democrats nor the conservative Christian Democratic Union , partners for nearly three years in a Grand Coalition , had won an outright majority . Outmaneuvering the Christian Democrats , who won 242 seats in the 496-seat Bundestag to the Socialists ' 224 , Brandt formed an alliance with the tiny Free Democrats , whose 30 seats represented the balance of power . The question was , would the schizophrenic Free Democrats , split into left and right wings , remain sufficiently united to vote Brandt into power ? <P> Taking no chances on anyone 's missing last week 's crucial balloting , whips for the Socialists and Free Democrats summoned their delegates to Bonn a day early . The precaution worked . As the Bundestag convened for the Kanzlerwahl ( Chancellor 's election ) , each Socialist and Free Democrat was in his place . While the votes were being tabulated , Brandt resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matchsticks , going through an entire box in 20 minutes . Then came the announcement : 251 votes for Brandt , two over the required absolute majority ; 235 votes against him ; five abstentions , presumably including three by recalcitrant Free Democrats ; and four ballots rendered invalid with markings like " poor Germany " and " nonsense . " <P> Thus , 91 years to the day after Bismarck banned the Socialists from Imperial Germany and 39 years since the party last headed a government , a Socialist candidate was chosen to lead West Germany . Political Strategist Herbert Wehner , the fierce ex-Communist who masterminded the transformation of the Socialists from a blue-collar movement into a more broadly based party , rushed to embrace Brandt . Their dream finally realized , Brandt openly wept . " I am satisfied , grateful for the confidence and a little proud , " he said a few moments later . Then the new Chancellor , who spent the Nazi years in Scandinavian exile , added : " Hitler has definitively lost . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
