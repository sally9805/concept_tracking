In the countdown to Canada 's Expo 67 , it was 878 days since the morning in 1964 when the first dump truck dropped the first load of fill into the St. Lawrence River off Montreal . All that seemed a long time ago as a 19-year-old Canadian Army cadet last week sprinted into the Place des Nations amphitheater and , before 5,250 invited dignitaries , handed a blazing torch to Prime Minister Lester Pearson . Grinning , Pearson tipped the flame toward a gas jet in a canister , and a fire flickered up-to burn night and day during the six-month life of Expo . <P> " The lasting impact of Expo 67 , " intoned the usually low-keyed Pearson , " will be in the dramatic object lesson we see before our eyes today-that the genius of man knows no national boundaries , but is universal . " As he spoke , church bells chimed throughout Montreal , fireboats in the river blasted streams of water into the air , a flight of jet planes screamed overhead , and a fusillade of fireworks splashed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that carried the flags of each of the 62 participating nations . <P> " First Category . " Thus began the greatest international exposition ever-the most spacious ( 6,000 acres ) , the costliest ( $1 billion ) , the most imaginative and likely to be the most visited ( some 10 million people are expected , twirling the turnstiles 35 million times ) . Since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert opened London 's Great Exhibition in 1851 , there have been dozens of " world 's fairs . " Some have left unforgettable landmarks ( most notably , the Eiffel Tower from Paris ' Exposition in 1889 ) ; some have simply left scars ( the dilapidated architectural skeletons and sour aftertaste from the shill 's paradise that was New York 's 1964-65 fair ) . Only a handful have come near equaling the majesty of Brussels ' classic production in 1958 . <P> Expo 67 , however , looks every bit as good as its superenthusiastic promoters promised ( see following color pages ) . For one thing , the International Bureau of Exhibitions , which has been refereeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " First Category Exposition " ( the first ever in the Americas ) , as opposed to a run-of-the-mill world 's fair , which emphasizes business exhibits and often-irksome commercialism . Beyond that , Expo 67 was dreamed up expressly to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Canada 's national birth , and thus is powered by the energies and imagination of a proud and thriving people who have long yearned to prove that their country is considerably more than the U.S. 's backwoods halfbrother . " Anyone who says we are n't a spectacular people should see this , " said Pearson . " We are witness today to the fulfillment of one of the most daring acts of faith in Canadian enterprise and ability ever undertaken . " And so it is.
