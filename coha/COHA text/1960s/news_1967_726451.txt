He was expected to fly to Cairo from the United Nations General Assembly session in New York . On July 13 Syrian President al-Attasi , Iraq President Aref , and Algerian President Boumedienne were all present in Cairo to confer with President Nasser and with each other . Earlier in the week , Jordan 's King Hussein had been to Cairo and Colonel Boumedienne had visited Damascus . New pattern emerging Meanwhile , United Nations chief truce observer , Lt. Gen.

Only the Syrians and Algerians have publicly repeated their wish " to continue the battle " as soon as possible to free Arab soil of Israeli troops . The United Arab Republic has invited the Soviet Warships at Port Said and Alexandria " to extend their visit indefinitely , " according to the Cairo newspaper Al Ahram . A kind of pattern is gradually emerging . Sober observers of the Mideast scene in both Arab lands and Israel now believe another round of fighting on a larger scale is possible . Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Jacob Malik 's visit to Cairo this week is believed to have been intended to warn the Arabs again , that if this happens , Russia- can give no belligerent aid . President Nasser , according to . Lebanese sources , has just told the pro-Nasser Leb* // *Arabs seek anti - Israel accord // anese politician Kamal Joumblatt that preparatiOne for a second round ' ' of fighting would require another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nasser is reported to have said , to complete the present house cleaning of Egypt 's armed forces and to prepare the ' new Russian arms for use . Time measured in weeks If this is true the diplomats of the big powers and of the Arabs and Israelis themselves have a few more weeks ' time to work toward some kind of peace  --  or at least an enforceable armistice . Algeria and Syria clearly want to fight . There is public agreement between Colonel Boumedienne and the Baath ( Arab socialist ) Party leadership in Syria that widespread guerrilla war should be waged in the Israeli-occupied part of Syria , in Sinai and in the Gaza Strip , and on the west bank of the Jordan River .

The Algerians may already have taken part , or may soon take part in guerrilla thrusts behind the Israeli lines in Sinai . Israeli intelligence is watching for the arrival of Algerian air or ground units in Damascus . President Nasser 's real position is still much of a mystery . The almost daily clashes on the canal , the night sea battle of July 11 , in which the Israelis reported destroying two Egyptian torp*lo:boats , may be part of Mr. Nasser 's answer to ' Algerian critics who accuse him of sOftness . The Soviets have openly said in inspired commentaries that President Nasser must reorganize his army and his political power structure along more Marxist lines if he is to benefit from Russian arms and advisers . Iraq 's President Aref , who reorganized his Cabinet this week , appears to sympathize with the Syrian-Algerian militants .

King Hussein was reported from London to be hoping against hope that the other Arab states will agree on how to recover Jerusalem and Jordan 's west bank area .
