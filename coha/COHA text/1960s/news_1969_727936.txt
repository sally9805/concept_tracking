txt The New Jersey Legislature meeting in a one-day special session tonight passed two waterfront anticrime bills designed to crack down on organized rackets said to be widespread on the Jersey piers . The two measures , which would extend the authority and licensing powers of the bistate Waterfront Commission , were part of a program of urban aid and crime control proposed by Gov . Richard .1 . Hughes in a special message ' on June 20 . The failure of the lawmakers to act on a long list of other proposals provoked the Democratic Governor into a slashing attack on the Republican-controlled Legislature at a news conference in his office tonight . He characterized the departure ' of the Legislature earlier in the evening as " the precipitous adjournment or flight from its duty . " " It took some responsible action but not nearly enough , " the Governor said . He said he was so disgusted by the " bedlam " of the Assembly that he had decided finally that a small , unicameral Legislature was advisable for New Jersey . He said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next January . The Governor had played a key role in shaping the present expanded bicameral Legislature ? 40 members in the Senate and 80 in the Assembly  --  at a constitutional convention in 1966 , but he said today that he had " made a mistake . " Having already been enacted by the State Senate , the two waterfront anticrime bills easily passed the Assembly . The first , approved by a vote of 57 to 1 , extends the regulatory licensing authority of the Waterfront Commission to warehouses and other peripheral facilities on the piers now outside its jurisdiction . The second would grant the commission authority to give its investigators all the powers of police officers in both New York and New Jersey . It passed by a vote of 53 to 0 , after assurances by its sponsors on both sides of the aisle that the targets of the measures were hoodlums and racketeers , and not the longshoremen or stevedores . Similar bills to expand the bistate agency 's powers have already been passed by the New York Legislature . But the Governor charged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another key proposal in his anticrime package , an intrastate antitrust law aimed at combating the infiltration or monopolization of legitimate business by organized criminals . And he scored the legislators , also for failing to act on a proposal that would give the state Public Utilities Commission strong regulatory powers over the garbage collection and disposal industry  --  an enterprise believed to be heavily infested with organized criminal elements . The Legislature passed two of the Governor 's less controversial proposals but failed to consider several others he said he felt were equally essential . It approved a bill that would lift , for a period of a year , the 6 per cent statutory ceiling on bonds sold by municipalities , school districts and similar public agencies . The measure is designed to help the public agencies compete in the money market with the generally higher interest rates in raising funds for needed facilities . The measure was approved in the Assembly by a vote of 63 to 5 , but only after Walter E. Pedersen , a Camden Republican , denounced it as the work of " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With its passage in the As sembly , by a vote of 48 to 15 , a $750,000 subsidy measure for assisting several bankrupt or financially ailing New Jersey bus companies also cleared the last legislative hurdle . The Senate had previously approved it . The Governor charged that the bill passed , however , only because about 10,000 bus riders were without transportation in Atlantic County , a Republican stronghold . The Governor 's major urban aid program was ignored , provoking him to remark that the Legislature had lost its claim to being a " responsible body . " The proposal would have produced an estimated $35-million in the first year by increasing the present tax rate on the net worth of bank , savings and loan and trust company stocks from three-quarters of I per cent to 2.25 per cent . Meanwhile , Governor Hughes signed into law a bill authorizing a referendum next November on a $271-million bond issue for use in building sewage treatment plants and acquiring reservoir sites . The bond issue proposal , which had bipartisan support , was described by the Governor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he promised to join with " all concerned citizens " in working for public approval of the bonds next November . The Governor vetoed a socalled service fee ranging from 50 cents to $2 on every passenger embarking from an airport in a municipality with a population of 100,000 or more . At the present time , this would apply only to Newark Airport . The airport passenger tax was ostensibly designed to provide new revenue for Newark , which faces a constant rise in property taxes and imminent fiscal crisis , and to a lesser extent for Elizabeth , which also provides part of the land on which the expanding airport is situated . The Governor formally vetoed a bill that would have banned trading stamps at gasoline stations , sparking a renewed threat of a statewide shutdown of service stations . Mr. Hughes formally returned the bill to the Legislature without his signature despite a threat by the New Jersey Gasoline Retailers Association to stage a " one-day shutdown . " Mr. Hughes had announced on June 20 he would veto the bill .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
