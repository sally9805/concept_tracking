txt With the bright hour of splashdown accomplished , the voyage to the moon added another laurel . to its crown . It became a harbinger of peace . From start to finish , from the day when President Kennedy decided on a moon landing by 1910 to the hour of great relief and rejoicing here in mid-Pacific , the American lunar program spanned two eras . It began in the cold war , in ' military competition with the Russians . It reached its nearly incredible goal here at a time when both superpowers were groping their way out of the cold war into an " era of negotiation , " trying to find the path toward nuclear-arms control and comparative peace . As the astronauts were coming back President Nixon caught the mood of the moment in a phrase : " I hope that when the next great venture into space takes place it will be one in which Americans will be joined by representatives of other countries , so that we can go together . . . . " That is why , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conquest , but adventures of exploration which tend to unite us all into one people , which we truly are . " The President was speaking informally . He had just finished working on what he described as piles of briefings for his round-the-world trip , the object of which was to finish laying the foundations for peace talks with the Soviet Union . The crucial arms-control talks were only weeks ahead . Perhaps the earlier mood of national pride over winning the moon race had given way in his mind to something bigger and less likely to invoke resentment of American power . " Those three brave men , " he said of the astronauts as they neared the earth , " are not just Americans . They represented all of mankind . " Mr. Nixon seemed to have been doing some thinking about criticisms of the lunar mission , once the most critical stages were over and the astronauts were coasting toward home .

" Sometimes we get very pessimistic about problems on earth . . . . So often we hear this can not be done . The problem is too great . ' But when I saw the President listed some of the achievements of the lunar flight . . . I realized that this is no time for the pessimists , this is the time for optimists , and idealists . .. . " I realized the kind of teamwork , the kind of scientific achievement , the kind of idealism that we saw in that space shot ? if we could just bring all that to bear on the problems of our environment , the problems of adequate food , health , and shelter . . . a fair share for everybody in this earth ? if that can be done , what a world we can create .

" Now I suppose that when ' we ' Rook at the world today and those great political differences that divide us and the war tha on , we sometimes would . . . say , Well , you are just dreaming . ' I do n't think so . . . . " I think every people in this world is a great people and a great country . If we think that way , we are going to go a long way . " As the President was musing in this stream-of-consciousness manner , speaking of the things that were on his mind , he was surrounded by earth problems and obstacles that were human and man-made rather than technical and subject to solving by engineers and computers . He had just been forced to order an additional $3.5 billion cut in his budget , where a variety of domestic programs had been cut to the bone . He still did not know whether Hanoi would respond to his first step of removing American troops from Vietnam , or whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence in Vietnam . The domestic program which he planned to announce to the nation shortly after returning from this trip would not be a major program of anything like the order of magnitude or quality that the moon shot represented . He seemed therefore to be talking more out of hope and faith than from decisions like that of President Kennedy to reach the moon by the end of the decade , But he also plainly thought that the path to a better life on earth led through foreign policypeacemaking  --  before it could reach economic development for cities and underdeveloped nations . He is known to think that as President he can . influence the course of peacemaking and that if successful there , the rest could follow much more quickly . There is no splashdown in sight for these humane and nontechnical missions . But Mr. Nixon obviously felt that the mood of success which broke out all over the Pacific waves and the television waves when the astronauts came down was a good omen for the remainder of his trip .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
