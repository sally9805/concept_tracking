txt As of today , 11 big-population states are tossups in a contest between Richard M. Nixon and Hubert H. Humphrey for the presidency . Outside these states , however , Mr. Nixon appears to have the broader base of support to build on . In all 50 states and the District of Columbia , Monitor political writers this week have assessed a Nixon-Humphrey confrontation . From their feel of the political climate in their own state the writers concluded that Mr. Nixon , as of now , would win 24 states with 206 electoral votes ; Mr. Humphrey would win 12 states plus the District of Columbia with 105 electoral votes . ( Needed to win are 270 electoral votes . ) Three Southern states  --  Alabama , Louisiana , and Mississippi  --  were given to George C. Wallace . These states have 27 electoral votes . Significantly , most of the big-population , pivotal states were placed in the toss-up category . Thus , California , Illinois , New York , and Pennsylvania are included with 11 states with 200 electoral votes in which Monitor writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning to Mr. Humphrey was found in New York but not enough to take it out of the tossup category . This points up the important fact that , as of now , the outcome of a Nixon-Humphrey controntation still depends on where the big states with big urban centers finally decide to go . During the 1964 election year Monitor writers made a number of similar assessments of the Johnson-Goldwater contest . These " listening post " appraisals  --  which come from day-to-day , intimate contacts by Monitor writers with the leaders and voters of each state  --  were remarkably accurate in 1964 . The Monitor assessments are interesting when read within the context of the recent Gallup Poll , which shows Mr. Humphrey as beating Mr. Nixon in a presidential test election . Gallup gives 42 percent of the vote to Mr. Humphrey , 36 to Mr. Nixon , and 14 to Mr. Wallace . But it is pointed out that Gallup 's poll // *If Nixon vs . Humphrey : big states in doubt // reflects a national vote , while the Monitor assessment is state by state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be from the electoral vote , state by state . Thus , there is growing evidence that the big-city vote well may shape the choice of the vice-presidential candidate on both sides of the ticket . Thus , this well might influence Mr. Nixon , if he is the GOP candidate , to move in the direction of a Percy ( with Illinois influence ) as a running mate . Among Democrats there doubtless will be increasing pressure to get Sen. Edward M. Kennedy on the ballot with Mr. Humphrey . And back on the Republican side there will be growing talk among Republican leaders that Nelson A. Rockefeller , not Mr. Nixon , would be the GOP presidential candidate most likely to win in New York , Illinois , Pennsylvania , California and other states that are heavily populated with Negroes , ethnic groups , and the poor . Neither Mr. Nixon nor Mr. Humphrey is running away with the election in any state at this time . Who gets which states However , Mr. Nixon seems to have a strong edge in Iowa , Maine , Nebraska , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds a similarly strong position among the voters of Minnesota and Missouri . The 24 Nixon states , as of now , as Monitor writers see it : Arizona , Colorado , Florida , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Michigan , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Mexico , North Dakota , Ohio , Oklahoma , South Carolina , South Dakota , Texas , Utah , Vermont , and Wisconsin . The 12 Humphrey states : Arkansas , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Missouri , Rhode Island , Tennessee , Washington , and West Virginia , plus the District of Columbia . The 11 ' toss-up " states : Wyoming , Alaska , California , Connecticut , Illinois , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Oregon , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . It is interesting to note that Mr. Humphrey scored better than did Mr. Nixon in the South and border areas . Mr. Nixon picked up Florida , South Carolina , and Kentucky . But writers saw Mr. Humphrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia . This appears to be the result of the Wallace candidacy . In the South he seems to take away more votes from Mr. Nixon than he does from the Democratic candidate . The important issue in the campaign , the writers reported , was crime in the streets . Should there be a summer of rioting Mr. Nixon would be the probable beneficiary of the reaction . The Vietnam war was not seen as having a major impact on a Nixon-Humphrey contest .
