GOP Unity Silvers ' 64 Cloud By Richard L. Strout Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor Chicago Republicans ended their national committee meeting here knee-deep in harmony . There was no question but what morale had improved . They had solved their most immediate problem ? leadership transition : and they were postponing other problems to a national conference later this year . They could even find humor in their predicament . Committee members listened to Thomas Benum. an opinion-research analyst , who had been hired to assess GOP troubles . " You are an embattled mi- nority , " Mr. Rennin explained to the warring factions with cheerful frankness . " Difficult as it may he to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was gallantry also , in defeat . The 132 members rose and applauded as Barry Goldeat cc , in a lighting speech , took lull blame for defeat . - It was my fault . " he said . He went through the list of criticisms of the 1964 campaign . " They were it y responsibility , " he said again and again . " I accept the full responsibility . " His voice changed as he added . " I am sorry so mai.y good men went clown with me . ' ' Mr. Goldwater , a private citizen now but a still familiar figure , stood at the dais in the ornate hotel ballroom . His prot ? g ? , Dean Burch . had been ousted as national chairman . as of next April 1 . to be replaced by Ray C. Bliss of Ohio . while rjonc tactfully it was nc% crthcloss the penalty meted out for disast IOUs defeat , But neither Mr. Goldy.tater nor Mr. Burch showed sullenness or personal rancor . Indeed . Mr. Goldwater cited a different opponent , big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not fighting the Democratic National Committee : we were fighting the federal government . " He asserted that the full force of big government had been mobilized against him and that this process is only now beginning . Citing what he called administration retaliation , he told the GOP committeemen , " You are going to feel it in your business . " " Keep the criticism on , the heat on , " he said in reference to President Johnson . " If he lust listens lo us long enough I think we 'll make a good President out of him . " Mr. Goldwater warned that he does not think the dollar is " sound . " He sees " a rapidly deteriorating situation around the world . " Unexpected Cash Just the same , Republicans left Chicago feeling better . The disagreeable first meeting after defeat was over . They also found more money than expected in their treasury , and now there was no direction to go but up . The Negro defection is one of the big unreso1 ed problems . In a powerful speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Negro in the South is going to vote , and when they do their vote is going to be more im ' portant in the South than in New York , Chicago , or other big cities . " The Negro Republican vote in Kentucky , he said , dropped from " 46 percent in 1962 to 3 ' percent in 1964 , " carrying down Republican candidates with it . Segregationists Added The unresolved Republican dilemma in personal terms is dramatized by the " bonus " membership which the national committee awards to states which make Republican gains in elections . Under Goldwater leadership such gains were made in the three Southern states , and three segregationist Republicans were added by the committee : John E. Grenier , Alabama ( author of the so-called " Southern strategy " of the GOP campaign ) : Wirt A. Yerger Jr . of Mississippi , and J. Drake Edens Jr . of South Carolina . Richard M. Nixon . a conspicuous figure here . also stressed the importance of winning back Negro and other minority votes . without permission .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
