RAKOSSY by Cecelia Holland . 243 pages . Atheneum. $5.75 . <P> The old adage , " He who has a Hungarian for a friend does not need an enemy , " may well be a national slander , but it proves true enough in the case of Jnos Rakssy , the tough , devious hero of this historical novel . The Hungarians were latecomers to Western Europe , drifting in from southern Russia in the 9th century , and they were so often friendless that it is a wonder they lasted at all . Rakssy is set in one of the worst times of trouble for the Magyars-when Suleyman the Magnificent and his Turkish Janissaries swept up through the Balkans in 1525 and made pilaff of the Hungarian chivalry at the battle of Mohcs . The Magyars were beaten so swiftly that Suleyman at first refused to believe he had really met and destroyed the national army of Hungary . <P> Novelist Holland 's hero helps explain the Magyar weakness . The great Baron Rakssy and the other lords have just crushed a peasant rebellion and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Catharine de Buez , who is related to the Habsburg emperor , and he gets her ; for good measure , he seduces her sister and slays her brother-in-law . He also has his eye on the neighboring castle of Vrath and gets it as well , by trickery rather than force of arms . By this time , not only the peasants are muttering that Rakssy must have a pact with Satan . But Rakssy is directly in the route of the Turkish invasion , and in two splendid battle pieces , his own castle and Vrath are stormed by the Turks . As sole survivor , Rakssy hunts down and kills a final Magyar enemy and then rides mindlessly to his own death against Turkish cavalry . <P> Although Hungarian history is studded with Rakssys ( the most celebrated led a revolt against Austria in the 18th century ) , this particular baron is fictional . Still , the character and the story have the ring of authenticity . Author Holland got her expertise at the Connecticut College for Women , where she specialized in the Hungarian Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in her fine first novel , Firedrake ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) , Cecelia Holland writes a spare , masculine prose and applies the technique of the good U.S. western to her feudal lords . She avoids the stage-prop flummery that clutters so many historical novels , and in her dialogue she steers a middle course between the " Prithee , m'lord " school and modern idiom . Most surprising of all , she is only 23 years old .
