Even as the U.S. proudly hailed Apollo 7 and its crew , the Soviets launched an impressive reminder that they are still running hard in the race to the moon . With no advance fanfare , Russia 's tenth manned spacecraft , Soyuz 3 , soared into orbit , piloted by fledgling Cosmonaut Colonel Georgy Beregovoy , 47 . On the craft 's very first pass around the earth , he made a rendezvous with Soyuz 2 , an unmanned spacecraft that had been fired aloft the dav before . <P> As always , Soviet officials were cautious and cryptic when they reported the results of the maneuver . The two ships , they said , had closed to within 650 feet of each other under " automatic control . " Then Beregovoy took over and flew even closer . Whether he actually completed docking was not made clear . <P> Not until the Soviets , in their own good time , release more information will U.S. space scientists be certain of the significance of the flight . It is the first manned Russian space mission since April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash of Soyuz 1 . It seems almost certain that it is ultimately aimed at the moon ; for one thing , the time is not right for a trip to any of the planets . <P> The Russians may be merely practicing hook-up procedures , a maneuver that U.S. spacemen have already perfected , or building an earth-orbiting space station . Indeed , there were suggestions that before the week ended a third capsule might be launched to join the first two . But the Russians may also be assembling the pieces of a composite spaceship , bound for the moon . U.S. space experts studied that technique years ago and abandoned it as too expensive . The Soviets ' last space shot , a circumlunar mission powered by a giant booster , suggested that they too had made the same decision . Now , no one can be sure . U.S. spacemen could only watch , wait and worry about where they stand in the lunar sweepstakes.
