Lyndon Johnson is not the only Western leader to suffer the slings and arrows of criticism by vociferous intellectuals . As West Germany 's election campaign gathers momentum , Chancellor Ludwig Erhard is also hearing the wrath of eggheads . Their complaint is hardly so dramatic an issue as Viet Nam is in the U.S. ; they grumble that der Dicke and his party have been in power far too long , seem to suggest that there is far too much German prosperity for the good of the German soul . <P> The complainers are mostly the left-leaning writers and thinkers of Group 47 , whose informal club includes such bestselling writers as Novelist Gnter Grass ( The Tin Drum ) and Playwright Rolf Hochhuth ( The Deputy ) . They think that Willy Brandt and his Socialists would be a welcome change . Grass is currently on a campaign tour for Brandt . Twenty-five leading writers have contributed to a campaign book entitled Pleadings for a New Government . Grass 's contribution was a partisan poem , Hochhuth 's an essay in pseudo economics arguing that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being lulled into impotence by their proliferating cars , " which they can pay for but can not afford . " What 's more , declared Hochhuth , Erhard was to blame for the low state of German education and science , and for the high rate of deaths in childbirth . <P> When Hochhuth 's article appeared in the weekly Der Spiegel , Erhard , ever sensitive to personal criticism , could restrain himself no longer . " Today it has become fashionable for poets to be social critics , " he exploded in a speech at Dsseldorf . " If they are , it is of course their good democratic right . But then they must permit themselves to be addressed as they deserve-as philistines and nitwits who pass judgments about things which they simply do not understand . " In another speech he snapped that Hochhuth was a kleiner Pinscher ( small terrier ) . As for Grass , Erhard growled : " There is a kind of intellectualism that can turn into idiocy . " <P> Delighted at having drawn blood , Group 47 's leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chancellor 's lack of self-control is shocking . " " Embarrassing , embarrassing , " clucked Writer Heinrich Boll . Der Dicke was unrepentant , but political aides with an eye out for his electoral image prevailed on the Chancellor to issue a clarification . A spokesman declared that Erhard 's statements did not mean that he " disassociates himself from novelists and writers or the world of intellect as such , " but were only a criticism of " polemic campaign contributions and direct attacks . " <P> <P> Germany 's long , hot , campaign summer leading up to the election on Sept. 19 is well under way .
