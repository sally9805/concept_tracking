As the rainy season ended in Southeast Asia , the time of decision began . <P> In SOUTH VIET NAM , the Communist guerrillas have doubled their strength in the past six months and seem able to muster a battalion-sized force at any point they choose , strike with it , and be gone before the road-bound army of President Ngo Dinh Diem can retaliate . Washington expects at any time a Communist announcement that the western plateau of South Viet Nam , next to the Laos border , is " liberated territory , " complete with a " capital ' ' and a Communist government . Should it happen , Washington suggested last week , the U.S. will dispatch regimental combat teams to help train the South Viet Nam regulars and , if necessary , to fight . <P> In LAOS , the decay of the U.S. position has gone ever further . From the beginning , Washington hoped somehow to avoid having to accept Prince Souvanna Phouma as Premier of Laos . Last week the hope went glimmering .

Worse , it seems evident that U.S.-supported General Phoumi Nosavan will be fobbed off with a minor cabinet post-or with none at all . His Royal Laotian Army is better trained and equipped than it was at the time of the cease-fire last May . But the most optimistic Western observers doubt whether it is yet a match for the Communist Pathet Lao , which has been continuously supplied by Soviet airlift . Commented a U.S. expert : " The problem is still one of leadership , and without that Laotians have no will to fight . "
