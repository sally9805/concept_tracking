The people who have been writing these things that annoy me have been talking about a 3,000-mile , high-angle rocket , shot from one continent to another , carrying an atomic bomb , and so directed as to be a precise weapon , which would land exactly on a certain target , such as a city . I say , technically I do n't think anybody in the world knows how to do such a thing , and 1 feel confident it will not be done for a very long period of time to come . I wish the American public would leave that out of their thinking . <P> - Dr . Vannevar Bush , Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development December 1945 <P> Even then , a few brilliant U.S. scientists and military leaders were thinking about little else but the feasibility of a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile . Yet because of the arguments-like Bush's-against it , it was not until May 1954 , just ten years ago next week , that the Air Force launched a crash program to develop the Atlas ICBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ensuing decade of strategic missilery , the U.S. has accomplished one of the greatest scientific , engineering and construction feats in history . It has produced and deployed a versatile flock of big birds : the pioneering Atlas , the more powerful two-stage Titan , the stopgap IRBMs Thor and Jupiter , and those truly pushbutton solid-fueled mainstays of the nuclear arsenal , the mass-produced Minuteman and the elusive , submarine-borne Polaris . <P> The Navy had such heroes as Vice Admirals William Raborn Jr . and Hyman Rickover in development of the Polaris system . The Army 's German-born Wernher von Braun pushed Jupiter before turning to space research . All of the other projects were Air Force-and no one in blue has the slightest doubt about who whiplashed those massive projects . He is the deceptively quiet and young-looking General Bernard Schriever , 53 ( TIME Cover , April 1 , 1957 ) , boss of the Air Force Systems Command . What Schriever does is develop the missiles until they are declared operational , train the missile crews , then turn everything over to the Strategic Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials as Brigadier General John W. Sessums and Research and Development Specialist Trevor Gardner had insisted that an ICBM should be built , and Princeton Atomic Scientist Dr. John von Neumann had argued that nuclear explosives could be made compact enough for missile delivery . <P> Evasive Action . Despite the size of Schriever 's task , there was nothing grand about his facilities when he was named commander of the obscurely titled Western Development Division and sent to Inglewood , Calif. , in 1954 . He set up shop in three buildings of a Roman Catholic parochial school that had been abandoned because they were not modern . The staff always wore civvies , shuttled in and out of a side door , lunched at a sidewalk hot-dog stand dubbed " the officers ' club . " Inglewood neighbors stared and wondered . " I never had to take so much evasive action , " recalls Schriever.
