138 GOODNIGHT ROSEMARIE 11:08 p.m. ? Rosemarie interrupts my armchair nap : " Do n't you think you 'd better watch this ? " Huntley is interviewing Brinkley . Tuesday , August 6th Night session : Thomas E. Dewey , Congressman Gerry Ford , and Senator Everett Dirksen torment the English language ; the world will little note nor long remember what they say here . ( I spotted one delegate cupping his ear as if actually interested , but from his facial expression decided he was nursing an earache . ) Not their words but certain indelible impressions remain of the old pro-pols decorating the hall : Tom Dewey , gone to beef and still rationing that slightly foolish grin , retains the ability to take the excitement out of an earthquake simply by showing up to watch it . Congressman Ford is the human equivalent of bread pudding : bland , colorless , outwardly dry , slightly spongy as one plumbs the depths . Senator Dirksen 's face is where God has kept His record of mankind 's sins ; his voice beckons the innocent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two meteorites harder than marble ( though not quite as bright ) collided in outer space at supersonic speeds , and there sprang into being Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina . The Old Confederacy , The Earth : fully grown , proclaiming wrath , understanding nothing . Ex-Senator Bill Knowland of California , bull-voiced and pugnacious even in prayer , comes off like a former Big Ten guard now running for President of Rotary International on a promise to stamp out beards . If Nelson Rockefeller really thinks he 's nominatable at this time and in this place , he should watch more television . Wednesday , August 7th 4:48 p.m. ? " It 's going to go down as one of the greatest conventions the American public has witnessed , " predicts Senator Charles Percy of Illinois . Goodnight , Chuck . 5:50 p.m. ? Mrs. Ivy Baker Priest Stevens , State Comptroller of California and former U. S. Treasurer , nominating Governor Reagan , slips in lauding Ronnie 's " million dollar  --  er. vote victory . " Future Hell is promised looters , draft-dodgers , campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big-spending bureaucrats . Bankers are apparently safe , thank God . 6:36 p.m. ? Ex-Senator Knowland , also a Reagan supporter , touts delegates off Nixon by warning that first-ballot nominations would have deprived the nation of such great Presidents as Rutherford B. Hayes and James Garfield . This fails to touch off the expected panic . 7:07 p.m. ? The Governor of Alaska is nominated for President with delivery of the convention 's most precious line " Wally Hickel is n't afraid to make waves . " 7:49 p.m. ? Florida 's Governor Claude Kirk , who on opening day had indistinguished himself through a speech fearlessly endorsing orange juice , is asked his preference for Vice President and selflessly thinks of others : " Well , my mother wants me and I 'll go along with her . " 8:20 p.m. ? Riots across Biscayne Bay . Fires . Stonings . Cars overturned . Two or three dead . Only this morning Tony Martin sang " The Glory of Love " while Senator George Murphy did an impromptu soft-shoe. 9:06 p.m. ? Nelson Itockefeller 's last forlorn hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of striking enough verbal thunder and lightning to melt Old Guard stone . So out comes Pennsylvania 's Governor Ray Shafer , a cross between a Groton Headmaster and Charlie McCarthy , who sounds as if he 's quoting the Pittsburgh phone book . 10:15 p.m. ? Governor Agnew nominates Richard Nixon , though for a moment  --  when he declared that " The nation needs a man to fit the times " ? Rosemarie shouted he was switching back to Rocky . 11:18 p.m. ? J. Robert Stassen , a Minnesota delegate , nominates his Uncle Harold . Delegates cheer when Mr. Stassen announces the family plans no floor demonstration . 1:09 a.m. ? Technically , it 's tomorrow . Somewhere along the way Senator Clifford Case was nominated for being " loved and respected across the length and breadth of New Jersey , " that great Chinese-American Hiram L. Fong of Hawaii was offered , and we ran out of wine . 1:10 a.m. ? Rosemarie bolts the convention for bed . 1:50 a.m. ? Nixon 's The One . 1:52 a.m. ? Rosemarie sleepily requests the Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close up , rather than on a TV screen .

" Thursday , August 8th Noonish or so  --  Nixon recommends for Vice President one Spiro T. Agnew . Where are you now that we need you , Hiram L. Fong ? Wally Rickel , make a wave ! 1:43 p.m. ? " Uncle Spiro 's The Two , " I say . Rosemarie stares , uncomprehending . " You got ta he kidding ! " she shouts , becoming in that moment The Voice of America . 8:22 p.m. ? Ronald Reagan is back in the bleacher seats , just another Swell Guy with a 1937 haircut in a white coat and wearing his Nixon button ; just another slugger from the Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson Rockefeller has earlier appeared before the convention , donating another little slice of his soul to Party Unity , handing the scoundrels his sword , going home at least four Presidential years older and six million dollars poorer not counting cuts and bruises . Delegates gave him a two-minute ovation and called it a decent burial . 9:07 p.m. ? The hall has long stirred with rumors that New York 's Mayor John Lindsay will contest the Agnew nomination . " This convention is coming apart , " John Chancellor proclaims for NBC . Now , John , you 've talked to one New Yorker too many ; look around at the old Midwestern dough-faces in their flat Nixon skimmers , at the calm way Ev Dirksen sits there digesting his supper Scotch , at the brittle little dragon ladies impatiently puffing their filtertips , at the lean Bright Young Men in their corporate collars , and you will see there is not one insurrectionist bone in a carload. 9:11 p.m. ? Lindsay endorses Spiro Agnew in a stilted , dime-store Churchill style tinged with overtones of unctuous Episcopalian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratefully escapes into the night . 9:17 p.m. ? The delegates are all shapes and sizes ( if not colors ) , though one most remembers the old dough-faces with their flat straw skimmers and sightless Orphan Annie eyes . Fred there , he owns the hardware store and has scientific proof that the kind of infantile paralysis that afflicted FDR slowly rotted the brain  --  just like syphilis . Ole Bill tells the funniest stories you ever heard , sings tenor in the Baptist choir , owns a few rent I houses and loans money at extra-special rates to the niggers ; he 's the finest old boy you ever seen by Larry L. King 139 but do n't cross ' im or he 'll skewer you on his pocketknife . Sam , the one whose false teeth fit a shade too casually , suffers from gall stones and from the way that gang in Washington has ruined his hired hands by coddling them with a minimum wage and unemployment insurance . Carl owns the weekly newspaper and is best remembered for his hard-hitting grocery ads . J. B. owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generous slice of his Congressman . When you see a Senator or a Governor or a Congressman dancing to some secret music , these are the unseen old spooks piping the tunes . So George Romney , of course . suffers one last and sadly glorious humiliation ; for unlike ancient elephants The Old Boys do not come to the burial grounds to die but to slaughter . 10-ish p.m. ? Rosemarie and I wager on the music King Richard will select for his Grand Entry Theme . She selects " I Believe in Yesterday , " then berates me for frivolity when I nominate " Dark Town Strutter 's Ball . " The music is not " Dixie " ( which may have been the only decision Strom Thurmond lost ) but when Nixon enters to the strains of " Buckle Down Winsocki " it is funnier than anything we 'd thought of . So there they are on the platform , Dick and Pat , together again , incredibly durable ghosts from another time , the great dazzling spotlight mercifully blinding them to what they have become . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows something of where they have been : the midnight compromises and the mandatory a.k. - ing , the insane grins and the eternal hot pursuit of " the impossible dream , " the sapping rituals and excesses of their peculiar trade . The Nixon daughters are there of course ( for we demand the sacrifice of Abraham on our political altar ; we want to see Isaac 's blood ) , Tricia a vision in virgin white and Julie  --  with her David lke  --  all so determined , a neat , sweet throwback to the bobby-sox era , that one wonders where they rented their costumes . When the time comes I shall pity Hubert and Muriel the same hard journey . 10:50 p.m. ? I believe Dick Nixon dissipates pity quicker than any other of God 's children . For in stepping up to accept the crown , Big Daddy invokes Dwight D. Eisenhower 's tired old heart ( " Let 's win this one for Ike ! " ) so as to somehow imply that if Winsocki will only buckle buckle down then ancient cardiac scars shall miraculously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth coats shall once more be in fashion , and somewhere in dog Heaven the faithful Checkers shall wag his tail in glee . Goodnight America , wherever you are . Harper 's Magazine , November 1968 JACK FROST a story by John Thompson " It 's getting all night out , " Dick said . Dick 's blackboard leaned three-legged against the wall by the back door . Through the furred belt of weather-stripping packed around the door and the rug folded against the door 's base . the cold touched his left cheek ; from the other side the warm oven breathed on him . The dry chalk dust made him clamp his front teeth together . Dottie was playing on the floor . " Yes Dickie , " his mother said . It is . " The good cowboy stood solid as a rock , his spurred boots firm on the ground . He was wearing chaps with knots on them and a bandanna and a white cowboy hat . He had bullets in his belt and a hunting knife . His horse was looking in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side . The bad cowboy was also wearing chaps with knots on them , and an ammunition belt with a hunting knife , and a bandanna . He had a black hat on , and he wore a black mask over his eyes . In front of the good cowboy 's gun , a ring of smoke puffed . Through its center , leaving streaks in the air , passed a heavy bullet . Overhead the sun was shining . Dick drew the sunbeams which struck from it in every direction . Since this was out West , the sun was exceedingly bright . Dick drew beams like bright spokes in three ranks concentrically shining . " Oh that 's good Dick , " Mrs. Alford said . " You 're such a good artist . You are . Another artist will make pictures for us tonight too . " " Who , " Dick said . The bullet would shoot the bad cowboy straight in the heart . Since it is impossible to bandage the heart , the bad cowboy would be dead . " Jack Frost will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He will make lace and ferns and fairy castles for us to see in the morning . " " Is Jack Frost a real man , Mamma ? " Dick said . He drew a cactus with spikes on it A bright electric bulb in a fluted glass bowl hung from the ceiling on a green cord , between the narrow , high , butterscotch-colored walls and the tall doors and moldings of varnished oak . It shone against the end of the short Michigan December day . It shone brightly on Ellen Al-ford 's white brow . Her black , thin hair was drawn straight back . The high ridge of her brow was smooth and white . The light cast shadows over her eyes . " Is he ? " Dick said . Her skirt and her long white apron hung to the tops of her laced shoes . She was a small woman . She had to reach up to put her hand in the oven . The gas range stood high against the wall on its cast-iron Chippendale legs , black , angular , upright ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were head-high to Mrs. Alford . The old gas lamp with a perforated mantel rather like an ice-cream cone stuck out from one side of its hood . " Is Jack Frost really true , Mamma , " Dick said . The oven door stood open in its black iron frame . Its thick panel of glass was tempered to a cloudy topaz . Below the oven on the black door of the broiler a large scrolled nickel-plated script slanted upward . It said DETROIT . Dottie was still playing on the floor . " Is he , Mamma , " Dick said . " Is Jack Frost a real man . " Mrs. Alford stood by the oven door . The warm iron was breathing into the room . " Mamma , " Dick said . The light cast dark shadows over her eyes . She tried to look at him but her eyes missed him and looked at the door , looking more or less at the glass where it was getting dark outside . " Mamma , " Dick said , " is he ? " Her high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair pulled at it . Her eyes were dark . Perhaps she was looking at the window that held the winter refrigerator . The kitchen light shone in on the white shelves there between the two panes of glass , shining on everything the refrigerator held . On the inner pane leaned the brown of the high walls , the white ofthe oilcloth of the kitchen table , the white of Mrs. Alford 's long apron . The outer glass behind the shelves was dark and clear . Out of its cold depths the garage at the back of the yard made a square white shadow . All down the street now and all over Grand Rapids the lights of all the houses would be spilling thinly into the backyards under the cold brushy spikes of the bare trees . In the valley , the lighted streetcars would be snubbing up and down . They moved along Monroe Avenue past the stores and then away between the hills . Soon the headlamps of the automobiles would be moving in procession up the long hills under the street lights and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon Mr. Alford would cover all his typewriters and turn out the lights and lock the door and drive home up Fulton Street hill , moving east . " Dick , " she said . The oven door was still open . Her face was turned to the window . Ellen Alford was forty . This is the age at which all the gifts of youth have been spent , and whatever has been purchased with them must be assembled to last the rest of one 's life . " Mamma , " Dick said . " What I want to know is . " " I 'm , " Mrs. Alford said . " Watch Dottie a minute , Dick , be . " She went into the dining room and the swinging door closed behind her . He could hear her walk across the living room . He heard her climb the stairs . Her feet on the stairs sounded as if she were walking inside the kitchen closet . Then she would go into her bedroom and sit in the chair . It would be cold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . The bad cowboy was a robber . He wanted to steal the other cowboy 's cattle and butcher them . But the other cowboy chased him on his horse . They rode for about a hundred miles ; their horses galloped at top speed . When she came back , Dick said , " I just wanted to know is Jack Frost a real man . " She was looking at him then . " Oh like fairy tales , Pickle , " she said . Her face was smiling . She bent to him and her forehead came down , shining , white , and smooth . Under her straight black hair her head was white ; it showed through tinder her hair . Let the bad cowboy lie there dead , with the black mask over his eyes . Barn , the gun had gone , and Barn , Barn , again . " You know , Dickie , " she said . Whenever she smiled the smile welled and did not ebb from her face for a long time . The darkness of her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She kissed Dick 's head where his hair was thatched around his cowlick , and then put her face against his cheek . 142 JACK FROST Her face was cool and damp like a milk bottle . When she stood up , she was still smiling . She went back to the stove , and in her long white apron , she was very small against the high tiers of black iron . The hinge of the oven door gave its immemorial creak , closing , and the warm iron breathed out . Mrs. Alford opened the window and took some dishes out of the winter refrigerator , and she worked at the stove . Dick drew the horned head of a cow looking in over the hill . Behind the hill there were hundreds of them . A vast herd of cows , fat and gentle , fed there on the prairie under the bright sun . Dick drew the heads looking over the hill . They all belonged to the good cowboy , and there were about a million of them . Where the long cylinder of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dottie was playing . Its slippery tan diamonds glittered under the electric light . She kept pushing her fat waist against it and hoisting one leg . Each time her leg slid down , she fell back on the floor on the pad of her diapers . She wore knit blue coveralls . " D , I , C , K , " said Dick . " Spells Dick . There . " " That 's fine , Dickie , " his mother said . " That 's really very fine . Now look at this , A , L. Al . F , 0 , R , D , Ford . Al-ford . See . " " That 's easy , " Dick said . " I can do that easy . " " See how she 's trying , Dick , " Mrs. Alford said . " Do n't disturb her . See . She is determined to learn to climb over . Look . She 's doing it like a lesson . " " Look , Mamma , " Dick said . " A , L , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , Dottie " Mrs. Alford said . " That 's good . " Dottie toppled and slid over the roll into the pantry . She squatted there , looking up . " That 's good , Dottie , " Mrs. Alford said . Dick ran to the roll of linoleum and hopped over and back , first with both feet and then on one foot . Dottie crouched , looking up . " My how you can jump , Diekie , " Mrs. Alford said . " Dottie thinks you 're so big and strong . " " What are you doing ? " Sister said . " What 's that ? " She dropped her stack of books on the table , The air around her was cold . Her scarf was tied over her head , and her cheeks were red . John Thompson teaches English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and is the author of two books , " The Founding of English Metre " and " The Talking Girl and Other Poems . " Her eyes watered . She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height ; in another year Sister would be as big as her mother . They held one another . " Your cheeks have turned to ice ? Oh , your fin-gers are icicles . The Snow Queen has touched you . Show Dick and Dottie . See how cold Sister is . " " Ouch . How come you 're so cold , " Dick said . " Ouch , how come , " Dottie said . " Oh shut up , " Dick said . " That 's not nice , " Sister said . Sister wore her long brown hair brushed back and braided in a thick braid down her back . She wore black wool stockings . " Well , " Dick said . " She does n't have to be a copycat all the time . " " Shut up is rode , " Sister said . " Is n't it , Mother ? " " Yes , it 's rude , Sister . Rut Dickie does n't mean to be rude on purpose . " " What 's that ? " Sister said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , Sister , I bought some new linoleum !

" you could have a white horse then named Lightning , no , named Star . " " Look , Sister , " Mrs. Alford said . " See how Dick writes his name . Is n't that fine ? " " Oh that 's good . Did you just learn that , Dick ? It 's good . The D is supposed to have a curl at the top like this . In school they wo n't let you write uphill like that . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very clever , is n't it , Sister ? Are n't you proud of him , " Mrs. Alford said . " Now do n't rub it out , Dick . You can show Daddy what you 've learned today . " " Does Daddy know how to read this ? " " What do you mean ? " " Well . I do n't know , " Dick said . The chalk dust coated his fingers and made him grit his teeth . " Now get on with your homework , Sister , " Mrs. Alford said . " Supper is really all ready . You go ahead . " " I would have a white horse named Lightning , " Dick said . " Then yours could be Star . "
