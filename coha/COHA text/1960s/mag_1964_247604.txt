If Paris designers never look back , it may be because they have a feeling something is gaining on them . If something is , it is probably Italian designers , every one of whom is aware that he can make up some yardage only by being even a little more daring than the French . <P> Suspenders , No Straps . Thus it was naturally Italy 's Emilio Pucci , lightweight sportswear champion of the world , who predicted that it would not be long before bikini wearers , dissatisfied with halfway measures and interrupted suntans , would drop their modest pretensions along with the tops of their suits . And though the U.S. 's Rudi Gernreich was the first to snatch the idea off the rack and get it on the market ( TIME , June 26 ) , the evidence presented at the fall fashion collections in Florence last week showed that the Italians were not prepared to let the U.S. run off with the topless suit honors . <P> Paraded on the temporary runway installed in the staid old Pitti Palace , where Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multitude of styles and shapes . Some designs were legitimate , some looked more like gags : Micia tore holes that left a knitted overblouse looking like supersized Swiss cheese , showed a G-string bikini beneath to any mouse man enough to peep . Glans left only two prim pockets on an otherwise totally transparent shirt . Veneziani attached five-inch-wide suspenders to the waist of a party skirt and called it an evening gown ; Princess Irene Galitzine cut a V that kept going , fore and aft , out of a sleek leopard-printed swimsuit . Baldini decorated a perfectly modest little bathing suit with two prominent painted breasts . And Frederico Forquet un-topped them all with a full-length strapless dress that was minus more than straps , leaving the bosom up in the air and out in it . <P> Coveralls , No Show . But Pucci , who had started it all , was not about to yield the field . First to be bold , last to be undone by fellows who had followed the leader and left him behind , Pucci could only retreat or fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to do both , for a starter wrapped two pretty Negro mannequins in hoods and long silk burnooses that whipped off , without warning , to show patches of scanty bikinis underneath . <P> The topless suit ? With a shrug and a yawn , Pucci turned gentleman and traitor , offered women wary of fads or of catching a cold , a grand way to cover up . It is a one-piece coverall outfit that fastens down the front , has to be stepped into , and is so difficult to get out of that the sun is bound to go down before it does , leaving a beachful of spectators ogling in the dark .
