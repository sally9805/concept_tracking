In art stores and schools all over New York City last week , a manifesto turned up calling for a DEMONSTRATION . It was signed by two relatively unknown representational painters who were fed up with what seemed to them to be the Museum of Modern Art 's lopsided patronage of the abstract , the sensational , and even the absurd . The museum , said the document , " has developed the public image of the painter as a madly inspired child , rather than an adult human being . " <P> The DEMONSTRATION turned out to be some 30 angry young pickets , who showed up briefly Sunday afternoon to do their stuff in front of the museum . But they were not as alone as they seemed . Coincidentally , 22 of the nation 's top artists , including Edward Hopper . Henry Varnum Poor and Jack Levine , fired off a protest to Manhattan 's Whitney Museum of American Art . There were , said the artists , 145 paintings in the last Whitney Annual , and of these . " 102 were nonobjective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine paintings in which the image had not receded or disappeared . " The question the painters wanted answered : Are the museums being fair ?
