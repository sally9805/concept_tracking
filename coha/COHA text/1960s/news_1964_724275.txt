txt The Jaguar a spoils car with a top speed of 150 miles an hour , retails in the Chicago area for about $6.300 . But Andre Nireinberger , a local hairdresser , recently walked into a dealer 's showroom here and bought one of these English-made autos for only $4,732 . He got this bargain price by arranging to pick up his Jaguar in England . Two weeks ago Mr. Nireinberger arrived in London for a three week vacation , sales slip in hand , and since then lie 's been driving his flashy XK-E around England . Even after he gets through paying shipping charges back to the States and U.S. import duties he still will have saved about SI.100 against the Chicago retail price . Such savings help explain why the practice of buying foreign cars in this country and taking delivery on the other side of the Atlantic is growing more common . They 're being sold not only to tourists but also to American businessmen traveling abroad . Rootes Motors . Inc .. a British auto maker , estimates that more than 25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with fewer than 1,000 a decade ago . And one source predicts the number of such sales this year will exceed 30,000 . The trend encompasses foreign cars at all price levels . Volkswagen Co. estimates that it will make about 12,000 overseas deliveries of its inexpensive autos to U.S. residents this year . up from about 2.000 last year . MercedesBenz , some of whose models retail for $13,000 in the U.S .. expects to sell Americans 4.200 cars for European pickup this year , more than double the number sold five years ago . Lower Duty Part of the saving Americans can make by taking overseas delivery of a foreign car comes from lower U.S. import duties , since cars that already have been driven overseas are charged at a lower rate than brand new imports . How much lower depends on a number of factors , including the number of miles driven overseas , but one dealer figures that the average amount saved runs about 2% of the overseas list price . Other savings stem from the fact that cars delivered overseas are exempt from certain U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes in some states . But the largest part of the savings results from eliminating the commission normally paid to U.S. distributors and reduction of the commission paid to dealers by manufacturers . Overseas deliveries usually net dealers a little less than half what they make on a U.S. delivered sale . Despite the lower profit margin , many foreign car dealers figure an overseas deal is better than no deal at all . " We have to face the fact many of our customers want to pick up cars while they 're in Europe , " says an official of Imperial Motors , a suburban Chicago dealer . " So we handle the paper work . take a small commission and hope to get their service and other future business. - Regular dealers are getting competition from delivery agencies which specialize in arranging overseas pickups of foreign cars . AutoEurope . Inc .. New York , one of the largest delivery agencies , says its sales volume has climbed an average of 25% a year since its formation in 1954 . So far this year , the company says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field include Car-Tours-InEurope , Inc. , Europe-By-Car , and Kinney System Car Rentals and Sales Abroad . Inc. , a licensee of Kinney Service Corp .. the car rental and parking firm . Travel and Shipping The delivery agencies , like car dealers , work on commissions from car makers . As part of their services they sometimes handle travel accommodations for their customers and shipping arrangements for their cars . " They did a beautiful job for me , " declares a Chicago public relations executive who acquired a Hillman Minx convertible through Auto-Europe while he and his wife took a month 's vacation in Europe . In this case the arrangements were unusually complicated because the couple did n't want to go to England where the Hillman is made by Rootes Motors . So the agency had the car shipped to Rome , their first stop . " Our car was at a garage where they said it would be and it was ready to go , " says the executive . He and his wife drove the Hillman 1,500 miles from Rome along the Riviera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged for its shipment to Chicago . The overseas delivered price was $1,840. including the $200 added charge for special shipment from the English factory to Rome . Shipping charges from Paris to Chicago came to about $150 and the U.S. duty on the depreciated value of the car ran to a little over $100 . The total cost : About $2,100 , or $240 less than the Chicago retail price . In addition , the executive figures he saved about $200 of what it would have cost to rent the same car in Rome for the 1,500-mile trip .
