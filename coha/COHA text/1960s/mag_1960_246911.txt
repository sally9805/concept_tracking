THE GRASS ( 216 pp. ) - Claude Simon , translated by Richard Howard-Braziller($3.75) . <P> The best , and one of the most eccentric , of France 's New Realist writers is Claude Simon , author of the powerful and murky novel , The Wind ( TIME , April 13 ) . His current book is a little less powerful and somewhat more murky . Author Simon 's moody , fitful sentences blow on for a thousand words or so before subsiding . He qualifies each thought , hedges each qualification , follows divergent ideas out of sight through cat 's cradles of parentheses and dashes . He is as fond as Faulkner of the present participle . When it seems that he must stop , affix a period and begin a new sentence with " He said . . . " , Simon merely drops a comma to catch his breath and continues with " saying . . . " If Simon 's chapter-sentences are read quickly , and if the reader does not follow his natural inclination to stop and sort out thoughts and thinkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of frenzy and foreboding . <P> Through the haze , objects , people and fragments of speech are seen and heard with heightened clarity . Mood and character are conveyed with subtlety and force . But complicated events and relationships often are lost to view . <P> The fact mattered little in The Wind , in which only one character is of much importance . The Grass , which tells the story of the deterioration of a French provincial family , as an old aunt lies dying , is more intricate and less suited to Simon 's techniques . Parts of the book are brilliant-notably the scenes of bickering between the dying woman 's brother and sister-in-law . Realist Simon forces the reader to note precisely the tics and twitches of decaying minds , and to feel the texture of withering flesh . But something is lost when Simon 's subject is less elemental than death . The reader never really learns what is happening to the book 's narrator , the daughter-in-law of the bickering couple . The same uncertain fog enshrouds her husband-or is it her lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner sometimes seems to be the pointless result of a powerful technique thoughtlessly applied .
