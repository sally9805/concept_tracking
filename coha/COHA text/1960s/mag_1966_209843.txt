The world 's big powers have been battling quietly for months over how to improve the mechanisms for bankrolling international trade and investment . Their aim : to foster world prosperity , which could be damaged unless the amount of money available to finance world trade keeps pace with trade 's growth . Last week , Washington 's money managers sniffed a scent of victory for some of their ideas about accomplishing that aim through world monetary reform . <P> <P> Betting on the Price . A mixture of good and bad news provided the ground for their hope . A sharp rise in gold hoarding abroad has sent shivers through Europe 's finance ministries . The free world 's official stores of gold-in national treasuries and in the hands of such international bodies as the Inter national Monetary Fund , the Bank for International Settlements and the Euro pean Payments Union-fell by $40 million during the first nine months of 1965 . That was the first such drop in ten years . The IMF figures that the missing gold has flowed into the hands of rich speculators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This amounts to a bet that the world price of gold will rise , and it puts pressure on Europeans as well as the U.S. Treasury . Reason : both would lose if a crisis ended with devaluation of the dollar . <P> <P> On top of that , the IMF reported last week that international monetary reserves shrank during the first three quarters of last year from $68.9 billion to $68.88 billion while global exports rose 5% . In the long run , the expansion of prosperity-giving world trade requires growth , not shrinkage of those reserves , which are composed of gold , dollars , British pounds , and drawing rights at the IMF . <P> Points of Progress . European countries have been dragging their feet about monetary reform , partly because they contend that the U.S. and Britain must first bring their balance of payments in order . Last week brought word of progress from both nations . President John son reported that the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit fell from $2.8 billion in 1964 to no more than $1.3 billion last year . Britain revealed that belt tightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $772 million last year . <P> All these developments , Washington feels , will impel the rich nations in the so-called Group of Ten to hasten their efforts toward an agreement on a new international currency to supplement dollars , pounds and gold in world trade , as the U.S. has been urging . The problem , of course , is old , and even in the relatively uncomplicated days of 1720 , English Satirist Jonathan Swift recognized it in a memorable quatrain : <P> Money , the lifeblood of the nation , Corrupts and stagnates in the veins , <P> Unless a proper circulation <P> Its motion and its heat maintains . <P> <P> Swift 's insight still applies-246 years later-as few statesmen understand bet ter than the Group of Ten , a blue-ribbon panel of finance ministers and central-bank governors from Belgium , Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , The Netherlands , Sweden and the U.S. The group will shortly meet again in Paris , with its sights set on reaching a compromise agreement by March .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
