" It 's not an easy quartet to listen to , " <P> said the festival director . " But the Ojai audience has suffered a great deal in the past . They 're used to it . " <P> Difficult though it may be , the quartet that the long-suffering Ojai ( Calif . ) Festival audience heard last week has proved to be one of the most successful of modernist chamber works . At last week 's UNESCO-sponsored International Rostrum of Composers in Paris , it was voted the outstanding musical work of the season . Winner of Pulitzer Prize and of the 1961 New York Music Critics Circle award , it has been recorded ( by RCA Victor ) and in the single year since its premiere , it has been played at most of the major European festivals . In various program notes around the world , it is known as Quatuor Cordes No. 2 , or Streichquartess Nr. 2 , or simply String Quartet No. 2 , by New York 's Elliott Cook Carter . <P> To Ojai 's festival director , Composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not easy " but also " rather astonishing-an opinion shared by most people who have heard it . The astonishment derives in part from the fact that Modernist Composer Carter treats his four instruments as individuals with " individual behavior patterns . " The first violin is fantastic , ornate and mercurial , " while he second violin is " laconic and orderly " the viola merely " expressive . " and the cello " somewhat impetuous " <P> Only Fourness . Instead of developing in traditional patterns , the work grows out of the " interactions , combinations , cooperations and oppositions " of Carter 's four egocentric instruments , any one of which may clamor for attention over the voices of the others . Although the four begin to " cooperate and exchange ideas " as the work progresses , Carter was so intent on emphasizing their individual identity that he instructed the performers to sit in four separate corners of the stage . ( The Lenox String Quartet , which played he work at Ojai last week , refused , said the arrangement would upset their coordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of opining up an 8-ft. gap between players. )
