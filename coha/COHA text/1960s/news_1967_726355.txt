txt War checkrein ? High U. S. , Soviet stakes in Mideast seen restraint The UN Security Council is expected to have little immediate impact on the Middle East war crisis so long as Moscow and Washington strongly back opposite sides . It is felt here that if the crisis should threaten to explode into a wider war , then the two biggest council powers would move discreetly to damp it down , rather than risk being sucked into a war themselves . But short of that , Moscow , backing Cairo , is content to let the crisis pressure continue while hoping for long-term gains in the Mideast . The Security Council does have some quieting effect merely by meeting . But it can only debate mild verbal backing for Secretary-General U Thant as he bargains with the Nasser government in Cairo , and extend a plea to all members to keep hands off . And even that debate shows continuing division among the major powers . Outcome uncertain The French Government has suggested concerted efforts by the United States , the Soviet Union , Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Cabinet spokesman announced . Meanwhile , Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban met President de Gaulle in Paris for private talks on the crisis . Mr. Eban was on his way to the United States . British Prime Minister Harold Wilson said Britain would promote and support international action to uphold the right of free passage in the Gulf of Aqaba . The Defense Ministry announced that all British warships in the Mediterranean have been put on stand-by alert . But the United Arab Republic President is believed here to be willing to make only a token concession anyway to Mr. Thant : nominal recognition of the existing UN observer machinery for the Sinai border . This limited machinery , rejected by Israel , would be meaningless as far as the real tension point , the blockaded Gulf of Aqaba , is concerned . ' Unless President Nasser alters his course unexpectedly on that blockade of Israel 's vital trade route to the world , his challenge to both Israel and the United States will continue . UN officials have difficulty seeing just how this collision can be resolved . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers in the Red Sea may intervene . Or the belligerents may halt on the brink short of major incident . Diplomatic opinions here vary widely . They say , for instance , that both President Nasser and American President John* // *U.S. , Soviets hold Mideast reins // son stand to make political gains from a confrontation , if it does not get out of hand . Mr. Nasser can continue to rebuild his position as hero of the Arab world . Mr. Johnson may gain the backing not only of many Jewish American voters but of a certain percentage of liberal intellectuals who had been criticizing him over Vietnam . Furthermore , if the Middle East crisis continues for some time , as it now appears likely to , it will tend to dilute public attention to Vietnam . Of course , there is another side to this coin noted here . The crisis makes a second front for Mr. Johnson to be concerned about . His reserves are thin and Cairo and Moscow know it . But the crisis is also a second front for Mr. Nasser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He now has troops committed on both the Yemen-Saudi Arabia-Aden front and the Sinai-Aqaba front . The same logic applies to Moscow 's role . The Kremlin can take pleasure in this new pressure on Washington outside of Vietnam . It can also relish possible future gains for its client , Mr. Nasser , if he can turn his current upsurge of prestige in the Arab world into eventual gains in : ( 1 ) Aden and Yemen , and ( 2 ) ascendancy over ? pro- American Arab Kings Hussein of Jordan and Faisal of Saudi Arabia . But for Moscow , also , this is a risky second front . And even though Soviet Foreign Ministry officials are talking rough privately as well as publicly in Moscow , many Arab leaders tend to take all-out Soviet support of Mr. Nasser with some diplomatic grains of salt . Hence , the persistent belief among many veteran European and American diplomats that Moscow has set upper limits beyond which it is not willing to support expansion of the crisis . A medium boil may be permitted , not boiling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , for Arab fervor behind President Nasser 's . moves . Looked at from one angle , the United Arab Republic leader has the initiative in the Gulf of Aqaba 's bottleneck Strait of Tiran . Looked at from another he has his neck out there . But either way , the United Arab Republic and Israel are on the verge of firing at each other in an area in which each may prove a sitting duck for the other  --  and in a situation where Washington and the other maritime powers may have to intervene . President Johnson 's backing for  --  a Security Council meeting emphasized the point of freedom of transit on international waterways . The Western powers obviously feel obliged to nip in the bud any challenge to that freedom . Cairo , which owns the Sinai shore and leases the island of Tiran ( three miles across the strait ) from Saudi Arabia , claims this to be closed territcrial waters . Before the UN Security Council could get on to such substantive issues as this , it would have to go through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis . These will doubtless include both Israel 's concern about increased harassment from the United Arab Republic and Syria and Cairo 's complaint that Washington was squeezing the Nasser regime by cutting off wheat aid and sending new arms to Israel and anti-Nasser Arab leaders . The outlook is for extended tension kept just below the " wider war " point , with no effective UN intervention until the brinkmanship is played out by the major participants .
