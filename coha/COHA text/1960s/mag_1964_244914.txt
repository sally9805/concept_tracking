Zulu vividly re-creates an episode from the British conquest of Zululand in 1879 . Its heroes were some 130 redcoats who made a blood-and-guts stand against 4,000 proud Zulu warriors besieging the mission outpost at Rorke 's Drift , Natal . Eleven of the survivors were later awarded Britain 's coveted Victoria Cross , the most ever given after a single military action . <P> Improving on history , Director Cy Endfield has made a battle film in the grand carry-on-lads tradition of Font-Feathers and Gunga Din . His characters are swiftly etched stereotypes , a drawback easily overlooked once the action begins to surge against the eye-filling sweep of Natal 's brooding , beautifully photographed Drakensberg Mountains . Soon an insidious clacking sound echoes through the surrounding hills . It is the primitive , awful din of short-stabbing spears hammered against rawhide shields . Now the threat becomes palpable . Across the horizon stretches a line of warriors clad in animal skins and necklaces of baboon teeth , wailing " Usuto ! Usuto ! " ( Kill ! Kill ! ) The first wave sacrifices itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave after wave , lunging , hacking , dying . For all but the squeamish , it is a grisly good show , and the film 's climax is visually and dramatically stunning-when the fierce Zulus , some 18 hours later , roar acknowledgment of their enemy 's diehard courage and withdraw , shields raised in tribute . <P> <P> That moment alone explains , perhaps , why Zulu is currently raking in more pounds sterling than any other film in the history of British cinema . After a spate of " kitchen dramas " filled with whining social protest , Zulu 's bloodbath refreshes the spirit with its straightforward celebration of valor , tenacity and honor among men .
