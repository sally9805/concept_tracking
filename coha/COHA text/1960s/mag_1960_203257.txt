A railroad and a city tried new approaches to the commuter problem ( TIME cover , Jan. 18 ) last week : <P> The New Haven Railroad 's President George Alpert , lawyer turned railroadman , at long last decided that one way to cut soaring delays and equipment breakdowns might be to give New Haven veterans a hand at the throttle . Alpert appointed a 24-year employee , Frederick J. Orner , 48 , as chief of the road 's operations and second in command . Orner , the road 's general manager of freight service , had been demoted from assistant vice president in 1956 ; now he will take over the jobs of two Alpert lieutenants brought in from another road in 1958 . Said Orner : " It is fairly obvious that the first thing to do is to improve employee and passenger morale . We 've got to get people to like the New Haven again and to patronize the railroad . We must all pull in one harness at one time . We have n't had that lately on the New Haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its problem in a different way . In effect , it took over operation of the Pennsylvania and Reading railroads ' commuter lines in the city by setting up a nonprofit corporation to run the lines . The city will control the corporation with eleven directors , give two directors to the railroads , two more to 23 labor unions whose members work on the roads . The corporation will set all schedules , collect all revenues , pay the roads for the use of their facilities at a guaranteed rate of $1,400,000 for the first year . It will get a $500,000 subsidy from the city this year , more in succeeding years , during which it plans to spend $5,000,000 for better stations , and new coaches that it will lease to the roads .
