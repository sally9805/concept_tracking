In Eastern Europe , politics and economics have come to mingle like goulash and galuska ( dumplings ) . The economic liberalization that is sweeping the area is difficult-and even dangerous-for Communist rulers to resist . Last week Hungary made a major move toward liberalization by appointing Jen Fock , 51 , a noted economist , to serve as the country 's new Premier . Fock , who replaces Gyula Kllai , 57 , is the author of Hungary 's " New Economic Mechanism , " which goes into effect next year . He is expected to steer a middle course between the conservatives , who want to keep the economy in the firm grip of the party planners , and those who advocate a major role for private initiative both in the factories and on the ailing kholkozes ( collective farms ) . <P> Fock 's accession was part of a shake-up in the Hungarian Cabinet that also saw the replacement of President Istvn Dobi by Pl Losonczi , a farming expert who has served as Hungary 's Minister of Agriculture since 1960 . Both appointments reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's real ruler , to strengthen his own position . Kdr , who called back the Russian tanks during the 1956 uprising in Hungary , has shrewdly conciliated the voices of economic reform in recent years . He knows that in order to dampen opposition within his own party , he must placate the westward-looking economists , who lament the central decision making that has succeeded mostly in leaving Hungary in debt and its people clamoring for a better life .
