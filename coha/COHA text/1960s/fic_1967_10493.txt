mild confusion . " Hem . ... Viewed the mangled bodies as they lay , in silent satisfaction . ' My emphasis . Well , that last item  --  gildin ' the lily , maybe ? " I made no reply . Off in the other cell I could hear Hark chuckling , muttering jokes to himself . The fragile dustlike snow was still falling ; it had begun to cling to the earth , the thinnest film of white like hoarfrost , no more substantial than breath blown frosty against a pane of glass . " Encore , as the Frenchies put it , " Gray was saying , " meaning , that is , re-peat : . . . and immediately started in quest of other victims . ' But let 's skip ahead now . . . " The voice droned on . I raised my eyes toward the river . Across the stream , beneath the trees on the far bank , I saw the procession I had seen each morning , though this time it was late for themthechildren usually came at dawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ; the oldest could not have been older than eight , the smallest was younger than three . Dressed in shapeless clothing which some troubled mammy had fashioned for them out of cotton sacking or the poorest odds and ends , they picked their way along beneath the trees on the far bank , gathering twigs and fallen branches for some cabin fireplace . Pausing , stooping down , suddenly scamperingforward , they moved with quick and sprightly motions beneath the clumsy flapping of their formless little sacks , piling twigs and sticks and fagots high in their arms against their bodies . I heard them call out to each other . I could n't make out their words , but on the cold air their voices were shrill and bright . Black hands and feet and faces , bobbing , swooping , dancing shapes silhouetted like lively birds against the white purity of the forest and the morning . I watched them for a long time as they moved , all unknowing doomed and hopeless , across the clean space of snow and finally vanishedwith their burdens , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sight . Suddenly I thrust my face into my hands , thinking of Daniel 's beast again in the burning visions of the night , thinkingof Daniel 's cry : 0 my Lord , what shall be the end of these things ? But the answer was not the Lord 's . It was Gray 's . And in the imprisoned space of my mind it seemed to come back amid a tumult and murmuration of flowing waters , wild waves , rushing winds . Justice . Justice ! That 's how come niggerslavery 's going to last a thousand years ! Hark always declared that he could distinguish between good white people and bad white people  --  and even white people who lay between good and bad  --  by their smell alone . He was very solemn about all this ; over the years he had worked out many subtleties and refinements upon his original philosophy , and he could talk endlessly as we worked alongsideeach other  --  advising me at the top of his voice , assigningexact , marvelous odors to white people like Moses handingdown the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as he jabbered away his broad , bold face would become furrowed in the most worrisome thought ; but Hark 's nature was basically humorous , outward-going , beneficent , serene , and he could not long sustain a somber mood , even though many horrible things had happened to him . Finally something connected with a white person and a certain smell would tickle some interior nerve : against all restraint the giggles would begin to well up from his belly and in an instant he would have broken down , clutching himself in helpless , wheezing , rich , delirious laughter . " Now , Nat , maybe it jes ' me , " he would begin seriously , " but dis yere nose of mine she jes ' get better ev'y day . Like I was comin ' roun ' de side of de barn yestiddy evenin ' and dere 's ole Miss Maria a-feedin ' the chickens . She seed me afore I could take off . Hark ! ' say she . Hark ! Come right yere !

Even de buzzards fly away from ole pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had smells like this , according to Hark . Mr. Joseph Travis , our master , had " a right honest stench about him , " said Hark , " like a good horse what worked him up a sweat . " Joel Westbrook , the boy whom Travis employedas an apprentice , was an uncertain , gawky lad , given to temper fits but amiable , even generous when in the mood ; hence to Hark his smell had a changing , fitful quality : " Sometime dat boy smell right pretty , like hay or somethin ' , other time he smell up a storm . " This offensive Miss Maria Pope was to Hark , however , in every way consistent in her smell . She was Travis 's half sister , who had come down from Petersburg to live with Travis and his family after her mother'sdeath . A bony , angular woman , she suffered from blocked sinuses which caused her to breathe through her mouth ; as a result her lips were always peeling to the quick and sometimesbled , which necessitated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanched appearance altogetherghostly and strange . Her eyes wandered distantly , and she was given to stroking her wrists . She hated us Negroes , who were at her beck and call , with a kind of profound and pointless hatred which was all the more burdensome to us+43+because she was not really of the family , and therefore her attitude had a harsh , remote , despotic quality . On summer nights , from the windows of the upstairs room where she slept , I could hear her sobbing hysterically and crying out for her departed mother . She was about forty , I suspect a virgin , and she read aloud from the Bible incessantly with a kind of hollow-eyed , mesmeric urgency , her favorite passages being John 13 , which deals with humility and charity , and the sixth chapter of I Timothy , beginning : Let as many servantsas are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed . Indeed , according to Hark , she once flattened him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he had committed it to memory . I have no doubt that she was more than a little cracked , but this did not diminish my intense dislike of Miss Maria Pope , though occasionallyI felt myself feeling sorry for her against my better judgment . But Miss Maria is , in a manner of speaking , only incidentalto a man I am trying to get at in a roundabout fashion  --  namely , Mr. Jeremiah Cobb , the judge who was about to sentence me to death , and into whose earlier acquaintance I was led by a complicated series of transactions which I must here try briefly to describe . As I told Mr. Gray , I was born the property of Benjamin Turner , about whom I remember only a little . Upon his abrupt death when I was around eight or nine ( a miller and dealer in timber , he was killed while felling a cypress tree , having turned his back on the monster at an improvident moment ) , I passed by bequest into the possession of his brother , Samuel Turner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These years , and those preceding them , . I shall return to in due course . Eventually Samuel Turner 's fortunes declined , and there were other problems ; at any Tate , he was unable to continue to operate the sawmill he+44+ I +45+inherited , along with me , from his brother , and so for the first time I was sold , to Mr. Thomas Moore  --  a sale which a weakness for irony impels me to remark was effected at the moment I reached my manhood , during my twenty-first year . I was the property of Mr. Moore , who was a small farmer , for nine years until his death ( another bizarre misadventure : Moore broke his skull while presiding at the birth of a calf . It had been a balky delivery , and he had wrapped a cord around the calf 's protruding hooves in order to yank it out ; as he sweated and tugged and as the calf mused at him soulfully from the damp membranes of its afterbirth , the cord snapped , catapulting him backward and fatally against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my grief was meager , yet at the time I could not but help begin to wonder if ownership of me did not presage a diminution of fortune , as does the possession , I am told , of a certain kind of elephant in India ) , and upon Mr. Moore 's demise I became the property of his son , Putnam , who was then fifteen . The following year ( that is to say , last year ) Mr. Moore 's widow , Miss Sarah , married Joseph Travis , a childless widower of fifty-five desirous of offspring , who lived in this same country region of Cross Keys , an expert wheelwright by trade and the last personso luckless as to enjoy me in the pride of ownership . For although under law I was Putnam 's by title , I belonged also to Travis , who had the right to exercise full control over me until Putnam reached his majority . Thus when Miss Sarah wed Joseph Travis and became domiciled beneath his roof , I turned into a kind of twofold property  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being owned even once . Travis was moderately prosperous , which is to say that like a few of the other inhabitants of this backwater , he managed to eke out slightly more than a living . Unlike the hapless Moore , he was adept at that which the Lord had him cut out to do , and it was a great relief for me to be able to help himat his trade after the long years at Moore 's and the monotony of toting his water and sopping his feverish , languishing pigs and alternately baking and freezing in his cornfield and his cotton patch . In fact , because of the circumstances of my new employment  --  which was to act as a general handyman around the wheel shop  --  I had a sense of well-being , physical at least , such as I had not felt since leaving Samuel Turner 's nearly ten years before . Like most of the other property ownersof the region , Travis was also a small farmer , with fifteen acres or so in corn , cotton , and hay , plus an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brandy . Since the relative success of the wheel shop , however , Travis had cut back on his farm holdings , leasing out his acreage to others , and retaining just the apple orchard , and a small producegarden and patch of cotton for his own use . Besides myself , Travis owned only two Negroes  --  a number , however , not unusual in its smallness , inasmuch as few white people in the region could any longer afford to support more than five or six slaves , and it was rare indeed to find a citizen prosperousenough to own as many as a dozen . Travis himself had recently owned seven or eight , not counting several unserviceablechildren , but as his acreage diminished and his solitary craft flourished , he had no need for this obstreperous pack , indeed found so many. , fat mouths to feed a burden on his capital , and thus , three years before , with great moral misgivings ( or so I heard ) sold off the whole lot  --  all but one  --  to a trader specializing in labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was my age lacking a year . Born on a vast tobacco plantation in Sussex County , he had been sold to Travis at the age of fifteen after the tobacco sucked the soil dry and the land went to rack and ruin . I had known him for years and had come to love him like a brother . The other Negro , acquired subsequent to the Mississippi sale , was Moses , a husky , tar-black , wild-eyed boy of twelve or there-.abouts whom Travis , finding himself belatedly short-handed , +46+ had bought at the Richmond market several months before my arrival . He was strong and strapping for his age , and bright enough , I think ; but he never quite got over the sepa ration from his mammy ; it left him bereft , stuporous , and he cried a lot and peed in his pants , sometimes even when he was at work , and all in all was a nuisance , becoming a great trial to Hark especially , who had a mother 's soul in the body of a bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This then was the population of ' our household at the time when I first encountered Jeremiah Cobb , almost one year to the day before he sentenced me to death : three Negroes  --  Hark , Moses , myself  --  and six white people  --  Mr. and Mrs. Travis and Putnam , Miss Maria Pope , and two more besides . The last were the previously mentioned Joel Westbrook , fif teen years old , a budding wheelwright whom Travis had ap prenticed to himself ; and Travis 's child by Miss Sarah , an infant boy of two months born with a purple blemish spread ing across the center of his tiny face like the single shriveling petal of a blighted gentian . The white people , of course , lived in the main house , a modest , plain hut comfortable two storied structure of six rooms which Travis had built twenty years before . He had hewn the beams himself , planed the timbers , made it all weather-tight with pine gum and mortar , and had been wise enough to leave standing round it several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer sun . Adjacent to the house , separated from it only by the pigpen and a short path through the vegetable garden , was the wheel shop , converted from a one time barn : here was the center of activity on the farm , here were the stores of ' oak and aslrwood and iron , the forge and anvils , the bending frames , the modeling hammers and tongs and vises and the rows of chisels and punches and all the other equipment which Travis employed in his demanding craft . Doubtless at least in part because of my repute ( decent : albeit somewhat ambiguous and suspect in a way that I will soon explain ) as a kind of harmless , runabout , comic nigger minister of the gospel , I was later made custodian of the shop ; in fact , prompted by Miss Sarah 's avowal of my integrity , Travis gave into my keeping one of two sets of keys . I had plenty enough to do , but I can not honestly say that my work here was toilsome ; unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable , I think , to drive his servants unreasonably and already having been well provided with willing help in the person of his stepson and the Westbrook boy , who was an eager apprentice if there ever was one . Thus my duties , compared to what I had been used to , were light and fairly free of strain : I kept the place clean and added my shoulder to a job when extra strength was needed , such as bending a wheel rim , and frequently I spelled Hark as he pumped at the bellows of the forge , but generally speaking ( and for the first time in years ) , the tasks I encounteredwere those calculated to tax not my muscles but my ingenuity . ( For instance , the loft of the shop since its conversionfrom the status of a barn had still been infested by bats , tolerable enough when the place was the abode of cattle but an insufferable plague of drizzling bat shit to humans laboringdaily below . Travis had tried half a dozen futile measures to rid himself of the pests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place down ; whereupon at this point I went out into the woods to a certain nest I knew of and plucked a blacksnake out of hibernation , wrenching it from the tail-end of its winter 's sleep and installing it in the eaves . When spring came a week later the bats quickly vanished , and the blacksnake continued in friendly , satisfied residence , slithering benevolently around the circumference of the shop as it gobbled up rats and field mice , its presence earning me , I know , quiet admiration in Travis 's regard . ) So , all things being equal , from the beginning of my stay with Travis , I was in as palmy and benign a state as I could remember in many+48+years . Miss Maria 's demands were annoying , but she was a small thorn . Instead of the nigger food I was accustomed to at Moore 's , fat pork and corn pone , I got house food like the white people  --  a lot of lean bacon and red meat , occasionally even the leavings from a roast of beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lean-to shed adjoining the wheel shop where Hark and I shared housekeeping was roomy enough , with the first bed elevated above the ground that I had slept on since the old days with Samuel Turner ; and I constructed , with my owner 's blessing , an ingenious wooden vent leading through the wall from the forge , which was always banked with charcoal : the vent could be shut off in the summer , but in the winter its constant warmth made Hark and me ( the poor boy Moses slept in the house , in a damp kitchen closet , where he could be available for errands night and day ) as snug as two grubs beneath a log . Above all , I had quite a bit of ' time on my hands . I could fish and trap and do considerable Scriptural reading . I had for going on to several years now considered the necessity of exterminating all the white people in Southampton County and as far beyondas destiny carried me , and there was thus available to me more time than I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to think over the complexities of the bloody mission that was set out before me . The particular November day I met Jeremiah Cobb is clear in my memory : an afternoon of low gray clouds scudding eastward on a gusty wind , cornfields brown and sere stretching toward the distant woods , and the kind of stillness which comes with that time of autumn , the buzz and hum of insects having flickered out , the songbirds flown south , leaving the fields and woods to dwell in a vast gray globe of silence ; nothing stirs , minutes pass in utter quiet , then through the smoky light comes the sound of crows cawing over some far-off cornfield , a faint raucous hullabaloo which swiftly dwindles off in the distance , and silence again , +49+broken only by the scratching and scrabble of dead windblownleaves . That afternoon I heard dogs yapping in the north , as if they were coming down the road . It was a Saturday , Travis and Joel Westbrook had driven that morning to Jerusalem on an errand , and only Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner of my shed cleaning some rabbits from my trapline , when in the midst of this deep and brooding silence I heard the dogs yapping up the road . They were foxhounds , but not enough of them for a hunt , and I recall being puzzled , my puzzlement vanishing just as I rose and looked up the road and saw a whirlwind of dust : out of the whirlwind came a tall white man in a pale beaver hat and gray cloak , perched on the seat of a dogcart drawn by a frisky jet-black mare . Behind and below the seat were the dogs , three flop-eared hounds yapping at one of Travis 's yellow cur dogs who was trying to get at them through the spokes of the wheels . It was , I think , the first time I ever saw a dogcart with dogs . From where I stood I saw the dogcart draw up to a halt in front of the house , then saw the man dismount ; I thought he came down clumsily , seeming for an instant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then , instantly regaining control of himself , he muttered something half aloud and at the same time aimed a kick at the yellow dog , missed wildly , his booted foot fetchingup against the side of the carriage with a clatter . It was comical to watch  --  a white man 's discomfiture , observed on the sly , has always been a Negro 's richest delight  --  but even as I felt the laughter gurgling up inside me the man turned and my laughter ceased . I was now able to observehim for the first time straight on : the face I beheld was one of the most unhappy faces I had ever seen . It was blighted , ravaged by sorrow , as if grief had laid actual hands on the face , wrenching and twisting it into an attitude of ineradicablepain . Now too I could see that the man was a little drunk . He stared somberly at the dog howling at him from+50+the dust of the road , then raised his hollow eyes briefly to the gray clouds scudding across the heavens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spasm of coughing seized him . Then with an abrupt , clumsy gesture he drew the cloak about his gaunt and bony frame and proceeded with fumbling gloved hands to fasten the mare to the tethering post . Just then I heard Miss Sarah call from the porch . " Judge Cobb ! " I heard her cry . " Sakes alive ! What are you ( loin ' down this way ? " He shouted something hack to her , the cadence of his words obscure , muffled against the gusty wind . The leaves whirled around him , all the dogs kept yapping and howling , the pretty little mare chafed and tossed her mane and stamped . I managed to make out the words : a hunt in Drewrysville , he was taking his dogs there , a grinding noise in the spindle box of his wheel . Ile thought the axle broke , split , something ; being nearby lie had come here for repairs . Was Mr. Joe to home ? Downwind came Miss Sarah 's voice from the porch , loud , buxom , cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem ! My boy Putnam 's here , though ! IIe 'll fix that wheel for you , Judge Cobb , straightaway ! Wo n't you come in and set a spell ! " Thank you no ma'am , t'ohh hollered back ; he was in a rush , he 'd get that axle fixed and he on his way . " Well , I ' spect you know where the cider press is , " Miss Sarah called . " Right next to the shop . ' ll-cy 's some brandy too ! Just help yourself anddrink your fill ! " I went back to the corner of the shed , attending to my rabbits , and paid no more mind to Cobb for the moment . Travis had allowed me to have the trapline , and in fact encouragedme in the enterprise since by arrangement he was to get two out of every three rabbits I caught . Such an agreementwas satisfactory to me , inasmuch as this game was plentifulin the countryside and the two or three rabbits a week left for Hark and me were as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it matter to me that Travis sold most of the rabbitsin Jerusalem and retained the money , which was clear+ 51 +profit , since if he was to earn interest on the capital which , body and brain , I represented anyway , I was glad to be capitalizedupon in one small way which I myself took pleasure in . For after all of the dull drudgery at Moore 's , it was the greatest delight to me to be able to make use of some actual indwelling talent , to fashion the traps myself  --  box traps which I made out of scrap pine from the shop , sawing and planing the wood with my own hands , carving the pegs and the notched pins which tripped the doors , and uniting one after another of the neat miniature coffins into a single smoothly operating , silent , lethal assembly . But this was not all . As much as manufacturing the traps I enjoyed walking the trapline at daybreak in the silence of the countryside , when frost crackled on the ground and the hollows overflowedas if with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike through the woods along a familiar pineneedledpath , and I devised a sort of cloth pouch to take along with me , in which I carried my Bible and my breakfast  --  twoapples and a piece of streak-of-lean pork already cooked the night before . On my return , the Bible shared the pouch with a couple of rabbits , which I brained bloodlessly with a hickory club . A multitude of squirrels preceded me on these walks , in rippling stop-and-go motion ; with some of them I became quite familiar and I bestowed names upon them , prophetic Hebrew names like Ezra and Amos , and I numbered them among God 's blest since unlike rabbits they could not by nature be easily trapped and could not by law be shot ( at least by me , Negroes being denied the use of guns ) . It was a silent , gentle , pristine time of day , and as the sun shone pale through the dews and the mists and the woods hovered round me gray and still in the autumnal birdless quiet , it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Near the end of my trapline there was a little knoll , surroundedon three sides by a thicket of scrub oak trees , and+52+here I would make my breakfast . From this knoll ( though hardly taller than a small tree , it was the highest point of land for miles ) I could obtain a clear and secret view of the countryside , including several of the farmhouses which it had already become my purpose eventually to invade and pillage . Thus these morning trapping expeditions also served to allow me to reconnoiter and to lay plans for the great event which I knew was in the offing . For at such times it seemed that the spirit of God hovered very close to me , advising me in this fashion : Son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus saith the Lord ; Say , a sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished : it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter . . . Of all the Prophets it was Ezekiel with his divine fury to whom I felt closest by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pork and applesdevoured , the bag of brained cottontails at my side , I would for a long time ponder Ezekiel 's words because it was through his words that the wishes of the Lord concerning my destiny ( even more so than through the words of the other Prophets ) seemed most clearly to be revealed : Go through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof . . . Slat/ utterly old and young , both maids and little children , and women : but come not near any man upon whom is the mark . . . Often as I brooded over these lines , I wondered why God should wish to spare the well-meaning and slay the helpless ; nonetheless , it was His word . Great mornings , filled with hints , auguries , portents ! I find it hard to describe the exaltation which seized me at such times when , crouched upon my secret knoll in gray momentous dawns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immutably as Saul or Gideon  --  myself , black as the blackestvengeance , the illimitable , devastating instrument of God 's wrath . For on these mornings as I looked down uponthe gray and somber and shriveling landscape it seemed as if His will and my mission could not be more plain and intel-+ 53 +ligible : to free my people I must one day only commence with the slumbering , mist-shrouded dwellings below , destroyingall therein , then set forth eastward across the swamps and fields , where lay Jerusalem . But to get back to Cobb , rather meanderingly I 'm afraid , and again by way of Hark . Hark had a flair for the odd , the offcenter : had he been able to read and write , been white , free , living in some Elysian time when he was anything but negotiable property worth six hundred dollars in a depressed market , he might have been a lawyer ; to my disappointment , Christian teachings ( my own mainly ) had made only the shallowest imprint upon his spirit , so that being free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and could laugh with abandon , thrilling to each day 's new absurdity . In short , he had a feeling for the crazy , the unexpected ; all in all , this caused me mild envy . There was for instance the time when our shed behind the wheel shop was still uncompleted , and our master paid us a visit during a roaring thunderstorm , gazing skyward at the water cascading through the roof . " It 's leaking in here , " he said , to which Hark replied : " Nawsuh , Marse Joe , hit leakin ' outside . Hit rainin ' in here . " Likewise , it was Hark who gave expression to that certain inward sense  --  an essence of being which is almost impossible to put into words  --  that every Negro possesses when , dating from the age of twelve or ten or even earlier , he becomes aware that he is only merchandise , goods , in the eyes of all white people devoid of character or moral sense or soul . This feeling Hark called " black-assed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbness and dread which dwells in every Negro 's heart as any word I have ever known . " Don ' matter who dey is , Nat , good or bad , even of Marse Joe , dey white folks dey gwine make you feel black-assed . Never seed a white man smile at me yet ' thout I didn ' feel just about twice as black-assed as I was befo ' . How come dat ' plies , Nat ? Figger a white man treat you right you gwine feel+ 54 +white-assed . Naw suh ! Young massah , old massah sweet-talk me , I jes ' feel black-assed th'ough an ' th'ough . Figger when I gets to heaven like you says I is , de good Lord hisself even He gwine make old Hark feel black-assed , standin ' befo ' de golden throne . Dere He is , white as snow , givin ' me a lot of sweet talk and me feelin ' like a black-assed angel . ' Cause pretty soon I know His line , yas suh ! Yas suh , pretty soon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ! Need some spick and span roun ' de throne room . Hop to , you black-assed scoundrel ! Hop to wid de mop and de broom ! ' " It is impossible to exaggerate the extent to which white people dominate the conversation of Negroes , and it is with certainty I can record that these were the words that Hark ( who had come out of the shed to help Inc dress and clean the rabbits ) had been speaking on this gray November day when , like the most vaguely discernible shadow , we felt simultaneously a presence at our crouched backs and again , half startled , looked upward to see the distressed and ravaged face of Jeremiah Cobb . I do n't know whether he overheard Hark 's words , it would hardly have mattered if he had . Both Hark and I were taken unawares by the man 's magisterial , sudden , lofty figure looming above us , swaying slightly against the smoky sky ; so abruptly and silently had he come upon us that it was a long instant before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to let slip from our hands the bloody rabbits and begin to move erect into that posture of respect or deference it is wise for any Negro to assume whenever a strange white man  --  always a bundle of obscure motives  --  enters upon the scene . But now , even before we had gotten up , he spoke . " Go on , " he said , " go on , go on , " in a curiously rough and raspy voice  --  and with a motion of his hands he bade us to continue at our work , which we did , easing back slowly on our haunches yet still gazing up into the unsmiling , bleak , tormented face . Suddenly a hiccup escaped his lips , a sound incongruous and unseemly and even+55+faintly comical emanating from that stern face , and there was a long moment of silence all around ; he hiccuped again , and this time I was sure I sensed Hark 's huge body beginning to shudder with  --  with what ? Laughter ? Embarrassment ? Fear ? But then Cobb said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , massah , " Hark said . He pointed to the shed severalyards away , directly at the side of the shop , where the cider barrels lay in a moist and dusty rank in the shadows past the open door . " Red bar'l , massah . Dat 's de bar'l fo ' a gennleman , massah . " When the desire to play the obsequious coon came over him , Hark 's voice became so plump and sweet that it was downright unctuous . " Marse Joe , he save dat red bar'l for de fines ' gennlemens . " " Bother the cider , " Cobb said , " where 's the brandy ? " " Brandy in de bottles on de shelf , " said Hark . He began to scramble to his feet . " I fix de brandy fo ' you , massah . " But again Cobb motioned him back with a brisk wave of his hand . " Go on , go on , " he said . The voice was not pleasant , neither was it unkindly ; it had rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pain as if the mind which controlled it struggled with a preoccupying disquiet . He was abrupt , aloof , but there was nothing one might call arrogant about him . Nonetheless , something about the man offended me , filled me with the sharpest displeasure , and it was n't until he limped unsteadily past us through the crackling brown patch of weeds toward the cider press , sayingnot another word , that I realized that it was n't the man himself who annoyed me so much as it was Hark 's manner in his presence  --  the unspeakable bootlicking Sambo , all gigglesand smirks and oily , sniveling servility . Hark had slit open a rabbit . The body was still warm ( on Saturdays I often collected my game in the afternoon ) , and Hark was holding it aloft by the ears to catch the blood , which we saved to bind stews . I can recall my sudden fury as we crouched there , as I looked up at Hark , at the bland , serene glistening black face+56+ with its wide brow and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption he was gazing at the stream of crimson blood flowing into the pan he held below . He had the face one might imagine to be the face of an African chieftain  --  soldierly , fearless , scary , and resplendent in its bold symmetry  --  yet there was something wrong with the eyes , and the eyes , or at least the expression they often took on , as now , reduced the face to a kind of harmless , dull , malleable docility . They were the eyes of a child , trustful and dependent , soft doe 's eyes mossed over with a kind of furtive , fearful glaze , and as I looked at them now  --  the womanish eyes in the massive , sovereign face mooning dumbly at the rabbit 's blood  --  I was seized by rage . I heard Cobb fumbling around in the cider press , clinking and clattering . We were out of earshot . " Black toadeater , " I said . " Snivelin ' black toadeatin ' white man 's bootlickin ' scum ! You , Hark ! Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trusting yet fearful . " How come  --  " lie began in an abrupt startled voice . " Hush your face , man ! " I said . I was furious . I wanted to let him have the back of my hand flush in the mouth . " Just hush , man ! " I began to mimic him , hoarsely , beneath my breath . " ' Red bar'l , massah ! Dat 's de bar'l wid de gennle- men 's cidah ! I fix de brandy fo ' you , massah ! ' How come you make with that kind of talk , bootlickin ' nigger suckup ? It was enough to make me plain ordinary sick ! " Nark 's expression grew hurt , downcast ; he moped discon- solately at the ground , saying nothing but moving his lips in a moist , muttering , abstracted way as if filled with hopeless self- recrimination . " Ca n't you see , miserable nigger ? " I persisted , boring in hard . " Ca n't you see the difference ? The difference betwixt plain politeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get me a drink . ' He said just , ' Where the press ? ' A question , that 's all . And there you is , already : scramblin ' and scroungin ' like a bitch pup , massah this and massah that ! You enough to make a man chuck up his dinner ! " Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry : for anger resteth in the bosom of fools . Ashamed suddenly , I calmed myself . Hark was a vision of dejection . More gently I said : " You just got to learn , man . You got to learn the difference . I do n't mean you got to risk a beatin ' . I do n't mean you got to be uppity and smart . But they is some kind of limit . And you ai n't a man when you act like that . You ai n't a man , you is a fool ! And you do this all the time , over and over again , with Travis and Miss Maria and Lord help you even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You a fool ! As a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his folly . You a fool , Hark . How 'm I goin ' to teach you ? " Hark made no reply , only crouched there muttering in his hurt and dejection . I was seldom angry at Hark , but my anger when it came had the power to grieve him . Loving him as I did , I often reproved myself for my outbursts and for the misery they caused him , but in certain ways he was like a splendid dog , a young , beautiful , heedless , spirited dog who had , nonetheless , to be trained to behave with dignity . AlthoughI had not yet told him of my great plans , it was my purpose that when the day came to obliterate the white people , Hark would be my right arm , my sword and shield ; for this he was well endowed , being quick-wilted and resourcefuland as strong as a bear . Yet the very sight of white skin cowed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servile abasement ; and I knew that before placingmy ultimate trust in him I must somehow eliminate from his character this weakling trait which I had seen before in Negroes who , like Hark , had spent most of their early lives on big plantations . Certainly it would not do to have a chief lieutenant who was at heart only an abject nigger , full of cheap grins and comic shufflings , unable to gut a white man and gut him without a blink or qualm . In short , Hark was for me a necessary and crucial experiment . Though it is a+5g+painful fact that most Negroes are hopelessly docile , many of them are filled with fury , and the unctuous coating of flattery which surrounds and encases that fury is but a form of self-preservation . With Hark , I knew I must strip away and destroy that repulsive outer guise , meanwhile encouraging him to nurture the murderous fury which lay beneath . Yet somehow I did not think it would take too much time . " I don ' know , Nat , " Hark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit seem I cai n't git over dat black-assed feelin ' . I tries , though . " He paused , ruminating , nodding his head ever so slightly over the bloody carcass in his hands . " ' Sides , dat man he look so sad an ' mou'nful . Never seed such a sad an ' mou'nful man . Kind of felt sorry fo ' de man . What you reckon made him so sad-lookin ' anyways ? " I heard Cobb returning from the press through the weeds , unsteadily , stumbling slightly , with a brittle crackling sound of underbrush being trampled underfoot . " Feel sorry for a white man and you wastin ' your sorrow , " I said in a low voice . Then even as I spoke I made a sudden connection in my mind , remembering how a few months before I had overheardTravis speaking to Miss Sarah about this man Cobb , and the terrors which had beset him grisly and Job-like within the space of a single year : a merchant and banker of property and means , chief magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lost his wife and two grown daughters to typhoid fever on the coast of Carolina , whither , ironically , he had sent his ladies to recuperate from winter attacks of the bronchial ailments to which all three were prone . Shortly afterward his stable , a brand-new structure on the outskirts of Jerusalem , burned to the ground in one horrid and almost instantaneous holocaust , incinerating all therein including two or three prize Morgan hunters and many valuableEnglish saddles and harnesses , not to mention a young Negro groom . Subsequently , the unfortunate man , having taken heavily to the bottle to ease his affliction , fell down+59+some stairs and broke his leg ; the limb failed to mend properly , and although ambulatory , he was plagued by a hectic , mild , irresistible fever and by unceasing pain . When I first heard of all this adversity I could not help but feel a spasm of satisfaction ( do not consider me altogether heartless  --  I am not , as you shall surely see ; but the contentment a Negro takes in a white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scanty rations , can hardly be overestimated ) , and I must confess that now as I heard Cobb behind me toiling back through the noisy weeds I experienced anew the same sense of gratification . ( For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me . I was not in safety , neither had I rest , neither was I quiet ; yet trouble came . . . ) A small thrill of pleasure coursed through my flesh . I thought he was going to walk past us to the shop or perhaps the house . Certainly I was taken by surprise when , instead , Cobb halted next to us with his boots practically atop one of the skinned rabbits . Again Hark and I started to rise , again he motioned for us to continue work . " Go on , go on , " he repeated , taking a huge gulp from the bottle . I heard the brandy vanish with a froglike croak in the back of his gullet , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smacking of lips . " Ambrosia , " he said . Above us the voice was self-confident , sturdy , stentorian ; it had an unmistakable vigor and force , even though the tired undertone of sorrow remained , and I felt the residue of an emotion , ever so faint , which I must confess was only the fear I was born and brought up with . " Am-ba-ro-sia , " he said . My fear receded . The yellow cur dog came snuffling up and I hurled into his face a slippery blue handful of rabbits ' guts , which he made off with into the cotton patch , groaning with pleasure . " A Greek word , " Cobb went on . " From ambrotos , that is to say , immortal . For surely the gods were conferring upon us poor humans a kind of immortality , no matter how brief and il-+6o+lusory , when they tendered us this voluptuous gift , made of the humble and omnipresent apple . Comforter to the lonely and outcast , an anodyne for pain , a shelter against the chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elixir must be touched by the hand of something or someone divine ! " Another hiccup  --  it was like a species of shriek , really prodigious  --  racked his frame , and again I heard him take a swig from the bottle . Intent upon my rabbits , I had not as yet looked up , but I had caught a glimpse of Hark : transfixed , with bloody glistening hands outstretched , he was gazing open-mouthed at Cobb with a look of absolute attention , a kind of ignorant and paralyzed awe affecting to behold ; straining to understand , he moved his lips silently in unison with Cobb 's , chewing upon the gorgeous syllables as if upon air ; droplets of sweat had burst forth from his black brow like a spray of quicksilver , and for an instant I could almost have sworn that he had ceased breathing . " Aaa-h , " Cobb sighed , smacking his lips . " Pure delight . And is it not remarkable that to his already estimable endowments  --  the finest wheelwright in the Southside of Virginia  --  your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of being the most skillful distiller of this ineffable potion within the span of a hundred miles ? Do you not find that truly remarkable ? Do you not now . " He was silent . Then he said again , ambiguously , in a voice which seemed  --  to me at least  --  touched with threat : " Do you not now ? " I had begun to feel uncomfortable , disturbed . Perhaps I was oversensitive ( as always ) to the peculiar shading of a white man 's tone ; nonetheless , there seemed to be something pointed , oppressive , sardonic about this question , alarming me . It has been my usual exprience that when a strange white man adopts this florid , familiar manner , and when his listeneris black , the white man is out to have a little fun at the black man 's expense . And such had been my developing mood of tension during the recent months that I felt I must avoid at+6i+all costs ( and no matter how harmless the by-play ) even the faintest premonition of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me squarely upon a dilemma . The trouble is : a Negro , in much the same way as a dog , has constantly to interpret the tone of what is being said . If , as was certainly possible , the question was merely drunkenrhetorical , then I could remain humbly and decently mute and scrape away at my rabbit . This ( my mind all the while spinning and whirling away like a water mill ) was the eventualityI preferred  --  dumb nigger silence , perhaps a little scratching of the old woolly skull , and an illiterate pinklippedgrin , reflecting total incomprehension of so many beautiful Latinisms . If on the other hand , as seemed more likely from the man 's expectant silence , the question was drunken-surly-sarcastic and demanding of an answer , I would be forced to mutter the customary Yassuh  --  Nawsuh being impermissible in view of the simple-minded nature of the question . What was so disturbing about this moment was my fear ( and these fears , one may be assured , are neither vagrant nor inconsequential ) that the Yassuh might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do now . You do find it remarkable ? Am I to understand then that you consider your master a dummox ? That because he can make wheels he ca n't make brandy ? You darkies do n't have much regard for your owners these days , do you ? Well , I want to tell you something , Pompey , or whatever your ludicrous name is , that ... " et cetera . The changes on this situation are endless , and do not think me overly cautious : motiveless nigger-needling is a common sport . But at this point it was not the possibility of humiliation I wanted to avoid so much as the possibility that having recently vowed that humiliation would never again be a constraint upon me , or a repression , I would be forced to surmount it by beating the man 's brains out , thus completely wrecking all my great designs for the future . I had begun to shake , and I felt a stirring , a kind of+62+watery weakness in my bowels ; just then , however , came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of a crashing in the undergrowth , and we all three turned to see a tawny mud-streaked wild sow lumber out of a thicket , snorting and grunting , trailed by her squealing brood ; now as quickly as they appeared pig and piglets seemed to dissolve back into the sere and withered forest , the space of sky above silent and gray and desolate with low-hanging , tattered , wind-driven clouds like smudged cotton through which faint sunlight seeped yellowish and wan . Distracted , our eyes lingered on the scene for a moment , and then came a slamming noise , very close , as the door of the shop opened suddenly , and caught by the wind , hurled itself on screaming hinges backward against the wall . " nark ! " a voice called . It was my boy owner , Putnam . " Where you , Hark ? " The child was in a foul mood ; I could tell this from the blotches on his pale white face : they grew prominent and rosy whenever he became exercised or harassed . I should acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hark ever since the preceding year when , out hunting hickory nuts on a balmy afternoon , Hark had innocently but clumsily ambushed Putnam and Joel Westbrook in some tangled carnal union by the swimming pond , both of the boys naked as catfish on the muddy bank , writhing about and skylarking with each other in the most oblivious way . " Never seed such foolishness , " I-lark had said to me , " But ' twar n't like I was gwine pay it no never mind . Nigger don ' care ' bout no white boys ' foolishness . Now dat daggone Putnam he so mad , you 'd think it was me dat dey caught jackin ' off de ole bird . " I sympathized with Hark but in the end I could n't take it too seriously , as it simply typified an uncorrectable condition : white people really see nothing of a Negro in his private activity , while a Negro , who must walk miles out of his path to avoid seeing everything white people do , has often to suffer for even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spy and a snooping black scoundrel. +63+ " Hark ! " the boy called again . " Get in here straight away ! What do you think you 're doin ' out there , you no-account nigger ! Fire 's gone plumb out ! Get in here , God durn you lazy wretch ! " The boy wore a leather apron ; he had a coarsefeatured , sullen , pouty-mouthed face with flowing dark hair and long side whiskers : as he shouted at Hark , I felt a brief , fleeting spasm of rage and I longed for the day to arrive when I might get my hands on him . Hark scrambled to his feet and made off for the shop as Putnam called out again , this time to Cobb : " I think you have someways broke a axle , Judge , sir ! My stepdad will fix it ! He should be here afore too long ! " " Very well , " Cobb called back . Then so abruptly that for an instant I thought he was still talking to the boy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so a fool returneth to his folly . That of course is most familiar , but for the life of me I am unable to place it within the Scriptures . I suspect however that it is one of the Proverbs of King Solomon , whose delight it was to rail at fools , and to castigate human folly ... " As he went on talking , a queasy sensation crept over me : the customary positions were reversed , the white man this time had caught the nigger at his gossip . How did I know that my own black blabbermouth would betray me , and that he would overhear every word I had said ? Humiliated , ashamed of my humiliation , I let the sticky wet rabbit corpse fall from my fingers and braced my spirit , preparing for the worst . " Was it not Solomon who said the fool shall be the servant to the wise ? Was it not he too who said a fool despisethhis father 's instruction ? And is not the instruction of the father , through Paul the Jew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominion , to wit : Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage ! " As he continued to speak I slowly stood erect , but even at my full height he towered over me , sickly , pale , and sweating , his nose , leaking slightly in the cold , like a great scimitar protruding from the stormy and anguished face , the brandy bottle clutched in onehuge mottled hand against his breast as he stood there in a limping posture , swaying and perspiring , speaking not so much to me as through and past me toward the scudding clouds . " Yes , and to this comes the reply , to this mighty and manifest truth we hear the response "  --  he paused for an instant , hiccuping , and then his voice rose in tones of mockery  --  " to this irresistible and binding edict we hear the Pharisee cry out of that great institution the College of William &; Mary , out of Richmond , from the learned mountebanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology . Speak you of liberty ? Speak you of the yoke of bondage ? How then , country magistrate , do you answer this ? Ephesians Six , Five : Servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ . Or this , my hayseed colleague , how answer you to this ? One Peter , Two , Eighteen : Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward . There , friend  --  there  --  is not that divine sanction for the bondage of which you rave and prattle ? ' Merciful God in heaven , will such casuistry never end ! Is not the handwriting on the wall ? " For the first time he seemed to look at me , fixing me for a moment with his feverish eyes before upendingthe bottle , thrusting its neck deep into his throat , where the brandy gulped and gurgled . " Howl ye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the Lord is at hand : it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty . You 're the preacher they call Nat , are you not ? Tell me then , preacher , am I not right ? Is not Isaiah only a witness to the truth when he says howl ye ? When he says the day of the Lord is at hand , and it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty ? Tell me in the honesty of truth , preacher : is not the handwriting on the wall for this beloved and foolish and tragic Old Dominion ? " " Praise God , mastah , " I said , " that sure is true . " My words were evasively meek and humble , with a touch of ministerialsanctimony , but I uttered them mainly to cover up my suddenalarm . For now I was truly afraid that he had identified me ; the fact that this strange and drunken white man knew who I was smote me like a blow between the eyes . A Negro 's most cherished possession is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather around himself , allowing him to merge faceless and nameless with the common swarm : impudence and misbehavior are , for obvious reasons , unwise , but equally so is the display of an uncommon distinction , for if the former attributes can get you starved , whipped , chained , the latter may subject you to such curiosity and hostile suspicion as to ruinously impair the minute amount of freedom you possess . As for the rest , his words had spilled from his lips so rapidly and wildly that I was as yet unable to get the exact drift of his thought , which seemed nonetheless mighty precarious for a white man ; and I still could not get over the sensation that he was trying to bait me , or lead me into some kind of trap . To conceal my dismay and confusion , again I mumbled , " That sure is true , " and I chuckled idiotically , gazing toward the ground while I slowly wagged my head  --  as if to indicate that this poor darky understood preciouslittle if indeed he understood anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted nearer to me , the skin close up not flushed and whiskey-pink as I had imagined but pale as lard , utterly bloodless and seeming to grow even whiter as I forced myself to return his gaze . " Do n't play dumb with me , " he said . There was no hostility in his voice , its sound was more request than command . " Your mistresspointed you out to me just now . Even so , I would have known , I could have distinguished between you two . The other Negro , what 's his name ? " " Hark , " I said . " That 's Hark , mastah . " " Yes , I would have known you . I would have known even had I not overheard you . Feel sorry for a white man and the sorrow is wasted . ' Is that not what you said ? " +66+A shiver of fear , old and habitual and humiliating , passed through me , and despite myself I averted my eyes and blurted : " I 'm sorry I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean it , mastah . " " Poppycock ! " he exclaimed . " Sorry that you said you 're not sorry for a white man ? Come , come , preacher , you do n't mean that . You do n't mean that , do you ? " He paused , waiting for an answer , but by now my distress and embarrassment had so unsettled me that I could n't even force a reply . Worse , I had begun to despise and curse myself for my own slowwittedinability to deal with the situation . I stood there lickingmy lips as I gazed out toward the woods , feeling suddenly like the most squalid type of cornfield coon . " Now do n't play dumb with nie , " he repeated , the voice edged with a tone almost gentle , curiously ingratiating . " Your reputation precedes you , as it were . For several years now there has come to my attention wondrous bruit of a remarkableslave , owned at different times by various masters here in the vicinity of Cross Keys , who had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by destiny thatmirabiledictu  --  he could swiftly read , if called upon to demonstrate , from a difficult and abstract work in natural philosophy , and in a fair hand inscribe page after page of random dictation , and had mastered his numbers as far as a comprehension of ' simple algebra , and had so attained an understanding of ' Holy Scripture that such of those few adepts in the science of ' divinity as had examined his knowledge of the Bible came away shaking their heads in wonder at the splendor of ' his erudition . " Ile paused and belched . My eyes moved back again toward his , and I saw him wipe his mouth with his sleeve . " Rumor ! " he resumed quickly . Now his voice had risen to a kind of ' impassioned runaway singsong , his eyes were wild and obsessed . " Astounding rumor to emerge from the backwoods of Old Virginny ! Astounding as those rumors which in olden times came back from the+67 +depths of Asia  --  that at the source of the River Indus , I believe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , which could dance a lively jig while accompanying itself on a tambourine , and when approached would sprout heretofore invisible wings and fly to the topmost branch of the nearest palm tree . Rumor almost impossible to entertain ! For to believe that from this downtrodden race , the very laws governingwhich bind it to an ignorance more benighted and final than death , there could arise one single specimen capable of spelling cat is asking rational intelligence to believe that balmy King George the Third was not a dastardly tyrant or that the moon is made of clabber cheese ! " He had begun to jab his finger at me as he spoke , a long bony finger with hairy joints , sending it forth into my face in quick thrusts like a snake 's darting neck . " But beyond this , mind you , beyond this  --  to imagine this . . . this prodigy , this paragon , a Negro slave  --  oh , perish the vile word !  --  who had acquired the lineaments not just of literacy but of knowledge , who it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of breeding and cultivation ; who , in short , while still one of this doomed empire 's most wretched minions , had transcendedhis sorry state and had become not a thing but a person  --  all this is beyond the realm of one 's wildest imagination . No . No ! The mind boggles , refuses to accept such a grotesque image ! Tell me , preacher , how do you spell cat ? Come now , prove to me the reality of this hoax , this canard ! " He kept jabbing his finger at me , the voice cajoling , amiable , the eyes still wintry-wild and obsessed . The smell of applejackwas around him like a sweet vapor . " Cat ! " he said . " Spell cat . Cat ! " I had begun to feel surely that he was not being sarcastic , that he was somehow trying to express mad , hulking , terrifyingfeelings beyond anyone 's surmise . I felt blood pounding at my temples and the cold sweat of fear and anxiety clammy beneath my arms . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I+68+ +69+breathed in a whisper . " Kindly please , mastah . Do n't mock me . " Time crept past and we were both silent , gazing at each other , and the November wind boomed behind us in the forest , crashing like giant , diminishing footfalls across the graying waste of cedar and cypress and pine ; for a moment my compliant lips trembled on a broken wisp of air , faltering  --  " Ca- , Ca- "  --  and a grief-haunted sense of futility , childish , lifelong , nigger-black , welled up in me like a sigh of pain . I stood there sweating in the blustery wind , thinking : So this is the way it is . Even when they care , even when they are somehow on your side they can not help but taunt and torment you . The palms of my hands slimy , and my mind roaring , thinking : I do not want to , but now , now if he forces me to spell the word I will have to try to kill him . I lowered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock me , mastah , please . " Yet now Cobb , adrift in his brandy haze , seemed to have forgotten what he had said to me and turned away , staring madly toward the forest where the wind still thrashed and flayed the distant treetops . IIe clutched the bottle as if with desperation at a lopsided angle against his chest , and a trickle of brandy oozed out against his cloak . With his other hand he began to massage his thigh , holding the leg so tightly that above the knuckles the flesh grew bone-white . " Almighty Cod , " he groaned , " this everlasting mortal ache ! If a man live many years and rejoice in them all , yet let him remember the days of darkness , for they shall be many . God , God , my poor Virginia , blighted domain ! The soil wrecked and ravagedon every hand , turned to useless dust by that abominableweed . Tobacco we can not any longer raise , nor cotton ever , save for a meager crop in these few southern counties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A plump and virginal principality , a cornucopia of riches the like of which the world has never seen , transformed within the space of a century to a withering , defeated hag ! And all to satisfythe demand of ten million Englishmen for a pipeful of Virginialeaf ! Now even that is gone , and all we can raise is horses ! Horses ! " he cried as if to himself now , stroking and kneading his thigh . " Horses and what else , what else ? Horses and pickaninnies ! Pickaninnies ! Little black infants by the score , the hundreds , the thousands , the tens of thousands ! The fairest state of them all , this tranquil and beloved domain  --  what has it now become ? A nursery for Mississippi , Alabama , Arkansas . A monstrous breeding farm to supply the sinew to gratify the maw of Eli Whitney 's infernal machine , cursed be that blackguard 's name ! In such a way is our human decency brought down , when we pander all that is in us noble and just to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , Virginia , woe betide thee ! Woe , thrice woe , and ever damned in memory be the day when poor black men in chains first trod upon thy sacred strand ! " Groaning in pain now , fiercely stroking his thigh with one hand while with the other he elevated the bottle to his lips and drained it to the dregs , Cobb seemed , for once , oblivious of me , and I recall thinking that wisdom dictated my stealing out of his presence , if only I could find a decent way to do it . In scattered , disordered riot , all manner of emotions had run through me as he had spoken ; not in years having heard a white man talk in this crazy fashion , I would not be honest if I did not admit that what he said ( or the drunken gist of it , stealing in upon my consciousness like some unreal ghostly light ) caused me to feel a shiver of awe and something else , dim and remote , which might have been a thrill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both awe and hope swiftly retreated in my mind , dwindled , died , and even as I looked at Cobb , I could only smell the musky scent of danger  --  flagrant , imminent danger  --  and feel a sense of suspicion and mistrust such as I had rarely ever known . Why ? It is perhaps impossible to explain save by God , who knows all things . Yet I will say this , without which you can not understand the cen-+ 71 +cluding his pinwheeling legs sailed out and forward , and he came down flat on his back with a bladdery , sacklike thud , directly beneath the clothesline which , at gullet level , had intercepted his flight . But as Cobb and I stood watching , watched him shake his head and try to rise up on his elbows , we saw now not one but two forces , though equally sinister and somber , converging on Hark from opposite directions : Putnam , still waving his lightwood stick , and Miss Maria Pope , who had appeared as if from nowhere like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hark with a hobbled spinster 's gait amid black snapping yards of funereal gingham . Blown back on the wind , her voice already was hysteric with shrill malevolence . " It 's up the tree for you , nigger ! " she screeched . " Up the tree ! " " Now , " I heard Cobb murmur , " now we are about to witnessa ritual diversion indigenous to this Southern clime . We are about to witness two human beings whipping another . " " No , mastah , " I said . " Marse Joe do n't ' low his niggers to be beaten . But there 's ways around that , as you will surely see . You about to witness something else , mastah . " " Not a speck of charcoal in the shop ! " Putnam was shoutingin a kind of wail . " And not a drap of water in the kitchen pail ! " Miss Maria shrilled . As if vying with each other to be the chiefest victim of Hark 's enormity , they surrounded him , encompassed the prostrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , shaking his head with the slow , stunned , dizzy bewildermentof an about-to-be-slaughtered ox that has received a faulty glancing blow . " It 's up the tree with him this time , impudent black scoundrel ! " Miss Maria cackled . " Putnam , get the ladder ! " " Hark 's most dreadful feared of heights , " I found myself explaining to Cobb . " This for him is worse than a hundred beatings . " " A fantastic specimen ! " Cobb breathed . " A regular gladia-+7 o+ tral madness of nigger existence : beat a nigger , starve him , leave him wallowing in his own shit , and he will be yours for life . Awe him by some unforeseen hint of philanthropy , tickle him with the idea of hope , and he will want to slice your throat . Yet now before I could make any kind of move , a cracking noise sounded behind us as once again the shop door opened , swung wide , and drove itself with windy force against the wall . And as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the shop , plunging in panicky headlong flight toward the fields and the woods beyond . Legs churning , his great black body moved at a furious gallop ; his eyes rolled white with alarm . Scant yards behind him now came Putnam , his leather apron flapping as he brandished a stick of lightwood , bawling at the top of his voice . " You , Hark , come back here ! Come back here , you clad-dratted no-good an'mal ! I 'll get hold of you at last , black bastard ! " Fleet as a deer , Hark scampered across the open lot , bare black feet sowing puffs of dust , the barnyard cat fleeing his approach , goose and gander too , cumbersomely flapping their flightless wings , emitting dismal honking sounds as they waddled from his path . On he came past us , looking neither left nor right , eyes round and white as eggshells , and we could hear the voice panting ah-ah-ah as he sprinted for the woods , moving now with such nimble-footed speed that he seemed whisked forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing ground each second , came the pimpled boy , still howling . " Stop ! You , Hark ! Black wretch ! Stop ! " But Mark 's great legs were churn- ing as if propelled by steam ; vaulting the pump trough , he soared through the air in a gigantic leap like something sus- pended by wire or wings , struck the earth with a thumping sound , and without breaking stride , bounded on toward the distant forest , the inside of his bare soles flashing splendidly pink . Then all of a sudden it was as if he had been felled by a cannon ball : his head snapped back , and the rest of him in- +72+ +73+tor , a veritable black Apollo . And swift as a race horse ! Where did your master get him ? " " From up Sussex way , " I said , " about ten , eleven years ago , mastah , when they broke up one of the old plantations . " I paused for a moment , half wondering to myself why I was proffering all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I went on , " heartsick and forlorn . On the outside he 's very cheery , but inside he 's just all torn up . He ca n't keep his mind on anything . That 's how come he forgets his chores , and how come he gets punished . Poor old Ilark ... " " Why is that , preacher ? " said Cobb . Putnam had fetched a ladder now from the barn , and we watched the procession as it made its way across the windswept lot , bleak and gray in the fading autumnal light -- Miss Maria in the lead , grim , hands clenched , her back stiff and straight as a poker , Putnambehind with the ladder , and between them Hark in his dusty gray denim , shuffling along with his head bent in total dejection , looming over the two of them like some huge Goliath , a giant towering above a pair of vengeful , hurrying dwarfs . In Indian file , straight as an arrow , they made their way toward an ancient and enormous maple whose lowermostbranch , leafless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm twenty feet above the earth . I could hear Hark 's bare feet scnfling across the ground , scuffing like the feet of a reluctant child . " Why is that ? " Cobb said again . " Well , nmastah , 1 'll tell you , " I said . " Couple years ago , afore I became Marse Joe 's property , Marse Joe had to sell off most all of his niggers . Sell them off down to Mississippi , where you know they are planting considerable cotton . Hark told me Marse Joe was in a misery about this , but he just could n't do anything else . Well , amongst these niggers was Hark 's wife and Ilark 's child  --  little boy about three or four years old he was then . Hark cared for that little boy almost more than anything . " " Yah , yah , yah , " I could hear Cobb murmur , making little clucking sounds beneath his breath . " So when that little boy was gone , Hark near about went mad with grief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yah , yah , yah . " " He wanted to run away and follow them all the way down to Mississippi , but I talked him out of it . See , he 'd already run off once years ago and had n't gotten anywhere . Besides , it 's always been my idea that a nigger should follow all the rules and regulations so far as he was able . " " Yah , yah , yah . " " Anyway , " I went on . " Hark ai n't been quite right ever since then . You might say he 's just been distracted . That 's why he does things  --  or does n't do things  --  that get him punished . And I 'll be quite truthful with you , mastah , he does n't do his chores , but I tell you he just ca n't help it . " " Yah , yah , " Cobb muttered , " yah , great God , the logical outcome . . . the ultimate horror ! " He had begun to hiccup again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs . He started to say something else , thought better of it , turned away , whispering over and over again : " God , God , God , God , God . " " Now about this here , " I explained . " Like I say , Hark 's most dreadful feared of high places . Last spring the roof leaked and Marse Joe sent Hark and me up to fix it . But Hark got halfway up and he just froze there . Begun to whimper and mumble to hisself and would n't go an inch further . So I had to fix that roof myself . Anyway , Marse Putnam and Miss Maria caught ahold of this fear of Hark 's  --  you might say they found out his weak spot . Like I said , Marse Joe wo n't tolerate anyone to mistreat his niggers , to beat them or anything like that . So whenever Marse Joe 's away , and Marse Putnam and Miss Maria figger they can get away with it , why , they run old Hark up a tree . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their voices muffled , remote , indistinct now on the blustery wind . Putnam propping the long ladder against the tree trunk , then jerking his arm furiously upward as he bade Hark to climb. +74+And Hark began climbing , reluctantly , at the third rung turning his frightened face imploringly back as if to see whether they might not have had a change of heart , but this time Miss Maria 's arms jerked upward  --  up , nigger , up  --  and again Hark continued his climb , knees quaking beneath his trousers . At last arrived at the lowermost branch , Hark swung himself off the ladder , clutching the tree so tightly that I could see even from this distance the veins standing out against the muscles of his arms , then with a sort of scrounging , sliding motion of his rump , deposited himself in the crotch formed by trunk and branch , and sat there embracing the tree with his eyes squeezed shut  --  dizzy , windy yards above the earth . Then Putnam removed the ladder and laid it flat on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by , mastah , " I said to Cobb , " and then old Hark will commence crying and moaning . Just wait and see . Then pretty soon he 'll start swaying . Crying and moaning and swaying there on that branch like he 's about to fall off . Then Marse Putnam and Miss Maria 'll set that ladder up against the tree and Hark 'll climb down . I reckon they get scared Hark will fall off and break his neck , and they would n't want that to happen . No , they just want to give old I Lark a poor time for a while . " " Yali , yah , yah , " Cobb murmured , distantly now . " And that for llark is a poor time indeed , " I said . " Yah , yah , yah , " he replied . I do n't know whether he waslistening to me or not . " Great God ! Sometimes I think . . . sometimes ... it is like living in a dream ! " Then suddenly , without another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house , the empty brandy flask still clutched in his hand , cloak flapping , shoulders hunched against the wind . I crouched down again above my rabbits , watching Cobb limp and sway across the lot and up to the front porch , his voice faint and weary as he called out : " Hallo , Miz Travis , think I 'll come in and set a spell after all ! " + 75 +And Miss Sarah 's voice way off within , high and full of cheer , and the sound of the door slamming as Cobb vanished inside the house . I stripped the white translucent inner skin from a rabbit , separating it from the pinkish flesh , and plunged the corpse into the cool water , feeling the guts squirming wet and slimy beneath my fingers . Blood mingled with the water , turning it a muddy crimson . Gusts of wind swept through the cotton patch , whistling ; an army of dead withered leaves marched along the edge of the barn , rolled with a husky scrabbling noise across the vacant yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cobb . Go through . the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations , that be done in the midst thereof . . . Slay utterly old and young , both maids and little children , and women : but come not near any man upon whom is the mark .. . Suddenly I found myself thinking : It is plain , yes , plain , plain . When I succeed in my great mission , and Jerusalem is destroyed , this man Cobb will be among those few spared the sword .. . Across the roof of the woods the wind rushed in hissing , majestic swoop and cadence , echoing in far-off hollows with the thudding sound of footfalls . Gray and streaked , boiling , in ponderous haste , the clouds fled eastward across the loweringheavens , growing darker now in the early dusk . After a bit I heard Hark begin to moan , a soft disconsolate wordless wail , filled with dread . For long minutes he moaned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap-tap-tapping of the ladderas they set it against the tree trunk and let him down . It is curious how sometimes our most vivid dreams take place when we are but half asleep , and how they occupy the briefest space of time . In the courtroom this day , dozing off for several seconds at the oaken table to which I had been bound by a length of chain , I had a terrifying dream . I seemed+7 6 +to be walking alone at the edge of a swamp at nightfall , the light around me glimmering , crepuscular , touched with that greenish hue presaging the onslaught of a summer storm . The air was windless , still , but high in the heavens beyond the swamp thunder grumbled and heaved , and heat lightningat somber intervals blossomed against the sky . Filled with panic , I seemed to be searching for my Bible , which strangely , unaccountably I had left there , somewhere in the depths and murk of the swamp ; in fear and despair I pressed my search into the oncoming night , pushing now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ominous , stormy light and by a far-off pandemonium of thunder . Try desperately as I might , I could not find my Bible . Suddenly another sound came to my ears , this time the frightened outcryof voices . They were the voices of boys , hoarse and half grown and seized with terror , and now instantly I saw them : half a dozen black boys trapped neck-deep in a bog of quicksand , crying aloud for rescue as their arms waved frantically in the dim light and as they sank deeper and deeper into the mire . I seemed to stand helpless at the edge of the bog , unable to move or to speak , and while I stood there a voice echoed out of the sky , itself partaking of that remote sound of thunder : Thy sons shall be given unto another people and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long , so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes . Screaming their mortal fright , black arms and faces sinkingbeneath the slime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes while the noise of a prodigious guilt overwhelmedme like a thunderclap ... " The prisoner will ... " The sharp rapping of a mallet interrupted the horror , and I snapped awake with a start . " If the court please . . . " I heard the voice say , " it is a crying outrage . Sech behavior is a crying outrage ! " The mallet cracked down again . " The prisoner is cautionedto stay awake , " said another voice . This time the voice+ 77 +was more familiar : it was that of Jeremiah Cobb . " If the court please , " the first voice continued , " it is a disgrace to these assizes that the prisoner goes to sleep , and in the full view of this honorable court . Even if it is true that a nigger ca n't stay awake any longer than  --  " " The prisoner has been duly cautioned , Mr. Trezevant , " Cobb said . " You may proceed with the reading of the deposi-tion . " The man who had been reading my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously relishing the pause , his own sparkling gaze , the total effect . His face was filled with hatred and disgust . I returned his gaze without faltering , though with no emotion . Smooth-featured , bullnecked , squinty-eyed , he now turned back to the papers , leaning forward aggressively on thick haunches and poking the air with a stubby finger . " The aforementioned lady fled and got some distance from the house , ' " he recited , " but she was pursued , overtaken , and compelled to get up behind one of the company , who brought her back , and after showing her the mangled body of her husband , she was told to get down and lay by his side , where she was shot dead . I then started for Mr. Jacob Williams 's ... ' " I ceased listening . There must have been two hundred people in the jammed courtroom : in holiday finery , the women in silk bonnets and tasseled shawls , the men in black morning suits and patent leather shoes , stern , aggrieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benches like a congregation of owls , silent now and attentive , breaking the steaming stillness with only a sneeze or a strangled , rattling cough . The round iron stove sizzled and breathed in the quiet , filling the air with the scent of burning cedar ; the room grew stifling warm and vapor clung to the windowpanes , blurring the throng of people still milling outside the courthouse , a row of tethered gigs and buggies , distant pine trees in a scrawny , ragged grove . Somewhere in the back of the+78+courtroom I could hear a woman sobbing softly , but hoarsely and bitterly and with that particular rhythmic scratchy persistenceof a female close to hysteria . Someone tried to shush her up , to no avail ; the sobs continued , heartbroken , rhythmic , unceasing . For many years it had been my habit , when situated in a position where time grew heavy on my hands , to pray  --  often not so much beseeching God for special favor ( for I had long since come to believe that He must surely frown upon too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in touch with Him , making sure that I never strayed so far away that Ile would be beyond hearing my voice . The Psalms of David I knew by heart , almost all of them , and many were the times each day when I would stop in the midst of work and recite a Psalm half aloud , feeling that by so doing I did not bother or harass the Lord yet magnifiedHim all the same by adding one voice to the choir of ascending praise . Yet again as I sat in the courtroom , listening to the restless stir and fidget of bodies on the benches , the hacking and coughing , the woman 's persistent sobbing like a single thread of hysteria , the same feeling of apartness from God which I had felt early that morning , and for past days in numbers beyond counting , washed over me in a chill , desolatinggush of anguish . Beneath my breath I tried to murmur a Psalm , but the words were flat , ugly , without meaning . The sense of His absence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor was it His absence alone which caused me this renewed feeling of despair , absence itself might have been endurable : instead it was a sense of repudiation I felt , of denial , as if He had turned His back on me once and for all , vanished , leaving me to mouth prayers , supplications , psalms of praise which flew not upward but tumbled hollow , broken , and meaningless into the depths of some foul dark hole . As I sat there I felt again almost overwhelmed by weariness , the weariness of hunger , but I forced my eyes to 79 +stay open and my gaze drowsed across the room toward Gray , still scribbling at his writing box , pausing now and then only to splash tobacco juice , with a dull pinging sound , into the brass spittoon at his feet . Nearby in the crowd an old hatchet-faced man sneezed enormously , again and again , the sneezes exploding violently from his nose in a shower of mist . My mind turned inward upon my abandonment . I found myself thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in months past , as in the days when God preserved me ; when his candle shined upon my head , and when by his light I walked through darkness .. . Then suddenly , and for the first time , with the same kind of faint shivery chill at my spine and shoulders that announcesthe commencement of a fever  --  a prickle at my neck as if from the lighest passing touch of icy fingers  --  I began to fear the coming of my own death . It was not terror , it was not even panic ; it was rather an apprehension and a faint one at that , an airless mounting sense of discomfort and uneasiness as if , knowing that I had eaten a piece of tainted pork , I was awaiting the cramps and the griping flux to come , the sweats and the gut-sickness . And somehow this sudden fear of death , or rather this tremulous and hesitant emotion which was more like a dull worry than fright , had less to do with death itself , with the fact that I must soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of contact with God . I mean , it was not that I had wanted to beseech God because I was afraid of dying ; it was rather that my own failure in praying to Him had caused me now this troublesome fear of death . I felt a trickle of sweat worm its humid way down the side of my forehead . Now I could tell that the man they called Trezevant was approaching the end of my confessions , the voice at once slowing its pace and rising in tone on a note of dramatic finality : " ... I immediately left my hiding place , and was pursued almost incessantly until I was taken a fortnight af-+8o+terwards by Mr. Benjamin Phipps , in a little hole I had dug out with my sword , for the purpose of concealment , under the top of a fallen tree . On Mr. Phipps 's discovering the place of my concealment , he cocked his gun and aimed at me . I requested him not to shoot and I would give up , upon which he demanded my sword . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pursued , I had many hairbreadth escapes , which your time will not permit me to relate . I am here loaded with chains and willing to suffer the fate that awaits me ... " ' Trezevant let the paper slip from his hand onto the table beside him and wheeled toward the six magistrates at the long bench , speaking quickly , almost without a pause , his next words surprisingly quiet but coming in such a rush that they seemed almost a continuation of my confessions : " If it may please this honorable court , the Commonwealth rests its case . All this here is self-evident and self-explained . It would be very unseemly to indulge in a prolixity of words after the simple fact of sech a document  --  each bloody and horrifying phrase of which reveals the prisoner setting here as a fiend beyond any parallel , a hell-born and degenerate mass-murdererthe likes of which has been unknown to Christendom . Now , this is no elaboration on the truth ; this is truth itself , your Honors . Search the annals of all time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human bestiality and you will search in vain for the equal of sech villainy . Attila the Hun that they aptly called the Scourge of God  --  him that ransacked Rome and held the very Pope in thrall  --  the ChineseKhan , nicknamed Genji , that with his rapacious Mongol hordes laid waste to the great empires of the Orient ; the nefarious General Ross , all too well known to most of those older people here still living , the cruel Englishman that in the conflict of 1812 devastated our capital of Washington , D.C.  --  vipers in human clothing all , yet not a man amongst them that does not tower as a pillar of virtue and rectitude along-+ 81 +side the monster setting here this day , right here , in this court of law . .. " Bemused , the grand names tolling in my brain like chimes , I felt a kind of horrible , silent laughter welling up within me as the stupid-looking , bull-necked man propelled me thus into history . He again turned and gazed at me , squinty eyes filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , your Honors , abominable as their deeds may have been , was yet capable of a certain magnanimousness . Even their vengeful and ruthless code demanded that they spare the lives of the young , the helpless , the old and the frail , the pitifully weak . Even their hard rules allowed them a smidgen of human charity ; and wanton in their cruelty as they was , some spark of grace , some quality of mercy compelled them oftentimes to withhold the sword when it come to shedding the blood of helpless innocence , babies and so on . Your Honors  --  and I shall be brief , for this case needs no clamorousprotestation  --  the prisoner here , unlike his bloody predecessorsin evil , can lay hold on to no mitigation by reason of charity or mercy . No compassion , no memory of past kindnessesor of gentle and paternal care deviated him from the execution of these bleak deeds . Tender innocence and feeble old age  --  sech alike fell victim to his inhuman lust . A fiend incarnate , self-confessed , his diabolical actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Your Honors ! The people cry out for swift retribution ! He must pay the supreme penalty with all due speed , that the stink of his depraved and hateful flesh be erased from the nostrils of a shocked humanity ! . . . Commonwealth rests its case . " He was finished . Suddenly I was aware that his eyes were spilling over with tears . He had made a prodigious effort . Dabbing at his eyes with the back of his hand , Trezevant sat down beside the whispering stove ; there was no great sound in the courtroom  --  only a subdued mumbling and a shuffling of feet , a renewed outburst of hacking and coughing+$2+through which that solitary noise of hysterical female weepingrose and rose in a soft despondent wail . Across the room I saw Gray murmuring behind his hand to a cadaverous man in a black frock coat , then he quickly arose and addressed the bench . And immediately , with no shock , I realized he was now speaking in tones that he always reserved for court , not for a nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Parker and I , speaking as counsel for the defendant , wish to commend our colleagueMr . Trezevant both for his persuasive and fluent readingof the prisoner 's confession and also for his splendid summation . We heartily concur and submit the defendant 's case to the court without argument . " He paused , turned to glance at me impassively , then continued : " However , one or two items , if ' it pleases your l lonors  --  and I too shall try to be brief , agreeing with the able prosecutor that this case needs no clamorous protestation . Felicitous phrase ! I would like to make it clear that Mr. Parker and I submit these items not by way of argument , nor out of the desire for mitigation or extenuationfor the prisoner , who to our minds is every bit as black  --  no play on words intended !  --  as he has been painted by Mr. Trezevant . Yet if these assizes have been convened to apportion justice to the principals in this conspiracy , they have also been held in the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grave questions  --  crucial and significantquestions the answers to which involve the safety and the well-being and peace of mind of every white man , woman , and child within the sound of my voice , and far beyond , yes , throughout every inch and ell of this Southern empire where the white race and the black race dwell in such close propinquity . Not a few of these questions , with the capture and confinement of the prisoner here , have been answeredto our considerable satisfaction . The widespread fear  --  nay , conviction  --  that this uprising was no mere local eventbut was part of a larger , organized scheme with **26;8448;TOOLONG out octopus-like throughout the slave population universally  --  this terror has been safely laid to rest . " Yet other questions perforce remain to trouble us . The rebellion was put down . Its maniacal participants have receivedswift and impartial justice , and its leader  --  the misguidedwretch who sits before us in this courtroom  --  will quickly follow them to the gallows . Nonetheless , in the dark and privy stillness of our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by worrisome doubts . Honesty , stark reality  --  naked fact !  --  compel us to admit that the seemingly impossibledid , in truth , eventuate : benevolently treated , recipients of the most tender and solicitous care , a band of fanatical Negroes did , in truth , rise up murderously and in the dead of night strike down those very people under whose stewardship they had enjoyed a contentment and tranquillity unequaled anywhere among the members of their race . It was not a fantasy , not a nightmare ! It was an actual happening , and its awful toll in human ruin and heartbreak and bereavement can be measured to this very day by the somber pall of mourning which hangs like a cloud here  --  here in this courtroom , two months and more after the hideous event . We cannoterase these questions , they refuse to dissolve like a mist , as the Bard put it , leaving not a rack behind . We can not wish them away . They haunt us like the specter of a threatening black hand above the sweetly pillowed head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealthy footstep in a murmurous and peaceful summer garden . How did it happen ? From what dark wellspring did it flow ? Will it ever happen again ? " Gray paused and again turned toward me , the square ruddy face impassive , bland , regarding me as ever without hostility . I had grown only mildly surprised by his voice , filled as it was with eloquence and authority , free of the sloppy patronizing half-literate white-man-to-a-nigger tones he had used in jail . It was obviously he  --  not the prosecutor Trezevant  --  who was in charge of things . " How did it hap-+g4+pen ? " he repeated in a slow , measured voice . " From what dark wellspring did it flow ? Will it ever happen again ? " And he paused once more , then with a flourish toward the papers on the table , said : " The answer lies here , the answer lies in the confessions of Nat Turner ! " Again he turned to address the bench , his words momentarilydrowned out as an ancient toothless Negro woman fumbled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cedar log ; blue smoke fumed outward , and a popping shower of sparks . The door clanged shut , the woman shuffled away . Gray coughed , then resumed : " Honorable Justices , as briefly as I can I want to demonstrate that the defendant 's confessions , paradoxically , far from having to alarm us , from sendingus into consternation and confusion , should instead give us considerable cause for relief . Needless to say , I am not suggesting that the prisoner 's deeds mean that we must not enforce stricter and more stringent laws against this class of the population . Far from it : if anything , this dreadful insurrectionshows that stern and repressive measures are clearly indicated , not only in Virginia but throughout the entire South . Yet , your Honors , I will endeavor to make it plain that all such rebellions are not only likely to be exceedingly rare in occurrence but are ultimately doomed to failure , and this as a result of the basic weakness and inferiority , the moral deficiency of the Negro character . " Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages briefly , and continued : " Fifty-five white people went to a horrible death in this insurrection , your Honors , yet of this number Nat Turner was personally responsiblefor only one murder . One murder  --  this being that of Miss Margaret Whitehead , age eighteen , the comely and cultivated daughter of Mrs. Catherine Whitehead  --  also a victimof the insurrection  --  and sister to Mr. Richard Whitehead , a respected Methodist minister known to many of those in this courtroom , who likewise met a cruel fate at the hands+g5+of this inhuman pack . One murder alone , it seems plain , was all that Nat Turner committed . A particularly foul and dastardlymurder it was , to be sure  --  taking the fragile life of a young girl in all her pure innocence . Yet I am convinced that this was the defendant 's sole and solitary victim . Convinced , your Honors , only after much preliminary skepticism . For indeed  --  perhaps like your honorable selves  --  skepticism nagged at , nay , overwhelmed me when I pondered close the evidence I transcribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission of a single slaying  --  a single slaying alone  --  be tantamount to a sly plea for clemency ? Thoroughly in key with the malingering nature of the Negro character , would not such an admission be typical of the evasiveness which the Negro perennially employs to cloak and disguise the base quality of his nature ? I thereupon resolved upon a sturdy confrontal of the defendant with my strictures and doubts , only to discover that he was adamant in his refusal to admit a greater involvement in the actual slayings . And at this moment  --  if the court will peiinit me the levity  --  I had begun durn well to doubt my doubts . For why should a person , knowing full well that he must die for his deeds anyway , having already owned to one ghastly murder , and havingdisplayed otherwise a remarkable candor in terms of the extent of his crimes  --  why should he not own all ? The man hath penance done , ' quoth the poet Coleridge in his immortal rhyme , and penance more will do . ' What availed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed : " Thus , not without some reluctance , I concluded that in terms of this beaucoup important item  --  the killing of one individual , and one individual alone  --  the prisoner was speakingthe truth .. . " But why ? " Gray continued . " Why only one ? This was the next question to which I addressed myself , and which caused me a severe and worrisome perplexity . Cowardice alone may well have served to explain this oddity . Certainly , pure Negro+g6+cowardice would find its quintessential expression in this base crime  --  the slaying not of a virile and stalwart man but of a fragile , weak , and helpless young maiden but a few years out of childhood . Yet once again , your Honors , logic and naked fact compel us to admit that this insurrection has caused us to rearrange , at least provisonally , some of our traditional notions about Negro cowardice . For certainly , whatever the deficiencies of the Negro character  --  and they are many , varied , and grave  --  this uprising has proved beyond any captious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of joining up with a fanatical insurgent leader such as Nat Turner or defending his fond and devoted master , will leap to his master 's defense and fight as bravely as any man , and by so doing give proud evidence of the benevolenceof a system so ignorantly decried by the Quakers and other such moralistically dishonest detractors . Whatever is unknown is magnified , ' quoth Tacitus in Agricola ! So much for Northern ignorance . To be sure , Nat Turner had his misguidedadherents . But the bravery of those black men who at their good masters ' sides fought faithfully and well can not be gainsaid , and let it be so recorded to the everlasting honor ofthis genial institution . . Now as Gray spoke , the same sense of misery and despair I had felt that first day when , in the cell , Gray had tolled off the list of slaves acquitted , transported , but not hung  --  them other niggers , dragooned , balked , it was them other niggers that cooked your goose , Reverend  --  this same despair suddenlyrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dream I had had , only a few minutes before , of the Negro boys screaming their terror in the swamp , sinking out of sight beneath the mire ... Sweating , the sweat rolling in streams down my cheeks , I felt an inward , uncontrollable wrench of guilt and loss , and I must have made a sound in my throat , or moved in my rattling chains , uncontrollably again , for Gray suddenly halted and turned and stared at me , as did+87 +the six old men at the bench , and I could feel the eyes of the spectators on me , blinking and blinking , watching . Then I slowly relaxed , with a kind of icy interior shudder , and gazed out through the steaming windows at the ragged grove of pine trees far off beneath the wintry sky  --  of a sudden then , for no particular reason other than that once more I had heard her name , thinking of Margaret Whitehead in some fragrant , summery context of dappled light and shade , dust blooming up from a baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispery , and girlish beside me on the carriage seat as I gaze at the mare 's clipclopping hooves beneath the coarse and flourishing tail : And he came himself  --  the Governor , Nat ! Governor Floyd ! All the way down to Lawrencevillehe came ! Is n't that just the most glorious thing you ever heard ? And my own voice , polite , respectful : Yes , missy , that must indeed be something grand . And again the breathless and whispery girl 's voice : And we had a big ceremony at the Seminary , Nat . And it was the most splendiferous thing ! And I 'm the class poet and I wrote an ode and a song that the little students sang . And the little girls presented the Governorwith a wreath . Want to hear the words of the song , Nat ? Want to hear them ? And again my own voice , solemn and polite : Why yes , missy . I 'd sure love to hear that song . And then the joyous and girlish voice in my ear above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June sending across the parched fields immensities of light and dark , dissolving patterns of shade and sun : We 'll pull a bunch of buds and flowers , And tie a ribbon round them ; If you 'll but think , in your lonely hours , Of the sweet little girls that bound them . We 'll cull the earliest that put forth , And those that last the longest , And the bud that boasts the fairest birth , Shall cling to the stem the strongest .. . +88+ Gray 's voice swam back through the courtroom above the restless shuffle , the hiss and hum and torment of the stove , panting like an old hound : " . . . was not Negro cowardice in this case , honorable Justices , which was at the root of the defendant 's egregious and total failure . Had it been pure cowardice , Nat would have conducted his operation from a vantage point allowing him but little if any propinquity with the carnage , the bloody proceedings themselves . But we know from the prisoner 's own testimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Negro Hark and the others  --  and we have no clear reason to doubt any of it  --  that he himself was intimately involved in the proceedings , striking the first blow toward their execution , and repeatedly attempting to wreak murderous acts of violence upon the terrified and innocent victims . " Gray paused for an instant , then said with empha- sis : " But note well , your Honors , that I say attempting . I stress and underline that world . I put that word in majus- cules ! For save in the inexplicably successful murder of Mar- garet Whitehead  --  inexplicably motivated , likewise obscurely executed  --  the defendant , this purported bold , intrepid , and resourceful leader , was unable to carry out a single feat of arms ! Not only this , but at the end his quality of leader- ship , such as it was , utterly deserted him ! " Gray paused again , then went on in a soft , somber , deliberate voice : " I humbly submit to this court and your Honors the inescapable fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plain habits of docility are so deeply embedded in the Negro nature that any insurgent action on the part of this race is doomed to failure ; and for this reason it is my sincere plea that the good people of our Southland yield not , succumb not to the twin demons of terror and panic But listen , Nat , listen to the rest . . . Yes , missy , I 'm listening . That 's a very fine poem , Miss Margaret . . . We 've run about the garden walksAnd searched among the dew , Sir , These fragrant flowers , these tender stalks , We 've plucked them all for you , Sir . Pray , take this bunch of buds and flowers , Pray , take the ribbon round them ; And sometimes think , in your lonely hours , Of the sweet little girls that bound them . There ! That 's the end of it ! What do you think of it , Nat ? What do you think ? That 's a very beautiful poem , missy . The mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past green hayfields busy with the cricketing stitch of insects ; slowly I too turn , eying her face with a nigger 's tentative , cautious , evasive glance ( some old black mammy 's warning ever a watchword , even now : Look a white folks in de eye you prayin ' for trouble ) , catching a glimpse of the cheekbone'slovely swerve and the fine white skin , milky , transparent , the nose uptilted and the shadow of a saucy dimple in a round young chin . She is wearing a white bonnet , and beneathit glossy strands of hair the color of chestnut have become unloosened , which all unconsciously lends to her demure and virginal beauty the faintest touch of wantonness . Sheathed in white Sunday linen , she is sweating , and I am close enough to smell her sweat , pungent and womanly and disturbing ; now she laughs her high , giggly girlish laugh , wipes a tiny bubble of perspiration from her nose , and suddenlyturning to gaze straight in my eyes , takes me off guard with a look joyous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swiftly turn away . You should have seen the Governor , Nat . Such a fine-looking man ! And oh yes , I almost forgot . There was an account of it in the Southside Reporter , and it mentions my poem , and me ! I have it right here , listen . For a moment she is silent as she gropes in her handbag , then reads rapidly , the voice breathless and excited+90+above the drumming hooves . The Governor was then conductedinto the Academical Apartment where upwards of a hundred pupils were handsomely arranged to receive him , and where a brilliant circle of ladies had previously assembled to witness the scene . After being introduced , an address was delivered by the Principal , to which Governor Floyd made a feeling and appropriate reply . An original ode for the occasion was then sung by the young ladies , accompanied by Miss Timberlake on the piano , to the air of Strike the Cymbal . Miss Covington then delivered the committee 's address in behalf of the school , in a style of pathos and eloquence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , Nat , this is about me . . . ) Miss Margaret Whitehead 's ode then followed , at the close of which the youngest pupils sang , in the most charming manner , Ruds and Flowers , as a sequel to the ode , and at the same time presented a wreath . The effect was electrical , and almost even , eye was in tears . We doubt whether the Governor has anywhere witnessed a more interestingscene , than this one in our own Seminary , dedicated to the highest principles of Christianfemale education .. . What do you think of Hull , Nat ? That 's mighty fine , missy/ . That 's mighty fine and grand . Yes , yes , that 's just grand . There is a moment 's silence , then : I thought you would like the poem . Oh , I knew you would like it , Nat ! Because you  --  oh , you 're not like Mama or Richard . Every weekend I 've came over from school you 've been the only one I could talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the timber and the corn and those oxen and all  --  and making money . And Richard is just as bad almost . I mean he 's a preacher and all but there 's nothing , oh , spiritual about him at all . I mean they do n't understand anything about poetry or spiritual things or even religious things . I mean the other day I said something to Richard about the beauty of the Psalms and he said , with that sort of scrunched-up sour look : What beauty ? + 91 +I mean can you imagine that , Nat ? From your own brother and a preacher , too ! What is your favorite Psalm , Nat ? For a moment I am silent . We are going to be late to church , and I urge the mare along at a canter , tapping her rump with the whip as the dust swarms and billows around her prancing feet . Then I say : That 's right hard to tell , Miss Margaret . There 's a whole slew of Psalms I dearly love . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Be mercifulunto me , 0 God , be merciful unto me : for my soul trustethin thee : yea , in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast . I pause , then say : I will cry unto God most high ; unto God that performeth all things for me . And then I say : That 's the way it begins . That is number Fifty-seven . Yes , yes , she says in her whispery voice . Oh yes , that 's the one that has the verse in it that goes : Awake up , my glory ; awake , psaltery and harp : I myself will awake early . As she speaks , I feel her closeness , oppressive , disturbing , almost frightening , the flutter and tremble of her linen dress against my sleeve . Oh yes , it is so beautiful I could just weep . You 're so good at remembering the Bible , Nat . And you have such a knowledge of , oh , spiritual things . I mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls at school they just do n't believe me when I say I go home on weekends and the only person I can talk to is a  --  is a derhy ! I am silent , and I feel my heart pounding at a great rate , although I do not know the reason for this . And Mama said you were going . Going back to the Travises . And that makes Margaret so sad , because she wo n't have anyone to talk to all summer . But they 're only a few miles away , Nat . You will come by sometime , wo n't you , on a Sunday ? Even though you wo n't be carrying me to church any more ? I 'll just feel lost without your society  --  I mean reciting to me from the Bible , I mean really knowing it so deeply and all . . . On she prattles and chirrups , her voicejoyful , lilting , filled with Christian love , Christian virtue , Christ-obsessed young awe and discovery . Did I not think that Matthew was of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temperance the most noble , pure , and trite contribution of the Methodist Church ? Was not the Sermon on the Mount the most awe-inspiring message in the entire world ? Suddenly , my heart still pounding uproariously , I am filled with a bitter , reasonless hatred for this innocent and sweet and quivering young girl , and the long hot desire to reach out with one arm and snap that white , slender , throbbingyoung neck is almost uncontrollable . Yet  --  strange , I am aware of it -- it is not hatred ; it is something else . But what ? What ? I can not place the emotion . It is closer to jealousy , but it is not even that . And why I should feel such an angry turmoil over this gentle creature baffles me , for save for my one-time master Samuel Turner , and perhaps Jeremiah Cobb , she is the only white person with whom I have experienced even one moment of a warm and mysterious and mutual confluence of sympathy . Then all at once I realize that from just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disturbance to the great plans which this spring are gatheringtogether into a fatal shape and architecture  --  arises my sudden rage and confusion . Why are you going back to the Travises , Nat , so soon ? she says . Well , missy , I was just hired out for two months by Marse Joe . It 's what they call trade-fair-and-square . What 's that ? she says . Trade . . . what ? Well , missy , that 's why I 've been working for your mama . Marse Joe he needed a yoke of oxen to pull stumps and Miss Caty she needed a nigger to work on her new barn . So Marse Joe traded me for two months for a yoke of oxen . That 's what they call trade-fair-and-square . She makes a thoughtful humming noise . Hm-m . A yoke of oxen . I mean , and you . . . That seems so very strange . She issilent for a moment . Then : Nat , why do you call yourself a nigger like that ? I mean it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer the word darky . I mean , after all , you 're a preacher . . . Oh , look yonder , Nat , the church ! Look at how Richard has gotten one whole side whitewashed already ! Now again , the soft reverie flowing away in my mind like smoke , I heard Gray 's voice as he addressed the court : " .. . are doubtless familiar , perhaps actually conversant , with an even more important work by the late Professor Enoch Mebane of the Professors Sentelle and Richards just quoted . For whereas Professors Sentelle and Richards have demonstrated , from a theological standpoint , the innate and inbred , indeed the predestined deficiency of the Negro in the areas of moral choice and Christian ethics , it remained the achievement of Professor Mebane to prove beyond the iota of a doubt that the Negro is a biologically inferior species . Certainly this court is aware of Professor Mebane 's treatise , therefore I shall refresh your honorable minds of its contents only in the barest outlines : videlicet , that all the characteristics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what Professor Mebane has termed the gnathic index ; the sloping , beetle-browed cranium , with its grotesque and brutelike width between ear and ear and its lack of vertical lobal areas that in other species allow for the development of the most upwards-reaching moral and spiritual aspirations ; and the extraordinary thickness of the cranium itself , resembling not so much that of any human but of the lowest beasts of the field  --  that all these characteristics fully and conclusively demonstrate that the Negro occupies at best but a middling position amongst all the species , possessing a relationship which is not cousin-german to the other human races but one which is far closer to the skulking baboon of that dark continentfrom which he springs ... " + 9 4 +Gray halted , and as if pausing for a moment 's breath , leaned forward with both hands against the table top , resting his weight there as he contemplated the magistrates at the bench . The courtroom was silent . Quiet , blinking in the steamy air , the people seemed to attend Gray 's every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some revelationwhich would assuage their fright and their anxiety and even the grief which stitched them together , one and all , like the hysteric thread of that woman 's sobbing anguish still persistingin the back of the courtroom , a single noise in the stillness , out of hand now , inconsolable . The manacles had made my hands numb . I flexed my fingers , felt no sensation . Gray cleared his throat , then continued : " Now then , honorableJustices , I beg to be permitted a philosophical leap . I beg to be permitted to connect these unassailable biological theories of Professor Mebane with the concepts of an even greater figure in human thought , namely , the great German philosopher Leibnitz . Now , you arc all acquainted with Leibnitz 's concept of the monad . The brains of all of us , according to Leibnitz , are filled with monads . These monads , millions and billions of them , are nothing but tiny , infinitesimalmental units striving for development according to their pre-established nature . Now , whether one takes Leibnitz 's theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolical fashion , as I myself am wont to do , the fact remains  --  and it seems indisputable  --  that the spiritual and ethical organization of a single mind may be studied and understood from not alone a qualitative standpoint but from a quantitative standpointlikewise . That is to say , that this striving for development  --  andI emphasize and underline that phrase  --  may in the end be only the product of the number of monads that a single mind is physically capable of accommodating . " He paused , then said : " And here , your Honors , is the crux of the issue which , I submit , if we now examine it closely , can lead only to the most optimistic of conclusions . For with hisunformed , primitive , almost rudimentary cranium , the Negro suffers from a grave insufficiency of monads , so grave indeed that this striving for development  --  which in other races has given us men like Newton and Plato and Leonardo da Vinci and the sublime inventive genius of James Watt  --  is unalterablyhampered , nay , mutilated , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the glorious musicianship of Mozart and on the other , pleasant but childish and uninspired croonings , on the one hand the magnificent constructions of Sir Christopher Wren and on the other the feeble artifacts and potsherds of the African jungle , on the one hand the splendid military feats of Napoleon Bonaparte and on the other  --  " He broke off again , with a gesture toward me . " On the other the aimless and pathetic and futile slaughter of Nat Turnerdestinedfrom its inception to utter failure because of the biological and spiritual inferiority of the Negro character ! " Gray 's voice began to rise . " Honorable Justices , again I do not wish to minimize the prisoner 's atrocious deeds , nor the need for stricter controls upon this portion of the population . But if this trial is to illumine us , it must also give us room for hope and optimism ! It must show us  --  and I submit that the defendant 's confessions have done so already  --  that we must not run in panic before the Negro ! So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimlessly put into effect ... " Again his words fade away on my ears , and I briefly shut my eyes , half drowsing , and again I hear her voice , bell-clear on that somnolent dusty Sunday half a year past : Oh me oh my , Nat , too bad for you . It 's Mission Sunday . This is Richard'sday that he preaches to the darkies ! Alighting from the buggy , she casts me a sweet , rueful look . Poor Nat . . . And she is gone ahead of me through the dazzling clear light , the white linen swishing as she runs on tiptoe , disappearing into the vestibule of the church , where I too now enter , cautiously , quietly , stealing up the back ladder to the balcony set off for Negroes , hearing as I climb Richard Whitehead 's voice+96+nasal and high-pitched and effeminate as always even as he exhorts that black sweating assembly among whom I will take my seat : And think within yourselves what a terrible thing it would be , after all your labors and sufferings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next life , and after wearing out your bodies in service here to go into a far worse slavery when this is over , and your poor souls be delivered over into the possession of the devil , to become his slaves forever in hell , without any hope of ever getting free from it ... High above the white congregation , beneath the church roof where heat as if from an oven blooms stifling and damp amid a myriad swarming motes of ( lust , the Negroes , seventy or more from the surrounding countryside , sit on dilapidated backlesspine benches or squat helter-skelter on the gallery'screaking floor . I cast a quick glance over the crowd and glimpse Hark and Moses , and I exchange looks with Hark , whom I have not seen for nearly two months . Intent , absorbed , some of the women fanning themselves with thin pine-bark shingles , the Negroes are gazing at the preacher with the hollow-eyed fixity of scarecrows , and as I regard them I can tell whom they belong to by what they wear : the ones from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owners who are fairly rich , dressed cleanly and neatly , the men in cotton shirts and freshly laundered trousers , the women in printed calico and scarlet bandannas , some with cheap earringsand pins ; the ones from poorer masters , Nathaniel Francis and Levi Waller and Benjamin Edwards , in dingy rags and patches , a few of the crouched men and boys withoutshirts , picking their noses and scratching , sweat streamingoff their black backs in shiny torrents , the lot of them stinking to heaven . I sit down on a bench near the window in an empty space between Hark and an obese , gross-jowled , chocolate-colored slave named Hubbard , owned by the Widow Whitehead , who sports a white man 's cast-off frayed+97+multicolored vest over his flabby naked shoulders , and whose thick lips wear even now , as he meditates conscientiously upon the sermon from below , a flatterer 's avid smirk . I , encatll us , from a pulpit elevated above the assembled whites , in black suit and black tie , pale and slender , Richard Whitehead raises his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the roof : If therefore you would be God 's free men in paradise , you must strive to be good , and serve him here on earth . Your bodies , you know , are not your own ; they are at the disposal of those you belong to , but your precious souls are still your own , which nothing can take from you if it is not your own fault . Figure well then that if you lose your souls by leading idle , wicked lives here , you have gained nothing by it in this world and you have lost your all in the next . For your idleness and wickedness are generally found out and your bodies suffer for it here , and what is far worse , if you do not repent and alter your ways , your unhappy souls will suffer for it hereafter .. . Black wasps soar and float through the windows , drowsily buzzing as they lurch against the eaves . I but barely listen to the sermon ; from these same lips I have heard these same sour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they do not change or vary , nor do they even belong to the one who speaks them , having been composed rather by the Methodist Bishop of Virginia for annual dispensation by his ministers , to make the Negroes stand in mortal fear . That they have a profound effect on some of us , at least , I can not doubt : even now as Richard Whitehead warms up to his subject , and his pale face dampens and begins to flush as if from the glow of promised hellfire , I can see around me a score of faces popeyed with black nigger credulity , jaws agape , deliciousshudders of fright coursing through their bodies as they murmur soft Amens , nervously cracking their knuckles and making silent vows of eternal obedience . Yes , yes ! I hear a high impassioned voice , then the same voice croons O0000-h+9g+yes , so right ! And I shift my glance and see that this is Hubbard : obscenely he sways and wiggles on his thick buttocks , his eyes squeezed tightly shut in a trance of prayerful submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger , docile as a pet coon . And now I feel Hark 's big hand on mine , firm and and friendly and warm , and I hear his voice in a whisper : Nat , dese yere niggers goin ' git to heaven or bust dey britches . How you been , Nat ? Eat high off the hog at ole Widow Whitehead 's , I whisper back . Afraid that Hubbard might overhear , I keep my voice pitched low : there 's a gun room there , Hark , it 's something enormous . She 's got fifteen guns locked up behind glass . And powder and shot enough to fill a shed . We get them guns and Jerusalem belongs to the niggers . Last March , a month before caving the ' l'ravises ' for the Widow Whitehead 's , I told lark of my plans hark and three others . Where 's Henry and Nelson and Sam ? Dert all here , Nat. , hark says . I knowed you 'd be here , so I got dear to come too . Funniest daggone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hci ; un to chuckle , and I start to shush him up , but he c'ontinue 's : You know dat Nelson , his white folks is Baptists and noes to church down Shiloh way . So Nelson didn ' have no business goin ' to no Meth'dist meetin ' , specially when deg was Irreachin ' to de niggers like now . So his massah  --  you know dot mean of Marse Jake Williams what has one leg  --  he say : " Nelson , how come you want to go to a Meth ' - dist meetin ' where they 's exhortin ' the niggers ? " So Nelson he say : " Why , massah , dear massah. , I feels right sinful . I feels I done had things to you , and jes ' needs the fear of God in me so 's I can be your faithful nigger from now on ! " For a momentHark shakes and trembles with silent laughter , I fear that he might give us away . I ; ut then he is whispering : Now dat Nelson is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to stick a knife in some white foks it 's dat ole Nelson . Dere he is , Nat , over yondah .. . +99+I have acquired the strongest faith in Hark , during the past six months slowly undermining his soppy childish esteem for white people , his confidence in them and his relianceupon them , digging in hard on the matter of the sale of his wife and little boy , which , I have insisted , was an irredeemableand monstrous act on the part of our master , no matter how helpless Marse Joe has claimed to be in the transaction ; I have battered down Hark 's defenses , playing incessantly , almost daily , upon his sorrow and loss , coaxing and wheedling him into a position where he too must grasp , firmly and without qualm , one of the alternatives of freedom or death-in-life , until at last  --  revealing my plans for a bloody sweep through the countryside , the capture of Jerusalem , and a safe flight into the bosom of the Dismal Swamp where no white man can follow us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a winter day in Travis 's shop , harassed to the breakingpoint by one of Putnam 's yowling , peevish harangues , he turns on the boy , brandishing in one hand a ten-pound crowbar , and with the glint of murder in his eye , saying nothing but presenting such an aspect of walled-up rage breaking loose that even I am alarmed , faces his quaking tormenter down once and for all . It is done , it is like once when I watched a great glorious hawk burst free from a snare into the purity of a wide blue sky . Hark is exuberant . Dat l'il sonabitch never run me up a tree again . Thus Hark becomes the first to join me in this conspiracy . Hark , then Henry and Nelson and Sam : trustworthy , silent , without fear , all men of God and messengers of His vengeance , these have shared already in the knowledge of my great design . I see Nelson now across the packed gallery : an older man , fifty-four or fifty-five or fifty-six  --  as is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sits oval-faced and impassive amidst this addled , distraught , intimidated throng , heavy-lidded eyes making him appear half asleep , a presence of unconquerable patience and calm , yet like a placid sea+ I O O +beneath which lie boiling vast convulsions of fury . A slick and shiny , elevated " S " the ragged length and width of a small garter snake , souvenir of old-time branding days , winds its way through the sparse gray hairs of his black chest . He can read a few simple words  --  where or how he has learned them I do not know . Weary and sick  --  close to madness  --  ofbondage , he has had more than a half a dozen masters , the last and present one an evil-tempered , crippled woodcutter his same age who dares not whip him after his one adventure in this area ( with no more emotion than if he had been slapping a gnat , Nelson struck him back full in the face , and said that if he tried it again he would kill him ) but now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds him on the nastiest kinds of leavings and slops . Nelson had a wife and family once but can hope no longer to see them either together or often , scattered as they are all over three or four counties of the Tidewater . Like Hark he has little religion  --  and like Hark is often foul of mouth , which generally causes me some distress  --  but this does not really trouble mc ; to me he is a man of God : shrewd , slowmoving , imperturbable , his slumbrous eyes conceal a maddeneddefiance , and he will be a strong right arm . Nigger life ai n't worth pig s ) rit , he once said to me ; mought make a nigger worth somethin ' to hisself , tryin ' to git free , even if he do n't . And his counsel about strategy is many times inspired : Rock de places what 's got horses first , horses 'll git us amoverin. ' fast . Or : Rock on a Sunday night , days a nigger 's night for huntin ' . Dent white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out treein ' a possum . Or : Us jes ' gots to keep de niggers out'n dem cider presses . Let dem black bastids get at dat cider an ' brandy and us done lost de war ... I look at Nelson and he looks back at me with sleeping , impassive eyes , betraying no recognition .. . Now again I hear Hark 's voice in my ear : After church dey 's some kind of doin 's at de graveyard dat de niggers ain'tsuppose to go to .. . + I O I + . Yes , I say , I know . I feel a growing excitement , for I sense that on this day I may be able at last to outline and enlarge upon the details of my plans . I know . Where we goin ' to meet ? See , dey 's dem two logs over de creek down behin ' de church . I tol ' Henry and Nelson and Sam to meet us dere while de white foks was at de graveyard .. . Yes , good , I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be overheard , and we both turn then , faking pious attention to the words rising toward us through the swarming wasps , up across the creaking and snapping rafters : Poor creatures ! You little consider when you are idle and neglectful of your masters ' business , when you steal and waste and hurt any of their substance , when you are saucy and impudent , when you are telling them lies and deceiving them , or when you are stubborn and sullen and will not do the work you are told to do without chastisement  --  you do not consider , I say , that what faults you are guilty of towards your masters and mistresses are faults done against God Himself , who has set your masters and mistresses over you in His own stead , and expects that you would do for them just as you would do for Him . Do not your masters , under God , provide for you ? And how shall they be able to do this , to feed and to clothe you , unless you take honest care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this of you . And if you are not afraid of suffering for it here , you can not escape the vengeance of Almighty God , who will judge between you and your masters , and make you pay severelyin the next world for all the injustice you do them here . And though you could manage so cleverly as to escape the eyes and hands of man , yet think what a dreadful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God , who is able to cast both soul and body into hell .. . And now through the soft moaning of the black crowd , through Hubbard 's fat sighs of pleasure and the murmur and fidget and the Amens gently aspirated in gasps of dumb rap-+ io3 +it , that I omit such a vengeance : Do not unto their women what they have done to thine .. . I banish Will from my mind and as my eyes rove around the gallery I see the other two in whom I have placed my trust . Owned like Will by Nathaniel Francis , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with freckles and ginger-colored hair . He is intractable and high-strung , also many time a runaway , and his yellow skin is knobbed and striped by the lash . I value him for his intelligence but also for his color : he is light of hue and his presence thus commandsconsiderable respect among many of the Negroes , especially the simple-minded , and I feel that when my scheme achieves momentum Sam 's appearance will be useful in gainingnew recruits . He is skillful in quiet , furtive intrigue and has already won for the cause Henry , who sits beside him now , eyes shut , rocking slightly , with a look of beatitude and calm . So far as I can tell , he is sound asleep . Short , square in shape , very black , he alone among my group is of a religious nature . He is owned by Richard Porter , a devout and kindly master who has never raised a hand against him . At forty , Henry lives among Biblical fancies , in a shadowland of near-silence , almost completely deaf from boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose name or face he can no longer remember . It is the recollection of that blow that feeds his calm fury .. . The sound of organ music fills the air . The sermon is ended . Down below , the white people have risen , joining together in song . " Can we , whose souls are lighted With wisdom from on high , Can we to men benightedThe lamp of life deny ? " The black people do not sing but stand respectfully in the hot gallery , mouths agape or with sloppy uncomprehending smiles , shuffling their feet . Suddenly they seem to me as+ I o 2 +ture and desire , I hear another voice behind me and very near , almost at my shoulder , a harsh rapid low muttering , almost incoherent , like that of a man in the clutch of fever : ... me some of dat white stuff , yas , get me some of dat white stuff , yas . . . And without turning  --  suddenly unsettled and afraid to turn ; rather , afraid to confront that obsessed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw and bulging eyes with their gaze murderous , fixed , dimbrained , pure  --  I know whose voice it is : Will 's . I am seized with a quick displeasure . For although like Nelson he has been driven half crazy by slavery , Will 's madness is not governed by silence and some final secret control , but has the frenzied , mindless quality of a wild boar hog cornered hopelesslyin a thicket , snarling and snapping its brutish and unavailingwrath . Age twenty-five or a little more , a chronic runaway , he once got nearly to Maryland , sustained in his flight not so much by intelligence as by the same cunning and endurance of those little animals native to the swamps and woods in which he roamed for six weeks , before being overhauledand delivered to his present master , a nigger-breaker named Nathaniel Francis who has beaten him into some kindof stunned and temporary submission . He crouches behind me now , muttering to whom it is impossible to tell  --  to himself , to no one , to anyone at all . Ole white cunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litany repeats it over and over . Will 's presence disturbs me , for I want no part of him , either now or in my future plans . And I am afraid that he willdiscover what 's afoot . Rather than finding any value in hisfractiousness , his rage and rebellion , I am filled with distrust , instinctively put off by the foaming and frenzied nature of hismadness . Besides , there is one other thing , evident enoughnow in that obsessive incantation : I know from hearsay thathe broods constantly upon rape , the despoliation of whitewomen masters his dreams night and day . And already  --  andHark and Nelson and the others have sworn to obey  --  I haveforbidden this kind of violation . It is God 's will , and I know+o4+ meaningless and as stupid as a barn full of mules , and I hate them one and all . My eyes search the white crowd , finally discover Margaret Whitehead , her dimpled chin tilted up as , with one arm entwined in her mother 's , she carols heaven- ward , a radiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and softly , like a gentle outrush of breath , my hatred of the Negroes diminshes , dies , replaced by a kind of wild , desperate love for them , and my eyes are wet with tears . " Salvation , O Salvation ! The joyful sound proclaim , Till each remotest nation I1:is learnt Messiah 's name ... " And later that afternoon  --  after the hurried secret parley by the creek  --  driving the carriage back home through the parched and windless fields , I hear behind me two voices now , Margaret Whitehead 's and her mother 's , fondly : I do think P , oysie 's sermon was most inspiring , do n't you , little Miss Peg ? There is a short space of silence , then her bright laughter : Oh , Mother , it 's the same old folderol , every year ! Just folderol for the darkies ! Margaret ! What an expression to use ! Folderol indeed ! I 'm simply appalled ! If your sainted father were here , to hear you talk like that about your own brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize that Margaret is close to tears . Oh , Mother , I 'm sorry , I just do n't know . And she is quietly sobbing now . I just do n't know . I just do n't know . And I hear the woman draw Margaret to her with a rustle . There , there , dear . I understand . It must be a bad time of the month . We 'll be home soon and you can just go lie down and I 'll make you a nice cup of tea . . . High over the flat land thunderheads loom , their under- 1 U 5sides churning , promising a storm . I feel the sweat rolling down my back . After a bit I let my eyes close , and I smell the rich odor of horse droppings as I make a silent prayer : Forsake me not , 0 Lord : 0 my God , be not far from me . Make haste to help me , 0 Lord my salvation , for the hour of my battle comes near .. . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet in the courtroom . It was hot and very still , and for a long time as I stood clumsily in my chains leaning against the table there was no interruption to the silence save for the panting and roaring of the stove . I turned to face Jeremiah Cobb . As I did so , regarding him for the first time straight on , I saw that his face was as white as tallow ; drawn and almost fleshless , it was the face of a cadaver , and it trembled and nodded as if with palsy . He looked down at me , the eyes sunk deep within their sockets , so that the effect was that of a gaze from some immeasurable distance , profoundas all eternity . Then all of a sudden I realized that he too was close to death , very close , almost as close as I myself , and I felt a curious pang of pity and regret . Cobb spoke again . " Have you anything to say why sentenceof death should not be pronounced against you ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not , " I replied . " I have made a full confession to Mr. Gray and I have nothing more to say . " . " Attend then to the sentence of the court . You have been arraigned and tried before this court and convicted of one of the highest crimes in our criminal code . You have been convicted of plotting in cold blood the indiscriminate destruction of men , of helpless women , and of infant children . . . The evidence before us leaves not a shadow of doubt but that your hands were imbrued in the blood of the innocent , and your own confession tells us that they were stained with the blood of a master  --  in your own language , too indulgent . Could I stop here your crime would be sufficiently aggravated+ I o 6 + + I o 7 + ... But the original contriver of a plan , deep and deadly , one that never could be effected , you managed so far to put it into execution as to deprive us of many of our most valuable citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstancesshocking to humanity . . . And while upon this part of the subject , I can not but call your attention to the poor misguided wretches who have gone before you . " He paused for an instant , breathing heavily . " They are not few in number  --  theywere your bosom associates , and the blood of all cries aloud , and calls upon you as the author of their misfortune . Yes . You forced them unprepared from time to eternity ... Borne down by this load of guilt , your only justification is that you were led away by fanaticism . " He paused again , gazing at me from the awful and immeasurabledistances where not alone his eyes but his dying flesh and spirit seemed to dwell , remote as the stars . " If this be true , " he concluded slowly , " from my soul I pity you , and while you have my sympathies I am nevertheless called upon to pass sentence of the court ... The time between this and your execution will necessarily be very short , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court is that you lc ' taken hence to the jail from whence you came , thence to the place of execution , and on Friday next , Novembereleventh , at sunrise , be hung by the neck until you are dead ! dead ! crud !  --  and may the Lord have mercy upon your soul . " We gazed at each other from vast distances , yet close , awesomely close , as if sharing for the briefest instant some rare secret  --  unknown to other men  --  of all time , all mortality and sin and grief . In the stillness the stove howled and raged like a tumultuous storm pitched in the firmament between hell and heaven . A door flew open with a clatter . Then we ceased looking at each other , and outside a human roar went up like thunder . That evening as Hark talked to me through the cracks of the jail wall , his voice came pained and laborious and with a sort of faint gurgle or croak , like a frog 's . Only Hark could have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that day in August when they broke us up . Time after time they had carried him to court on a litter and they were going to have to hang him roped to a chair . The two of us would be the last to go . Dusk was coming on : as the cold day lengthened , light began to drain away from the cell as from a vessel , turning the corners dark , and the cedar plank I was lying on grew as chill as a slab of stone . A few leaves clung to the branches outside and through the gray twilight a cold wind whispered sharply , and often a leaf would flicker to earth or scuttle through the cell with a dry rattling sound . Every now and then I listened to Hark , but mainly I waited on Gray . After the trial he had said that he would come again this evening , and he promised to bring me a Bible . The idea of a Bible kept me in a greedy suspense , as if after a day 's long thirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch me brimming pails of cool clear water . " Oh yes , Nat , " I heard Hark say beyond the wall , " yes , dey was lots and lots of niggers kilt afterwards , w'ile you was hid out . And war n't our niggers neither . Dey tells me roun ' about a hundred , maybe lots mo ' . Yes , Nat , de white folks come down like a swarm of golly-wasps and plain long stomped de niggers ev'ywheres . You didn ' know about dat , Nat ? Oh yes , dey was plain long stomped . White folks dey come fum all over ev'ywheres . Dey come a-gallopin ' down from Sussex an ' Isle of Wight and all dem other counties an ' run de niggers clean into de groun ' . Didn ' make no nem'mine dat dey didn ' fight fo ' Nat Turner . If'n he had a black ass , dey fill hit full of lead . " Hark was silent for a while and I could hear his thick , tortured breathing . " After you was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat was standin ' in a field up some-+ I o 8 +wheres aroun ' Drewrysville . Dese white folks rode up an ' stop Jere . Is dis yere Southampton ? ' dey holler . Nigger he say , Yassuh , boss , you done jes ' passed de county line over yondah . " Pon my soul , Nat , dem white folks shot him dead . " Again he was silent , then he said : " I heerd tell of a nigger name of Statesman livin ' down aroun ' Smith 's Mill what ai n't even heerd of de ruction , bein ' slow in de head , you know ? Anyways , his massah he powerful exercise ' an ' mad an ' he take ole Statesman out an ' tie him to a tree an ' shoot him so full of holes you could see de sun shine th'ough . Oh me , Nat . Some sad stories I done heerd all dese months in jail ... " I watched the wintry gray light stealing softly away from the cell , thinking : 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , 0 my God , forgive me the blood of the innocent and slain ... But it was not a prayer at all , there was no echo , no understanding that it had reached God 's almighty hearing , only the sense of its falling away futile on the air like a wisp of smoke . A shudder passed through my bones and I clasped my arms around my legs , trying to still their shaking . Then as if to blot out this new ktu , wlcdge , I broke in upon Hark , saying : " Tell me , Hark , tell inc . Nelson . Tell me about Nelson . How did he die ? Did lie die brave ? " " Why sho he die brave , " Hark said . " Hung ole Nelson back in September . Him and Sam together , standing ' up straight as you could pray for , both dem . Dey tells me ole Sam wouldn ' die right off , flew off'n dat hangin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gobbler a-jumpin ' and a-twitchin ' . " Feebly , softly , Hark began to laugh . " Reckon dat li'l ole yellownigger was too light fo ' de rope . Dem white folks had to yank on old Sam 's feet afore he 'd give up de ghost . But he died brave , though , him an ' Nelson . Didn ' hear no mumblin ' nor groanin ' when dem two niggers died . " He paused and sighed , then said : " Onliest thing ole Sam was sad about was dat we didn ' cotch dat mean sonabitch Nat Francis dat+ Io9 +owned him . Cotched his overseer and two chillun but not Nat Francis . Dat 's what give Sam a misery . I seed Nat Francis in de cou'troom de day dey tried ole Sam . Jesus jumpin ' Judas ! Talk ' bout a mad white man ! Oo-ee , Nat , he let out a howl and jump straight over de railin ' an ' like to strangle dat Sam befo ' dey could haul him off . I heerd tell Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished de ruction . Got him a gang of folks an ' rode from Cross Keys to Jerusalem , shootin ' down ev'y nigger in sight . Dey was a free nigger woman name Laurie , wife to old John Bright live up Cloud School way , you know ? Well , dey took dat woman an ' leant her up ' longside a fence and druv a three-foot spike right up her ole pussy like dey was layin ' out a barbecue . Oh me , Nat , de tales I heerd tell dese months and days ! Dey was two white mens I heerd about , come up from Carolina , has actual got dery a real bunch of black nigger heads all nailed to a pole and was out to git dem some mo ' till de troops grabbed holt ' em an ' run ' em back to Carolina  --  " " Hush , " I broke in . " Hush , Hark ! That 's enough . I ca n't bear no more of that . I ca n't bear such talk no more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried could not help thinking , scraps of prayer afloat turbulent and spinning in my brain like twigs upon a flood : 0 spare me , that I may recover strength . Before I go hence . And be no more . I heard footsteps in the passageway , and suddenly Gray appeared at the door with the boy Kitchen , who noisily threw open the latch . " I ca n't stay but a minute , Reverend , " he said as he stepped into the cell and sat himself down across from me slowly , with a soft weary grunt . He looked exhausted and unstrung . I noticed that he was carrying nothing with him , and I felt my heart sink like a stone ; even before I could start to protest , though , he had begun to speak : " I know , I know , that durn Bible ! I know I promised to fetch you one  --  I 'm a man of my word , Reverend  --  but I run into a patch of difficulty , all unforeseen . The vote was five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean , Mr. Gray ? " I exclaimed . " What vote ? Mr. Gray , I ai n't asked for much  --  " " I know , I know , " he put in . " By all rights any man condemned to death should have the fullest spiritual comfort , be he black or white . And this afternoon when I petitioned the court for a Bible for your own personal use , I brought this fact out in the strongest terms . But like I say , Reverend , I run into a bit of difficulty . The majority of the Justices did n't cotton to this idea in any way , shape , nor form . In the first place , they felt very strongly about the moot point in  --  and the general tenor of  --  the community feeling as it stands , namely , that no nigger is to be allowed to read or write anyhow . In the second place , and on account of this , since no nigger about to he hung in this county has ever been allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make an exception in your case . So they took a vote . Five to one against your havin ' a Bible , with only the Chief Magistrate in favor  --  Mr. JeremiahCobb , whos about to cash in hisself , so I guess he 's got good reason to he soft on matters pertainin ' to spiritual com-fort . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I 'm sorry about that , Mr. Gray . It 'll be right tough on me without a Bible . " Gray was silent for a while , a queer quizzical look on his face . Then he said : " Tell Inc , Reverend , you ever heard tell ofa galaxy ? " " A what ? " I said . I was barely listening . I can not describe my misery and desolation . " A galaxy . G-a-l-a-x-y . Galaxy . " " Well , sir , " I replied finally , " I may have heard that word used , but I ca n't rightly say I know what it exactly means . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " The sun do n't move around the earth , a great big ball up there . The sun is a star . You know about that , do n't you ? " " Yes , " I said , " it seems to me I did hear about that . There was a white man in Newsoms told some of the Negroes that , + I I I +long time ago . He was one of those Quaker men . " " And you believe it ? " " I used to think it was right hard to believe , " I said , " but I 've come to believe it . By the Lord 's grace all things can be believed . " " Well , you know the sun is a star , but you do n't exactly know what a galaxy is . That right ? " " No , I do n't know , " I replied . " Well now , in England there 's a great astronomer name of Professor Herschel . Know what an astronomer is ? Yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago in the Richmondnewspaper . What Professor Herschel has found out is that this here star of our'n that we call the sun is but one of not thousands , not millions , but billions of stars all revolvin ' around in a great big kind of cartwheel that he calls a galaxy . And this sun of our'n is just a piddlin ' little third-rate star swimmin ' around amongst millions of other stars on the edge of the galaxy . Fancy that , Reverend ! " He leaned forward toward me , and I could smell the sudden apple-sweet perfumeof his presence . " Fancy that ! Millions and even billions of stars all floatin ' around in the vastness of space , separated by distances the mind ca n't even conceive of . Why , Reverend , the light we see from some of these stars must of left there long before man hisself ever dwelt on earth ! A million years before Jesus Christ ! How do you square that with your Christianity ? How do you square that with God ? " I pondered this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you , Mr. Gray , by the Lord 's grace all things can be believed . I accept the sun and the stars , and the galaxies too . " " Hogwash ! " he exclaimed . " Christianity is finished and done with . Do n't you know that , Reverend ? And do n't you realize further that it was the message contained in Holy Scripture that was the cause , the prime mover , of this entire miserable catastrophe ? Do n't you see the plain ordinary evil of your dad-burned Bible ? " + I I2 +He fell silent , and I too said nothing . Though I was no longer either as hot or cold as I had been that morning  --  indeed , for the first time that day I felt a tolerable comfort  --  my throat had gotten dry and I found it difficult to swallow . I closed my eyes for a second , opened them again : in the cold , pale , diminishing light Gray seemed to be smiling at me , though perhaps it was only the dimness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his heavy round face . I felt that I had only faintly understood what Gray had said  --  grasped the barest beginnings of it ; finally I replied in a dry voice , the frog still in my throat : " What do you mean , Mr. Gray ? I fear I do n't quite follow . Evil ? " Gray leaned forward , slapping his knee . " Well , Jehoshapbat , Reverend , look at the record ! Jes ' look at it ! Look at your own words ! The words you rattled off to me for three days runnin ' ! The divine spirit ! Seek ye the kingdom of heaven ! My wisdom came from God ! All that hogwash , what I mean . And what 's that line you told me the heavenly spirit said to you when you were about to embark on this bloody course of your'n ? For he who knows  --  What ? " " For Ire who knoweth his Master 's will , " I said , " and doeth it not , shall be beaten with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , hogwash like that , what I mean . Divine guidance . Holy will . Messages from up above . Durndest slop ever I heard of . And what did it get you ? What , Reverend ? " I made no reply , even though now I had begun to understand what he was trying to say . I stopped looking at him and thrust my head into my hands , hoping that he would not find it necessary to go on . " Here 's what it got you , Reverend , if you 'll pardon the crudity . It got you a pissy-assed record of total futility , the . likes of which are hard to equal . Threescore white people slain in random butchery , yet the white people still firmly holdin ' the reins . Seventeen niggers hung , including you and+ I I 3 +old Hark there , nevermore to see the light of day . A dozen or more other nigger boys shipped out of an amiable way of life to Alabama , where you can bet your bottom dollar that in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and fever . I 've seen them cotton plantations . I 've seen them rice layouts too , Reverend  --  niggers up to their necks in shit from day clean to first dark , with a big black driver to whip ' em , and mosquitoes the size of buzzards . This is what you brung on them kids , Reverend , this is what Christianity brung on them boys . I reckon you did n't figure on that back then , didyou ? " I was silent for a moment , considering his question , then I said : " No . " For indeed , to be most truthful , I had not figuredon it then . " And what else did Christianity accomplish ? " he said . " Here 's what Christianity accomplished . Christianity accomplishedthe mob . The mob . It accomplished not only your senseless butchery , the extermination of all those involved in it , black and white , but the horror of lawless retaliation and reprisal  --  one hundred and thirty-one innocent niggers both slave and free cut down by the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon you did n't figure on that neither back then , did you , Reverend ? " " No , " I said quietly , " no , I did n't . " " And furthermore , you can bet your sweet ass that when the Legislature convenes in December they 're goin ' to pass laws that make the ones extant look like rules for a Sunday School picnic . They goin ' to lock up the niggers in a black cellar and throw away the key . " He paused , and I could sense him leaning close to me . " Abolition , " he said in a voice like a whisper . " Reverend , single-handed you done more with your Christianity to assure the defeat of abolition than all the meddlin ' and pryin ' Quakers that ever set foot in Virginia put together . I reckon you did n't figure on that either ? " " No , " I said , looking into his eyes , " if that be true . No. " + 4 +His voice had risen to a mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , butchery ! Death and destruction ! And misery and suffering for untold generations . That was the accomplishment of your Christianity , Reverend . That was the fruits of your mission . And that was the joyous messageof your faith . Nineteen hundred years of Christian teaching plus a black preacher is all it takes  --  Is all it takes to prove that God is a God durned lie 1 " He rose to his feet , moving briskly now , his voice softer as he spoke , pulling on his dingy gloves . " Beg pardon , Reverend . I 've got to go . No offense . All in all you 've been pretty fair and square with me . In spite of what I said , I reckon a man has to act according to his own lights , even when he 's the victim of a delusion . Good night , Reverend . I 'll look back in on you . " When he had gone Kitchen brought me a pan of cold pork and hoe cake and a cupful of water , and I sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall and fade away against the gray sky to the west . Presently I heard Hark on the other side of the wall , laughing softly . " Dat man sho give you down de country , Nat . What dat man so sweat up about ? " But I did n't reply to Hark , rising instead and shuffling the length of the chain to the window . Over Jerusalem hung a misty nightfall , over the brown and stagnant river and the woods beyond , where the water oak and cypress merged and faded one into the other , partakinglike shadows of the somber wintry dusk . In the houses nearby , lamps and lanterns flickered on in yellow flame and far off there was a sound of clattering china and pots and pans and back doors slamming as people went about fixing supper . Way in the distance in some kitchen I could hear a Negro woman singing  --  a weary sound full of toil and drudgery yet the voice rich , strong , soaring : I knows moonrise , I knows star-rise , lay dis body down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared ; a rime of frost lay in its place , coating the earth with icy wet pinpricks of dew , criss-+ I 15 +crossed by the tracks of squirrels . In chilly promenade two guards with muskets paced round the jail in greatcoats , stamping their feet against the brittle ground . A gust of wind swept through the cell , whistling . I shivered in a spasm of cold and I closed my eyes , listening to the lament of the woman far off , leaning up against the window ledge , half dreaming in a half slumber of mad weariness and longing : As the heart panteth after the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , 0 God . My soul thirsteth for God , for the living God . Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts : all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me . . . For what seemed a long time I stood leaning near the window , my eyes shut tight against the twilight . Maybe he is right , I thought , maybe all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I 've done was evil in the sight of God . Maybe he is right and God is dead and gone , which is why I can no longer reach him . . . I opened my eyes again , looking out into the gloaming light , above the woods where wild ducks skimmed southward against a sky as gray as smoke . Yes , I thought , maybe all this is true , otherwise why should God not heed me , why should he not answer ? Still the woman 's rich sweet voice soared through the gathering dusk : I walks in de moonlight , walks in de starlight , to lay dis body down . . . Grieving , yet somehow unbending , steadfast , unafraid , the voice rose through the evening like memory , and a gust of wind blew up from the river , dimming the song , rustlingthe trees , then died and became still . I 'll lay in de grave and stretch out my arms . . . Suddenly the voice ceased , and all was quiet . Then what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if what I done was wrong , is there no redemption ? I raised my eyes upward but there was no answer , only the gray impermeable sky and night falling fast over Jerusalem . PartIIOLDTIMES PASTVoices , Dreams , Recollections+ + + + + + + + + + + + +ONCE WHEN I WAS A BOY OF TWELVE OR thereabouts , and living with my mother in the big house at Turner 's Mill , I remember a fat white man who stopped one night and had supper with my owner of that time , Samuel Turner . This traveling man was a bluff , hearty soul with a round red face , cruelly pockmarked , and a booming laugh . A dealer in farm implements  --  ploughs and harrows , shares and cultivators and the like  --  he traveled up and down the country with several huge wagons and a team of dray horses and a couple of boys to help him , stopping for the night at this or that farm or plantation , wherever he happened to be peddlinghis wares . I no longer recall the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do remember the season , which was the beginning of spring . Indeed , it was only what this man said about the weather and the season that caused me to remember him at all . For that evening in April , I was serving at the supper table ( I had just recently begun this chore ; there were two older Negroes in attendance , but it was my apprenticeduty alone to replenish the glasses with cider or buttermilk , to pick up whatever fell to the floor , and to shoo away the cat and the dogs ) and I recollect his voice , very loud but genial , as he orated to Marse Samuel and the family in the alien accent of the North : " No , sir , Mr. Turner , " he was saying , " they is no spring like it in this great land of ours . They is nothing what approaches the full springtide when it hits Vir-+ I 2 0 + + I 2 I +ginia . And , sir , they is good reason for this . I have traveled all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges of New England to the hottest part of Georgia , and I know whereof I speak . What makes the Virginia spring surpassing fine ? Sir , it is simply this . It is simply that , whereas in more southern climes the temperature is always so humid that spring comes as no surprise , and whereas in more northerly climes the winter becomes so prolonged that they is no spring at all hardly , but runs smack into summer  --  why , in Virginia , sir , it is unique ! It is ideal ! Nature has conspired so that spring comes in a sudden warm rush ! Alone in the Virginia latitude , sir , is spring like the embrace of a mother 's arms ! " I remember this moment with the clarity of a great event which has taken place only seconds ago  --  the breath of spring still in my nostrils , the dusty evening light still vivid and golden , the air filled with voices and the gentle clash of china and silverware . As the traveling man ceases speaking , the clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I Dear through the soft yet precisely enunciated cadences of S:unuel Turner 's own voice : " You are perhaps too complimentary , sir , for spring will soon also bring us a plague of bugs . But the sentiment is well taken , for indeed so far Nature has been kind to us this year . Certainly , I have but rarely seen such ideal conditions for planting  --  " There is a pause as the sixth and final chime lingers for an instant with a somnolent hum , then dwindles away dully into infinity , while at this same instant I catch sight of myself in the ceiling-high mirror beyond the far sideboard : a skinny undersized pickar-inny in a starched white jumper , the toes of one bare foot hooked behind the other leg as I stand wobblingand waiting , eyes rolling white with nervous vigilance . And my eyes return quickly to the table as my owner , for the traveling man 's benefit , gestures with his fork in a fond , circular , spacious motion at the family surrounding him : his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty , and his two nephews  --  grown men of twenty-five or more with rectangular , jut-jawed faces and identical thick necks looming above me , their skin creased and reddened with sun and weather . Samuel Turner 's gesture embraces them all ; swallowing a bite , he clears his throat elaborately , then continues with warm humor : " Of course , sir , my family here can hardly be expected to welcomesuch an active time of the year , after a winter of luxuriousidleness . " There is a sound of laughter , and cries of " Oh , Papa ! " and I hear one of the young men call above the suddenclamor : " You slander your industrious nephews , Uncle Sam ! " My eyes wander to the traveling man ; his red , evilly cratered face is crinkled in jollity , and a trickle of gravy threads its way down the side of his chin . Miss Louisa , the eldest of the daughters , smiles in a vague and pretty way , and blushes , and she lets drop her napkin , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . Now in the twilight the merriment slowly subsides , and the conversation proceeds in easy ruminative rhythms , the women silent , the men alone chatting garrulous and fullmouthedas I circle the table with the china pitcher of foamingcider , then return to my station between the two thickneckednephews , resume my one-legged heron 's stance and slowly turn my gaze out into the evening . Beyond the veranda the pasture slopes away green and undulating toward the pinewoods . On the coarse weedy grass a score of sheep munch placidly in the yellow light , trailed by a collie dog and a small , bowlegged Negro shepherdess . Past them , far down the slope where a log road separates the lawn and the loomingforest , I can see an empty cart drawn by two flop-eared mules , making its last trip of the day from the storehouse to the mill . On the seat of the cart sits a Negro man , a yellow straw hat raked down upon his head . As I watch , I see that the man is trying to scratch his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then his right arm arching down over his+ I 2 2 +shoulder as the black fingers grope in vain for the source of some intolerable itch . Finally , as the mules plod steadily down the slope and the cart ponderously rocks and veers , the man stands up with a lurching motion and scrapes his back cowlike up and down against the sidepost of the cart . For some reason , I find this wonderfully amusing and I suddenly am aware that I am giggling to myself , though not so loudly that the white people may notice . Long moments pass as I watch the cart drift rocking across the margin of the woods , the man seated again as cart and mules pass with a distant drumming of hooves and creaking axles over the little bridge then around the murky lower rim of the millpond , where two white swans glide stately and soundless , finally vanishing behind the forest-shadowed white shape of the sawmill with its dull and sluggish rasp of metal-tortured timber drifting up faintly through the dusk : hrrush , hrrush . Closer now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my daydream , and I turn back to the table and the bright tinklingcollision of china and silver , the traveling man 's voice broadly ingratiating as he speaks to Marse Samuel : " . . . a new line of sundries this year . Now for instance , I have some pure sea salt from the Eastern Shore of Maryland , for preservingand table use only , sir . . . They is nothing better in the market . . . And so you say they is ten people here , including the overseer and his family ? And sixty-eight grown Negroes ? Presuming it goes mostly for salt pork then , sir , I should say five sacks will do you nicely , a splendid bargain at thirty-one dollars twenty-five cents ... " Now again my mind begins to wander . My thoughts stray outdoors once more where the brilliant fuss of chattering birds intrudes in the fading day  --  blackbirds and robins , finches and squawking jays , and somewhere far off above the bottomlands the noise of some mean assembly of crows , their calls echoing venturesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my attention , so now slowly and+ 12 3 +with irresistible pleasure I turn to gaze at the coarse green slope with its slant of golden light and its nimble bustle of many wings , the flower bed only feet away ferny and damp with the odor of new-turned earth . The little black bowleggedshepherdess has vanished from the pasture , sheep and collie too , leaving behind a haze of dust to tremble in the evening light . Rising on fat whirlpools of air , this haze fills the sky like the finest sawdust . In the distance the mill still rasps with a steady husking noise above the monotonous roar of water from the sluiceway . Two huge dragonflies dart across the evening , wild and iridescent , a swift flash of transparency . Springtime . Worried that my excitement will show , I feel my limbs stretch and quiver with a lazy thrill . A sense of something quickening , a voluptuous stirring courses gently through my flesh . I hear the blood pulsing within me like some imagined wash of warm oceanic tides . In my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spring , spring , I find myself whispering to myself  --  and this awakeningbrings to my lips the shadow of a grin . I feel half stunned , my eyes roll like marbles . I am filled with inexplicable happinessand a sense of tantalizing promise . As the traveling man 's voice drifts back into hearing , I turn again and feel the gaze of my mistress , Miss Nell , upon me , and I look up then and see her mouth forming the whisperedword " cider . " I grasp the heavy pitcher with two hands and again make my circuit of the table , filling the glasses of the women first , taking pains that not a drop is spilled . My care is meticulous . I hold my breath until the edge of the table swims dizzily before my eyes . Now finally I am at the elbow of the traveling man , who , as I serve him , ceases his talk of commerce long enough to look down at me and goodnaturedlyexclaim : " Well , I 'll be durned if that crock ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half aware that he is addressingthese words to me , and I am unconcerned as I pour the cider , replace the glass , and continue my tour around the I24 +table . " Cute little nipper too , " the traveling man adds in an offhand tone , but again I make no connection between myself and what is said until now , drawing near to Miss Nell , I hear her voice , gentle and indulgent as it descends from the rare white prodigous atmosphere above me : " And smart , you would n't believe ! Spell something , Nat . " And then to the traveling man : " Ask him something to spell . " Suddenly I am fastened to my tracks and I feel my heart beat wildly as I realize that I am the focus of all eyes . The pitcher in my hands is as heavy as a boulder . He beams down at me ; the radish-red broad cheeks are all benevolence as the man pauses , reflects , then says : " Can you spell lady ' ? " But abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupt , amused : " Oh no , something difficult ! " And the traveling man scratches the side of his pitted face , still beaming : " Oh well , " he says , " let 's sec , some kind of flower . . . Columbine . ' Spell columbine . ' " And I spell it , without effort and instantly but in a pounding fury of embarrassment , the pulse roaring in my ears as the letters tumble forth in a galloping rush : " . . . i-n-e , spells columbine ! " And the laughter at the table that follows this , and a shrill echo from the walls , makes me realize in dismay that I am yelling at the top of my lungs . " It is I am sure a kind of unorthodoxy , and considered thus by some , " I hear my master say ( I resume my station , still flustered and with a madly working heart ) , " but it is my conviction that the more religiously and intellectually enlighteneda Negro is made , the better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one must begin at a tender age , and thus , sir , you see in Nat the promising beginnings of an experiment . Of course , it is late for this child , compared with white children , yet . . . " As I listen to him speak , not completelycomprehending the words , my panic and embarrassment ( which had been made up in equal parts of childish selfconsciousnessand terror at the thought that I might publicly fail ) diminish , fade away , and in their place I feel stealing+ I25 +over me a serene flow of pride and accomplishment : after all , I may have been a loudmouth , but I did know the word , and I sensed in the sunny laughter a laurel , a tribute . All of a sudden the secret pleasure I take in my exploit is like a delectableitch within , and though my expression in the mirror is glum , abashed , and my pink lips are persimmon-sour , I can hear my insides stirring . I feel wildly alive . I shiver feverishlyin the glory of self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the traveling man is again talking of his wares : " It is the Carey plough , sir , of stout cast iron , and I calculate it will supplant all ploughs presently in the market . They has been a big demand for it in the Northern states . . . " Yet even as he talks and my thoughts wander astray again , the proud glow of achievement hangs on , and I am washed by a mood of contentment and snug belonging so precious that I could cry out for the joy of it . Nor does it go away . It is a joy that remains even as the pinewoods begin to crowd ragged trembling shadows into the deserted pasture , and a horn blows far off , long and lonesomesounding , summoning the Negroes from the mill and the distantfields . As abruptly as some interrupted human grumble , the sawmill ceases its harsh rasp and husk , and for a moment the silence is like a loud noise in my ears . Now twilight deepens over the meadow , where bats no bigger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see through the evening shadows in the distance a line of Negro men trooping up from the mill toward the cabins , their faces black and barely visible but their voices rising and falling , wearily playful with intermittent cries of laughter as they move homeward with the languid , shuffling , shoulder-bent gait of a long day 's toil . Snatches of their talk rise up indistinctlyacross the field , sounds of gentle , tired skylarking in the twilight : " Hoo-dar , Simon ! ... Shee-it , nigger ! . . . Cotch you , fo ' sho ! " Quickly I turn away ( could there have been a whiff of something desperate and ugly in that long file of 126 +sweating , weary men which upsets my glowing childish housebound spirit , disturbs the beatitude of that April dusk ? ) and circle the table with my pitcher one last time while the two other Negro house servants , Little Morning and Prissy , clear away the dishes and light thick candles on pewter candelabra that fill the darkening room with a pumpkin-hued glow . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thumbs of both hands hooked in the pockets of his vest . He is in his early forties ( to be precise , he will be forty-three at fivethirtyin the morning on the twelfth day of the coming June , according to one or another of the old house servants , who know more about the events in white people 's lives than white people do themselves ) but he looks older  --  perhaps only to me , however , since I hold him in such awe that I am forced to regard him , physically as well as spiritually , in terms of the same patriarchal and venerable grandeur that glows forth from those Bible pictures of Moses on the mount , or an ancientElijah exploding in bearded triumph at the transfigurationof Christ . Even so , the wrinkles around his mouth are early ; he has worked hard , and this accounts for those lines and for the cheek whiskers which end in small tufts whiter than a cottontail 's butt . " Ugly as a mushrat , " my mother has said of him , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horselike , the nose too prominent and beaked , and , as my mother also has observed , " Lawd did n't leave Marse Sam a whole lot of jawbone . " So much for my master 's chin . But his eyes are kindly , shrewd , luminous ; there is still strength in his face , tempered by a curious , abiding sweetness that causes him ever to seem on the verge of a rueful smile . At this time , my regard for him is very close to the feeling one should bear only toward the Divinity . " Let us adjourn to the veranda , " he says to the traveling man , pushing back his chair . " We usually retire more or less promptly at eight , but tonight you and I will share a bottle of 12 7 +port while we make out a requisition for my needs . " His hand falls lightly on the shoulder of the traveling man , who is rising now . " I hope you will forgive me if it sounds presumptuous , " he continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , but for a peddler who has the difficulties of so much travel , you sell an extremely reliable line of wares . And this , sir , as you must be aware , is of the greatest importance in a region like ours , removed so far from the centers of ' commerce . Since last year I have taken the opportunity of commending you to my friends . " The traveling man shines with pleasure , wheezing a little as he bows to the women and the young men , then moves on toward the door . " Well , thank you , sir . . . " he begins , but my owner 's voice interrupts , not rude , not even abrupt , but in continuation of his praise : " So that they shall be as satisfied as I have been in the past . And what did you say was your tomorrow 's destination ? GreensvilleCounty ? Then you must stop by Robert Munson 's place on the Meherrin River ... " The voices fade , and while I busy myself around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman Prissy clear the dishes , the rest of the family rises , slowly scattering in the last brief hours before bedtime : the two nephews to attend to a mare ready to foal , Miss Nell to take a poultice to a sick Negro child in the cabins , the three other women  --  all astir with gay anticipation as they bustle toward the parlor  --  to read aloud from something they call Marmion . Then these voices too fade away , and I am back in the kitchen again amid the clumping of crudely shod Negro feet and the sharp stench of a ham hock steaming on the stove , back with my tall , beautiful mother banging and grumbling in a swirl of greasy smoke  --  " ' Thaniel , you better get dat butter down in de cellar lak I told you ! " she calls to me  --  back in my black Negro world .. . But that evening in the early darkness while I lie awake on my straw bed , the word columbine is like a lullaby on my+ I2 8 +tongue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , letting each letter form its own shape , as if suspended magicallyabove me in the night . I lie at the drowsy edge of sleep , listening to the sounds of evening , to the feathery fuss and clumsy stir of chickens in their shed , a far-off howling dog , and from the millpond a steady passionate shrilling of frogs numberless as stars . All around me the smell of manure is rank and strong like the earth itself . Presently I hear my mother 's footsteps as she moves with a tired slat-slat of bare calloused feet from the kitchen , enters our tiny room , and lies down beside me in the dark . Almost at once she is fast asleep , breathing in a gentle rhythm , and I reach out and lightly touch the rough cotton shift above her ribs , to make certain that she is there . Then at last the spring night enfolds me as if with swamp and cedar and with drowsy remembrance , and dimly I hear a whippoorwill call through the dark , the word columbine still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with inchoate promise and a voiceless , hovering joy . It was memories like this which stayed with me all through the few days left until my death . During the night just after the trial I came down with some kind of fever , and when I awoke the next morning my arms and legs were trembling with the cold , even though I was soaked in sweat and my head was afire and swollen with pain . The wind had risen and in the sunless morning light , pale as water ; a blast of cold air howled through the open window , bringing with it a storm of gritty dust and pine needles and flying leaves . I started to call out to Kitchen , to ask him to fetch a blanket to stop up the window , but then I thought better of it , remained quiet : the white boy was still too scared of me even to answer . So again I lay back against the plank , shivering , and fell into a feverish doze when once more I was lying in the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace as I+ I 2 9 +drifted through the afternoon quiet of some wide and sunlit river toward the sea . In the distance I heard the ocean boomingwith the sound of mighty unseen breakers crashing on the shore . Far above me on its promontory stood the white temple , as ever serene and solitary and majestic , the sunlight bathing it as if with the glow of some great mystery as I moved on downriver past it , without fear , to the sandy cape and the tumultuous groaning sea . . . Then this vision glimmeredout and I awoke , raging with fever , and I fell asleep again , only to awake sometime later in the day with the fever diminishing and my brow cold and dry and the remnant of something frail and unutterably sweet , like a bird call , lingeringin my memory . Then not very long after this the fever commenced again and my mind was a wash and flow of nightmares , nightmares filled with unending moments of suffocation .. . And so in this way , between waking and oblivion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days and nights before the day of my execution .. . My mother 's mother was a girl of the Coromantee tribe from the Gold Coast , thirteen years old when she was brought in chains to Yorktown aboard a schooner sailing out of Newport , Rhode Island , and only a few months older when she was sold at auction beneath a huge live oak tree in the harborside town of Hampton , to Alpheus Turner , who was Samuel Turner 's father . I never laid eyes on my grandmother  --  nor for that matter a Coromantee girl  --  but over the years I heard about her and her kind , and in my mind 's eye it is easy to see her as she squats beneath the live oak tree so many years ago , swelled up with child , panting in a slow fright , lifting her face slightly at Alpheus Turner 's approach to reveala mouth full of filed teeth and raised tattoos like whorls of scattered birdshot on her cheeks , patterns blacker even than her tar-black skin . Who knows what she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws near ? Although his face is i1- lumined by a beneficent smile , to her it is a fiendish smirk , and besides he is white , white as bone or skulls or deadwood , whiter than those malevolent ancestral ghosts that prowl the African night . And his voice is the voice of a ghoul . " Gnah ! " he roars as he touches her , feeling the soundness of her limbs . " Fwagh ! " He is saying only " Good ! " and " Fine ! " to the trader , but in her terror she believes she is about to be eaten . The poor thing nearly takes leave of her senses . She falls from her perch on the block and her mind reels back in space and time toward some childhood jungle memory of warm , enveloping peace . As she lies asprawl , the dealer 's line of talk is to her a witch doctor 's jabber of disconnected croaking sounds , hav- ing to do with ritual chops and stews . " They all take such fright , Mr. Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at them fat tits ! Look how they spring ! I 'll wager she pops a ten-pound boy ! " But that same summer it was my mother who was born ( publicly begat upon the same slave ship by some unknown black father ) and it became well known around Turner 's Mill that when my young grandmother  --  who by this time had been driven crazy by her baffling captivity  --  gave birth to my mother , she was sent into a frenzy , and when presented with the babe , tried to tear it to pieces . I expect that if my grandmother had not died soon after this , I would have later become a field or timber hand at the Turner place , or maybe a mill hand , which was only a small cut better . But on account of my grandmother I was lucky and became a house nigger . My grandmother died within days of my mother 's birth , refusing to eat , falling into a stupor until the moment of her last breath , when it was said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsing in upon the inhabiting bones until the body of the child ( for that is what she was ) seemed so fragile as to be almost weightless , like a whitened , burnt-out stick of lightwood ready to crumble at the softest touch . For years there was a cedar headboard in the Negro graveyard , not far from the mill , with carved letters which read : " TIG " AET . 13BORN ANHEATHENDIED BAPTISEDIN CHRISTA.D. 1782R.I.P . That graveyard is in an abandoned corner of a meadow , hard by a scrubby grove of juniper trees and loblolly pine . A plain pole fence , dilapidated to begin with but long since fallen into splintery ruin , sets off the place from the rest of the field ; many of the headboards have toppled over to rot and mingle with the loamy earth , while in the spring those that remain become half hidden in a jungle of wild coarse greenery  --  skunk cabbage and cinnamon fern and a prickly tangle of jimson weed . In the summer the underbrush grows so thickly that you can no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grasshoppers sail through the weeds with small scaly whickerings , and ever so often a blacksnake slithers among the green , and on August days the odor is ripe and rank and very close , like a hot handful of grass . " How come you all de time studyin ' dat grabeyard , ' Thaniel ? " my mother says . " Ai n't no place fo ' chillun to go studyin ' ' bout . " And it is true : most of the Negroes avoid the place , filled with superstitious dread , and this in some measure ( the rest being lack of time ; attention to the dead requires leisure ) is the reason for the unsightly disrepair . But there is a leftoversavage part of me that feels very close to my grandmother , and for a couple of years I am drawn irresistibly+ 1 3 2 +back to the graveyard , and often I steal away from the big house during the hot break after midday dinner , as if seeking among all those toppled and crumbling wood markers with their roll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaniels  --  " Peak " and " Lulu " and " Yellow Jake "  --  some early lesson in mortality . How strange it is , after all , at age thirteen to ponder the last resting place of your own grandmother , dead at thirteen herself .. . But the next spring it is all gone . A new graveyard will be laid out at the edge of the woods , but before that  --  because it is drained and level and easy to get at  --  even this tiny remnantof crop land is needed , to raise sweet potatoes . I am filled with wonderment at how quickly the graveyard vanishes . It takes less than hall ' a morning  --  burnt off by a gang of black field hands with casks of turpentine and blazing pine fagots , the weatherworn cedar headboards consumed by flame , the dry underbrush crackling and hissing as the bugs spring up in a swarm and the field mice scuttle away , the cooling black char leveled clown by mule team and harrow , so that nothing remains of " Tig , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of the muscle , sleep , laughter , footsteps , grimy toil and singing and madness of all those black unremembered servitors whose shaken bones and dust , joiningmy grandmother 's in the general clutter underground , are now made to complete the richness of the earth . Only when I hear a voice  --  the voice of a Negro man , an old field hand standing by amid the swirling smoke , slope-shouldered , looselipped , grinning with a mouthful of blue gums , gabbling in that thick gluey cornfield accent I have learned to despise : " Dem old dead peoples is sho gwine grow a nice passel of yams ! "  --  only when I hear this voice do I begin to realize , for nearly the very first time , what the true value of black folk is , not just for white men but for niggers . So because my mother was motherless , Alpheus Turner brought her up out of the cabins and into his own home , +133+where she was reared by a succession of black aunts and grannies who taught her nigger-English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough , she became a scullery maid and then a cook , and a good cook to boot . Her name was Lou-Ann , and she died when I was fifteen , of some kind of tumor . But I am ahead of myself . What matters here is that the same happenstance that caused my mother to be brought up in Alpheus Turner 's house caused me in the course of events to become a house nigger , too . And that may or may not have been a fortunate circumstance , depending upon how you view what came to pass in Jerusalem so many years later . " Quit pesterin " bout yo ' daddy , " says my mother . " What make you think I knows where he done run off to ? What his name ? I done tol ' you dat twenty times . He name Nathaniel jes ' like you ! I done tol ' you dat , now quit pesterin ' ' bout yo ' daddy ! When he run off ? When de las ' time I seen him ? Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got no reelection . Les ' see . Well , Marse Alpheus he died ' leven years ago , bless his name . And seem lak ' twar n't but a year after dat when me an ' yo ' daddy was cou'tin ' . Now dere was some fine-lookin ' man ! Marse Alpheus done bought him in Petersburg fo ' to work strippin ' logs in de mill . But yo ' daddy he too smart fo ' dat kind of low nigger work . And he too good-lookin ' , too , wid dem flashin ' bright eyes , and a smile  --  why , chile , yo ' daddy had a smile dat would light up a barn ! No , he too good fo ' dat low kind of work , so Marse Alpheus he brung up yo ' daddy to de big house and commenced him into buttlin ' . Yes , he was de number-two butteler helpin ' out Little Mornin ' when first I knowed yo ' daddy . Dat was de year before Marse Alpheus died . And me an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole year it was  --  right in dis room .. . " But quit pesterin " bout dat , I tells you , boy ! How I know where he done run off to ? I don ' know nothin ' ' tall ' bout dat mess . Why sho he was angered ! Ai n't no black man goin ' run+134+ off less'n he 's angered ! Why ? How I know ? I don ' know nothin " bout dat mess . Well , awright , den , if you really wants to know , ' t was on account of Marse Benjamin . Like I tol ' you , when Marse Alpheus die ' t was Marse Benjamin come to own ev'ything on account of he was de oldest son . He five years older dan Marse Samuel so he gits to own ev'ything , I mean de house an ' de mill an ' de land an ' de niggers an ' ev'y- thing .

Well , yo ' daddy he ai n't used to havin ' no one holler at him like dat , an ' he turns aroun ' still smilin ' , see  --  he al- ways smilin ' , dat man -- an ' he mock Marse Benjamin right back . Marse Benjamin he done said somethin ' like , Nathan- iel , dis yere silver is filthy ! ' An ' yo ' daddy , he say : Yes , dis yere silver is filthy !

Well , Marse Ben- jamin he jes ' fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dere in front of Miss Elizabeth an ' Miss Nell an ' Marse Samuel and all de chilluns  --  dey jes ' young things den , ' bout yo ' age  --  and what he does , he whops yo ' daddy across de mouf with his hand . Dat 's all he does . One time  --  he jus ' whop him one time across de mouf an ' den he sit down . I'se lookin ' in at de door by dat time an ' all de family 's in an awful commotion at de table , Marse Samuel stewin ' an ' fussin ' an ' sayin ' to Marse Benjamin , Lawd knows he was uppity but you didn ' have to whop him like that ! ' an ' all , an ' de chilluns all a-cryin ' , least- wise de girls . ' Cause you see , Marse Alpheus he didn ' like to smite no niggers anyways an ' he never done it much , but whenever he done it he always took keer to do it way off in de woods out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks , too . So de fambly dey ai n't never seen a black man hit . But dat ai n't no nem'mine fo ' yo ' daddy . He jes ' come on out of dere and he march straight through de kitchen with dis yere smile still on his face an ' a little bitty strick of blood rollin ' down his lip , an ' he jes ' keep marchin ' on back to de room where we stays at  --  dis yere room right yere , chile !  --  an ' he packs up some food in a sack , an ' dat night he done light out fo ' good .. . " Where he done went to ? How I know ' bout dat ? You says on account of you 'd like to find him ! Lawd , chile , ai n't nobody goin ' find dat black man after all dese many years . What you say ? Didn ' he say nothin ' , nothin ' at all ? Why sho he did , chile . An ' ev'ytime I thinks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said he couldn ' stand to be hit in de face by nobody . Not nobody ! Oh yes , dat black man had pride , awright , war n't many black mens aroun ' like him ! And lucky too , why , he must had him a whole bag full of rabbit foots ! Ai n't many niggers run off dat dey don ' soon cotch someways . But I don ' know . Said he was goin ' run off to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and make him lots of money an ' den come back an ' buy me an ' you into freedom . But Lawd , chile ! Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , dey say dat 's a misery long ways off from here an ' I don ' know where yo ' daddy ever went . " Two hundred yards or so behind the room where my mother and I stay , at the end of a path through the back meadow , is the ten-hole privy shared by the house servants and the mill hands living in the compound of cabins near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steeply sloping bank of a wooded ravine , the privy is divided by a board partition ; five holes are for women and small children , the other five are for the men . Because the big house is isolatedfrom mill and field , and because the affairs of house servants transpire as if in a world apart , this privy is one of the few places where my daily life intersects with the lives of those Negroes who already I have come to think of as a lower+ 136 + + i37 +faintly sweetish like stagnant swampwater . I raise one oval lid and seat myself on the pine plank above the hole . Between my thighs light floods up from the slope of the ravine and I look downward at the vast brown stain splashed with the white of quicklime . I sit here for long minutes , in the cool beatitude and calm of morning . Outside , somewhere in the woods , a mockingbird begins a chant which ripples and flows like rushing water , ceases , commences again , falls ineffable and pure through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivy and fern . Here within , amid the sun-splashed gloom , I relieve myself in pleasant unhurried spasms , contemplating a blackberry-sized spider weaving in one corner of the ceiling a thick web which shakes , stretches , trembles in milky agitation . Now through the walls of the privy , from the distant back porch of the big house , I hear my mother calling . " ' Thaniel ! " she cries . " You , Nathaniel ! Nathan-yel ! You , boy ! Better come on here ! " I have dallied too long , she wants me near the kitchen to fetch water . " Nathaniel Turner ! You , boy ! " she cries . The mood of contentment dwindles away , the morning ritual nears its end . I reach out toward a tattered sack on the floor  --  a croker sack filled with corncobs .. . All of a sudden a searing heat seizes me from underneath ; my bare bottom and balls feel set on fire and I leap up from the seat with a howl , clutching at my scorched nether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greasy white billow . " Ow ! Ow ! Daggone ! " I shout , but it is mainly from surprise  --  surprise and mortification . For even as I cry out , the pain diminishes and I gaze back down through the hole , beholding the grinning light-brown face of a boy my age . He stands off at the edge of the mire below , grasping in one hand a blazing stick . With his other hand he is clutching his stomachin an agony of delight , and his laughter is high , loud , irrepressible . " Daggone you , Wash ! " I yell . " Jest daggone yo ' no-good black soul ! " But my rage is in vain , and Wash keepsorder of people  --  a ragtag mob , coarse , raucous , clownish , uncouth . For even now as a child I am contemptuous and aloof , filled with disdain for the black riffraff which dwells beyond the close perimeter of the big house  --  the faceless and nameless toilers who at daybreak vanish into the depths of the mill or into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundown to occupy their cabins like so many chickens gone to weary roost . Most of my way of thinking is due to my mother . It is the plague of her life that amidst so many other comparative comforts she must still make that regular trek to the edge of the ravine and there mingle with the noisy rabble so beneath her . " Hit 's a shame in dis world , " she fusses to Prissy . " Us folks in de house is quality ! And we ai n't got no outhouse for our own selfs , hit 's a cryin ' shame ! I 'll vow dem cornfield niggers is de akshul limit . Ev'y one dem chillun dey lets pee on de seat , and don ' none of ' em close down dem lids , so 's it stinks like misery . Druther go to de privy settin ' ' longside some ole sow dan one dem cornfield nigger womans ! Us house folks is quality ! " Equally disdainful , I avoid the morning rush , training my bowels to obey a later call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance to the men 's side ( which I have used since I was five ) is bare of vegetation , black hard clay worn glossy smooth by the trample of numberless bare or broganed feet , imprinted daily with a shifting pattern of booted heels and naked toes . Designed to prevent either malingering or seclusion  --  like the doors to all places frequentedby Negroes  --  the privy door too is lockless , latchless , swinging outward easily on leather hinges to reveal the closet within drowned in shadows , almost completely dark save for slivers of light stealing in through the cracks between the timbers . I am used to the odor , which is ripe , pungent , immediate , smothering my nose and mouth like a warm green hand , the excremental stench partly stifled by quicklime , so that the smell is not so much repellent to me as endurable , laughing , doubled up amid the honeysuckle .

It is a folly to look for good days so long as sin is so high , and those that study its nourishment so many ... The life of a little nigger child is dull beyond recounting . But during one summer month when I am nine or ten a cou- - , ple of curious events happen to me , one causing me the bitterestanguish , the other premonitions of joy . It is midmorning in August , hot and stifling , so airless that the dust-stained trees along the edge of the distant woods hang limp and still , and the grinding of the mill seems blurred , indistinct , as if borne sluggishly through heat waves trembling like water above the steaming earth . High in the blue heavens , buzzards by the score wheel and tilt and swoop in effortless flight over the bottomlands , and I lift my eyes from time to time to follow their somber course across the sky . I squat in the shadow of the little room projecting from the kitchen , where my mother and I live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smell faintly bitter and pungent ; midday dinner is far off , I feel my insides churning with hunger . Although I am not underfed ( to be the child of the cook is to be , as my mother constantly points out , the " luckiest little nigger ' live " ) I seem nonetheless to exist at the edge of famine . On the sill of the kitchen window above me , a row of muskmelons , half a dozen pale globes , stand ripening in the shade , unattainable as gold . I consider them gravely and with a yearning that brings water to my eyes , knowing that even to touch one of them would fetch upon me calamity like the crack of doom . Once I stole a pot of clabber cheese , and the walloping my mother gave me left me sore as a carbuncle . It is my duty to wait here near the door , to carry water and bring up things from the cellar , to run errands for my mother whenever she commands . My chores today are light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the corn crop has been laid by awaiting harvest and the mill works at half-time . During such a lull it has always been the custom of the brothers Turner , together with their wives and children , to make their annual trip to Richmond , leaving the place for a week or so in the hands of the overseer . Since with the family away my mother has only to cook for ourselves and the house servants  --  Prissy and Little Morning and Weaver and
