FEW more intimate relationships exist , outside the family or the church , than that of the average person with his doctor . Each year , nearly one billion visits are made to the U.S. 's 225,000 practicing doctors , or about five visits for every American . Each visitor expects not only medical care but comfort , sympathy , relief , reassurance and solace . There was a day when he could be sure of getting all these : the day , not too far past , of the family physician who often knew as much about his patient as he did about an illness . Today , Americans get far better medical care than ever before ; as for the rest , they are often lucky to get as much as a hurried smile . The result is a troubling paradox : at a time when medical skill has reached new pinnacles , the doctor-patient relationship has badly deteriorated . It is a situation that both irritates the patient and worries the medical profession . <P> The fact is that the doctor 's role has radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hangs in many a doctor 's office-a rumpled and exhausted physician keeps home watch over a comatose child while her worried parents hover anxiously in the background . The doctor has obviously been up all night , brooding , worrying , waiting-probably in part because he did not know what else to do . In today 's medicine , both the scene and the sentiment are badly out of date . The child would be in an oxygen tent in a hospital , festooned with tubes , watched over by bustling nurses or electronic monitors , banished from her parents ( visiting hours , 9-11 a.m. ) , and lucky to get a brief visit from the doctor once or twice a day . Instead of Old Doc 's bedside manner , the modern physician depends on a panoply of new skills , drugs and facilities that save many a patient his predecessor would have lost . The father image has been supplanted by the skilled technician whose head is far more important than his heart . Trouble is , the patient misses the heart . <P> <P> A Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . For the very reason that medical knowledge is expanding in quantum leaps , a modern doctor must spend much more time simply keeping abreast of his profession , thus has less time for individual patients . Moreover , his new skills can best be employed not in the home , but in the office or hospital , where equipment is available . With growing affluence and insurance , more and more people can afford what he has to offer . Since the overall ratio of doctors to population has remained roughly the same-one doctor for 760 people-the result is that the patient-load on doctors has doubled in just a few years . Because the patient is increasingly sophisticated about medicine , thanks to better reportage of medical advances , he is also likely to demand more of his doctor . Says Jerome Pollack , professor of medical economics and associate dean at Harvard Medical School : " People are aware of the explosion of medical knowledge , and they use doctors more . There is a great strain on doctors . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
