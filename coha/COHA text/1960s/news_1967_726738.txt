txt They do poorly as electronic equipment repairmen , and in the cooks and bakers schools they absorb visual instruction but can not follow written recipes . As a group they have a little more difficulty with the services ' basic training than their better equipped contemporaries and a lot more difficulty with advanced training involving mathematical or reading skills . But , so far , the Project 100 , - 000 , or " New Standards " men , as they are called by the Pentagon , have fitted pretty well into the armed forces , which , until Oct. 1 , 1966 , had rejected them . A Pentagon study of the first year of a new program for better military and social utilization of Group IV personnel ? the lower mental category in Armed Forces Qualification Tests  --  has shown that the attrition rate for the " New Standards " men in basic training is about double that of those in Groups I , II and III ? about 4 per cent as compared with 2 per cent . In the mcire complex advanced training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44.6 per cent among the " New Standards " men , but it has averaged about 12.3 per cent for all types of specialties as compared with 8 per cent for Army advanced trainees as a whole . About 48,700 Group IV men , with standards that were hitherto lower than those acceptable to the armed forces , plus // 600 men with medically remediable defects , were drafted or enlisted from Oct. 1 , 1966 , to Sept. 30 , 1967 . They represented Phase I of " Project 100 , - 000 "  --  a plan to induct 100,000 such men annually . The objective of the program is twofold  --  to make better military use , with the help of remedial and specialized training , of men with little education and restricted aptitudes , who would have to be used in large numbers by the services in case of a major war ; and to help provide educational opportunities and social rehabilitation for men with limited education and abilities . Use of Group N Men The services have always used Group IV men , who are defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Armed Forces Qualification Tests . Sometimes , such as during the Korean War , almost 30 per cent of inductees and new enlistments in the services came from Group IV personnel . Today the Group IV men represent 22 to 23 per cent of the draft-eligible population , and Project 100,000 has established a ratio of 22.3 per cent Group P/ category for the armed services as a group . In the fiscal year 1961 , tightened service standards led to a reduction of Category IV personnel accepted by the armed services to 12.9 per cent of all first enlistments . By 1966 , Vietnam and reduced mental standards for induction had increased this to 16.6 per cent . The Project 100,000 " New Standards " program requires the induction of 85,000 men each year , commencing Oct. 1 , from lower levels of Group IV personnel , men who were disqualified for service under the mental standards prevailing un7 til Oct. 1 , 1966 . On the basis of the services ' experience with 49,300 " New Standards " men in the first year of the program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men will be trainable , but a majority of them will have aptitudes , edu- , cation , skills and abilities ade quate only for the somewhat simpler military occupational specialities . The Army , which is handling more of the " New Standards " men than any other service , has found in a preliminary sampling of results that only 1.3 per cent of the lower-grade Group IV men failed to complete satisfactorily advanced individual training in infantry , gun crews and allied specialities . But the fail rate was much higher in such occupational areas as electrical , electronic and mechanical equipment repairmen , communications and intelligence specialists , medical and dental specialists , administrative and clerical specialists and other ratings requiring reading ability , mathematics and aptitudes . Group Is Not Segregated The " New Standards " men are not segregated or identified to their fellow trainees . They go through regular training along with Groups I , II and III . However , imaginative new methods of instruction emphasizing visual aids and repetitive techniques are being devised to help the slow learners , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " New Standards " men To date , about 10 per cent of them have been " recycled " ? repeated some phase of training  --  or have received special help in special training companies . This compares with about 4 per cent of the Group I , II and III men who have required special or extra training . Samplings of the " New Standards " men show that most of them come from the so-called underprivileged section of the society and that many of them , despite the fact that 43.4 per cent are high school graduates , have failed or repeated grades or have major reading weaknesses . Weaknesses in Reading To compensate for their weaknesses in reading and writing , the services have provided remedial instruction during training . Most of this instruction is similar to that provided at the special remedial literacy training units established by the Navy at its training stations at San Diego , Calif. , and Great Lakes , Ill . This involves four weeks of intensive instruction to recruits to increase their reading and writing skills - to at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " New Standards " men on entry is 21 ; 37.1 per cent are Negro . They have completed an average of 10.5 school years , but 31.8 per cent have failed or repeated one grade and another 24.3 per cent have failed or repeated two or more grades . About 27.8 per cent of them have a reading ability equivalent to the fourth grade or lower . About 8.5 per cent have one or more police convictions in civil courts on their records , and almost 30 per cent were unemployed . At induction , 26.6 , per cent were earning $60 a week or less . The services so far have found no major difficulty in absorbing the limited numbers of " New Standards " men assigned to them . They believe , however , that the full impact of the program upon combat effectiveness can not be judged until a considerably larger number of men have passed through the training cycle and completed first enlistments . The Army , in particular , recalls with some concern the low standards following the Korean War , when large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military prison population and a major proportion of disciplinary incidents . Generally , service spokesmen agreed that the program could be socially useful without any important degradation of military . effectiveness , if the numbers of " New Standards " men were kept to about the present planned intake proportions , and if the re-enlistment rate of these men did not greatly exceed the re-enlistment rate of higher categories .
