 | @# F ROM THE Golden Horn to the Potomac , from the year before the telephone to the ear of testing the Apollo moon-hip , from a little group of scienists and scholars to a worldwide National Geographic Society of : ive million members ? the long , busy life of Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor spanned all this . For 67 years he served the Society , first as Editor , then as President-Editor , and finally as Chairman of the Board of Trustees . For 55 years he edited the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ? from 1899 till 1954 ? and he gave us wise counsel till the day of his death . Because many members throughout the earth have sent their sympathy at his passing and shown keen interest in his career , and because without him our global Society and magazine would not have existed , this issue is dedicated to the ever-young man who saw a vision and made it real . October seems especially fitting , because that was the month of his birth and marriage , and of the birth of the magazine itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert Grosvenor was 90 when he failed to awake from a nap last February 4 in the old family summer home in Nova Scotia , where he had been marooned by increasing frailty since the previous autumn . But to us , his associates , he still seemed as young in heart and mind as any member of the staff . He always kept the sense of wonder that makes men young whatever their years . " They Lose All the Fun " Reminiscing a year before , he recalled bucking a storm in a Pan American Airways Clipper while he and Mrs. Grosvenor were making the first passenger flight of a husband and wife across the Pacific , in 1937 . Seeking less turbulent air , the pilot descended to about 200 feet above the waves . " Today , " a young man ventured , " the pilot would probably climb over the storm . " " They lose all the fun nowadays , " declared  | Dr. Grosvenor , emphatic as ever at 89 . " You ca n't see anything . " All his life he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world through the GEOGRAPHIC . " Extraordinary , " he would say as he peered at a picture . ( Like his son Melville , our President-Editor since 1957 , he joyed nothing so much as poring over a Rood set of color transparencies , especially he latest he had made himself . ) " Extraordinary . " He was an extraordinary editor , the rst to see the value of photographs and publish them on a lavish scale . Those of us who spent our professional lives in his shadow know that we were privileged to learn and grow in the presence of genius . He was a brilliant scholar , a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Amherst . But as an editor he was entirely self-taught . Like his magazine , he was unique , though his son has many of his qualities , including the all-important capacity for wonder , enthusiasm , excitement . Little children have it ? and great editors . Such people never grow old in spirit . They enjoy to the full the world God made . My mother expressed it a little wistfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'd like to stay and see how it all comes out . " Dr. Grosvenor at 90 still closely followed events in the changing world around him , leafed through the latest GEOGRAPHIC with professionally appraising eyes , and looked forward to seeing his beloved birds north-flying in another spring . It must make the Almighty especially happy when people appreciate His world so much . From Backpack to 25-mile Stack A born teacher like his father , Gilbert Grosvenor turned from teaching boys in a prep school in New Jersey to editing the GEOGRAPHIC as its sole paid employee at 23 . As builder of the Society and its magazine , he became a teacher to millions . When he died he left a towering monument : the world 's largest educational society , a great force for knowledge and international understanding . Its magazine had grown from a few hundred copies ? he recalled carrying them to the post office on his back ? to more than 5,000,000 a month , enough for a stack 25 miles tall . Like Prince Henry the Navigator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explorers of his era : Peary , Byrd , Amundsen , Shackleton , Stefansson . Gilbert Grosvenor himself did not go to the North Pole ? until much later , at age 77 ? but he and the Society backed the men who first did : Peary by dogsled in 1909 , Byrd by airplane in 1926 . In a " Dear Bert " note scribbled on the Society 's 1932 map of Antarctica , Rear Adm . Richard E. Byrd conveyed his " affectionate regards and appreciation and congratulations for producing this splendid map " and added : " P.S. I think I 'll try to clear up some of these blank spaces " ( pages 478-9 ) . He did . After flying over both Poles and mapping much of the Antarctic Continent by air , he wrote : " The officers and staff of the Society have given me all-out support in every major venture of my exploring career . " Many Map Features Bear His Name Explorers and scientists expressed appreciation by naming their discoveries for the Society 's forward-looking leader : Grosvenor Mountains and Grosvenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island in the Canadian Arctic ( by Vilhjalmur Stefansson ) ; Lake Grosvenor in Alaska ( by Dr. Robert F. Griggs ) , and Mount Grosvenor , Alaska ( by Lawrence Martin ) ; Grosvenor Glacier in Peru ( by Hiram Bingham ) ; Mount Grosvenor in China ( by Joseph F. Rock ) ; Grosvenorfjellet , a mountain in Spitsbergen ( by the British Spitsbergen Expedition of 1952 ) ; and Grosvenor Arch ( pages 450-51 ) in Kane County , Utah ( by Jack Breed ) . An honor that pleased him especially because of his lifelong interest in education and civic affairs was the naming of Grosvenor Elementary School , on Grosvenor Lane , near his Bethesda , Maryland , home . His great interest in wildlife , particularly birds , was recognized by the naming of two species for him : a thrush from Nepal by Dr. S. Dillon Ripley , now Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution , and a thicket warbler from New Britain , by the late Dr. E. Thomas Gilliard of the American Museum of Natural History .

The Grosvenor Medal , established by the National Geographic Society 's Board of Trustees in 1949 " for outstanding service to geography " ( page 481 ) , has been awarded only twice ? to Gilbert Grosvenor and to the late Dr. John Oliver La Gorce , his " colleague of the golden years " and successor as President and Editor ( 1954-1957 ) . As editor and traveler , conservationist , backer of trail blazers , adviser and supporter of scientists , Dr. Gilbert Grosvenor was one of the most influential men of his day . For more than a generation , as the Society 's President and Editor , he presided over a Board of Trustees that included some of the most eminent men in the Nation . He knew all the Presidents of the United States in this century , some of them intimately . " Played a Vital Role in America 's Coming of Age " In the evening of the day Dr. Grosvenor died , President Lyndon B. Johnson and the First Lady telephoned from the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his sisters and comfort them . Next day the President sent this wire : " As the Nation grieves the loss of your father , inquiring minds everywhere grieve the loss of a leader . Through words and pictures and through his own unswerving dedication , Gilbert Grosvenor opened the wonders of the world we live in to three generations of Americans . No mountain was too high , no sea too deep , no climate too forbidding for the teams of the National Geographic Society . " If a great national power has an obligation to know and to understand the nature of the world around it , then it can truly be said that Gilbert Grosvenor played a vital role in America 's coming of age . " Mrs. Johnson and I send our deep condolences to you and your family . " Wired former President Dwight D.

Mrs. Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet Dr. Grosvenor was as courtly to the greenest employee as to a President . When he left us , what we remembered best were his delightfully formal courtesy and genuine thoughtfulness . Recalled a recent newcomer to the staff : " He showed me through his offices as if it were an honor to him to have me there . " " He never climbed to the heights on top of little people , " a long-time employee expressed it . " He took everybody with him . " Another recalled a time when a shy cub from New England was invited for a weekend with the Grosvenor family and guests at their winter home in Florida . White linen suits were in style then , and , on the advice of friends , he had brought one . But nothing had been said about white shoes , and when he went down to dinner he saw to his horror that of all the men present he alone was wearing black shoes . He had no others ; there was nothing he could do in his embarrassment but try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Grosvenor quietly excused himself and disappeared upstairs , to return shortly . He was wearing black shoes . " One day , " remembered our Art Editor , " my office phone rang and I was asked to see Dr. Grosvenor .

' " I was somewhat startled but replied , The operator said , " Would  | you please step in to see Dr. Grosvenor . " ' " The Chief had a twinkle in his eye . " But that is n't what I said . I shall have to talk to the telephone operator about that . I knew you were busy with fresh proofs this morning , and what I asked the operator to say was , " Please ask Mr. Poggenpohl to step in to see me when he has a minute .

" Nothing of a partisan or controversial character . " But it was typical of this strong-minded editor that he reserved the right to decide what was controversial and what was not . " Many subjects , " he observed long afterward , " I have not regarded as controversial " ? referring to such hotly debated issues as Peary 's versus Cook 's claims to discovery of the North Pole and Gen. Billy Mitchell 's championship of the bombing airplane versus the battleship . To Dr. Grosvenor then , as to history later , there was no question that Peary and Mitchell were right . This mild-seeming gentleman of courtly manners had the soul and heart of a fighter . Those who challenged his plans and principles struck steel beneath the velvet . At the outset he fought a major policy decision of his formidable father-in-law , Alexander Graham Bell , when the genius of the telephone , then President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , S. S. McClure in New York , knew more about what was best for the GEOGRAPHIC than young Gilbert Grosvenor . Back steamed Gilbert , with his strongest ally , from Europe where they were honeymooning . His loyal ally and love of his life .  | was Dr. Bell 's daughter Elsie May . With his bride 's staunch support , the stripling editor went into action as soon as they stepped off the boat in December , 1900 . The question at stake was a vital one : Should the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC be merely a magazine sold by subscription and on newsstands ? Or should it be the journal of a great society , representing and enlightening the legion of men and women eager to learn of the world and its creatures , and willing to support exploration and research ? " You Are Responsible Now " Dr. Bell had seen this very vision when , as the Society 's second President , he had invited 23-year-old Gilbert Grosvenor to come to Washington to build up the puny young Society and edit its struggling little magazine . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Society 's Executive Committee had persuaded him that the Midas of the 10-cent magazine knew best in publishing matters . First , Mr. McClure had said , change the magazine 's name ? geography has no appeal for the public . Never mention the National Geographic Society in it , and give up trying to build circulation by membership in a geographic society . Build up circulation by newsstand sales , and publish the magazine in New York ? no popular magazine will ever thrive in Washington . All this collided head on with Gilbert Grosvenor 's conception . He was appalled . " Well , Bert , " Dr. Bell said , " the Board made you the Managing Editor . You are responsible now . " The Managing Editor went at once to New York and asserted his authority . When he pointed out in detail to the Board that printing costs had soared with the move to New York while circulation had stood still , he was upheld and congratulated .

GEOGRAPHIC Editor and world traveler wasborn where Europe and Asia meet ? in C , stantinople , now Istanbul , Turkey . His father the Reverend Edwin Augustus Grosvenor was a clergyman who preferred the classroom to the pulpit . From 1867 to 1890 taught history at Robert College , founded a result of the chance meeting of two Amer. cans ? financier Christopher Robert and I Cyrus Hamlin , missionary in Turkey after the Crimean War. * Both the professor a : - . his wife , Lilian Hovey Waters , came from ( New England families . The young couple felt doubly blessed win - on October 28 , 1875 , they became the parentof identical twin boys .

The other , Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor , was to live 36 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international enlightening function as missionary - founded Robert College . Geography Comes to Life " Before the future president of your Society went to America , " wrote the late Maynard Owen Williams , Chief of the GEOGRAPHIC. - Foreign Staff , " his eyes were focused on scenes of many lands and his ears tuned to the babel of tongues then spoken on Galata Bridge .... " His nurse was an Armenian . Kurdish porters toiled up the cobbled paths carrying provisions to his home . Albanians , Bulgarians , and Greeks were his classmates ... " Little wonder that geography seemed to Gilbert Grosvenor a dramatic series of living pictures , rather than mere dots on a chart . " The old Byzantine city on the Golden Horn  |p476  was then the throbbing capital of a vast realm of the fez and the veil , for the Turkish Empire , though in its twilight , still stretched from the Adriatic to the Persian Gulf and from deep into the Balkans to the tip of Arabia . To Professor Grosvenor the teeming , ancient city seemed to cry out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-volume work , and the twins helped make it a family project . To aid in copying the manuscript , Gilbert learned to type . But another new development fascinated him far more . His father had acquired a number of photographs , and with them he proposed to illustrate his book . Photoengraving was in its infancy then , and the idea was a revolutionary one . But it prevailed , and the scholarly work was embellished with 230 photographs . Gilbert Grosvenor 's lifelong love affair with photographs had begun . Meanwhile the time had come for a drastic change of scene for the family ? from the twingabled house by the Bosporus to Amherst College in Massachusetts , where the father became professor of European history . The twins were duly enrolled at Amherst , and instructors , students , and tennis opponents had a strange sensation of seeing double . Of medium height but wiry build , the Grosvenor brothers are remembered still as one of the best tennis doubles teams ever to play for Amherst .

She and Gilbert had met at a house party at the Bells ' summer home at Baddeck , Nova Scotia , in 1897 , his graduation year , and between them a spark had flashed . The 19-year-old girl was Elsie May Bell of Washington , D. C. , slimwaisted , brown-eyed , and as full of spirit as a mockingbird . Elsie 's father , the famed Alexander Graham Bell , had invented the telephone in 1876 and now , while pursuing his lifelong goal of improving the lot of the deaf , he had turned his amazingly versatile mind to contemplating such varied problems as human flight , air conditioning , and popularizing geography . His father-in-law , Gardiner Greene Hubbard , had been the moving spirit in " organizing a society for the increase and diffusion of geographical knowledge " at the Cosmos Club in Washington in January , 1888 , and had served as President of the National Geographic @# O N.G.S ELSIE BLLI . GROSVENOR  | Society until his death in December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-in-law , Dr. Bell . After a year of dubious progress , with the kind of magazine usually produced by eminent but amateur editors , Dr. Bell decided he needed a man who could make the magazine interesting . In fact he felt this so strongly that he decided to pay the salary from his own pocket , if he could get the right man . History fails to record to what extent the distinguished elbow of Dr. Bell was gently jogged by his lovely daughter , but it does record that on February 19 , 1899 , he wrote a letter to his friend Dr. Edwin Grosvenor at Amherst : My dear Professor Grosvenor : As President of the National Geographic Society I am on the lookout for some young man of ability to act as Assistant Secretary of The Society , and manage , under the direction of our Editorial Committee , our monthly publication , " The National Geographic Magazine . " In this connection your two sons recur to my mind . I do not know whether the position contemplated would be in the nature of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be consistent with their aims in life ? and therefore write confidentially to you before approaching either of them upon the subject . If , as I understand , they contemplate ultimately going into law ? the opportunities for study here are unrivalled , and the duties of the position would not be of so exacting a character as to prevent them from pursuing any studies they desire . The present Editor of The Magazine , an expert geographer , serves without remuneration , but he finds himself so overburdened with work as statistician to the Agricultural Department that he desires to resign the Editorship . He would remain , however , on the Editorial Committee and give his active assistance to his successor . We are now contemplating the advisability of placing The Magazine in the hands of one only salaried officer , the Assistant Secretary , making him the Managing Editor to get out The Magazine with the assistance of the Editorial Committee . I am afraid , however , that our present Assistant Secretary would not be competent to conduct The Magazine . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S1,200 a year . I have thought that perhaps for the same salary we could secure an unmarried man of superior ability by applying to the Presidents of our universities . Some bright college graduate just beginning life would probably find in this posi- tion a steppingstone to something better , and able , while here , to pursue some postaduate course of study while earning his livelihood . Under the proposed plan the members of e Editorial Committee would provide the riginal material for The Magazine , the Manmg Editor simply applying to them for aterial as needed . The chief duties of the lanaging Editor would be the arrangement of the material and the reading of proof ? but he must also have sufficient literary ability to be able to write himself in an emergency , and sufficient judgment to use the scissors with discrimination in quoting from our exchanges . Of course , in all this he would have the assistance of the experts upon the Editorial Staff who would always be glad to be consulted . Either of your sons would , I am sure , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know what their present prospects are , or whether such an opening would prove attractive to them . We shall make no change for some months yet , and in the meantime no harm can come from consulting you upon the subject ... P.S. ? I forward by this mail a specimen copy of The Magazine . Identical Letters to Identical Twins Dr. Bell 's idea that this would be a parttime job , with plenty of time for studying law on the side , seems a bit quaint today when it takes 1,800 hard-working people to carry on the Society 's work . Even more amusing in the light of events is his comment that the position might be " a steppingstone to something better . " But to me the most delightful aspect of the letter was its Victorian impression of blindness to the facts of young love : " In this connection your two sons recur to my mind . " And to the boys themselves Dr. Bell wrote letters that were identical twins : My dear Friends : Will you kindly look over the enclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you would consider the proposition to become Assistant Secretary of the National Geographic Society , and Managing Editor of The Magazine if such a proposition should be made to you . To no one 's surprise , Edwin deferred to his brother , who was in the process of adding an Amherst Master of Arts degree to the magna cum laude Bachelor of Arts diploma he received in 1897 , and was teaching just about everything in the curriculum at the Englewood Academy for Boys , in New Jersey .  | " I had been engaged originally to give instruction in French , German , and Latin , " Dr. Grosvenor recalled a few years ago . " The principal later assigned me classes in college algebra , chemistry , public speaking , and debating . Compared with this program , a job as editor seemed very easy . " * He reported for duty in Washington on April Fools ' Day , 1899 , and Dr. Bell personally escorted his new editor to the Society 's headquarters . It consisted of half of a small rented room on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across 15th Street from the U. S. Treasury . The young man , it turned out , was not to have the title of Managing Editor at the start , 460 but Assistant Editor and Assistant Secretary . Whatever the title , the responsibility was his . As he wrote many years later : " The little space of which I , age 23 , t only employee , was to assume charge , w littered with old magazines , newspapers , an a few books of records , which constitut the only visible property of The Society . Th treasury was empty , and had incurred a debt of nearly $2,000 by expenditure of lifemembership fees to keep alive . " The Society was not so poor as it seemed , i however , for its management , inspired by Alexander Graham Bell , had a revolutionary idea : " Why not popularize the science of geography and take it into the homes of the people ? Why not transform the Society 's magazine from one of cold geographic fact , expressed in hieroglyphic terms which the layman could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , human-interest truth about this great world of ours to the people ? Would not that be the greatest agency of all for the diffusion of geographic knowledge ? " By the end of his first month , young Mr. Grosvenor 's appointment had been confirmed for one year at a salary of $100 a month ( paid personally by Dr. Bell for five years ) . Within a year and a half he was Managing Editor , and before two years were over the battle with the McClure faction had been won and the magazine brought back from its brief Babylonian captivity in New York . Now Gilbert could concentrate on improving the magazine , as well as enlisting new members by writing to every possible prospect that his father , father-in-law , wife , and friends could suggest . Soon membership was steadily rising , and members were reading the little magazine instead of relegating it to a shelf with other scholarly publications and promising themselves to consult it someday . Photographs Open Windows on the World In February , 1903 , the Board applauded its young dynamo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually , as the magazine 's only professional , he had been the editor from the outset . Remembering Professor Grosvenor 's elaborate use of photographs in his Constantinople book , his son was making his magazine more and more a window on the world . Distant lands became vividly near and exciting when presented in pictures and maps teamed with informative , clearly written text . The Editor bought a camera and took pictures himself , besides getting photographs from Government agencies and buying all he could afford . Explorers and travelers told their first-person stories , taking the reader along in imagination to feel as they felt and learn as they learned . No wonder that people with inquiring minds everywhere began to respond by the thousands ? especially in the new 20th century , when the war with Spain had expanded American horizons to the faroff Philippines . Members found that , as if by magic , the magazine in their mailbox bore timely information about places in the news , with photographs and maps . Guam , Luzon , Manila Bay ? where were they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! @# 461  | his members two maps on an area as much in the public eye then as Viet Nam is today : a large supplement map , Theater of Military Operations in Luzon , June , 1899 ; and Philippine Islands as the Geographical Center of the Far East , January , 1900 . Lacking funds , he got such early maps from Government agencies . They were generally in black and white only . But within a few years he was able to afford maps printed in several colors . On a trip to Europe in 1913 , he saw the shadow of approaching war and immediately ordered maps from commercial cartographers . Out came the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC with a special wall-map supplement in colors , Balkan States and Central Europe , in the magazine for August , 1914-the very month the great armies of Europe marched to a fouryear Armageddon . Europe and Adjoining Portions of Africa and Asia followed in July , 1915 , as the conflict grew toward world dimensions . Before the end of World War I , the Society had its own Cartographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each number is planned with a view of being timely , " wrote Editor Grosvenor in his " Guiding Principles . " Members could expect prompt background information " whenever any part of the world becomes prominent in public interest , by reason of war , earthquake , volcanic eruption , etc . " Indeed , it had been a volcanic eruption that caused the young editor to start publishing photographs on a hitherto unheard-of scale . As a clue to public interest in various subjects for the magazine , he had formed the habit of closely noting audience reaction at the Society 's Washington lectures . At a lecture on the 1902 eruption of Mont Pelee , which 463  |p464  killed 30,000 people on the island of Martinique , he overheard some young ladies behind him complaining about the absence of photographs showing the awful destruction . The lecturer had been too squeamish to show them . Gilbert Grosvenor decided the girls were right , and he redoubled his efforts to obtain and publish outstanding photographs . Editors of other magazines generally were blind to the promise of photo-journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible by copper halftone engraving , and an official of a leading monthly of the day ? now long since defunct ? told him flatly they were vulgar . First Color Series in 1910 Even within his own Editorial Committee young Grosvenor encountered this prejudice . Several members opposed use of photographs unless purely " scientific . " Too often this meant just plain dull . To the Editor it was self-evident that every picture and sentence must be interesting to the layman . How could you educate and inform if you lost your audience by boring your readers ? He persisted in trying to make the magazine reflect this fascinating world . A turning point came on a December day in 1904 when the Editor found the deadline for the January number upon him ? with 11 vacant pages and not a manuscript in sight . Discouraged , he turned to the morning mail , and found a big envelope of photographs of Lhasa , mysterious capital of Tibet ( pages 462-3 ) . He filled the 11 pages with Lhasa pictures accompanied only by captions , and expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before the month was out he had been unanimously elected to the Society 's Board of Managers . Thus photographs , outstanding in quality and quantity , became the hallmark of the growing young magazine ? eventually three pages of pictures to every one of text . And in 464  |p465  November , 1910 , the GEOGRAPHIC presented its first color series , 24 pages of hand-colored " Scenes in Korea and China " ? far more color than any magazine had ever published in one issue . Soon photography in color superseded colored photographs , and ever in the forefront in its use was the GEOGRAPHIC 's picture-minded Editor . Constantly he cajoled , criticized , and encouraged his small but able and loyal staff . Making History With Pictures " If the National Geographic Magazine is to progress , " he wrote a field man in France in 1923 , " it must constantly improve the quality of its illustrations , and this can only be attained by you by giving greater care and attention to the mechanical details involved in making photographs . Light conditions , cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will study the photographic art and seek to find the method of overcoming such handicaps , and yet cloud and overcast sky should not be termed handicaps , for often such conditions enable a photographer to secure better photographs than can be obtained in bright sunlight . It all depends on whether the photographer understands atmospheric effects . " " The art of taking photographs in color , " he wrote the same man three years later , " requires the technique of an engineer , the artistic ability of a great painter , and the news interest of a daily-newspaper photographer , so if you do not strike 100 with every photographic attempt in colors , I hope you will not be discouraged . I am much pleased with the increasing quality shown by all your pictures . " He made the Society 's photographic laboratory one of the most progressive in the country and was quick to adopt new techniques and tools . When reliable exposure meters became available , he ordered them for all staff photographers , declaring : " The photographer who attempts to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traveler who disregards automobiles and . - es old-fashioned horse-carriages . " By the time Dr. Grosvenor retired as Editor 1954 , he could point to a score of photographic firsts for the magazine , from the first aerials of the North and South Poles to the first extensive series of color photographs of New Guinea 's fantastic birds of paradise . " Grosvenor Luck " Nine-tenths Foresight In 1920 Dr. Grosvenor had been elected President of the Society in addition to being Editor of its magazine . Although then only 44 , he had long been the moving spirit of both . His wide travels and friendships , extensive reading , and close observation of world events endowed him with an editorial " cat 's whisker " admired and envied in the publishing world . For instance , " Roaming Korea South of the Iron Curtain " came out in the June , 1950 , GEOGRAPHIC ? a 32-page article , with 34 illustrations and a map , in the hands of members the month the Korean War broke out . Thus grew the legend of " Grosvenor luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grosvenor 's well-stocked larder of manuscripts and photographs on most parts of the world . Another was the ability of his devoted staff to move fast . Less than two months after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor , the Society 's members , and our armed forces , received a new Geographic map in 10 colors , Theater of War in the Pacific Ocean , with a table of airline distances . Immediately after the attack , an urgent request from the Navy had sent 600 copies of the current Geographic Pacific map flying west for battle use . Always patriotic , Dr. Grosvenor also believed strongly in the importance of our British heritage and unity of purpose among the free peoples of the English-speaking world . " I intend to use the Geographic Magazine to the best of my ability to promote a better understanding between Great Britain and the United States , " he wrote to a contributor in December , 1918 . " Let us hope the American people and the British people will be smart enough to learn the principal lesson of this war , that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular GEOGRAPHIC , I remember , he labored with special care and pride ? the issue for April , 1949 , devoted wholly to " The British Way , " recounting the British Isles ' great gifts to mankind . When at last he had chosen every picture and personally edited every word , he wrote as the proofs were released to the printer , " These are my final revisions . I now bid farewell to this article , which I 've been planning for five years . " Another famous one-subject issue that took editorial courage to produce was March , 1919 , entirely devoted to dogs . Its popularity promptly proved the identity of the dog 's best friend , and that issue of the magazine became a collector 's item . Eventually it became a book , for books soon supplemented the magazine as increasers and diffusers of knowledge . Regular News Bulletins  |p471  to the press brought up-to-date geographic information to millions of newspaper readers , and School Bulletins informed the young in terms they could understand . One of the first things the young Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A paper from a distinguished professor of geography had proved , in Gilbert Grosvenor 's charitable words , " exceedingly hard to digest , " and he had taken it to Dr. Bell for his opinion . That learned gentleman confessed that much of the paper baffled him too , but advised its publication because of the high academic standing of its author . An avalanche of protest followed , and Gilbert Grosvenor made a vow that thereafter the magazine would publish no sentence not readily understood . Technical matter , he decided , could and should be published in separate scientific papers . No Patience With Obscurity or Pretense Gilbert Grosvenor had no patience with murky thinking . " What does this mean ? " he would pencil sternly beside a paragraph long on pretentious words but short on clarity of thought . Bombast bored him . " Come down off your soapbox , " he said firmly to writers carried away by their opinions to the point of speechifying in print . " Stick to the facts . Our readers can be trusted to form their own opinions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , " but dislike the feeling of being taught . " Use a long word when a short one would do as well , and the manuscript would come back from his paper-piled office with the offending word circled and labeled : " This is a jawbreaker . " Qualify a statement with the lazy phrase " is said to " and you would be called into his presence and informed : " The NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE does not publish hearsay . Either it is a fact or it is not . Find out . " If you came to consider yourself an expert on a field of science or a country and affected esoteric terms or high-flown language , Gilbert Grosvenor would puncture your inflated ego and bring you down to earth . Snobbish use of foreign words without translation was , and is , similarly taboo , on the grounds that no one knows every language and it is our business to make ourselves understood . Once he spelled it out for me patiently : " If you War loomed over China in June , 1937 , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace at the Yun Kang caves . Within a month Japan and China were at war . Shortly , a National Geographic botanical expedition in China sent out an article and pictures for publication in the Society 's magazine , giving a timely understanding of the terrain of conflict . @# .  |p472  do n't tell the people , they wo n't know . " Elementary , and I shall never forget it . Another valuable lesson was learned when , as a young and green member of the staff , I was given a manuscript to edit . The author was a well-known woman writer , a personal friend of Dr. and Mrs. Grosvenor , and I hesitated to alter it much , though I winced at many of its mannerisms , such as " lovely " or " charming " every few hundred words . I soon learned my error of omission . Dr. Grosvenor asked who had passed this into proof . I confessed . " This violates , " I was emphatically told , " every rule of editing NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE copy . " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved to the fullest possible extent . Every word and picture , every advertisement and lecture had to meet the highest standards . " This advertisement looks very questionable , " he pointed out in a 1911 memo . " Ten pages of good advertising is better than thirty pages containing any questionable matter . " Dullness he abhorred , whether in manuscripts or in lectures . Of one scientist , he noted half a century ago : " I had him down to lecture once and he succeeded in putting everybody to sleep who did n't leave . " But the all-important test was truth . " It is very important , CONGRATULATIONS , DOCTOR . YOU 'VE MADE GEOGRAPHY A LEADING LOCAL INDUSTRY  |p473  when considering material from youthful travelers , that their material be cross-examined with extreme care , " he wrote a member of his staff in 1934 . Citing a popular tale of this type , he said , " I rejected it because , while most entertaining , I felt that it was not generally true throughout . The first test of every article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil . " The accuracy of his memory was almost eerie . " I published a paper on that in April , 1904 , " he would say . And swinging around to the bound volumes behind him , he would pull out one and turn to the page . The editorial " I " was understandable because literally , in those early days , Gilbert Grosvenor was the GEOGRAPHIC . From the first , he himself wrote articles for the magazine . Even before he came to Washington he contributed " Lloyd 's Journey Across the Great Pygmy Forest . " It appeared , unsigned , in the January , 1899 , issue . Between 1899 and 1965 he produced literally hundreds of articles and pictures for the GEOGRAPHIC . Specifically , 285 articles are credited to him ? 47 with his byline , 13 signed with a co-author , and 225 unsigned . His published pictures total 411 . The first , in the November , 1906 , issue , showed the explorer Peary and the secretary of the Peary Arctic Club . The last , in July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady of the National Geographic " and showed his indomitable wife on their travels through five continents . Found Articles Even at Sea Ever alert for fascinating subjects and able contributors , he found them even on the high seas . One day in 1930 the liner in which he was crossing the Atlantic encountered the full-rigged sailing ship Grace Harwar , and Dr. Grosvenor 's camera caught forever that fleeting vision of high-piled canvas ( pages 474-5 ) . Later he learned that a young Australian writer , Alan Villiers , had sailed in her from Australia to England in the grain-ship race around Cape Horn . The result was " Rounding the Horn in a Windjammer , " first of 23 articles in the magazine between February , 1931 , and February , 1966 , by Capt . Alan Villiers , one of the greatest living writers of the sea . Dr. Grosvenor himself was an avid sailor .  |p474  " He belonged to the generation of bluewater sailors , " said the Reverend Dr. Edward L. R. Elson of the National Presbyterian Church in his eloquent funeral sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always with great enthusiasm . He had such an infectious enthusiasm for sailing that he affected everybody whose life he touched . He sailed the Bras d'Or Lakes in Nova Scotia , into every little cove and indentation , and the wide open spaces ; and he sailed the ocean . " Only a few years ago in mid-summer , with grandsons and granddaughters for crew , when Dr. Grosvenor was in his mid-eighties , he raced the Elsie , the sizable yawl which he had received from Alexander Graham Bell , in an 1S-mile race sailed in near-gale winds on the big Bras d'Or Lake . But what is more significant is that against younger competitors the Elsie won . Those of us who were there will never forget the night at the yacht club when the award was bestowed . Dr. Grosvenor was more fatigued by the adulation and the plaudits of the people than by the race itself . " As Dr. Elson said in that memorable tribute , " In the highest and best sense , he was a religious man . " Although a devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His spirituality was as spontaneous and natural as the disciplined brilliance of his mind and the social grace with which he moved on every level of humanity . " Fought Prudery in Behalf of Smithson In the early days , the young Editor augmented Dr. Bell 's $100 a month by writing for other publications , and he did not hesitate to wield his free lance in behalf of causes that interested him . A yellowed article in the New York Herald of March 1 , 1903 , bears the byline , " Gilbert H. Grosvenor , Editor National Geographic Magazine , " and starts : " James Smithson , the founder of the Smithsonian Institution , is about to be turned out of his grave , in Genoa , Italy , to make room for a quarry . " The birth , life and death of this great benefactor of mankind were for him one series of misfortunes , and now even his resting place is to be destroyed . As the illegitimate son of a duke and a noble lady who was the descendant of kings , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embittered and blighted by the thought of his tainted birth ; he died in Genoa ? he never had a home ? without a single kinsman beside his deathbed ; his grave was dug in a city far from his native land , and now his bones must be turned out of his grave in order that the city may get stone for its harbor works . " It ends : " The United States Government ought to assign a war ship to carry his body in state across the Atlantic ... . We should place him where he may rest in peace ? not for another seventy-five or one hundred years , but for as long as the great nation lives for which he showed such complete confidence and respect . " Incidentally , Editor Grosvenor helped writer Grosvenor to accomplish the purpose for which he had pleaded so eloquently . While Smithson 's illegitimacy caused the prudish to hesitate , the 27-year-old Editor enlisted the White House on his side . President Theodore Roosevelt agreed , and the body of the founder of our Smithsonian Institution came here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This attitude was reflected in the magazine , and Dr. Grosvenor prided himself on the fact that " the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC never dressed tribal women prudishly in Western clothing ; we pictured them in their natural state . " The Chief , or GHG , as we called him ( though nothing but Dr. Grosvenor to his face ) , was not the kind of editor who would ask his writers to conform to his preconceived ideas . " Just make it interesting , " he would say to a staff man setting out on an assignment . Two or three generations of GEOGRAPHIC men and women owe to him our traditional freedom to report the world as we find it . Our only limitation is summed up in his seven Guiding Principles , in brief : 1 . Absolute accuracy . 2 . Abundance of instructive and beautiful illustrations . 3 . Everything must have permanent value . 4 . Avoid trivialities and material of a purely personal nature . 5 . Nothing partisan or controversial . 6 . Only what is of -a kindly nature ; nothing unduly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately some of these points ? notably Nos. 5 and 6 ? had a certain built-in elasticity , and the Editor determined the amount of stretch . There was never any doubt about that , or about his editorial courage . To New Heights in the Depression When I joined the Society 's staff , the year was 1933 , and the great depression as the Nation wallowed out of the trough , Gilbert Grosvenor added color pages and maps . He had faith in this country , his Society , his magazine , and the people who make up the membership . Staunchly backed by his loyal Vice President and Associate Editor , Dr. John Oliver La Gorce , and a scienceminded Board of Trustees , Dr. Grosvenor gave continued support to exploration and research. * In fact , he literally soared to new heights by committing the Society to a lofty See " 75 Years Exploring Earth , Sea , and Sky , " by Melvin M. Payne , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , January , 1963.  |p477  new project in cooperation with the United States Army Air Corps : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space by stratosphere balloon . In 1934 all hands aboard the three-man flying laboratory had to parachute as the world 's largest balloon split and plummeted after reaching a height of 60,613 feet over Nebraska . At the second attempt , in 1935 , the great balloon had a blowout during inflation at the natural Stratobowl near Rapid City , South Dakota , but the crew patched it , and Captains Albert W. Stevens and Orvil A. Anderson took their ton of instruments to the unheard-of height of 72,395 feet ? 13.71 miles ? an altitude that was to stand as a record for 21 years . More important , its data gave future spacemen their first accurate knowledge of the black void above 96 percent of the atmosphere . Bathysphere Reaches Record Depth The previous year the Society under Gilbert Grosvenor had backed man 's deepest descent in the sea , the William Beebe Bathysphere Expedition , whose record depth of 3,028 feet was to stand for 15 years . Who can say to what extent these achieve-477  |p480  ments helped buoy the Nation out of the slough of depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices from the edge of space came clearly into millions of homes by nationwide network radio ? It was during the depression , too , that Dr. Grosvenor launched a major publishing project over the spoken or unspoken protest of virtually every member of the staff . At his Wild Acres home in Washington 's Maryland suburbs , he had found delight in the presence of birds and learned to identify most of the species bound up and down the Atlantic flyway . Now he set out to bring his readers every major species of North American bird , complete with a color portrait . " Birds , birds , birds , Dr. Grosvenor 's birds , " sighed many a member of the staff as " Woodpeckers , Friends of Our Forests , " followed " Crows , Magpies , and Jays , " and the series continued with several such articles a year .

After the war , those of us who were called often to Dr. Grosvenor 's office found a little difficulty in making ourselves heard . " Speak up , please .. Do n't mumble so , " he would say . And slowly it dawned that he was growing deaf . Especially sad and ironic , it seemed , for deafness to strike again in this family . Dr. Bell had always described himself not as the inventor of the telephone but as " a teacher of the deaf . " His wife , Mabel Hubbard Bell . Mrs. Grosvenor 's mother , had been profoundly deaf since the age of four , overcoming the handicap by her keen intelligence , observation , and skill at reading lips . Dr. Grosvenor , too , refused to let " a little deafness " stop him , and in 1953 , at 77 , he went to the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Thomas W.

But when I told him of the invitation , he leaped to his feet like a boy and exclaimed , Oh , good ! Do you think you can get me an invitation too ? ' " It was duly arranged , and Dr. Grosvenor personally made the first series of photographs ever taken pinpointing the North Pole. * It was typical of him that he was not content to make this merely a sentimental journey , an old man 's imaginary rendezvous with his friends of the young years , Peary and Byrd . To him it was a working assignment , to be covered well ? and with pictures ? for the magazine . @# Succeeding his grandfather on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor , talks with James E.

Always he let his heartdreams prevail , and treasures in his office as it looked 20 years ago testify to rewards . He sailed the Elsie , he saved the Big Trees , he loved the birds , and he sent the blue-brown-and-green Geographic flag to the ends of the earth , to the stratosphere , and to the depths of the sea . In May of 1954 , he retired as President and Editor in favor of Dr. La Gorce . But as Chairman of the Board of Trustees , he continued to give his colleagues the benefit of his wisdom and editorial judgment . His eye for the interesting and important was still as keen as ever . When President Kennedy met death by assassin 's bullets , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plimpton of Amherst recalled the President 's visit there only four weeks before . Our 88-year-old Chairman promptly brought this material to the Editor 's attention , and it added greatly to the interest and historical value of our March , 1964 , article recording the world 's tribute to the murdered President . He was always eager for new experiences , as shown in this anecdote by a loved and devoted co-worker , Executive Vice President Melvin M. Payne : " One windy fall afternoon , he and Melville and I had an appointment downtown , and we decided to walk back to the office . He was wearing his hearing aid , which he whimsically called Little Sister .

' " Still Planning Articles in His 90th Year On the day after Christmas , 1964 , Dr. Grosvenor lost his beloved wife and the Society lost its first lady ? granddaughter , daughter , wife , and mother of Presidents of the Society . In work for the Society , his other love , he found the best antidote to his grief . Always one of the country 's foremost conservationists , he had been instrumental in establishing the National Park Service 50 years ago , and in his last summer he helped us with plans for articles on its golden anniversary . But as the summer waned so did his strength . When the Canada geese and whistling swans flew south over the Bras d'Or Lakes bound for the Chesapeake and points south , Gilbert Grosvenor could not go . But he could still write letters , and he answered many of those he received when he reached the age of 90 last October 28 . He still retained his sense of humor , even when the joke was on himself . From Nova Scotia he penned  |p487  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With best wishes and warm appreciation of your kindness to me . Yours sincerely Gilbert , Grosvenor Christmas came , the first without his wife , and Dr. Grosvenor grew a little more frail . By February the end was near . His son and daughters gathered . He told them he knew his life span was ending and calmly to each he said goodbye . Just before he took the nap from which he did not awake , a daughter heard him mention a recurring dream . It seemed he was just setting off on a journey or coming into port . 487
