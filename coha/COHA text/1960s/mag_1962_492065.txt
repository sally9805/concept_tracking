FOUNDED IN 1728 BY ? . wenty-one millionaires sat around a table in Kansas City not long ago and , with disbe- lid ' and frustration . faced the fact that they could n't find a job for a boy . These businessmen , each of whom had contacts and resources far beyond the average , had volunteered to take part in a plan , sponsored by Rotary , to help some teen-age boys who seemed headed for trouble . Most of the youngsters had no fathers and had not done well in school , although they were of normal intelligence and ability . For many , home life was squalid . Most faced the world with anger and hostility . The biggest thing these youngsters needed was honest , solid employment , so they could feel like men , could have a few dollars in their pockets and a place in a society that values men by the work they do . But even twenty-one millionaires could not find the needed employment . Ultimately they had to create jobs for the boys . The twenty-one thus learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We waste more than a million kids a year . As we once wasted natural gas and forests and topsoil , today we waste our most valuable natural resource  --  the productive power of young brains and muscles , the creative power of young imaginations and emotions . We waste them because we neither keep them in school nor give them jobs . In 1960 2,500,000 youngsters reached eighteen , the age when most are graduated from high school . These were divided , roughly . into thirds : One third went to college , one third quit school after graduation and one third had already dropped out . Those who went on to higher education have some sort of organized way to move on from school to work , uncertain as it is . The other two thirds do not . Many of the graduates and a few of the dropouts eventually get jobs and learn some sort of skill , although it takes longer than it should and the work is often less demanding than they 're capable of handling . The rest have no skill that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are the wasted ones . As part of an eighteen-month study sponsored by the Taconic Foundation , we saw and talked to these kids in big cities all across the land . They are boys and girls  --  mostly boys  --  who have finished with school . There arc no jobs for them . The Army does n't take many , of them these days ; indeed some have been rejected . A very few of them are juvenile delinquents , but the majority are not . The economic catastrophe of the Great Depression in the 1930 's produced bands of wild boys who swarmed onto freight cars and haunted the highways of the nation . The product of today 's economic upheaval are not wild ; they 're defeated . They droop on the stoops of tenements , prop up the walls of candy stores and ha around junkyards and jalopy lots , fascinated b the symbol of power that is a car . Some are bitter anger at anyone who has , or is , more than they smolders behind their eyes . Most are apathetk deeply convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a square world anyway . ' Among them are some of the best minds in ail nation . An Iowa study found that nearly one ou of live dropouts had an IQ of more than 120 . An other by Glenn Stice of the Educational Testini Service , Princeton , New Jersey , showed that abou 50,000 of the dropouts in any one year were amoni the nation 's most potentially able students . A Years ago these boys would have landed jobsii grocery stores or sweeping out factories . If the , were aggressive and alert they could work up ic better jobs and eventually make good careers foi themselves . But today most of these entry job are closed to them for complicated reasons which will be explained later on . In Detroit , which i ! fairly typical of America 's large cities , such job have been decreasing at the rate of 2000 a year IN the past ten years . Testifying before a congres sional committee last spring , Mayor Louis q M Irian i of Detroit said , " From 1955 to 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ si teen- and seventeen-year-olds in Detroit . " In Denver , Colorado , the employment sere of Boys Incorporated interviewed 2101 boys 1947 and got jobs for 529 . In 1957 this agency sa 13,421 boys and got jobs for 1261 . Thus the d mind for jobs had increased nearly seven tim but the supply had only doubled . The situation " social dynamite , " according to Dr. James Conant , author and educator . He cited a rue study in a large city slum where nearly six out every ten kids between sixteen and twenty-o were out or work . Executive Secretary Groven N. Grimes of Detroit 's Commission on Child and Youth , said recently that of the youths are n't educated beyond high school , " almost si percent of all boys and thirty percent of all face a dismal prospect in the labor market of next decade unless they receive deliberate continuous help . . . to bridge the gap betty school and work . " The majority of our wasted million are in slums of our biggest cities or at the lowest nomic levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the products of r schools . Other thousands come from the sub or the large villages on the fringes of metropoli areas . Essentially they are of three kinds , i probably the best way to separate them is describe sonic boys we talked to . The first is the Drifter . He is a normally heal normally intelligent boy who does n't see m point in school . He goes because he has to often is graduated from high school . He ca n't into college and he has no skill to sell an emplo nor any drive to learn one . He likes cars . He boy like George . George lived in a middle-class town in England . His father died before he ente school ; his mother worked to support him was too indulgent with him . Occasionally he reprimanded for smoking in school or getting minor scrapes . Each time his mother march 44r school and blamed the teacher or the principal  --  never George . He liked to hunt and fish , and she Nought him rods and guns . When he was fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year tearing it down and rebuilding it . He flunked one subject each year , although his teachers insisted he had average intelligence . He was graduated with his class and , as a reward , was allowed to spend the following summer loafing . That summer he smashed up his car but was n't seriously injured himself . He got part-time work digging graves in the local cemetery to finance a new one . He was rejected by the Army for asthma , which he 'd had since childhood . For the next four years he floated from job to menial job . He helped in a small machine shop , worked for a time for his uncle who owned a fishing boat , but after a while he quit because the hours were too long . He got a temporary job as a clerk in the local employment office and later worked for a time on the highways . At twenty-three he got married . and after a year or two of that  --  and a couple of short-term separations  --  he began to steady down . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outdoor job which uses perhaps half his potential intelligence and ability . There was , of course . no way of recapturing the four wasted years , during which he might have learned a trade . The second kind is the Reject . These boys , too , have normal intelligence and ability , but their parents or society has pushed them out of the mainstream of American young life . Included among them are youngsters who are the targets of our bigotries  --  the Negroes . Puerto Ricans , Mexicans and American Indians . They are kids like Peter , who was found by the Cincinnati police one freezing morning asleep in an unheated parked car . When they thawed him out they learned he had n't had a meal in three days . He was sixteen ; his parents , both alcoholics , had thrown him out . He had quit school some months before , and he did n't know of any place to go . Or Tim . Tim was picked up in New York City one day , hungry , frightened , knowing no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on a farm , his parents had been divorced and his mother had remarried . Neither she nor her new husband had time for Tim . so they " put him out to work . " They gave him enough money to get to the big city  --  where there were supposed to be jobs  --  and sent him off . They are kids like Paul . Paul is a Negro and exceptionally bright . During his four years of high school he got few grades less than A. He was an excellent athlete , especially at basketball . He would have gone to college to study engineering but had to support his family . So when he was graduated he wanted to become an apprentice pipe fitter . He could n't because he was a Negro . He became a janitor . The third , and most difficult , kind is the Outsider . Some of these youngsters are emotionally disturbed and have never been treated . Some come from a background so alien that they never stop feeling lost . Some , of normal intelligence , are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for reasons no one fully understands . So most grow up not knowing many of the simplest things a person must know today to get along  --  like how to read . Some withdraw from the world , some find a place in a gang , some become juvenile delinquents , some simply survive . But none is employable without intelligent and persistent help . Jim is one such youth . Jim was not a slum kid , although the area he lived in qualified as the " Mums " of the wealthy suburb where it was located . Actually it was lower middle class , and his father owned both their house and his own business , a gas station . The school system Jim went through was one of the best in America , yet it failed to reach him from the first grade on . Probably only psychoanalysis would ever pinpoint what made Jim the way he was , but there were some indications : His father , a big , muscular man , resented him and frequently beat him . His mother alternated between overprotecting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? " ) and scorning him ( " You bum , you 'll never be any good ! " ) . Both parents seemed to prefer his younger brothers and sisters who , incidentally , got along well in school . Jim was a big , hulking kid of normal intelligence who somehow never learned anything , though he was promoted with his class . As a result , by the time he was sixteen and quit school , he was incredibly ignorant . He could read , but only at the second-grade level . He could barely write his name . He could n't tell time . He did n't know the months of the year . He did n't know whether an inch was bigger than a mile . He could n't add and subtract . He knew very few words , other than the slang of the gang he belonged to . and was n't able to talk to people or understand what they said . He was thus almost completely shut off from the world around him  --  except when he was with his gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Jim was terrified by the world . He was afraid of his father . He was afraid of dead people and sick people . He was afraid to go into his own house at night if no one was there , and he often slept in the backyard rather than face the unknown terror . He was afraid of the dark . He was afraid of girls , afraid to ask for a date or go to a dance . He referred to himself as " a corner clown , " said he had been bad news from the age of five on , " that he had " no guts , " and in a dozen different ways showed that he felt he had no control over the things that happened to him . The only way he could discharge this weight of fear and self-contempt was to strike out at the world that was so hostile to him . He became the Enforcer for his gang : He beat up anybody the leader told him to . He broke into a rich man 's house and wrecked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation was to swing at somebody  --  or run away . In the end , however , Jim was one of the lucky few . He fell into the hands of a remarkable youth worker who lavished thought , effort and time on him for three years and finally got him to the point where he could hold a job . These arc the kinds of kids that our society has no place for . In 1960 there were just over I , 000,000 of these youngsters . Because of our increased birthrate , in 1964 there will be 1 ? 325 , - 000 ; in 1966 , 1,460,000 more  --  all joining the residue from 1960 's million . The U.S. Labor Department estimates that between 1960 and 1970 26,000,000 young workers will enter the labor force ; of these , nearly 30 percent , or 7,500. - 000 , will lack a high-school education . These youngsters make up a huge pool of unskilled manpower precisely at a time when the need for unskilled people is declining in ratio to population . There is an insatiable demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting higher and higher . Professional . white-collar and service-industry jobs are increasing . But the number of unskilled jobs in industry is holding steady . If farm labor is taken into account  --  and this has always absorbed a number of unskilled workers  --  the actual number of jobs is decreasing . And , as a result of the baby boom , there are more young people competing for these jobs every year . These are the dimensions of the crisis we face . How did it come about ? It is obvious why maladjusted kids ca n't get jobs and obvious that they need special treatment  --  which most of them are not getting . But why do normal teen-agers have so much trouble getting work ? It 's partly the fault of their own attitudes , partly of employers ' attitudes  --  and partly due to a variety of circumstances which we shall review in this series of articles . Not long ago a union leader , who had worked up from a bench himself , was trying to pull strings to get his son hack into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suggested the boy might work in the trade and become a union official himself , the father was horrified : " What , my son be a worker ? I 'd die first ! " If parents are teaching their sons that skilled work is beneath their dignity , its no wonder the youngsters do n't prepare for it or do well at it once they get it . The job market seems to tit girls better than it does boys . One reason is that girls look on a job as something to do until they get married ; when they have a baby they usually quit . This makes a higher turnover and thus more job openings . But boys look on a job as a permanent thing . The traditional attitude is that you start at the bottom and work up . So they stick longer , and the resulting lower turnover means fewer openings . Moreover , many employers are reluctant to hire young men . The only detailed study we know of employers ' attitudes toward young workers was made by the Bureau of Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of all employers said they did n't require any particular educational level , such as high-school graduation , and 42 percent insisted they were quite willing to hire youths under eighteen . Yet only 15 percent had actually hired nongraduates under eighteen . Obviously there must have been other , more subtle factors at work . One such factor was employers ' ideas of the law . About two thirds of the employers gave " the law " as the reason they did n't hire younger workers . But when they were questioned , researchers found they really did n't know what the law was . One , for example , said he thought it would help if minors were allowed to work over forty hours aweek , though the study said the law under which that employer operated allowed minors to work forty-eight hours . Other firms knew what the law was but thought it unrealistic and reported they would hire more minors if it were changed . For example , if the job of elevator operator were not included in " hazardous occupations , " they might hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work where liquor is served , several hotel and restaurant people said they 'd hire younger men . Only 17 percent of the employers could see no disadvantages in hiring young workers . Most could see more disadvantages than advantages . Chief among these were that young people were inexperienced , had personality deficiencies and did n't stick to the job . Several employers said it was too much trouble to go through the involved procedure of work permits ; others said there was no use training a boy when he would probably be drafted shortly . Some , whose manufacturing processes included certain hazards , said their insurance rates were higher for young workers . Some said workmen's-compensation rates were higher when you had young workers . The U.S. Department of Labor says this is n't so . This study , along with others , showed that for Negroes jobs are harder to get . But there was wide variation on how much of a hindrance race was ; some firms kept no records at all , and the largest companies were more ready than the small to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the public , employers cited public prejudices as the reason they could n't hire Negroes . However , the researchers concluded that practical discrimination was shown most often by the familiar tactic of characterizing some jobs , usually the lowest , as " Negro " jobs  --  so while these employers did hire Negroes , they did not offer the same chance for advancement that they did to whites . Department of Labor figures on unemployment consistently show that Negroes are the last hired , the first fired . Only one man in ten in our working force is a Negro , but one in five of the unemployed is , and once he loses a job , he 's out of work longer . Even when Negroes have skills , it 's harder for them to get jobs : In Washington , D.C. , in 1957 not a single graduate of the electrical-wiring course at the Phelps High School ( predominantly Negro ) got a job in that work , but 80 percent of the white boys who had taken the same course in another school did . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes can work in the skilled trades . Boston , for example , reported the total number of workers in the building trades was 5007 ; the total number of Negroes , sixty-two . In San Francisco the Urban League reported that " outstanding resistance by some unions had made it virtually impossible to place Negroes in certain categories of craft-union skill , " and cited the plumbers , Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , steam fitters and operating engineers . The same picture is repeated over and over again across the country , both North and South . And it is repeated also for the Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in our society . Today the country needs more skills than young workers have , whatever their color . This is because all sections of our economy are becoming more complex as our machines become smarter . It was a cinch to repair a prewar washing machine , but try to fathom the solenoids. relays and timing devices of a modern automatic . When an untrained youngster , like those among our wasted million , gets his first job , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the employment people call semiskilled  --  such as assembly-line jobs . But these , too , are decreasing ; personnel experts in Detroit told us recently that there will never again be as many auto workers as there were in 1953 . Automation , which speeds this process , does not fall only on the workers already employed . In many cases older workers are shifted to other jobs , perhaps given some retraining , but usually kept . But as current workers retire , take other jobs or move away , they are not replaced . Thus , the company cuts its payroll . This process , of course , means that new workers are n't hired  --  and the new workers are the young . Said A. H. Raskin of The New York Times in a recent article on automation , " Even if the bulk of the shake-out of present jobholders is made through . . . normal turnover , the contraction of work opportunities will bear cruelly on youngsters looking for their first job . . This is clearly shown in a couple of random examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important part of New York 's economy , and many unskilled young men have secured their . first job as messengers for the brokerage houses . Recently one odd-lot brokerage house moved into a new building and with it got a brand-new system of pneumatic tubes for inside deliveries . The firm had employed 50 runners , today it employs 100 . But it has taken over the work of eleven other firms , each of which had employed 15 runners . So there is a net loss of 115 jobs for messengers in the city . The other example can he stated in one brief sentence : Automatic elevators in New York City have wiped out the jobs of 40,000 operators . There are big labor shortages in the country . but they 're among the high skills . The Department of Health . Education and Welfare reported recently , for example , that every graduate engineer needs five well-trained technicians behind him . But the live do n't exist . Other shortages are in teachers , social workers , doctors ; in engineers , missile and electronics experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to tell the smart new machines what to do ; and in dozens of other fields . In the face of all this difficulty , who helps the high-school graduate , or the dropout , get a job ' ? The first place he turns is to his family and friends  --  and their ineffectiveness is measured by the high number of unemployed among the young . Beyond that , there arc guidance and placement counselors in the high schools , state employment services , private employment agencies and special community programs to help get jobs for youngsters . Nobody knows how many young people are placed by individual high-school counselors , but it is not likely that many are the kinds of bo who make up our wasted million . There are enough guidance counselors , many of them are fully trained or are n't allowed to devote full ti to the work , and they have too much to d They 're supposed to help youngsters choose t proper high-school course , the right college , a ? vise them on personal problems , guide them in choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's remarkable they can do as mac vocational guidance and placement as they do But the counselors never get to help those of ou wasted million who have dropped out of scho. because most drop out by the tenth grade and most vocational guidance is concentrated in the eleventh and twelfth grades . Very few private employment agencies have the kind of placement service that is needed by be-ginning workers . Probably the most inclusive job counselin and placement service for youngsters is provided . by the various state employment agencies . I 1959 these placed job counselors for seniors 41 percent of the nation 's high schools which located primarily in large cities , produced 6 percent of all graduates . Generally these counselors are in the schools for a short time each Year to process the senior class ; in 1959 they ha ' interviews with less than a third of the senio in the schools covered . This same year 71,500. seniors were placed out of 750,000 who were n't : college-hound  --  or less than one in ten . Only 9413 dropouts were placed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two states of Cali fornia and Pennsylvania , where cooperation between the schools and the employment serVi was more extensive and started earlier . State employment services are primarily placement agencies ; if a youth needs a good deal of special counseling , most are not set up to provide it . It is to their credit that despite this they hay established special youth services in many citi which give intensive guidance and which col he copied by all . In some states the public employment service ' has cooperated with various local groups to set up a special youth employment service . In Cali fornia , for example , 141 communities have sue agencies . Here and elsewhere they cover a wid range : Some handle only part-time work , so full-time ; some cover only a few youngst . others are very inclusive . In other parts of tit country , community agencies , with no cone lion with the public employment service , offe various special services of their own . Many 0 these do excellent work , but there are n't enou to modify the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . Responsible people around the country ha thrown new bridges across the gull-that separat school from work for youngsters , but they ha been foot bridges . No hordes can cross them . F the vast majority , for the wasted million ca year , the truth is that we have no place . Next week , in a second article of this serf we shall examine in more detail one of the b causes of this frightening situation and . tel . some hopeful corrective measures that are bet taken in a few scattered communities .
