Automobile carburetors have little in common with the visionary paintings of Paul Klee , but Arnold Maremont is a devoted connoisseur of both . Mare mont , 59 , is president of Chicago 's Maremont Corp. , a leader in the greasy , $7 billion business of making spare parts for old cars . Yet he runs his firm from a low ebony coffee-table desk , surrounded by modern paintings and chairs by Mies van der Rohe , is as elegant and impeccably dressed as if he were managing Tiffany 's . All this seems to help : he has built Maremont 's sales from $30 million in 1959 to $122 million last year . Last week he capped a five-year diversification program by buying the Cal-Val Research &; Development Corp. , a California producer of giant shock absorbers and bomb-rack parts for the Air Force . <P> <P> The Scheme . Until five years ago , Maremont Corp . was almost exclusively a maker of auto mufflers . Looking for broader fields , Arnold Maremont noted that the auto spare-parts business seemed to offer depression-proof growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 4,000,000 every year , and spare parts move even when new-car sales falter , because motorists must spend more to keep their old cars running . Maremont also noticed that Detroit auto companies supplied only 30% of the parts , while thousands of independents producing a jumble of reliable and unreliable products fought over the rest . His scheme : to acquire enough independents to make a full line of branded , guaranteed parts . With his program completed , Maremont now produces 8,000 parts for cars , is the biggest independent making a full line of products . At the same time , Arnold Maremont cast about into nonautomotive fields , picked up several basically sound companies in trouble and set them right . One problem acquisition : the Gabriel Co. , a producer of auto shock absorbers and electronic gear , which took longer than expected to revamp , was largely responsible for slicing Maremont 's 1963 earnings in half . <P> A Most Happy Fella . A product spread that puts Maremont into items ranging from tail pipes to microwave antennas might seem too diverse to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's president . In addition to running 87-year-old Maremont , which was founded by his father , he has interests in paper and in a maker of Christmas-tree balls , has backed a Broadway musical ( The Most Happy Fella ) , and owns a chunk of the Saturday Review . His collection of modern art contains Dubuffet , Braque , Leger , Gris , Pollock , Arp and Kline , is valued at more than $2,000,000 . <P> A political liberal , Maremont frequently throws himself into controversy . He was the first Illinois industrialist to back a law ending discrimination against hiring Negroes . Named chairman of the Illinois Public Aid Commission two years ago , he campaigned for publicly supported birth control for welfare families . After he had excoriated the state legislators in a TV interview , they passed a special law so that they could fire him . They did-but Maremont , undeterred , last week sandwiched speeches and interviews on birth control in among visits to his far-flung plants . Says he : " My role as a businessman is only one aspect of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
