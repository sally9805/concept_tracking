txt Big food chains are moving to head off the possibility of another round of boycotts . Food prices are climbing again . And supermarkets want the housewife to know they are not to blame . The increases are laid to the rise in farm prices and the world food shortage . - A massive information campaign is underway to get this message across . It is sponsored by the National Association of Food Chains and directed to the news editors of 300 of the nation 's largest newspapers . In a bulletin to members of the food industry , the association says : " We do n't know of anyone in the industry or government who does n't believe that food prices are going to rise substantially by the end of the year . " Unless American consumers are alerted to this  --  and told why in clear and convincing terms ? we could see a repeat of last fall 's problems . " At the same time , the outlook for the American economy for the rest of 1967 is enough to make the public whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a rate of $800 billion a year . By contrast , at the end of World War II it was running at a bit more than $200 billion . Most economists now broadly agree on prospects for the second half of the year  --  after a slow first quarter and a pickup in the second . A composite guess by them at this midyear point would be an economy tagged at a little more than $780 billion . Just the increase in the gross national product expected for this year over last  --  something like $40 billion ? is almost twice the current cost of the war in Vietnam . In recent years the annual addition to the national output ( income , in civilian terms ) has been running something like half the federal budget for everything  --  including defense . It wo n't be far under half this year . Those de luxe high-speed trains promised for the Northeast corridor are feeling the pinch of the Vietnam war . Passenger demonstrations on the Boston-New York leg were set to begin July 1 . Now Department of Transportation officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials attribute most of the delay to " the Far East crisis . " It held up United Aircraft , chief supplier for the Boston-New York line , some 56 days when the Air Force took over Alcoa 's aluminum press . Technical problems with the new turbine-powered cars also caused some slowdowns . When the test trains finally take on their first passengers , officials say they may exceed 120 m.p.h . But terrain factors  --  like Baltimore 's long tunnel  --  will lower average speed to about 75 m.p.h . Another delay : The Navy 's Sealab 3 postponed again . Originally scheduled to begin last winter at a site off the California coast , this manin-the-sea project was put off until mid-October . Now it has been pushed forward once more  --  into spring , 1968 . Difficulties in building two decompression chambers have beset the experiment . These chambers , to be used on deck for decompressing aquanauts following a period under the sea , are substantially more complex than earlier shipboard models . Sealab 2 placed aquanauts at a depth of 205 feet in 1965 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupying for 12 days each underwater quarters anchored at a depth of about 430 feet . The military objectives are to advance rescue and salvage capabilities , gain experience in underwater maintenance , and explore possibilities of using contintental shelves in warfare . How and why ... Senate subcommittees sometimes vie for witnesses . Frank S. Hogan , District Attorney of New York County , is the latest object of pursuit . He is regarded as a star witness on electronic eavesdropping because New York , in its fight against organized crime , has used it extensively . Sen , Edward V. Long 's judiciary subcommittee on administrative practice and procedure is considering the Senator 's bill to ban law-entorcement use of electronic snooping . He wanted the DA as a witness . But Sen. John L. McClellan , chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on criminal laws and procedures , also wanted Mr. Hogan to testify ? on a measure making certain exemptions for official electronic surveillance to combat organized crime . After weighing both invitations , Mr. Hogan accepted the McClellan bid . He testified this week .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
