They were vastly dissimilar men-a polished Cabinet minister , a tough bodyguard , a wealthy newspaper publisher , a confirmed criminal and a veteran Socialist politician . One chilly day last week all five met the same fate : they mounted a scaffold at Seoul 's Sodaemun prison and were hanged by the neck until dead . <P> The executions were carried out by the ruling military junta , headed by General Park Chung Hee , who some observers feel is being just a shade too zealous as a reformer . General Park confirmed the death sentences but delicately refrained from having them carried out until after he had made his good-will visit to U.S. President John Kennedy last month , during which he won strong U.S. backing . <P> What the hanged men had in common was that they had all supported deposed President Syngman Rhee . Otherwise , their alleged crimes hardly seemed to merit the death penalty : former Home Minister Choi In Kyu was accused of fraud ; Rhee 's ex-bodyguard Kwak Yung Joo and Gangster Lim Wha Soo , of corruption ; Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Publisher Cho Yong Soo was charged with " sympathizing " with the views of Communist North Korea .
