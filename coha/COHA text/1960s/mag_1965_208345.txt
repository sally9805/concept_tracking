The U.S. plans for a supersonic transport have had as many ups and downs as a single-prop plane bulling its way through a thunderstorm . Last week President Johnson received the most optimistic report yet on the SST-a report that has suddenly brightened the plane 's uncertain prospects . Prepared by the Commerce Department , it bases its favorable analysis of the 1,900-m.p.h. , 150-passenger plane on several new economic and technical discoveries . <P> <P> Government and industry have been spending $2,000,000 a month for research on the SST , about 75% of it Government funds . Work on the drawing boards and in the wind tunnels has produced important design improvements in both the SST 's airframe ( for which Boeing and Lockheed are competing ) and engines ( General Electric v. Pratt &; Whitney ) . The airframe makers have discovered that a relatively small reduction in airframe weight produces a disproportionately larger increase in payload ; a 1% reduction , for example , would increase the payload by 10% . National Aeronautics and Space Administration research has given increased hope for solving the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the SST have been raised from 200 planes to 400 . <P> All this has convinced many previously hesitant airline officials that the plane is commercially practical , and has turned the congressional head wind against the SST into a tail wind . " My gloom has been dispelled , " says Mike Monroney , chairman of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee , who less than two years ago was nearly ready to abandon the SST . " I am convinced that it is now time to get our SST off the drawing board . " Says Boeing President William M. Allen : " Boeing would be prepared to implement a construction program tomorrow . " <P> <P> Monroney is now proposing that the Administration underwrite a major part of the SST prototype-development program ( the original stand of the U.S. airframe makers ) , wants to see both a Boeing and a Lockheed prototype . After flight tests and evaluation of the prototypes , the government would make its choice and the winning company would then build production-line ships with its own risk capital ; the government would recover its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly powerful motivation for giving the go-ahead : if the SST market is forfeited to the British and French , who seem to have patched up their differences and are forging ahead with the Concorde , the U.S. would lose upwards of $10 billion in potential sales in the next dozen years .
