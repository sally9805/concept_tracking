txt Washington , Nov. 4 ? A congressman asserted today that " the shadow of blame falls on our nation " if American officials knew of the coup in South Viet Nam and did not exert every effort to protect the life of President Ngo Dinh In a House speech , Rep. Clement J. Zablocki D. , Wis. , who is chairman of a House foreign affairs special study mission which visited Viet Nam last month , said : " Can we believe that the state department did not know that a coup was likely ? Were steps taken to warn President Diem of the impending danger . Calls for Accounting " And what of the central intelligence agency ? Did its agents in Viet Nam know of the coup ? Did , in fact , its agents play a part in it ? These questions remain to be answered . " Asked later if the foreign affairs committee would investigate the government 's role , Zablocki said that if the answers to his questions are forthcoming no investigation will be necessary . But , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. Melvin R. Laird R. , Wis. asked Zablocki if he believed a commitment was made to the junta prior to the coup . Cites U. S. Inconsistency " You , as a member of the appropriations committee , know the answer to that better than I , " Zablocki said , " but my best judgment is that there must have been some encouragement . " Rep. William C. Cramer R. , Fla. said the state department appears to be " ready , willing and anxious " to recognize the junta but is not following the same line in recognizing provisional governments in the Dominican Republic and Honduras , where the military recently overthrew governments . Zablocki agreed with Cramer that there is a lack of consistency in the courses being , foltowed by the American government , and agreed with Cramer that the same principle is involved . He said the same formula should be followed . Zablocki said he was concerned about the " ruthless " way in which Diem was deposed and " grieved at the assassination . " He said Diem 's slaying was a reprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a suicide . The congressman said that before the United States recognizes the new government it should receive definite commitments for the return to some form of civilian rule and insist on reforms . Zablocki said that the withholding of American aid to Viet Nam was in part , justified . But , he said , there can be little doubt that this curtailment also heartened D i em 's opponents and helped " trigger the coup . " Calls Junta Ruthless " It was a signal to the military leaders of Viet Nam that the United States would support the overthrow of the Diem regime , " he said . " Further , there will be some who will say that the United States openly encouraged the coup . Whatever the case , the military junta which now rules Viet Nam has not shown itself to be any less ruthless or any less autocratic than the former regime . " Zablocki said that what has happened in Viet Nam must cause troubled thoughts for the leaders of other nations allied with the United States in the Eight against world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most particularly in Latin America . He said that the study mission heard from many individuals that the war against the communist Viet Cong guerillas could not be won under Diem , but he said , the study mission found that the war was being won .
