txt " Jacob Riis " should soon be joining " Mrs. Murphy " as the year 's most symbolic name in the national housing field . Unlike " Mrs. Murphy , " an imaginary rooming-house landlady spared from fair-housing provisions of the 1966 civil-rights bill , " Jacob Riis " means " can do " most emphatically . Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson will dramatize this point May 23 when she dedicates a boldly landscaped public-housing courtyard called Jacob Riis Plaza . Set amid the high-rise Jacob Riis Houses in Manhattan 's lower East Side , the plaza may serve as a trend-setter for the nation . Pergolas and pyramids The plaza 's designing team tackled the age-old criticism of " the project " : that it dehumanizes already demoralized low-income tenants by a barrackslike sameness in structure and setting . The architects could n't do much about the 14-story buildings that surround the plaza . But they did lend form , function , and beauty to the three-acre environs ? the area where tenants of all ages should find a place to meet and share good times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a children 's play area with stone igloo and pyramids transform a once limited space to one seemingly much larger , surely more useful .

" I ca n't get over it , " a young mother exclaimed as she watched her children frolic in the sand area . " This playground has a tone of men who understand children . " The loudspeaker filled the plaza with the voices of the Brothers Four singing " What Next , My Love ? " That 's what Freddy George , a guard on the New York City Housing Authority police force , wondered as well . " Wait till summer . Then we 'll know , " he said . " It 's great for the little kids .

" Architect Simon Breines , partner in the firm Pomerance &; Breines , conceded Patrolman George 's point on teen-agers . Mr. Breines used to play baseball on the Brooklyn streets as a boy . Traffic would n't permit it now . And most of the former vacant lots today house heavy construction equipment or new buildings . Pomerance &; Breines.worked closely with landscape designer Paul Friedberg , hoping to solve such problems . The team had earlier laid out George Washington Carver Plaza in an East Harlem housing project . Carver Plaza , which also boasts an amphitheater , won the First Lady 's praise when she dedicated it in 1964 . She helped engage the architects in future plaza projects in Washington , D.C.

" The trend is toward more attention to the crowded open spaces . " Since early New Deal days , public-housing landscapers have devoted this space to English garden-style lawns . These soon proved impractical . With nowhere else to toss a football , youths ignore " stay off " signs , ruined the lawns , then lost patience with the warnings of housing project police . Gangs sometimes formed out of these frustrations . " So we got rid of the grass plots and put in paving that gives easy access and permits trees to be planted " , Mr. Breines recalled .

And niceties like the amphitheaters keep politicians wary . They look too much like frills . The Riis amphitheater already is paying dividends , however . Dramatic groups , trained by Mobilization for Youth , the area 's antipoverty agency , use the sunken stage regularly . It 's also in demand by graduating classes and teen-age musical combos . It seems a natural site for summer dances , too . Solutions outlined Mr. Breines says the architects can solve the teen-agers ' quandary in the corning Kapper Plaza . assignment . The answer lies in a refreshment stand and a combination baseball-football field . " We think we 'll do better in Washington , " he said . " The plaza should have a paved square for dancing and a place for snacks . We 'll have a meeting place where the boys can treat the girls to pizza and soft drinks .

The Riis project recently underwent a shift in tastes of another sort . Electrical engineers testing the area 's loundspeaker played a Bach cantata over the sound system for several hours . After the tests , a deluge of protests greeted the project manager . Tenants demanded to know why the workmen stopped " the nice music . " These days Riis residents hear Bach all the time . Mrs. Johnson and her entourage are expected to note one appropriate irony ? the choice of the Riis project to stage this housing breakthrough ? in dedication - day speeches . Jacob Riis , a Danish-American newspaperman , was the Michael Harrington of his day . His book " How the Other Half Lives " exposed slum living in New York City before the turn of the century in much the same way that Mr. Harrington 's " The Other America " laid bare the plight of this nation 's poor in the 1960's.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
