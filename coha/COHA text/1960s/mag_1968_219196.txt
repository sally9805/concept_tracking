TOWARD A DEMOCRATIC LEFT by Michael Harrington . 314 pages . Macmillan . $5.95 . <P> <P> Socialist Michael Harrington is one of the last of the political evangelists-by temperament more Old Left than New Left . He comes on , in the words of Britain 's best America-watcher , D. W. Brogan , like a pastor at the moment of decadence . In The Other America , Harrington heaped coals on the heads of his middle-class pewholders by exposing the suffering of the " invisible poor " - and helped make it a new priority of national concern . In this book , Harrington attempts Jeremiah 's longest leap : from the catalogue of sins to the calculus of redemption . " The American system does n't seem to work any more , " he says , and in Toward a Democratic Left proposes what he calls " practical intimations of a new civilization " for the U.S. <P> In emphasizing the practical , Harrington makes concessions that neither the Old Left of idealistic socialism nor the New Left of angry anarchism is likely to applaud . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American life , and , he observes accurately , it is not realistic " to expect that the American people will decide to transform capitalism during that period . " To get something done , one must " locate a radical program midway between immediate feasibility and ultimate Utopia . " He has little patience with calls for instant destruction of the existing order : " A hazy apocalypse is no substitute for an inadequate liberalism . " <P> Traditional Optimism . Harrington 's point of departure is the 1964 election and the legislation that followed from it in 1965 , which at long last completed the program of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal . " Everyone except the Neanderthals agreed on Federal management of the economy , the goal of full employment , Medicare , formal legal equality for Negroes and , above all , economic growth . " As a result , traditional American liberalism lost its innovative thrust , argues Harrington , and is unable to cope with the persisting problems of poverty , urban blight , inadequate education and racial hostility . To Harrington , nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However miserable the present may be , there is always hope for the future . " <P> He does not sufficiently prove his thesis . Indeed , he gives the impression of having researched this book the way Sinclair Lewis used to research a novel : by filling a trunk not only with his own notes but also with every newspaper or magazine clipping that might some day serve to make a point . Many of his statistics come from Government reports , and he naturally leans most heavily on the bleakest . Still , some of the citations are deeply disturbing : children under 18 compose 42% of America 's poor ; the average Negro who finishes high school has a mathematical ability below eighth-grade level and a reading ability not much higher ; the President 's Council of Economic Advisors estimates that only 22% of America 's poor receive any kind of welfare or public assistance .
