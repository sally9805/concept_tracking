' How can railroads reduce freight damage caused when coupling cars slam together ? Answers to these and other questions vital to businessmen increasingly are coming from trade associations , organizations of competitors set up to deal with mutual problems Their role in the economy has grown steadily in importance since the first associations were founded before the Civil War , and this growth has accelerated greatly in recent years . To keep member firms happy , the nation 's 12,800 trade associations have been stepping up activities in a broad range of fields , including promotion , research , lobbying , information service and education . The trade groups have so proliferated-3,720 have started up since 1940 , says the U.S. Department of Commerce that today they blanket the economy , covering almost all lines of business , including the prominent and the obscure , the old and the new . Steel , Chick Sexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 2.804 members , represents an industry with sales of $14 billion yearly ; but for 50 firms whose business is sorting male ande female baby chicks for hatcheries , the National Chick Sexing Association is the big thing . Pickle men take pride in their 68-year-old National Pickle Packers Association ; now only starting to build an industry esprit de corps is the National Association of Fallout Shelter Manufacturers , about two months old . The joining propensities of U.S. businessmen , plus their yen to know what the competition is thinking , have been a boon to the industry trade groups . Of the nation 's 4.7 million business firms , about 3.8 million , or 80% , belong to at least one trade association , according to the American Society of Association Executives , a trade association for trade association administrators . For many giant , diversified companies . the *Ctist of representation in numerous trade groups can be staggering .

A sampling of trade association members shows that , by and large , most think they are getting their money 's worth . But , says Glenn B. Sanberg. executive vice president of the American Society of Association Executives , " Some of the larger companies are beginning to take a stiff look at participation in these associations to determine if they 're worthwhile . Associations are going to have to produce to survive . " William H. , a vice ' president of American Motors Co. , which belongs to 30 associations , underlines this point : " While we have no particular drive td Qut back the number of association memberships , the company is examining each one intensively to determine if its really worth belonging to . " Antitrust Concern Some companies privately also have expressed concern that their cooperative activities with competitors in trade associations might involve them in Government antitrust action . Despite such worries , evidence abounds that trade organizations are becoming increasingly active in performing major services for members , such as conducting industry-wide promotion and advertising campaigns to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing 400,000 tobacco growers and 100 export companies , has been campaigning to promote the sale of American-grown tobacco in Burma . This association , two other trade groups and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are spending 650,000 this year to help Burmese cigaret makers adv8rtise five local brands made from U.S. tobacco . Burma was chosen for this campaign because this Asian nation 's cigaret consumption is relatively low , while the potential market is large . Cigaret sales have increased in Burma from 1 billion in 1958 , the year before the campaign started , to 1.5 billion last year , and a further gain of 25% is expected this year , according to J. B. Hutson , president of Tobacco Associates . The group is active in similar programs in Japan , Thailand and France . Trade Shows Grow Trade shows , another association promotional approach , are growing in number and popularity . Associations this year will sponsor about 3,500 trade shows with a total estimated attendance of five million persons . In 1950 , associations sponsored only about 2,200 shows , according to the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the housewares division of General Electric Co .. says the twice-yearly trade shows staged by the National Housewares Manufacturers Association are invaluable to GE . " Talking to retailers who are selling our products stimulates thinking , " Mr. Sahloff explains . He says the shows give GE sales managers a " chance to renew acquantances with customers in a short time . " Trade associations also are expanding their research work for members and will spend about $28 million on such activities this year , up from about $12 million in 1954 , according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . Such industry-wide research often pays oft in increased sales for members . In 1959 the Super Market Institute , with 750 member firms , paid Raymond Loewy Corp , an incluF4 ? trial design firm , $75,000 to study supermarket met chandising techniques . Following the yearlong research project the institute advised members to reverse their traditional store layouts .

" Usually when we remodel a store we figure our sales will rise about 10 ' ; " Trade associations are also turning their research facilities to the development of new products The Pot Hand Cement Association last month assigned five of its 400 engineers to design sevetal plans for concrete fallout and blast shelters that 3.50111 ( 1 protect 25 persons The Linen Supply Association spent $100,000 over the past 15 months developing an elec .

Keller , research chi ector The rail group is spending $52,000 on the project this year . Facts and Figures The collecting of facts and figures is a major occupation of trade associations These vast files of information often are used by member companies in planning production and sales campaigns . In 1959 Chrysler Corp . dropped plans to name its new compact the Falcon when it learned through the Automobile Manufacturers Association that another company intended to use the name . The other company , of course , was Ford , which kept the Falcon name while Chrysler switched to Valiant . The information saved embarrassment and expensive changes in advertising plans , says William L. Scherer , head of the association 's patent department Among other things , the patent department keeps a list of proposed names for new cars andi cross-checks new names submitted by auto companies to avoid duplication The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical services , this year will collect more than four billion facts and figures on such items as wages , profits , steel output , shipments and markets ' Institute figures are essential for planning expansion or changes in steel-making facilities , " says Joseph D. Block , chairman of Inland Steel Co . " The institute showed us that more and more galvanized sheets are going to industries with big tonnage potential such as household appliances , air conditioning , steel buildings and automobiles . " As a result , Inland last July increased its production capacity for galvanized steel sheets by 35% , to 460,000 tons annually from 340,000 tons . Statistics Curb Layoffs The American Home Laundry Manufacturers Association issues monthly reports to its 20 members on production , shipments , sales and inventories of home washing machines and dryers . " Since we started receiving these twines two years ago we have n't had any layoffs because of over-production as used to be the case , " sass a spokesman for Whirlpool Corp .

The U S.

The National Association of Retail Grocers last spring completed a $25,000 color movie showing grocers how to install their own bakery plants In the past five years nearly 1,100 supermarket executives have taken such courses as management philosophy and employe communications at the eight annual seminars sponsored by the Super Market Institute . As their activities have explained , trade associations have become a big business in themselves , employing an army of workers . While no overall employment figures are available for the trade groups , the 1,800 associations that operate on a national basis employ about 30,000 persons . Budgets of some of the larger associations run to $1 million or more a year . Top administrators of the larger groups earn an average of $42,700 yearly , according to the Chamber of Commerce ; but managers of smaller groups may be paid as little as $4,500 a year . Associations meet most of their bills from dues levied on members , usually in proportion to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $150,000 a year to belong to the American Iron &; Steel Institute ; members of the Farm Equipment Institute pay between $100 and $20,000 , and the Super Market Institute charges dues of between $100 and $300 . The concern of some companies that their cooperative activities with competitors in trade associations might lead to Government antitrust action stems in part from the antitrust suit last winter against 29 electrical manufacturers for price fixing . It was brought out during the case that some executives of these firms used conventions of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and other trade groups as opportunities to carry on price-fixing discussions These informal and illegal talks were conducted separately from the trade association meetings . Although neither NEMA nor any other trade association was involved in any illegal activity , the publicity given to the case has made some firms extra cautious about trade association meetings . One official of a trade association outside the electrical industry calls it " a fear psychosis . " A legal adviser to a manufacturer says : " I know there 's been a lot of discussion among companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade associations to more than offset the exposure of sales people to possible price-fixing talk . " Joseph F Miller , managing director of NEMA , says members have not been shying away from association activities : attendance at meetings " has been the same " as in the past . Last June , NEMA 's board of governors adopted a statement of principles as a guide to its members . Included was this ruling : " Discussions of such commercial policies and practices as prices , terms and conditions of sale shalt continue to be prohibited at such ( NEMA ) meetings .
