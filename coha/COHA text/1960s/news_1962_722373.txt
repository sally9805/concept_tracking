txt The Administration asked the Senate today to tighten almost every part of the tax bill that the House passed last week . Testifying before the Senate Finance Committee , Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon proposed changes that , when fully effective , would net the Government an estimated total of ** a year more in revenues than the House bill would . What Mr. Dillon proposed today was , in general , what President Kennedy proposed in his original tax message to Congress forty-nine weeks ago . In other words , the Administration wants now what it wanted then , without the modifications and changes made by the House . A Matter of Strategy Ten days ago President Kennedy congratulated the House Ways and Means Committee for producing a bill " that will truly serve the national interest . " The President 's statement was designed to ; vin support for the bill in the House itself , where it faced the possibility , of outright defeat . The House approved the committee bill . Now the Administration is doing what it had planned all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original ! plan . The Administration , however , is not expected to get everything it wants . The Finance Committee 's , chairman , Senator Harry Flood , Byrd , Democrat of Virginia , 1 opened the attack on the House bill by criticizing the investment credit device . Assailed by Byrd A central feature of the bill , investment credit is designed to stimulate business expansion by reducing taxes for businesses investing in new machinery . Mr. Byr ' called the plan a " subsidy " and an " amazing proposition . " The principal changes in the House bill that Mr. Dillon requested today included both a liberalization and a tightening of the investment credit device . The net effect would be to reduce its immediate impact on the Government 's revenues but increase its long-range impact . The biggest change , in terms of dollars , would be repeal of two eight-year-old provisions that reduce the income tax rates on divided income  --  as item in the original Kennedy bill that the House left out altogether . The other major changes proposed would tighten provisions that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request that the income of overseas subsidiaries , of American companies be subject to United States tax when earned , instead of when returned to this country . He also asked again that expense account deductions for entertainment be made non-deductible . And he asked for a stiffer formula for taxing savings and loan associations and savings banks . The only major feature of the House bill that Mr. Dillon accepted without change was the establishment of a system of tax withholding on dividends and interest  --  a feature that is as hotly contested as any in the bill . Despite the many changes he proposed , Mr. Dillon called the House bill " a good piece of tax legislation . " At the very outset of his two-hour statement he said that it was urgent that the bill be passed , and at the conclusion he asked that it be done ' as soon as possible , without the injection of new issues that would slow it down . Byrd Forecasts Deficit Even while Mr. Dillon was testifying , a Finance Committee aide distributed in the packed hearing room statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's effect on revenues and of the general budget outlook for the coming year . The Administration has estimated a balanced budget for the 1963 fiscal year , which begins July 1 . Mr. Dillon said that he still hoped for it . The estimate released by Senator Byrd forecasts a budget deficit of $3,800,000,000 to $4 , - 900,000,000 . Mr. Dillon said that the Senator 's estimate of revenue losses had failed to take into account the general stimulus to economic activity , and thus to tax collections , that the investment credit would produce . The credit is needed " to increase our efficiency and our productivity at a rate at least equal to that of other leading industrialized nations , " he said . Business has not done so on its own because it was not sufficiently profitable to do so , he stated . The credit , he said , will increase the profitability of equipment investment " far more " than any of the alternatives that have been proposed . The credit , combined with the revision of plant and equipment depreciation allowances that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a tax footing comparable to its foreign competitors , Mr. Dillon said . The Senator challenged the investment credit on several grounds . He said that it would cause multibillion-dollar losses of revenue to the Treasury over the years . He said that American business was " supposed to be the most progressive in the world " and did not need such a stimulus . And he said that he was opposed to the clause making the credit retroactive to Jan. 1 ? in effect , applying the incentive to investment that has already been made . The principal recommendations that Mr. Dillon made today were as follows : INVESTMENT CREDIT The Administration originally proposed , last April , a graduated credit , but accepted the House Ways and Means Com mittee 's decision last summer to substitute a straight 8 per cent credit . Last month the Ways and Means Committee cut the credit to 7 per cent to reduce the revenue loss that the bill would entail . As it stands now , the credit would permit most businesses to subtract from their tax an amount equal up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upto-date machinery and equipment . The full amount could be deducted up to $25,000 . Above that , only one-quarter could be subtracted . The credit for public utilities would be only 3 per cent . Mr. Dillon asked that the general credit be raised to 8 per cent again , that utilities be excluded from the bill altogether , and that the one-quarter credit for investment above $25,000 be made a one-half credit instead . EXPENSE ACCOUNTS The House bill would require that a business demonstrate that its entertainment expenses are closely related to doing its business . Mr. Dillon said that it " draws only a vaguely defined line " and would certainly result in " considerable controversy and litigation . " He asked that entertainment expenses be made totally nondeductible , and that some provision be made for segregating business expenses from pleasure expenses on trips that are part business and part pleasure . One original request that the Treasury abandoned some time ago and Mr. Dillon did not mention today was a provision that would set fixed dollar amounts on deductible on-theroad expenses . SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutual savings banks , but does not make it comparable with the liability of commercial banks . It would permit the savings institutions to accumulate bad debt reserves tax-free by either of two formulas : 3 per cent of the net increase in their real estate loans , or 60 per cent of the income they retain after paying dividends or interest to depositors . Mr Dillon asked that the second formula be made 33 1/3 per cent instead of 60 per cent . FOREIGN EARNINGS The Administration is asking the Senate to tighten up more than the House did on the income of Americans living abroad as well as businesses operating abroad . For individuals the House set dollar limits on the amount of income that could be exempt from United States income tax . Mr. Dillon asked elimination of the exemption for persons living in economically developed countries and a $20,000 limit in less-developed countries . For business operations in socalled " tax haven " countries ? that is , countries with no tax or a low tax  --  Mr. Dillon asked only one major change . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are invested in under-developed countries . Mr. Dillon asked that the exemption be limited to profits generated in underdeveloped countries and reinvested there . For the operations of over ? seas subsidiaries generally , Mr. Dillon returned to the Administration 's original request that their earnings be subject to the United States corporate income tax when earned . Present law and the House bill provide a " substantial tax advantage for investment abroad than at home , " he said . At the least , he said , the privilege of deferring payment of United States taxes amounts to " an interest-free loan . " Mr. Dillon challenged the pri principal argument of businesses that their overseas operations help the United States by increasing exports  --  from here to the subsidiaries  --  and by returning dividends greater than the outflow of investment . He said that investment increased exports little , if any , and that the investment did not come home in dividends for ten or fifteen years . The fact that annual dividends flowing in aie greater than annual investment flowing out is not relevant , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investment . He also argued that other countries curbed overseas investments far more than the proposed tax would . In total , the Dillon proposals ? according to the Treasury 's estimates  --  would yield the Government $965,000,000 more taxes each year . The investment credit would cut revenues by $1,350,000,000 and the other features of the bill would bring in that much and $965,000,000 more . The House bill , by Treasury estimate , would yield a net increase of $120,000,000 . In the fiscal year 1963 , the Treasury estimates , the Administration 's proposal would yield a net $90,000,000 increase in revenues and the House bill would yield a net loss of $320,000,000.
