For the past several years a number of peo- ple have been worrying in print over the alleged softhcadedness of our teen-agers  --  pointing with dismay to the manner in which high-school students carefully avoid the tough , hard-core subjects such as mathematics , physics and chemistry , the basic sciences which are the foundation for the nuclear , space-conquering age we have entered . But I , for one , am no longer worried . Not since a year ago when I first began talking with such youngsters as Earl Godfrey , Joseph T ... iro and Albert Thiess Jr . Earl Godfrey , then a dark-haired , serious-eyed seventeen-year-old , looked out the window at the winter sky during a pause in our conversation at Cathedral High School , Springfield , Massachusetts . " I hope it snows soon , " lie remarked . " Why ? " I asked . " Well , I shovel snow to earn money for my science projects , " he explained . " Right now I need forty dollars to buy an electric motor and other parts for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a million electron volts to power a particle accelerator , the kind that shoots alpha and beta particles at a target . " Earl told me he wanted to become a nuclear physicist . " That 's been my ambition for four years . 1 like research . I hope to go to college , but my folks ca n't afford to send me , so I 'm trying out for various scholarships and loans . But right now I 'll he in a fix unless it snows , so I can finish that generator . " It 's a pleasure to report that Earl Godfrey has been able to go to college , thanks to a grant from an anonymous donor , and is majoring in physics , with a view to nuclear engineering , at the University of Massachusetts . Joseph Liro , a blond , crew-cut seventeenyear-old , was an all-round student leader in the same high school and found time  --  aside from his studies , activities , and part-time job in a grocery store  --  to plan an electronic computer which , he hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just talk to this machine , lell it numbers , and it would add or multiply them ? " I asked . 4 8o The Space Generation cell . I 've built this model garage with an automatic door . When the car approaches the garage it breaks a beam of light between a post and the electric eye . This starts a motor which raises the garage door . You can see how the garage roof is cut away to show the motor and relay switches . And this " ? he put up a large display board with , a wiring design on it ? " is the schematic . " Albert trundled the toy car down the miniature driveway , but the garage door did n't budge . He frowned and looked around . " I 'm getting interference from the house lights , " he said . He rigged a shade for the electric eye , and after that his automatic door worked smoothly . What these young men had in common was their membership in a national high-school organization , the Junior Engineering Technical Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful interest in applied science . The youngsters attracted to this fast-growing club seem fairly typical of science-minded teenagers all over the country when their curiosity and competitive spirit are challenged . The nuclear , automated space age may be something of a fearsome mystery to many of the older generation , but it wo n't be to these bright kids , who are going to help run it , eagerly and ably . The Jets organization itself has much of the enthusiastic , sky's-not-the-limit attitude of its members . The society was launched eleven years ago by Michigan State University 's College of Engineering simply as a state program to locate and attract high-school students with talent in applied science . But the society now has rocketed to national proportions  --  even to some foreign nations  --  and at last count had 762 chapters with about 19,000 members in forty-six states and seven countries . Spurring on this growth have been numbers of industrial firms which have contributed to the national organization 's budget and , perhaps most important , have lent the clubs the time and brains of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jets came from a farm-youth club . and was stimulated by a lack of youthful interest in applied science . Back in the years following World War H the faculty of Michigan State 's engineering school became apprehensive about ( I I the poor preparation and motivation of the freshmen they were getting , and ( 2 ) the increasing number of " dropouts " ? students who enrolled in engineering but later decided they were n't cut out for this kind of course and withdrew . In some cases the entering freshmen simply had an erroneous idea about engineering and , after wasting a year or so , found they were unsuited for it . In others the youngsters had talent , but had n't taken enough basic science and mathematics in high school  --  or had n't taken these courses seriously enough  --  to provide a foundation for technical courses in college . Michigan State was sending emissaries , such as Prof. Harold P. Skamser of the College of Engineering , to " college days " and " career days " at Midwestern high schools . Skamser and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent scholastic records and who wanted to go into engineering or scientific research , but simply could n't qualify . " These young people had followed the course of least resistance , " Skamser recalls . ( He now is dean of engineering at California State Polytechnic College . ) " Their realization that their training was useless for a career in applied science came too late for them to take corrective action . " ( Continued from Page 27 ) In talking over the problem , Skamser and Lorin G. Miller , then dean of engineering and since retired , decided that some mechanism was needed to reach the high-school students early in the game , something that would give the youngsters a taste of applied science so they could decide for themselves whether or not they had talent and what would be required to develop it . But how to reach them ? How to dramatize the adventure and excitement in engineering and research ? Seeking answers , Miller and Skamser thought of the remarkable success long enjoyed by the 4-H Clubs of America in capturing the imaginations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United States Department of Agriculture and state agricultural colleges , promote agricultural education by the project method , The 4-H calls it " learning by doing . " The 4-H clubs use youth-run meetings , demonstrations , emblems , contests and awards to bring life and competition to subjects which might be considered dreary if presented simply as textbook lessons . Part of the 4-H technique is the use of experienced people in the community  --  teachers , outstanding farmers , and the like  --  as volunteer leaders for the clubs . Unblushingly Miller and Skamser borrowed the 4-H pattern . They thought up a name , originally Junior Engineering Training for Schools , later changed to Junior Engineering Technical Society . The main idea was to get initials that connoted speed and action  --  or JETS . Keep in mind that Sputnik had not yet blazed through the skies , or the profs might have figured out an acrostic that would have added up to ROCKETS . The clubs would " learn by doing " with individual and group projects which would emphasize applied physics , chemistry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later did turn out to be a rocket and a TH streak of lightning . Each club would have a teacher-adviser , to be known as a " jets pilot , " and a local volunteer technical adviser , an engineer or scientist , but the club members themselves would run the show , guided by their elected officers : A captain , first officer , navigator ( treasurer ) and communications officer ( secretary ) . Industries would be invited to back the clubs , locally and nationally , with ideas , technical material , prizes , scholarships and money . There would be contests , awards , field trips and engineering expositions where the kids could show their projects . There would be no national fees , although the local clubs might collect dues for their own purposes . Skamser organized the first club in 1950 in his own back yard  --  at the East Lansing High School , not far from the campus of Michigan State . From there the idea spread rather slowly through the state ; during the next two years only nine other clubs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engineering circles , the movement began to spread to other states . New ideas came along too . A club newsletter called the Jels-O-Gram was started . Michigan State University set aside a few entrance scholarships especially for Jets members . An official pin was adopted  --  a small , silver slide rule with the word " Jets " engraved on it  --  and the Keuffel and Esser Company of Hoboken , New Jersey , manufacturers of engineering instruments , agreed to provide these to all members . Companies such as General Electric , which had previously sponsored high-school engineering and science clubs in their plant communities , made their educational literature available to the Jets and took an interest in expanding the organization . The Consumers Power Company of M ichigan decided to support the Jets program on a statewide basis , assigning seventy-five of the company 's engineers to work in their spare time in organizing and advising the clubs . " The reason for our part in the program is very simple , " said a company // spokesman . " For several years there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Jets program . They get a kick out of working with the youngsters and have learned they have to cram up on their engineering principles before going to club meetings . " Industry 's increasing interest in Jets was one reason for the society 's mushrooming growth . By 1958 the organization had 365 chapters in thirty-five states and had completely outgrown its status as a part-time Michigan State project . So it was reorganized as a national , nonprofit society with an impressive board of directors drawn from various parts of United States industry , education and government . A full-time executive director was hired . Dean J. D. Ryder of Michigan State 's College of Engineering was elected president of the society , a post he still holds . The national headquarters remained in East Lansing . Jets roots took hold in many different ways . For example , five years ago Carl Parenti , an intense aeronautical engineer , then chief of engineering training of Republic Aviation Corporation , Farmingdale , Long Island , was desperately scouting for engineers on the Michigan State campus when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office he convinced Republic 's top command that the company should undertake to promote the Jets idea in the high schools in its area , and should back the decision with a grant of at least $100 annually per school and part of the working time of as many asa dozen of its engineers and sci- " We 're real selfish about this program , " said Parenti , who since has become manager of the organization-procedures division of the company . " We want to have engineers and technicians when we need them , so we 're helping the high schools to find and develop talent . We are n't trying to interfere with the school system , but we do want to help them give better guidance to students in the fields of science and engineering . " Parenti believes that the schools , rather than the students , have been to blame for lack of emphasis on basic studies . He tells of one case in which a promising student found himself overloaded because he had to help his father in business . The boy decided he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or driver training . His faculty adviser suggested that the student drop mechanical drawing , but stay with the driver training , calling it " a practical subject that would be of more value . " Parenti 's face turns a light crimson when he tells this . " These clubs have been a challenge too , " he added . " We now are working with twelve of them . They will try anything . For instance , the Jets at Levittown Memorial High School decided their school needed a cyclotron  --  an atom smasher  --  as an aid to science instruction ; not just a model , but a **29;2028;TOOLONG industrial type . So they set out to build it . " They have completed it too . Working under the guidance of their pilot , Marvin Feinstein , a science teacher , the Levittown group first came to Parenti seeking advice and materials . Parenti now admits that he was a bit shaken up ; he feared the project was too ambitious for a bunch of teen-agers to take on , but he did n't want to dampen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up preliminary plans for the device , hoping that in the process they would discover what a complex piece of equipment they were tackling , But it did n't work out quite as he imagined it would . The club studied all the written material they could find on cyclotrons , consulted experts with a number of the country 's largest electrical firms and laid out a three-year program for the construction , volunteering to continue their work through summer vacations . The club then came back to Parenti with their complete designs , which Republic 's engineers checked and found to be quite sound . There was a problem of making the magnetic core of the atom smasher because it had to be a carefully machined , two-ton chunk of metal . So Republic machined the core to the junior engineers ' specifications . The club had the cyclotron  --  believed to be the largest in any high school  --  all wired and ready for testing as this article went to press . " We soon learned to avoid telling the Jets that something was out of their reach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divert them from impractical or dangerous projects . For example , the Jets at Lindenhurst High School wanted ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? to build a big rocket and try to put it into orbit  --  these kids are all hopped up about space . But Howard Triani , a Republic engineer and counselor to the club , and Fred Frisbie , the club 's pilot , pointed out to the youngsters that they had no place to fire such a rocket , and that they might learn more about the science of rocketry if they built a static test stand for rocket motors . " The members liked the idea and negotiated with the village government for a piece of land , away from the town and jutting out over a bay . In drawing up plans , the club sought and secured technical advice from Reaction Motors , Inc. , a rocket-engine firm . As yet the club has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - They certainly have learned a lot about rockets  --  and also how to do business . " At the sparkling , ultramodern , 55,000 , - 000 Cathedral High School in Springfield , Massachusetts , 1 sat in on a regular , twice-a-month meeting of one of the top Jets clubs of the country . It was a somewhat unnerving experience which left me feeling like some antique left over from the auto-and-airplane age , yet pleasantly amazed by the scientific sophistication of forty-four young men and six girls who expertly discussed everything from cryogenics to thermodynamics , particularly the latter because the club 's 1960 group project  --  they also had many individual ones  --  was the designing and building of a working model of a solar home . The pilot of this club is Sister Loretto Thomas , a dedicated but jolly teacher of physics and mechanical drawing , who realized that I was out of my depth . So she explained things as the meeting went along , adding comfortingly , " This generation is n't any smarter than the older one , but they have access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-confidence too . " I could n't argue with her about that . Jets Capt . Joseph Liro  --  the boy mentioned earlier  --  was running the meeting with professional smoothness and was pointing out that this project gave the club an excellent opportunity to work as a group because a solar house involved investigation of a number of different principles and would require participation by all members  --  the girls , for example , would be in charge of the design from standpoint of livability and decoration . He then called on Earl Godfrey to report on the findings of a committee which had researched mechanisms for solar heating . Godfrey quickly diagrammed a " sandwich " of glass plates and copper sheets to collect heat from the sun . He pointed out that the glass plates would be spaced to permit the sun 's rays to penetrate but not to bounce back . The copper sheets would transfer the heat to water , piped into a reservoir which could be drawn on as needed . After some discussion of capacities , angle of the sun 's rays at various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharpies , a boy who plans to become an architect , suggested an alternate design , a house with a dome , carrying a curved mirror which would collect the sun 's heat and would be guided by an electric eye to stay directly in line with the sun from morning till night in all seasons . There was some objection that this was " too much engineering and too little house , " plus discussion of means by which such a solar heating system could be converted in summer to a cooling system . At the end of the discussion , the Captain listed the alternatives on the board and put the matter to a vote . The mirror type won . Before the meeting adjourned , I asked how many Jets members planned to go on to college  --  and was astonished when every student put up a hand . " All of you ? " 1 said in surprise . A girl held up her hand . " We all plan on going to college , " she said , " but some of us may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked for a show of hands of those planning to go into engineering , and all but seven indicated such plans . On polling the seven I learned that they intended to major in physics , mathematics and chemistry . The year before , out of twenty-two members , sixteen had enrolled in engineering schools . Sister Loretto told me that the club definitely had helped its members to clarify their plans for careers in applied science . " Before we started this program , most boys had only a vague idea of what " engineering " or " technology " really meant , " she said . " Now Jets members know just what each kind of engineer does , and they understand that any kind of engineer must also be a mathematician as well as a designer and planner . The club 's activities also help in a negative way  --  they show those youngsters who lack the particular talents needed for applied science that careers in engineering and research are n't for them . This last is important , too , because it saves youngsters from drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Throughout the entire school year the national Jets organization spreads its 82 doctrine and information by a number of routes . Each chapter receives the semimonthly .10A-0-Groin , along with a fat package of information material on some phase of physical science , especially prepared for high-school use . These are called " academic unit plans " and may cover anything from nuclear physics to fluid mechanics . A typical unit -- say , on dynamics  --  will have a thirty-four-page booklet , illustrated with drawings , giving not only the basic laws but also their application in such things as rockets , automobiles and airplanes . There will he suggested projects which can be set up with simple materials . As Richard T. Fallon , executive director of Jets national , says , " It is n't enough to talk or write to teen-agers . They need stuff they can put their hands on and use to build . Industry has been very helpful in supplying kits of various kinds that we can send out . For example , one company provided materials from which Jets members could build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently is covered by a grant from the National Science Foundation . Other activities promoted by the national organization are " science downs , " engineering expositions , field days and leadership conferences  --  all designed to whip up the competitive spirits of members . The science downs are something like a spelling bee with atomic-age overtones ; that is , teams from different clubs challenge each other and square off in contests , each team seeking to answer the most questions about science . Engineering expositions at high schools , on a local or regional basis , give embryo engineers a chance to show their projects and to win awards  --  usually technical items such as slide rules , instrument-building kits , technical books and the like  --  supplied by local firms that are co-operating in the program . Leadership conferences are regional get-togethers at which Jets club leaders and advisers can swap ideas and talk over their work . The big show  --  the place where outstanding teen-age engineers from all over the country can compete  --  is the National Jets Projects Exposition at Michigan State University . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was all about . The show pros ed to be a dazzling display of youthful technical skill and imagination  --  with enough teen-age lapses into faulty spelling and horseplay to give the event a flavor all its own . As I wanted to talk with some of the youngsters while they were setting up their exhibits , I arrived early at the large lobby of Michigan State 's new library , the scene of the exposition . There I found Executive Director Fallon straightening out some last-minute details in allocation of exhibition spaces . " We have one hundred and twenty-one entnes from seven states , " Fallon told me . " We 're expecting a total of 2400 members and their pilots and advisers . We put many of them up in the college dorms , " He showed me how the projects were divided into nine engineering categories  --  from aeronautics to astrophysics . Fallon himself is a mathematician , a former high-school teacher at Defiance . Ohio , where he became interested in the Jets movement and organized an award-winning club . " When the exhibits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't just gadgets or toys , " he said . " To qualify they have to demonstrate a scientific principle or development and do it in an original way  --  not just an imitation . We have teams of top-notch judges for each category  --  specialists from education and industry . Projects which are rated Superior or Excellent win awards . It was n't long before Albert Thiess Jr. , the boy with the photoelectric-cell demonstration . Caine in and began setting up his project . tl le later won a Superior award . ) Crews of boys carrying heavy crates and strangely shaped objects streamed through the doors , and the exhibit hall began to hum , whir , crackle and flash as various electronic devices were tested . One group in particular attracted considerable attention because it came to the registration desk and apologetically but rather firmly requested that the long desk be moved closer to the wall at one end of the hall . " We have a wind tunnel , one that uses smoke , " their spokesman explained . " It 's kind of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the only place for it . " The registration desk was moved , and a Jets team from Traverse City , Michigan , started setting up its twenty-footlong apparatus , a sturdy , interlocking affair with an impressive-looking control board . It had been designed and built by three students , Joe Wollam , Fitch Williams and Nick Crain . Wollam , a slender , spectacled boy with the standard crew-cut hair , was the leader of the crew and talked to me while making a last-minute repair in the wiring . " We wanted a tunnel that would give us a good velocity  --  around forty miles per hour  --  and would show the effect of air flow on wing foils and model-airplane conformations , " he explained . " We more or less found the parts for it . The power unit came from a project we had last year . We borrowed an old vacuum sweeper from the basement to make our smoke-generating device . We had to buy the siding for the tunnel and the fan motor  --  we earned the money for this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you generate the smoke ? " I asked . " Well , we tried a lot of methods and materials , but We found a mixture of tobacco and tine oil makes the most visible smoke . It 's ignited and sucked into the wind tunnel by the vacuum sweeper . I 'd show you how it works but , to be honest , we do n't want to turn this thing on until the judges come around because , boy , it 's going to fog up this whole hall . " // It did too . But through the resulting haze , the judges managed to find their way to pin a Superior ribbon on the project . All together , twenty-four of the entries won Superior awards and twenty-one were rated as Excellent , The Michigan State University handed out seven tuition scholarships in the engineering school to Jets boys . Later I inspected exhibits until I was completely confused but was in agreement with Dean Ryder that " The kids always surprise us . They have a lot more potential than we expect . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had constructed a model of an atom , using table-tennis balls with lights inside them which would light up in various sequences to show the action of different particles  --  protons , neutrons , mesons , neutrinos , and so forth  --  during nuclear fission . There were working models of ram-jet engines , rocket-guidance systems , cloud chambers , communications systems using infrared light ( " Enemy could n't jam it as they can radio , " said the young builder ) . In the mathematics section was a demonstration which had even the profs on the ropes . It had something to do with the fourth dimension and was called " Hypercubes Made Visible . " Pioneering in a relatively new field was a tall , dark-haired young man , Greg Touchman , aged eighteen , of Cedarville , Ohio , who was showing a device he had spent two years in building . It was an air-liquefaction machine he had developed especially for cryogenics , the study of the effect of exceedingly low temperatures on materials and processes , a branch of science which has gained new significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Touchman won a Superior award OD his project and later was named 1960 's Jets National Junior Engineer  --  the title carrying with it a trip to Washington to receive a trophy presented by Lt. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever , head of the Air Research and Development Command , and a member of the Jets board of directors , The young man was busy last summer on a special job for Jets , writing an academic unit on cryogenics for distribution to the clubs . He received a scholarship and enrolled last fall in mechanical engineering  --  specializing in cryogenics , naturally  --  at Michigan State . " We think that Jets is helping to clear up some of the confusion that developed after the Russian Sputnik , " Dean Ryder said . " You know , youngsters took seriously that publicity that the Soviet Union was ahead of us in science . So there was a big increase in enrollment in pure-science courses  --  and a drop in the courses in applied science a special glamour . " He pointed out the window where a long antiaircraft rocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose toward the sky , " What the kids and the high schools overlooked was that there is just as much engineering as there is science in a rocket . When a space rocket goes into orbit , that 's considered a great scientific achievement  --  but when it flops , some engineer goofed . " Jets has helped show students how science and engineering fit together , " he continued . " And we know that students from these clubs are better scholastic risks than the average . They 've been preselected . This is highly important today because what we need in the coming age is not just engineers , but good engineers . " Personally I think the kids are getting the message .
