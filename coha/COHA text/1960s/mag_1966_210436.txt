Up to His Ears . Pairing Jean-Paul Belmondo and Ursula Andress in a feckless adaptation of Jules Verne 's The Tribulations of a Chinese Gentleman , Director Philippe de Broca overbids to repeat the success of his hilarious mock-action thriller , That Man from Rio . The trouble is that Director de Broca 's imitation of his own winning formula is not a whit better than anyone else 's , and a good deal worse than some . <P> Satirizing practically nothing , Up to His Ears sets up shop in Hong Kong , where Belmondo , as the bored-to-death young heir to a knitting-mills fortune , has anchored his yacht and tried to kill himself for the ninth time within a week . Someone suggests that he could turn his suicidal impulse to good account by insuring his life for $2,000,000 and letting himself be murdered . He does-and then meets Stripper Ursula , a girl worth living for . Fleeing a corps of assassins , the lovers go to the Himalayas and back by junk , ricksha , sampan , elephant , airplane and balloon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat off an attack by a fleet of heavily armed Coca-Cola trucks . <P> In a comedy with residual plot development or a semblance of character , a few such antics might be funny . Ears mistakes physical exercise for humor , and before one-third of the marathon unreels it has exhausted everyone except its agile leading man , who is still one of filmdom 's sprightliest actors . But not sprightly enough , perhaps , to carry off a role that requires him almost simultaneously to be like Harold Lloyd on a high wire , Buster Keaton pratfalling in a Chinese opera , and Humphrey Bogart doing a striptease in drag .
