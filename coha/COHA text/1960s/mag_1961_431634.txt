 | ITALY 'S NEW CA ESAR @# 0 V E R the last ten years or more , the influence and power of a strange , elusive man named Enrico Mattei have been increasingly felt throughout Italy . Although in theory a mere government bureaucrat , Mattei is in practice the undisputed boss of what has become one of Europe 's biggest industrial complexes . As such he has enormous sums of money at his disposal . He also has jobs , and plenty of them , to dispense . At times , too , he not only can help candidates get elected but can be instrumental in getting others defeated . He has been known to have a say in the setting up of ministries . And what with the leaps-and-bounds growth of the Italian economy in recent years , Mattei 's influence , political and financial , has spread rapidly beyond the borders of his own country to the Mediterranean region as a whole . Mattei is , in short , a man to reckon with . Most foreigners would not recognize the name at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the president of a by-now famous state-owned combine called ENI , which is short in Italian for " Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi . " Translated freely , these words mean in English " National Corporation for Combustible Fuel . " ENI was , in fact , set up by the Italian Parliament in 1953 with the simple purpose of promoting the research and exploitation of the Italian subsoil . The new oil age was here , and Italians felt strongly the need to free themselves from the old system of depending on coal imports . Mattei himself , then a deputy , helped write and steer the ENI bill from committee room to the floor . The final document was loosely worded and allowed its ambitious boss-to-be to wander far afield . True , most of ENI 's assets have an easily recognizable connection with the production and distribution of natural gas and oil . ENI owns , for example , a good two thousand miles of pipelines through which is funneled the natural gas to fuel a great part of North Italy 's industry . ENI maintains a tanker fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refineries which will have an annual capacity of 6.5 million tons . The far-flung system of spectacularly constructed filling stations run by ENI 's subsidiary , AGIP , are now to be found in a halfdozen or more European countries as well as throughout most of the littoral of North Africa . But ENI has other interests , too , which seem to have only a vague connection with fuel production . ENI under Mattei has gone into the fertilizer business in a big way , at the rate of over a million tons annually . ENI now produces 90,000 tons annually of synthetic rubber . ENI is about to enter the big-scale production of sulfur , plastic materials , and asphalt . ENI owns an iron foundry and a natural steam works . With the construction of an atomic-energy plant , the biggest in Europe , ENI will soon be in the electric-power business . Almost as a sideline , ENI runs a string of motels , bars , and restaurants  | strategically placed on the peninsula 's highways . ENI even runs a newspaper . Other incidental ENI products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap . All in all , ENI today is rated as a two-billion-dollar corporation . To repeat , all this is the exclusive property of the Italian state . ENI 's net profits , when they are not being reinvested in new ventures , are supposedly turned over to the Italian treasury ; and Mattei as ENI 's president is , on paper , merely the public servant reappointed at stated intervals by the Prime : inister . Actually , Mattei has become much more in the Italian public mind than his title would indicate . First and foremost , he is the man who has protected Italy from the depredations of an international oil combine which , many Italians sincerely believe , selfishly wants to keep the country from developing its own resources and would , if left alone , charge the limit . Italians only have to consider the recent reductions in the price of gasoline , all forced by Mattei , to be sure of their convictions . But perhaps of even greater importance , Mattei has become the symbol of a vigorous new state Socialism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He carries the banner for a large , perhaps a majority , group of Italians who think that by judicious use of public monies some of the grave shortcomings of capitalism can be corrected . Capitalism in Italy , it is pointed out , has historically tended toward monopoly situations . Italians have long had to put up with big-company maneuvers which Americans , with their anti-trust laws , would not have tolerated for a day . Italian industrialists , Mattei insists , have traditionally worked on the basis of a maximum of quick profit gained on a minimum of investment . They have been unwilling to expand or to take long-term risks . The result of these characteristics , if one can believe Mattei , is that whole sections of the country and sectors of the national economy go undeveloped . " When ENT 's synthetic-rubber plant was built , there arose a cry that I was invading a field of endeavor that should have been left to private initiative , " Mattei says . " But why ? Private capitalism has had decades in which to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mattei is no Communist , but his one trip to Red China and his several trips to Soviet Rus added to his conviction that countries like Italy must make long-term and sometimes even u profitable investments out of public funds . Other wise , he is convinced , the Socialist countries will overtake the West in industrial production . A S CAN well be imagined , this sort of thinking , backed by action , has made Mattei a highly controversial as well as a dynamic figure . Most of the international oil companies decided long ago that Mattei was unreliable and declined to cut him in on their deals . The - Italian industrialists are not too interested in oil , but they feel quite differently when Mattei goes into the fertilizer or the electric-power business . In a phrase , they . are not amused Asa result , several deputies have made it their business to heckle the government regularly about ENI operations . The late and venerated Reverend Senator Luigi Sturzo , for example , devoted a good part of the last decade of his life to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that it was bad economics but that the growth of an organism like ENI was in the long run a threat to political liberty . Critics of Mattei have both disliked what he stands for and at the same time have deprecated his ability . He has been called a bad businessman , an incompetent executive , an arrogant dreamer . Some opponents have even called him a madman . The Confederation of Industry , the Italian counterpart of the National Association of Manufacturers , maintains an entire office devoted to a minute study of ENI operations and is ready at any given moment to prose the unsoundness of most of ENI 's subsidiary corporations . The Italian press , mostly owned or controlled by industry , has kept up a steady barrage of criticism based on these studies . The usual line of attack on Mattei is the simple one that anybody can make a go of a business that can draw on the public treasury at will , that does not have to satisfy shareholders , and that , above all , is exempt from the taxes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will answer this argument by pointing out that , outside of an original sinking fund of $48 million , Mattei has never come back to the government for money , not even for the costly fertilizer and synthetic-rubber plant . True , he has had luck . Early in his career of government servant his geologists hit what was  | Europe 's lushest field of natural gas . By piping this gas into big industrial plants in Milan and Turin and Genoa , as well as bottling it to sell to housewives , Mattei was soon netting an average of $75 million annually . Mattei 's own private joke , in fact , has been that he has forced private industry to finance his public works . Not even the most ardent Mattei man could deny that there are some things in the ENI operation which seem , at the very least , questionable for a public-owned outfit . For example , long ago it was established beyond doubt that ENI 's books had been juggled to cover all sorts of extracurricular activities and unapproved expenditures . Newspapers and magazines ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly . Last year Mattei was caught with the shares of an ambitious journalistic venture , 11 Gunn() of Milan , virtually in his pockets . A loud cry was raised in Parliament , after which red-faced government spokesmen were constrained to divulge the details of a deal involving , briefly , the timely purchase and timelier sale of a very valuable piece of land which , Mattei had been in a position to know , was about to become the terminus of the Milan-Naples Thruway . Profits of $40 million were turned over to 11 Giorno . Nobody with even the most rudimentary knowledge of politics in Italy would deny that Mattei has in late elections virtually financed Italy 's ruling Christian Democratic party . The Milanese contingent of the party belongs 100 per cent to Mattei . In fact , Mattei 's Milan headquarters , a huge complex of striking new glass skyscrapers called Metanopoli , has been cynically referred to as the " real capital of Italy . " One of the most controversial features of Mattei 's activities is that he is constantly playing footsie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending public money is most attractive . With the support of the solid left , added to that of a big faction of his own party , Mattei has become virtually a law unto himself . Nowadays he hardly bothers to get government approval . One of his biggest and costliest projects ? an oil pipeline starting from Genoa and going first to Switzerland and then to southern Germany ? has been started without even one " Whatdo-you-think-of-it ? " toward the government . The entire system of pipelines for natural gas was laid out and constructed without so much as a look at local ordinances . Farmers ' fields were dug up and divided , whole streets of towns and cities were torn up . bridges were constructed over treams , all on Mattei 's own authority . At BY ROBERT NEVILLE 81 Cremona the Mayor awoke one morning to find a ditch two feet wide had been dug halfway through the center of the town overnight . He thereupon raised a howl so fearful that Mattei quickly appeared on the scene , apologized , and even offered to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of this interview the Mayor was pleading with Mattei please to continue and finish the work and not leave a gaping ditch in his town . A government committee of five ministers is supposed to supervise Mattei 's activities , but in practice rarely does . There exists in the ministries a tacit understanding to let Mattei go pretty much where he wants . Mattei 's mandate must be renewed ? by the committee of ministers ? every three years , but so strong is his position , that not even recent governments of rather conservative complexion have dared deny him his job . Quite possibly any government that would do so would fall . At the very least it would be inviting trouble . Mattei adherents will frankly admit , in private , most of the bad things said about the boss , but they will at the same time insist that he is only playing politics as they must be played to survive in the Italy of today . ENI has become a political as well as an economic operation . To run ENI properly the president must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattei waited to get government permission to build things , nothing would ever get built . He must somehow wangle Parliamentary approval , by means fair or foul . Private industry in Italy also notoriously juggles its books and subsidizes politicians ; why not public industry too ? When in the jungle live by the rules of the jungle . THE DOGGED FISHER WHAT kind of man is this who has bebecome the darling of public ownership advocates and at the same time the villain of the private enterprisers ? Mattel 's strongest characteristic is his incredible drive backed by a relentless will power . He is all work and practically no play . When not rushing to Cairo or London or Munich on a quick business chore , he spends a good fourteen or sixteen hours daily at his desk in a plain modest office at general ENI headquarters on Via Tevere in Rome . Even at meals there is usually no letup . To the obvious distress of his most patient Viennese wife , Mattei wants to talk business with associates and employees even when eating lunch and dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little other talk . A very unlettered man , he can not even be called self-taught . He knows next to nothing about modern history , literature , or religion . He has a liking , curiously enough , for abstract art in its wildest phases , and he buys such pictures by the dozens for his offices , but when asked why , he merely replies : " I just like them . " He never reads a book and will only skim through certain newspapers . His vocabulary is quite limited . Except on his own narrow subject , Mattei is most inarticulate . Mattei has almost no social life . Cocktail parties , the specialty of the Eternal City , are not for him . The only times he accepts an invitation out are those rare occasions when good friends like the Shah of Iran or the King of Morocco or President Bourguiba of Tunisia are passing by and are being feted . Mattei does not even maintain a home at Rome , instead putting up in a permanently rented suite at the Hotel Eden . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sport which interests him is troutfishing , and this he does with a real concentration . He thinks nothing of walking fifteen miles or so up and clown a trout stream in the course of a ten-hour day in the open . His wife used faithfully to accompany him on these expeditions , but has in recent years had to beg off . A non-smoker and non-drinker , the Mattei constitution is , in a word , robust . Let Mattei get near a good sports store and he can not resist the temptation to enter and buy artificial flies . Mattei is also a demon traveler . He flies to Milan from Rome and back as easily as most people would go downtown . Some weeks he makes this trip as often as six or seven times . If he wants to see King Mohammed V of Morocco or the head of the Krupp works in Germany , Mattei will fly there in the morning , do his business , and fly right back in the afternoon . ENI 's air fleet , incidentally , consists of seven airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ordered for the boss 's use , putting him right up there in the class of the really big capitalists . Mattei 's salary , incidentally , is nominal , and he turns even that little over to a war orphans ' home and lives , instead , on an expense account . Mattei 's decisions are strictly his own , arrived at generally through a long process of thinking things through . He has assistants , but no real associates . He is not one to discuss matters , nor does he like to have people around who contradict him . It has been said that only one man , the late Senator Ezio Vanoni , former Minister in various postwar governments , has ever been able to say " No " to Mattei . In fact , it is generally believed that Vanoni , the former Socialist turned Christian Democrat , inspired Mattei with the original idea of using AGIP profits to establish government-owned industry . It was also Vanoni who apparently first thought up the idea of creating ENI . Wherever the influence comes from , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They are quite frequently in the dark about crucial decisions . They are also sq generally overloaded with detail work that it is harder to see them than to see the big boss himself . @# CLIMBING PERILOUSLY F E W men have risen so high on so little as Enrico Mattei . Born fifty-four years ago in a very small town on the Adriatic side of Italy , Mattei was the eldest son in a family of seven children . His father was a noncommissioned carabiniere officer whose maximum pay in those years was $50 monthly . Enrico planned to go to college and get a degree , but he soon abandoned the idea as impractical and at fourteen set out to work . He thus never went beyond elementary school . The title of " engineer , " which in later years Mattei was so proudly to put in front of his name ( Italians are congenitally fond of titles ) , was an honorary one bestowed on him in 1953 by the Turin Institute of Technology . Mattei 's first job was painting bedsteads , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , he rose from apprentice to general manager . By the tame he was twenty-three , the Adriatic Coast had become much too restricted an area for this energetic young man . He transferred his activities to his dream city of Milan , and within a few years he had set himself up in his own business of producing chemicals used in tanneries and textiles . By the time he had reached his middle thirties Mattei had acquired the status of a well-to-do Milanese manufacturer . The war changed much in Italy . A nominal  | member of the Fascist party ? probably by necessity ? Mattei broke with the tottering regime and joined the Resistance . He was unusual among top Partisan leaders in being neither a Communist nor a Socialist . Arrest and dramatic escape interrupted his work for the Allied cause , but at the end of the war General Mark Clark pinned the Silver Star on his chest . Elected a deputy to the postwar Parliament , Mattei was appointed by the new democratic government to perform the onerous task of liquidating an old Fascist state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters which in due time was to become quite famous . AGIP had been started by Mussolini 's government to prospect for oil and gas ( mineral rights in Italy have long been reserved to the state ) ; but in fifteen years of activity it had found little or nothing and still was costing the state considerable money . Offered for sale , it attracted no bidders , and the decision had been forthwith made to abandon it . At this point Mattei entered the picture . He knew little about oil or natural gas , but he allowed himself to be persuaded by personable young geologists on the spot that the government 's decision was quite wrong . Communications between north and south in Italy in those postwar times were not very good , nor was the chain of command from the ministry clown very clearly established . It was a bit risky , but not really dangerous , to ignore orders from above and do the very opposite of what he had been told to do . With a couple of superannuated drilling rigs , a determined Mattei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lucky man had found natural gas in terrific quantities . The find would be enough to supply , even in this postwar period of prosperity , a good 17 or 18 per cent of Italy 's total fuel needs . Moreover , it would save Italy an average of something like $150 million yearly in foreign exchange normally used to buy coal and oil abroad . Present reserves are estimated to last , at the present rate of consumption , for another twenty years . Mattei was sitting on top of the world . Nobody in Rome was gauche enough to remember his act of disobedience . Meanwhile , the foreign oil companies , mainly those of the United States , perked up at this discovery of natural gas and began ' putting in bids for oil concessions . Mattei quickly responded with a bill which excluded all but himself from prospecting in the Po Valley . Later he was to make it tough , although not impossible , for outsiders to drill in any part of the Italian mainBY ROBERT NEVILLE 83 land . ( They were still able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to think that the presence of such quantities of gas plainly indicated oil in the vicinity , but curiously enough Mattei has found only negligible quantities of it in the Po . His enemies have frequently sneered that he is simply incapable of finding oil . Considering the record , Mattei should not have been too surprised at the reply he got when he asked the international oil combine to cut him in , even for as little as 2 per cent , on the postMossadegh deal for the Abadan refinery and concession . The combine 's loud " No ! " was to be repeated several years later when he also wanted a piece of Libya . This not only hurt Mattei , but made him angry to boot . In one of his few public outbursts of temper he called the Big Seven* of oil " nasty " and went on to say that to treat Italy , a faithful Atlantic Pact partner , in that manner was " thoroughly shameful . " Soon he was planning sweet revenge . In 1957 , he negotiated an oil concession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual 50-50 basis , he wrote an agreement for a 75-25 division between Iran and ENI . The Big Seven tried so hard to prevent the signing of this concession that the Shah of Iran reprimanded them for their " open , constant , and heavy-handed interference . " Having accomplished that , Mattei now began traveling about Africa and the Mediterranean offering similar deals here and there . Nasser of of Egypt eagerly took him up , and so did Bourguiba of Tunisia and Mohammed V of Morocco . Ditto too , for Somaliland and the Sudan . Eventually Mattei even got his Libyan concession , again on 75-25 terms . All this while Mattei was entering the marketing field in a big way . The AGIP filling stations , found in every nook and corner of the Italian peninsula , are lavish pieces of architecture ? smart , colorful , spacious . They were the first in Italy to have clean rest-rooms and free showers , and recently they have added such conveniences as bars and restaurants . As a result , AGIP outsells all other brands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T winter Mattei working through AGIP forced the pace on the price of gasoline and oil . Not having enough crude oil for all his refinery needs , he made a deal with the Russians which gave him around two million tons extra ' Standard of New Jersey , Standard of Indiana , Standard of California , the Texas Company , Gulf , British Petroleum , and Shell .  | annually . The price paid for this fuel was never disclosed , but oil men in Rome believe it was at least 20 per cent , and possibly 40 per cent , lower than Mattei would have had to pay the Big Seven for it . Having thus assured himself of this supply , Mattei reduced the basic price of refined oil to the lowest in Europe . The international oil cornpa nies began complaining about losing something like $20 million on retail sales alone in Italy . They contended that Mattei was also losing money , but that he covered his losses with the usual fat profits on natural gas . Mattei 's reply to this was that the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinted about more cuts to come . Such companies as Esso , Mobil Oil , British Petroleum , and Shell , all of which retail in Italy , have long suspected that Mattei 's real objective was to run them out of business on the peninsula . Perhaps even more important , however , are Mattei 's more recent marketing activities throughout Europe , Asia , and North Africa , where he is now getting set to give his enemies , the oil companies , a real run for their money . A system of AGIP filling stations either has already been built or will soon be built in Egypt , Tunisia , Morocco , Sudan , Austria , Switzerland , Germany , and even Great Britain . A few weeks ago he moved into the Indian market . If Mattei begins slashing prices in all these countries the present price war in Italy will look like a Sunday school picnic by comparison . Playing the international game of oil is one thing ; bucking the Italian industrialists on their own home ground is quite another and infinitely more dangerous game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most electrical goods , for example , have long been in the hands of corporations largely owned by the state . But most of these state-owned outfits have lost rather than made money , and at best have avoided direct competition with private industry . Certainly none has had the benefit of anything approaching the dynamic talents of Mattei . Matters first big sortie into industry , as distinguished from the gas and oil business , came when he decided to build a 5150 million fertilizer and synthetic-rubber plant at Ravenna . His nominal justification for this project , not widely believed , was that only in this ' way could he find use for a surplus supply of natural gas he had brought in near Ravenna . Whatever the real m otive , an immediate howl of protests , led by the great chemical firm of Montecatini , arose . The outraged howling increased as Mattei began slashing prices and breaking up the old fertilizer monopoly . At the same time all sorts of statistics were paraded to prove that Ravenna could never , never be an economic success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should not , for example , Mattei charge himself the same rate he charges private industry for the natural gas he uses ? Otherwise , contend the industrialists , it would be unfair . Even now , several years later , it is easy to prove that at Ravenna Mattei has not had a proper return on the lire investment . But other incalculables hard to express on the credit or debit sides of ledgers surely enter the picture . Before ENI 's plant was built Ravenna was a city living feebly off its splendid Byzantine monuments . Now it has the bustle of a very live provincial city . The unemployment slack which had plagued the town for decades has been taken up . The price of land has risen . The once dead port is now in constant use . Sometimes it would seem better to build even at too high a cost than not to build at all . SOARING INTO TROUBLE AT T E 1 'S latest project is perhaps his most interesting , if only for the impact it promises to have on an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under construction at Gela , on the southwestern tip of Sicily . The refinery will eventually take something like six million tons of crude a year , the chemical plant will produce all of Italy 's asphalt needs and fertilizers and plastic materials besides , and an electricity generating plant will supply not only Gela but much of occidental Sicily with cheap power . All this is estimated to cost $200 million , a truly whopping sum for any city in the Italian South and stupendous for poverty-stricken Sicily . Gela has a long , illustrious , and tragic history dating back to the sixth century , B.C. , when it formed a part of Magna Graecia . Its chief claim to fame in recent years , however , is that it is a sad example of Sicily 's pervading poverty . With a total of 52,000 inhabitants , it hardly has the facilities of a village of a thousand in the United States . Its streets are largely unpaved . Few houses have running water . Donkeys and chickens normally sleep in the same room with the family . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Illiteracy is rated at about 60 per cent of the population above six years old . Unemployment is put at 4,000 ; underemployment at 14,000 . A man who can earn as much as $20 monthly at Gela is considered lucky . In  | recent elections at Gela the Communists have been gaining dramatically . All sorts of schemes have been tried to relieve this situation ? agrarian reform , a special Southern Development Fund , special tax rebates for industry . But they have made little impact . What Gela needed was jobs , and permanent jobs at that . And this is precisely what the new ENI plant promises to give ? something like 2,500 of them at good pay . Again , all sorts of criticisms have been made . 11d-rough AGIP found oil in great quantity in the valley above Gela , the quality was so poor that it was considered hardly salable . Why , oh Idly , it was asked in Parliament , try to produce more oil when there is already a glut on the market ? The Gela oil , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many by-products Mattei intends to extract . But Sicily already has , , pen sulfur mines galore . In fact , working conditions in those mines have long been a scandal . Largely because of antiquated machinery , Sicilian sulfur has cost at least twice what it brings on the world market . The differences until now have been made up by a benevolent government my ing at all costs to keep men at work . But now comes Mattei with assurances that he can produce his sulfur at world prices and still make a profit . The open sulfur mines as they are now worked seem doomed , and again the cry of unfair competition is raised . The same thing happens with Edison of Italy when Mattei sets out to produce cheap current . Mattei seems by and large impervious to all these arguments . If he comments at all , it is merely to mumble that his critics seem to be living in another age . But he does realize that in Gela he has really taken on a big job . One difficulty is that he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gela promises to be higher than can be justified by any foreseeable return . But any price would seem justified if only at long last the old vicious circle of ignorance , poverty , and crime in South Italy could be broken . If Mattei can do that , he will have left his indelible mark on his country . One eminent writer on economic subjects , with a long liberal record in Italian affairs , when asked to weigh the good in Mattei versus the bad , summarized this way : In his activities within Italy Mattei has been brilliantly useful , but in his foreign ventures he is dangerous . This writer liked Mattei when he was producing cheap bottled gas for the Italian housewife , when he was undercutting established monopolies in fertilizers , when he produced cheaper current for everybody , and when he built model filling stations here , there , and everywhere . He even admired the way Mattei by-passed governmental bureaucracy , and he was not too disturbed by Matters methods of buying popular support . After all , he reasoned , the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed another matter . In making his deals with Arab countries and Russia the ENI boss had definitely tried to influence the Italian Foreign Office . For a time last winter Italy was making up to the Soviet Union in a manner quite unbecoming an Atlantic Pact partner , all because of Mattei . And this fall he consummated a bigger-than-ever new deal with Moscow which brings a total of three million tons of crude into Italy at a discount of around 40 per cent , at the same time that Mattei sells the Russians steel piping . The trouble , however , is that no political force is in sight capable of stopping Mattei . And past efforts to get or even to contain him have failed . Once Mattei would have been glad to become a member of the international oil club ; now you could n't drag him in . The probabilities are that the oil companies and the Italian industrialists are simply going to have to get used to living in the same world with Enrico Mattei for many long years to come . @# Harper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
