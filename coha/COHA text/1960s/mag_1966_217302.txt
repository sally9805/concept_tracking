The disappearance of a British colony has always been marked by the pomp and panoply of Britain 's imperial traditions . A member of the royal family usually flew out to hand over the articles of independence . The governor general was on hand in his gold-braided uniform and cocked hat . Tribal dancers exploded in bare-breasted ecstasy . Then , promptly at midnight , bullnecked district officers wept openly as a bugle sounded and the Union Jack came down . <P> Last week , with the fall of the ultimate symbol of Britain 's once great empire , there was no bugle , no ceremony , no tears . Workmen simply replaced the sign on the Colonial Office 's old headquarters near Whitehall with one reading " Commonwealth Office . " <P> Colonial Reminder . At the zenith of Britain 's imperial power in the late 1800s , the Colonial Office ruled more than 100 colonies in every quarter of the globe . It might , in fact , have ruled more , but the office got off to a bad start . It was created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements in the Western Hemisphere . After the American colonists revolted-partly in protest against the unenlightened policies of Colonial Secretaries-the Colonial Office was abolished for nearly 75 years , and its functions reverted to other ministries . When the Colonial Office was formally re-established in 1854 , a portrait of George Washington was whimsically hung over the fireplace in the Colonial Secretary 's office as a reminder of the mistakes of his predecessors . <P> Not all Colonial Secretaries could keep track of their far-flung charges . A lady at a London banquet in 1852 once asked Colonial Secretary John Pakington where the Virgin Islands were . He is supposed to have replied imperiously : " As far as possible , my dear lady , from the Isle of Man . " A President of the Orange Free State in South Africa reported his experience in 1876 with another Colonial Secretary who " unfolded a pocket map and begged that I would point out to him where the Orange Free State was . " <P> The job itself has less glamour-and more administrative headaches-than most Cabinet posts , but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Colonial Secretary when the job was still under the War Office . Winston Churchill was Under Secretary from 1906 to 1908 and steered through Commons a bill granting self-rule to the recently defeated Boers in South Africa . Reginald Maudling served as Colonial Secretary before he became Harold Macmillan 's Chancellor of the Exchequer . The present Secretary is Fred Lee , 60 , who last week was in the Southwest Pacific on a trip to British territories that no other Colonial Secretary had ever before visited . <P> Out of Business . While the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretaries made the sweeping decisions that extended the British realm , the Colonial Office minded the less dramatic chores of the empire . It set up the famed London School of Tropical Medicine , waged successful wars against malaria and the tsetse fly . Under its direction , Britain became the first modern nation to extend developmental aid to backward areas of the world , and its officers helped train a substantial segment of the world in methods of administering government and running essential health , educational and financial services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
