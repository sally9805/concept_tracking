About the Tea-Fed Tiger <P> Sir : <P> If Krishna Menon ( Feb. 2 ) told your reporter that Theosophy did not appeal to him , this is a complete misstatement of fact . He was an active Theosophist until he was well into his 30s . For some time he was an active organizer and propagandist for the Theosophical Society , as well as a propagandist for Mrs. Besant 's Home Rule Party , which was opposed to Gandhi 's and young Nehru 's party in its basic policy of achieving independence through constitutional reform . <P> When Krishna Menon perceived that Mrs. Besant 's movement was dying , as she herself was , he went over to the more extreme , aggressive Gandhi group . It was as a leader of one of Mrs. Besant 's troops of Indian Boy Scouts that he got his start in public life as a Boy Scout commissioner . <P> My interviews with Krishna Menon ( I am writing a biography of Mrs. Besant ) confirm Honor Balfour 's minority impression . He was friendly , cooperative and informative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you are in politics , you often have to do things to other people which you would n't want them to do to you . " <P> ARTHUR H. NETHERCOT <P> Professor <P> Northwestern University <P> Evanston , Ill . <P> Sir : <P> As my father 's patient , Mr. Menon would come quite often to visit us in years past . He was always very kind to us , but his favorite trick was to lure us close to him with a friendly smile , hook our necks with his cane and draw us close , saying , " Now I 've got you ; what are you going to do about it ? " <P> Of course , nothing could be done , and , as a result , I sympathize very strongly with Goa and the other objects of his colonialist policy ; he 's a very strong man . <P> BILL HITZIG <P> Harvard University <P> Cambridge , Mass . <P> TIME in Turkish <P> Sir : <P> Hrriyet , the Turkish newspaper with the largest circulation , has printed a translated summary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 26 on its front page , along with a picture of the Salan cover portrait . <P> This story , to my view , is one of the best prepared in TIME 's history , and I have been a regular reader since my school days . <P> We Turks are closely interested in the Algerian situation . We should like to see this problem solved through peaceful negotiations . The blood that is spilt in Algeria causes us anxiety and bitter grief . This is the reason why we have reprinted your article . <P> NECATI ZINCIRKIRAN <P> Managing Editor , Hrriyet <P> Istanbul <P> Sir : <P> Despite the provocative conclusions you draw from half-digested facts concerning the S.A.O . in Algeria , history will accord much value to the peace , order and enlightenment brought to millions of Africans and Asians by the colonial policies of Britain , France and the U.S. <P> Far from deriving any practical benefit from their " free " status , the peoples of Indo-China , the Congo , India , and the Indies have reaped instead a harvest of civil strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cf these lands from Western administration has led to Communism and anarchism.
