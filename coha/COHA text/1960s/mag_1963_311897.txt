Architect 's Art <P> Sir : <P> We applaud your magazine for the great tribute you have paid to Minoru Yamasaki Jan. 18 by adding him to your previous selections of Distinguished Architects Frank Lloyd Wright , Edward Stone and Le Corbusier . And thank you for placing it under Art , where architecture belongs , as it is and always has been a fine art . Mies van der Rohe and Bunshaft come under engineering and IBM machines . And I. M. Pei belongs under water . <P> <P> HELMUT AJANGO Designer <P> Ajango &; Butts <P> Fort Atkinson , Wis . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I would like to add something that Yama once said about his profession : " An architect , to implement our way of life , must recognize those human characteristics we cherish most : Love , Gentility , Joy , Serenity , Beauty and Hope . " <P> EARL L. PRICE <P> Managing Editor <P> Architectural Beacon <P> New York City <P> <P> Sir : <P> It is good to see you give up your long-term " Hate Detroit " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the Wayne State University campus , of the new gas building , and of the booming auto business . Your excellent color shots of Yamasaki 's new buildings in Detroit are much appreciated . <P> JAMES C. TRIMBLE <P> Boulevard Congregational Church of Detroit <P> Detroit <P> <P> The Contributors <P> Sir : <P> What scares me about that $53 million ransom for the Bay of Pigs prisoners Jan. 11 is not that Castro blackmailed the U.S. Government , but that the U.S. Government blackmailed U.S. corporations into " donating " the $53 million . <P> GILBERT CHAMBERS <P> St. Petersburg , Fla . <P> <P> Sir : <P> In your issue of Jan. 4 , you state in your lead story on the ransomed Cuban patriots that " they were particularly instructed to stay silent about the last-minute U.S. refusal to provide expected air cover , " etc . <P> Where did that idea and order originate , and why was the dirtiest doublecross in the whole history of civilization so censored ? It seems to me that the answer to these questions is an urgently important part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled . <P> STERLING BEESON <P> Toledo <P> &gt; The order originated with Kennedy Administration staffers managing the ransom operation , and was delivered to the released prisoners , after they had boarded aircraft bound for the U.S. , by men who had been freed from Cuban prisons earlier. - ED . <P> <P> Twisted <P> Sir : <P> To your reviewer 's " nothing painful , nothing real " about Oliver ! Jan. 11 , I would add-thank goodness ! When I attend a musical , I want light entertainment , not painful soul searching . After seeing Oliver ! , I left the theater pleasantly entertained and in a far better , happier mood than before the performance . Oliver ! , in my opinion , was twisted just right . <P> EDWARD A. ROSENBLUM <P> Cedarhurst , N.Y . <P> Tax Talk <P> Sir :
