txt The City Planning Commission recommended an $872.5-million capital budget to Mayor Lindsay yesterday . The figure was $118.7-million less than the $991.2-million budget submitted by the commission last year . Part of the decline results from a simple bookkeeping change that lists more than $70-million in City University construction funds outside the main budget . But part of it also reflects the fact that less money is available through borrowing and from Federal and state grants . The recommended capital budget  --  which pays for major construction , equipment purchases and maintenance ? represents less than half the $1.7-billion requested by the city agencies that will spend the money . Traditionally , capital budgets rise as they move toward final approval . Last year the final figure was $1,059,000,000 . Further Approval Needed The next step for the 1968-69 capital budget is for Mayor Lindsay to add any of his own modifications and to submit the budget to the Board of Estimate and the City Council by Feb. 1 . One of the economies made by the commission could be reversed by then . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program in the commission 's primary draft . That program involves building public housing in small units , to fit in with existing neighborhoods , rather than massive developments that tend to create their own ghettos . It also provides funds to build middleincome housing , so middle-income people will not leave the city but remain and provide leadership in their communities . Model Cities is one of the administration 's key programs , and the Mayor pressed hard for and finally won a restoration last year of the $10-million that the Board of Estimate and the City Council had cut from the $25-million proposed then . The commission 's vice chairman , Lawrence M. Orton , said // yesterday that the Mayor was aware of the Model Cities cut . But a press aide to the Mayor said later that while Mr. Lindsay was aware of it , he " did not approve it . " The Mayor himself was away yesterday on a skiing vacation in Vermont . Mr. Orton said the cut had been made to allow for other increases that the commission felt were more imperative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $865.4-million , some $7-million less than its final recommendation yesterday . The Model Cities cut and several other smaller cuts -- In funds for air-conditioning city buildings and for new approaches to the Brooklyn Bridge , for example ? were made to kee pthe budget from going even higher . The increases the commission felt were necessary on top of last month 's tentative budget involved items ranging from new trucks for the Sanitation Department to a crash program for hospital modernization . Some Increases Made The commission took the following actions : git doubled the $3-million allocation to the Sanitation Department for the purchase of more equipment , particularly collection trucks and sweepers . Part of this need , it was explained , stems from the increasing deterioration of the department 's current fleet and part from the increased refuse load resulting from the shutting down of apartment-house incinerators to curb air pollution . git added $2-million to the $10-million previously earmarked for the modernization of city hospitals to provide for a crash program of upgrading . tin increased funds for the narcotics treatment program by $1-million to provide shelters for addicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated to the Highways Department for paving the city 's streets . tilIt provided $1.2-million for equipment for the New York Community College in downtown Brooklyn . This would release matching funds from the state . gIf allocated $9-million for the development of the Hunt 's Point food-processing distribution center in the Bronx . The funds are to prepare the site and construct the first building . It restored $2.9-million that had been cut from the . Department , of Marine and Aviation 's request to build a small airport for private airplanes in the Fresh Kills section of Staten Island 's West Shore . The airport is expected to help divert private craft from the busy commercial airports in the metropolitan area . The city has less money for its new capital budget  --  which covers the year beginning July 1 ? because of several factors . For one thing , there has been a tapering off of state funds for sewers and Federal funds for highways . In addition Mayor Lindsay decided not to borrow up to the limit . This move , to make the city 's bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . The capital , or construction , budget is not to be confused with the much larger expense , or operating , budget . This will be submitted later by the Mayor . The current expense budget is $5.2-billion.
