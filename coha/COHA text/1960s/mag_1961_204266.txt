Hollywood , after years of profitably cranking out fodder to feed TV 's terrible tapeworm , has almost relegated the theatrical film- once its 18-carat bread and butter-to the limbo of relics along with the two-reel comedy and the Mighty Wurlitzer . Last week filmdom 's labor leaders , in an effort to lock the studio door after the horse opera had gone , enlisted the aid of the House Subcommittee on the Impact of Imports and Exports on American Employment to do something about the problem of " runaways " - films made overseas by U.S. companies . The hard fact : of the 38 American films currently shooting , 20 will be made wholly or in part away from Hollywood . <P> U.S. companies have been making pictures abroad in increasing numbers for a variety of reasons . Among them : they cost less , foreign governments subsidize them lavishly , and authentic locales have become important for audiences conditioned to television 's you-are-there immediacy . U.S. extras get about $25 a day for doing what an Italian extra would do for $5 . <P> Star witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who flew in from Hollywood to testify as vice president of the Screen Actors Guild . Heston insisted that , personally , he much preferred working in the comfortable U.S. to " climbing Mount Sinai barefoot " or " riding hour after hour in a chariot in the vicinity of Rome . " But many of the films cited by the complaining unions " could n't have been made at all if they had not been made abroad . " In fact , the runaways were helping Hollywood stay in business . Ben-Hur , he argued , saved M-G-M from bankruptcy . But if it had been made in Hollywood , it would have cost prohibitively more than the $14.5 million it cost to make in Rome .
