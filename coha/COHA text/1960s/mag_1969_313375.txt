THE spy came in from the damp , striding briskly from his chauffeur-driven Rover 2000 , whuppa-da-whupp through the revolving door into the Victorian lobby of Brown 's Hotel , Dover Street , London W.I. To an experienced counterespionage agent , his disguise probably would have appeared too perfect , and therefore suspicious . But there were no M15 types on duty at Brown 's - only a myopic receptionist too vain to wear her National Health Service spectacles and a concierge who had been with the house for 43 years and certainly knew a well-to-do Yank tourist when he saw one : blue suit , rep tie , white handkerchief folded so that exactly half an inch protruded from the breast pocket ; razor-cut hair , a bit dark for his age , and well-manicured fingers and lacquered nails clutching a copy of Fielding 's Travel Guide to Europe . <P> In the lobby , the spy paused to scuff at a frayed carpet edge with the toe of one glossy , custom-made Irish brogan . He sniffed the air . His glance shifted to the flowers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small room . Tilting his head back , he peered at the ceiling plaster and moldings . Finally , almost diffidently , he walked up to the counter and cleared his throat . " Yes , sir ? What can I do for you ? " inquired the receptionist . The spy plunked Fielding 's Travel Guide down on the counter . " My name , " he announced , " is Temple Fielding . I happen to write this book here . Perhaps you 've heard of it . I wonder if I could see the manager . " <P> Temple Fielding ! The receptionist turned and fled to an inner office , looking for someone in authority . Fielding had blown his cover . In the multilingual world of espionage , the professionals call it hosen herunterlassen-literally , dropping one 's trousers . Fielding could hardly have caused more of a flurry at Brown 's if he had literally done so . No wonder . An estimated 2,000,000 Americans will visit Europe this year , and an impressive number of them will follow a trail carefully blazed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. guidebook writers . <P> More than 100,000 will pay $7.95 for the latest edition of his Guide , a 1,485-page , 909,000-word primer for peripatetics that weighs 2 lbs . 3oz . Another 100,000 budget-minded tourists will spend $2.25 for Fielding 's Super-Economy Europe ; the rest of the Fielding five-foot shelf ( he is his own publisher ) includes a European shopping guide , time and currency converters and a guidebook to the Caribbean . Temp operates Temple Fielding 's Epicure Club - which , for $15.50 a year , guarantees the insecure traveler a somewhat phony VIP welcome at any of 29 top European restaurants , plus free cocktails for two . Other business deals are in the offing , including a possible U.S. television series on travel , to be hosted by himself . All of this earns Fielding a yearly income that is over $100,000 , and climbing . <P> <P> The G.P. Who Understands <P> In the 22 years since his first Guide was published , " the normal Mr. and Mrs. Smith of Middletown , U.S.A. " to whom it is frankly addressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler 's Dr. Spock-a role he relishes . " If Temp has a cause , and I think he has one , " says his chief assistant , Joe Raff , " it is to ease the passage of the traveler , to assuage his doubts . He 's
