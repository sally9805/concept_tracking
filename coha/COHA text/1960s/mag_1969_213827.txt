Psychologically more destructive than heroin-and now more available than marijuana-amphetamines are in many ways the most treacherous of all abused drugs . Despite the threat they pose , a recent survey by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs revealed that 92% of the speed and pep pills in illicit traffic were manufactured by legitimate U.S. drug firms . <P> At hearings in San Francisco last week , the House Select Committee to Investigate Crime began to probe the route of amphetamines from manufacturers to the streets . There emerged a frightening pattern of ineffective federal regulation , corporate negligence and complicity on the part of some drug firms that profit from the illegal trade . <P> Cranked Out . An estimated 8 billion amphetamine pills are produced each year in the U.S. Federal officials estimate that no more than half this production is routinely dispensed by medical prescription . Much of the remainder is diverted to criminal channels by loss , theft and misdirected shipments . Said Committee Chairman Claude Pepper : " It is alarming that more than half of the stimulant and depressant drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . Some drug companies make little effort to verify the legitimacy of customers who order amphetamines . As a test , Government investigators set up a fictitious company in the Midwest and received without question nearly every drug ordered from manufacturers . Michael Sonnenreich , deputy counsel of the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs , said that firms do not deliberately promote illicit traffic , but " there are so many loopholes in the existing drug abuse laws . Companies crank out enormous volumes of drugs , and they sell them to anybody who appears to be legitimate . " <P> A congressional investigator charged that 60% of the amphetamine pills exported to Mexico return to the U.S. via illegal channels . The movement of American amphetamines through Tijuana has prompted Mexican customs officials to call it " pill city . " Donald Rice , a former large-scale drug distributor , told the committee of the ease with which large quantities of amphetamines could be purchased in Mexico and smuggled back into the U.S. Rice admitted making $60,000 a year in amphetamines and said that he could not see " how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that illegitimate business is involved . " Another retired speed entrepreneur testified that he easily obtained the ingredients for making amphetamines from wholesale chemical companies . <P> Committee Chairman Pepper plans to press for legislation to limit exports and imports , to restrict sales of amphetamine ingredients , and to regulate the sale of drugmaking machinery . The committee will ask for limitation of drug production , based on medical need , and will suggest a ban on a variety of amphetamines , the dangers of which outweigh their legitimate uses . If Pepper succeeds , there will perhaps be no further shipments like the one by a U.S. company to a nonexistent street number that turned out to be the eleventh hole of a Mexican golf course . There Mexican smugglers picked up the goods for sale north of the border .
