" This is the man I would vote for as President , " boomed Toastmaster Roger Main , a banker and Democrat , at a banquet in Jacksonville , Fla . " But since he is not a candidate , I intend to vote for his candidate . " Up rose the audience to give a standing ovation to the toastmaster 's hero , Republican Senator Barry Morris Goldwater of Arizona. * In mostly Democratic Jacksonville , many Democrats were among the 500 who had paid $25 each into the Republican campaign fund to hear Goldwater tell them to vote for Dick Nixon . In dozens of other cities and hamlets from South Carolina to Georgia to Florida last week , crowds were also large and enthusiastic , and Goldwater 's message was the same : " Do n't kid yourself that Jack Kennedy has any love for the South . Do n't vote for the Democrats just because your grandfather did . Vote Republican ! Just try it once-you 've no idea how good you 'll feel in the morning . " <P> Handshakes &; Autographs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to play upon the South 's strong conservative feelings-in foreign relations , human relations , federal controls and states ' rights . " There 's hardly enough difference between the Republican Conservatives and the Southern Democrats to put a piece of paper between , " he says . How many Southern voters Goldwater swings is debatable , but there is no question that many want to hear him . The G.O.P. 's high command receives more Southern speechmaking requests for Goldwater than for any other campaigners except Dick Nixon and Cabot Lodge . <P> An energetic stumper , Goldwater keeps rolling 18 to 20 hours a day , often piloting himself in a chartered Beechcraft . He shakes every hand in sight . He autographs copies of his bestselling Conscience of a Conservative ( now in print : 103,000 hardbacks , 400,000 softbacks ) . He was the first nationally known Republican in history to campaign in Spartanburg , S.C . last month . <P> Soft Sell &; Hard Hit . The hardshell Conservative who had angrily denounced the Rockefeller-Nixon truce before Chicago as a " Munich , " now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Republican platform is , he says , the lesser of two evils . He hard-hits Lyndon Johnson as " the forgotten candidate . " He writes off Jack Kennedy with sarcasm : " Sometimes I wonder how Jack gets that sailboat back to harbor . " <P> He calls for a tougher foreign policy , in words more violent than Nixon 's : " If it takes force to remove the Castro government , then we should use force . We can not have a Communist country 90 miles off our shore . " Federal aid to education : " The Government has no right to educate children . The family has an obligation to educate children through local school boards and local taxes . " As for federal medical aid to the aged , " If my kids do n't take care of me when I 'm old , I 'll whale the tar out of ' em . " <P> <P> * If Nixon is defeated next month , Goldwater will be available in 1964 , he told the Phoenix Press Club Forum at week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
