The sun blazes on Majorca for ten months of the year . It lights the baked forms with a harsh kind of super-reality . The sallow leaves of a dead cactus writhe upward like a petrified fountain . A palm hangs against the sky like a bursting skyrocket . On the ground , a beetle crawls . Above it , crouches a man - no figment of a dream but a com pact figure with grey thinning hair , a potato nose , and dressed all in sober brown . " Once , " he " I was passionate about insects . I painted many of them . " In fact , he still does . <P> Bach &; the Beatles . Though Joan Mir is now 75 , the freshness and fascination with which his blue eyes see the world around him have not changed . For 60 years , he has been painting these forms-sun , moon , star , woman , man , birds , flowers , sparks . Of course he paints them in his own way-and they are instantly recognized the world over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees , his images are usually a surreal shorthand . An asterisk denotes a star , a curlicue a snail , a cartoon figure with popeyes and a Minnie Mouse behind becomes a kind of Iberian Everyman . " I 'm always in a state of dreaming , " says Mir , suggesting that his night vision discerns what others can not see by day . <P> At the same time , Joan ( pronounced Jo-ahn ) Mir is wide awake .

Both the studio and the 13-room , 200-year-old stone farmhouse behind it which serves Mir as an annex , are crammed with his new paintings and sculptures .

" I 'm in a state of euphoria , " he reports , having completed more than 80 paintings and ten sculptures . Many of these go on view in a massive Mir exhibit that opens this week at the Maeght Foundation near Vence in Southern France . As always , he works , as he puts it , " in part by hazard ; the main thing is the first breath , with great attack . " <P> Erotic Whimsy . What he fails to mention are the careful preparations that come before . He sketches incessantly , in the subway and even on the airplane - as he did last month when he popped across the Atlantic to pick up an honorary degree from Harvard .
