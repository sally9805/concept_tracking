txt The Government applied new pressure today to reduce mortgage interest rates . President Kennedy announced steps being taken by I three Government agencies , starting with a one-quarterpoint cut in the ceiling on interest rates for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration . The new F. H. A. ceiling will be 51 , : i per cent , effective Monday . The F. H. A. does not lend money . It insures loans that private lenders make , and from time to time it adjusts the ceiling on interest rates they may charge for insured loans . These adjustments , by themselves , do not change what it costs to borrow money for a mortgage , but they are pressure . Thus , when the F. H. A. cut its ceiling to 512. per cent , from 5% percent four months ago , mortgage costs did not immediately drop by onequarter of 1 per cent . They have dropped in the ensuing months , however , and now the ceiling is being cut again . When the ceiling was 5% pet cent , a home buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments of $90.061 a month  --  principal , interest and ' , F. H. A. insurance premium included . With the ceiling at 51 per cent , the monthly payment dropped to $87.75 . Now , under the 5% per cent ceiling , the payments on the mortgage of the same amount and duration will be $85.59 . These figures do not take into account the common practice of discounting , where a lender lends , say , $99 and the borrower agrees to repay $100 . It is presumed that there will be some immediate discounting to compensate for the new lower F. H. A. ceiling , as there was some immediate discounting following the cut in February . Thus , the actual cost of borrowing does not drop immediately because the borrower pays in the discounting what he saves from the lower rate . Discounts Disappear As interest rates proceed downward , however , discounts disappear , and the two other actions announced by the Administration today will have direct effect on rates . First , the Federal National Mortgage Association ? commonly known as Fanny Mae ? will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . The mortgage association buys Governmentbacked mortgages from the private lenders who make them . It announced today that it would pay one point , or $1 per $100 , more for what it bought , and that will inevitably result in its buying more . It is expected that this will offset about half the discounting that results from the F. H. A. ceiling cut . Second , the Federal Home Loan Bank Board is pushing its eleven regional banks to cut the rates it charges to savings and loan associations for shortterm advances , with the pre sumption that the associations in turn will cut their rates to home buyers . Four of the home loan banks have cut their rates by one- , quarter point in the last two weeks , and others are expected to follow . House Panel Acts In Congress today , the House Banking Committee approved the multibillion-dollar housing bill that its subcommittee reported out on Wednesday . The bill is an altered version of the Administration 's proposals . But the committee 's chairman , Representative Brent Spence , Democrat of Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with White House approval . Committee Republicans , arguing that the bill violated the President 's plea for Congressional restraint on money measures , offered the Administration 's own bill as a substitute today and were defeated . The Senate Banking Committee has approved a housing bill that includes a $100,000,000 mass transit plan , which the Administration does not want right now . The over-all price ' tags on both the Senate and House bills and the Administration 's proposals are in the ' neighborhood of $4,900,000,000 . But housing bills are particularly hard to price accurately . The interest - rate actions taken by the Administration today were not its first . It cut the F. H. A , ceiling to 51/2 per cent from 5% per cent ten days after taking office and has been applying pressure to force rates down at every opportunity . The Administration is more or less convinced that general interest rates will not decline any more than they have , now that the economy has turned upward , but it is determined to see mortgage rates lower . Officials indicated , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last they planned to make . Effects of Cut In dollars and cents , the effect of the rate cut is as follows : A thirty-year , $15,000 mortgage carries monthly payments ? principal , interest and insurance ? of $90.06 at 5% per cent , $87.75 at 51 ' 2 per cent and $85.59 at 5% per cent . When the ceiling was cut to 51/2 per cent on Feb. 1 , there was some immediate discounting but it has disappeared since then with increased mortgage ' buying by . the Federal National Mortgage Association and a general slackening of rates . ' Rates on conventional uninsured mortgages have been easing , too , and now average slightly more than 6 per cent .
