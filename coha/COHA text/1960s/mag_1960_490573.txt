Notes and Comment BOUT the year , it OUT this time of new ear , is our custom to look back at the year just ended , select our worst mistake , and spend a few minutes or hours of silent regret over it It is best , we think , to go in for such recollections while in transit from one place to another . The company of persons who know nothing of what has caused one 's face to grow longer  --  persons who , in fact , are not aware that one has a face  --  is the best company on a trip of this sort . A regrettable error in one 's past life can often be dealt with satisfactorily on a bus ride up or down Fifth Avenue . Some of the errors in our own past life have seemed to require a longer trip . What we like best to do on such an occasion is to get out of town . The trains on the main line between New York and Washington have served us well for many years . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it takes longer . This year , it was unnecessary for us either to look far back or to perform the tiresome chore of deciding whether the outstanding error we had made in these columns in 1959 was small , middle-sized , large , gigantic , or a whopper . In the December 5th issue of the magazine , while undertaking a lighthearted expedition through the pages of the special issue of the London Times Literary Supplement that was devoted to the American imagination , we mistook an English lady for an American lady . It was the mistake of the year , and a whopper . Long before Christmas , a good research man came to our assistance and straightened us out on the matter . He turned a complete report over to us on the day before Christmas Eve , when we were boarding the Congressional Limited at Pennsylvania Station . We have already privately begun to refer to 1959 as the year of the two Helen Gardners For a few , hazy moments of that year , we were under the delusion that there was one Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that there were two Helen Gardners . By the time we had settled down in a quiet corner of a chair car on cur way to Washington , we could calmly , if penitently , read our assistant 's report on the two worlds of the two Helen Gardners one American and dead , the other British and alive . Both ladies proved to be important writers . And since both also proved to be widely known and distinguished scholars , and interesting people , it seems fitting that they be formally introduced within a typographical bower they can call their own . The Two Helens THE two Helen Gardners who are celebrated for their interest in the arts do not represent such totally disparate personalities as a superficial glance at the difference in their ages , nationalities , and professional fields might indicate . The British Helen was born Miss Helen Louise Gardner , and is so designated in most American libraries , a circumstance that has enabled most people to avoid confusing her with the deceased American Helen , who had no middle name or initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , now in her late eighties , lives in Chicago and is at present vacationing in Jamaica . We talked to her before she left Chicago . Her sister Helen , she told us , was born in Manchester , New Hampshire , on March 17 , 1877 , or thereabouts ( the year is not certain ) , and although she lived in Chicago most of her life , she always retained a New England accent . Having attended grammar and high schools in New England , she went the University of Chicago , where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1901 . ( She returned seventeen years later for a Master 's degree . ) Her original scholastic interests were Greek and Latin , and between 1901 and 1910 she was an instructor in these at  --  and then assistant principal of  --  the Brooks Classical School , in Chicago . It seems to have been an increasing interest in art , rather than her work with the classical languages , that impelled her to leave Brooks in 1910 for independent study . After getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Art Institute of Chicago , where she became a professor . Her department was the History of Art , and she was chairman of it from 1933 until her retirement , in 1943 . She died . on June 6 , 1946 . This Miss Gardner 's fame rests securely on her textbook " Art Through the Ages , " which was first published in 1926 and was reissued in new editions in 1936 , 1948 , and 1959 . According to her publishers , Harcourt , Brace , " Art Through the Ages " has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and is still a leading textbook in America for college courses in art history . The 1959 edition was - revised by the Department of Art History at Yale . Mr. Sumner McNight Crosby , who supervised the revision , calls Miss Gardner 's book " a favorite with generations of students in schools and colleges , " and remarks that " the general reader who is interested in the history of art has found it an exciting and informative survey . " He cites especially its author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simplicity of style . " Miss Gardner 's only other book was on art appreciation . Entitled " Understanding the Arts , " it was published by Harcourt , Brace in 1932 . Miss Gardner has been described by people who knew her as a quietly gay person who had conservative principles , a subtle sense of humor , and prodigious energy . A small , brown-eyed woman with  --  in her later years  --  pretty , gray hair , she wore glasses and enjoyed JANUARY 9 9 19GO travelling . Once , when a recording of her voice was played back to her , she was much distressed by the experience and remarked that she was glad she did n't have to listen to her own lectures . But she was an excellent , enthusiastic teacher , and , despite this displeasure with her own voice , continued to lee-tore . In fact , she was a visiting lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1927 and at the University of Chicago in 1928 . Next to Art , she loved Nature , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house on the shore of Lake Michigan . She was a member of the American Association of University Women , the American Society of Aesthetics , Midland Authors , and Phi Beta Kappa . Miss Helen Louise Gardner has the reputation of being one of Oxford University 's most distinguished women dons . She is described by her associates and friends as a woman of great wit , learning , and charm . Like the American Miss Gardner , she is noted for an immense fund of energy and a lively interest in art ( one of her papers , published in 1956 , is entitled " Milton 's First Illustrator , John Baptist Medina " ) , but her professional field is English literature  --  chiefly the work of the six teenth- and seventeenth-century English poets . Some of those poets came to New England , and she studied their work just the same . She is a friend of T. S. Eliot , an American poet who went to England and stayed there , and one of her best-known critical works is " The Art of T. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a standard reference hook in American colleges . Her other major critical works are " The Metaphysical Poets " ( 1957 ) and " The Business of Criticism " ( 1959 ) , which consists of two sets of lectures she gave in England ? " The Profession of a Critic " and " The Limits of Literary Criticism . " Both argue the necessity of a historical approach to literature , and both are pleas for a measure of skepticism toward any absolutes in interpretation . Miss Gardner 's official roles include those of Professorial Fellow of St. Hilda 's College , Oxford ; Reader in Renaissance English Literature , University of Oxford ; and Fellow of the British Academy . This Miss Gardner was born in London on February 13 , 1908 , and attended North London Collegiate School until she went to St. Hilda 's for undergraduate study , in 1926 , the same year that the American Miss Gardner published her first edition of " Art Through the Ages . " Miss Helen Louise Gardner had heard of Miss Helen Gardner before December 5 , 1959 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages " and their paths never crossed , either personally or in correspondence . Their names have caused some confusion to British librarians in the past , and Miss Helen Louise Gardner once received a phone call from a librarian in London asking her to clear up the muddle . With time , however , their relative cultural roles have become clearly distinguished , and in the catalogues of the New York Public Library and the libraries of New York University and Columbia no such confusion is evident . Somewhere along the line , Miss Helen Louise Gardner decided to scuttle her middle name , and she became Helen Gardner . She had a perfect right to do this , and it confused almost nobody . After graduating from St. Hilda 's , Miss Gardner taught at Royal Holloway College , University of London , for three years and at the University of Birmingham for seven years . She then returned to St. Hilda 's as a don . She is , just as the American Miss Gardner was , a firm believer in classical studies , and in the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisite for entrance she was instrumental in having the resolution defeated . Her speech , according to the London Times , was " a tour de force of persuasion which impressed opponents as much as it delighted supporters . " Very unlike the American Miss Gardner , the English don recognized almost from the start that she was an excellent lecturer , gifted with unusual powers of persuasion and delivery , especially for a woman , and she has given many talks over the B.B.C. During one of these talks she mentioned the name of the seventeenth-century Massachusetts poet Edward Taylor , whom she described as " a true child and heir of the English metaphysical poets and not a mere imitator . " He was English-horn but did most of . his writing after he had settled in New England . It was in our reference to her comments on Taylor that we got into trouble . Miss Gardner of Oxford resembles Miss Gardner of Chicago in being short , having gray hair , and wearing glasses . Her eyes , however , are gray-blue , not brown . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a visiting lecturer at the Unix ersity of California at Los Angeles , where the American Miss Gardner spent some time as a visiting lecturer , too . The British Miss Gardner conducted a graduate seminar in metaphysical poetry there , and also gave an undergraduate lecture course in contemporary poetry . Prominent among her achievements on the %Vest Coast was the conversion of the captain of the U.C.L.A. football team to an interest in T. S. Eliot and other modern poets . She also went on a mountain trip in the Sierra Madre , in the course of which she sat under a tree with two nuns and played the recorder . She loves Italy and she loves good food ; one of her favorite foods is scam/ ; , or Italian shrimps . Her mother , who is still alive , plays the piano very well , and used to teach it . Miss Gardner has two brothers but no sisters . At Oxford , she starts her day by taking prayers at eight . She is a devout member of the Church of England . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old churches and eating at old inns . She dresses very well , and likes American clothes . Besides being an impressive performer on the recorder , she is an excellent chess player and a connoisseur of wines . She has just been appointed a delegate of the Oxford University Press  --  the first time in its four hundred and eighty-one years that a woman has been accorded this honor . ( The delegates draft the overall policy of the Press . ) On this occasion , the London Times described her as a " finely featured and clear-cut person who gets things done . " Things she has done this past year , in addition to publishing " The Business of Criticism , " include the joint editing , with G. M. Story , of a volume of the sonnets of William Alabaster , a minor metaphysical poet , and the supervision of a hook of Elizabethan and Jacobean studies dedicated to a colleague , Professor F. P. Wilson . In 1952 , she edited the " Divine Poems " of John Donne . Her shorter papers include " Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; " Milton 's Satan and the Theme of Damnation in Elizabethan Tragedy " ( 1948 ) ; and " The Noble Moor " ( 1955 ) , a Shakespearean lecture she gave on being elected a Fellow of the British Academy . She is due for a two-term sabbatical leave this year , and hopes to complete an edition of Donne 's love poems during this time , as well as revisit Italy . Among her other future projects are critical works on Shakespeare 's tragedies , Milton 's " Paradise Lost , " and Spenser 's " Faerie Queene . " ? OVERHEARD during an intermission at the Met , one Edwardian lady to another : " %Ve were in the habit of going abroad every summer because of the mosquitoes . " Intellectual Sell THE merely impressive executive office , whether enclosed by mahogany or exposed by glass , may have had its day . Look for a trend toward bringing the product in : sporting-goods board rooms laid out to look like football stadiums , railroad board rooms suggesting Pull mans , and  --  who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloons . This insight into the future of office decor stems from a visit we made to the new executive offices and wholesale showrooms of McGregor-Doniger , Inc. , the men's-sportswear people , at 666 Fifth Avenue . Getting off the elevator at the seventh floor , as we 'd been instructed to do , we went through an anteroom containing a large McGregor-Doniger sign framed in McGregor plaid , announced ourself to a receptionist spunkily dressed in non-McGregor plaid , and soon ended up in the hands of William Doniger , the firm 's president and chief fashion designer . Mr. Doniger , an ebullient man , pointed out some samples of his wares that were on view in the reception room , and remarked that at the moment business was very outerwearsy but that , come spring , it would get sportswearsy . " On this floor , we converted the main hallways into replicas of the world 's great avenues of fashion : Via Condotti , of Rome ; Bond Street , of London ; and Princes Street , of Edinburgh , " he told us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.A. , and Scandia Way , our interpretation of a street in Stockholm . Thirty-two years ago , my father was ahead of his time when he moved the business up from Fifteenth to Thirty-first Street . Now we 've moved ahead again , and we want to be ahead in decoration as well as geography . At Thirty-first Street , we had angular modern but no motif . Let 's take the tour . " Off we went , trailing Mr. Doniger down the Via Condutti , which looked plausibly Roman and ended  --  amiably , if not accurately  --  with a reproduction of the Fountain of Trevi . Along the sides of the corridor , or street , were show windows fixed up to look like shops and displaying some of McGregorDoniger 's more Italianate offerings . Between greetings to passing colleagues , and above the din of a vacuum cleaner that seemed to he serving as the aural equivalent of motor scooters , Mr. Doniger told us that a pile of Roman coins is kept on hand , so that visiting retail-store buyers can throw a few lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountain ; any American coins thrown into it are given to the Red Cross . We then swung into University Lane . Mr. Doniger pronounced it atmospherically indistinguishable from Chapel Street , New Haven , and pointed out a couple of the shopwindows , one of which contained pre-Easter suits and the other post-Easter suits . " Here we have the horse-blanket approach , and over here the seersucker approach , " he said . " All this is n't intended to help us sell our merchandise to retailers . I can sell just as well in a phone booth , maybe better , but we 're convinced that selling is n't enough . We want to inspire the retailers with ideas on how to sell to their customers  --  that is , we want to sell intellectually . " Next , we went down lamplit Bond Street ? " Window for window , door fur dour , the real thing . Very tawny , " said Mr. Doniger  --  and turned into Scotch House Lane , which is what McGregor-Doniger has named its replica of Princes Street . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Mr. Doniger what they were doing there . " England used to own India ! " he declared triumphantly . " The Army boys brought back the material , and that was how the whole thing got started . " Silenced , we followed Mr. Doniger into a large room , which he said was called the Bagpipe Room and was used for directors ' meetings and as a clubroom . It had Madagascar-ebony walls and McGregor-plaid curtains ; among its contents were an antique Scotch liquor cabinet , which is still being used as a Scotch liquor cabinet , and an apparently operational set of bagpipes . Huge bookcases surmounted by a carved replica of the royal arms of Scotland lined the room . " Knowing our directors , I feel that they do n't want a directors ' room , they want a clubroom , " explained Mr. Doniger . We inquired whether the directors , when they declare a dividend to the merry skirl of the pipes , wear sports clothes . " Definitely not , " said Mr. D. " Other than our executive shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt with the formal appearance of a dress shirt , I 'd say that sportswear should n't be worn in New York City . Bermuda shorts and checked shirts downtown  --  not good fashion . Too relaxing-at-homey . On the other hand , we believe that a man wants to change into sportswear the minute he gets home from the office . He should have a double wardrobe . Good for morale , good for business . Nice of you to come up . Right down Scotch House Lane there to the elevators .

Please find enclosed stamps to cover the extra postage you would have to pay . Merry Christmas . No stamps were enclosed . Rock-Haunting Peterson RSSELL F. PETERSON , a mammalogist whom we first met in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papua with a great take of fauna and flora for the Museum of Natural History , is back from another Museum collecting expedition  --  four Cs months in Australia and New Guinea  --  which has yielded some twelve hundred animal specimens . " The trip was sponsored by Philip Spalding , a Wall Street broker , " Mr. Peterson said when we greeted him anew . " I had two Australian assistants  --  a herpetologist and a mammalogist  --  and an Australian cook , and we hired aboriginals from time to time . We took along a Land-Rover and a trailer , and drove thirteen hundred miles , from Brisbane to Cairns , in eastern Queensland , over a road that was torn up many tens of miles , and then we went west through open forest into an appalling desert  --  hardbaked , dead-flat stony terrain , the most desolate region you could imagine . We 'd been told that western Queensland was untouched biologically , and it was . We found some new things and extended the biological ranges of others . One of the new things was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't act like a possum in any way . He does n't live in trees and behave himself ; he haunts rocks , emerging only at night , to forage in trees . " Mr. Peterson ran into Petropseudes , unexpectedly , by haunting rocks himself . " I was in a high crevice , " he said , " shooting bats with a pistol , in a had light ( tomb bats , to he precise ; the tomb hat is sac-winged and free-tailed , and a very interesting fellow ) , when the stone above me started to bleed . In Biblical times , that would have caused quite a stir . Well , it turned out to be a rock-haunting possum who had been taking a nap ; he was ten or twenty feet up , and the crevice was so narrow I could n't reach him , but I later got six others . They are the first to be in the Museum , and I daresay the first in this hemisphere . They are considered rare even in Australia . " Another novelty was a pure-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Macroderma gips , " Mr. Peterson said . " I shot only one , but I saw three others , which escaped . You have about fifteen minutes of hat shooting every night , at twilight ; before that they 're asleep , and concealed , and after that they 're out in the dark . We had a very interesting time with snakes and lizards . Our herpetologist , William Hosmer , whom I recruited from the University of Melbourne , got an eleven foot amethystine python , and we obtained a six-foot lizard , V aranus gzgantrui  --  one of the biggest known . You usually ca n't get near these  --  they move like an express train  --  but we came across one near a river , straddling a dead crocodile that he was eating , and he was so preoccupied , and so gorged , that we were able to grab him by the tail and put him in a hag . I thought , Why not send him to the Museum alive , partly as a joke Sn we packed him in a slatted box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time , and , of course , he 'd just had the crocodile  --  and put him on an airplane at Norman-ton , in western Queensland . He went through customs in fine style and got to New York in a week . He grew fatter and fatter at the Museum , I 'm told , and after a couple of weeks he was sent to the Bronx Zoo , where , just after he was photographed , the poor chap up and died . Some sort of parasite . " Mr. Peterson sighed , and presently revealed to us that he had also had an interesting time with Mr. Hosmer . " He was tearing the hark off a dead ironwood tree , looking for lizards , " he said , " when a heavy branch fell on him , impaling his right arm . A toxic reaction set in , he ran a high temperature , and within two hours he was unconscious . We were way out in the hush the real outback . I drove Bill nine miles to a cattle station , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flying doctor from Cairns , but the wireless did n't work , so I had to drive two hundred miles up the Cape York Peninsula to the Mitchell River Hospital . This took forty hours I gave Bill antibiotics and morphine on the way  --  and when we got there , there was nobody at the hospital . No doctor , no nurse . Bill 's arm was swollen and black , and he was still unconscious . I finally reached a doctor on Thursday Island , at the tip of Cape York , by wireless ; after Pc/ described the symptoms , he said I 'd have to operate at once . He stayed on the wireless for an hour , giving instructions , while I operated . I had various surgical instruments you use in preparing specimens , and I had often done sutures on dead animals , but operating on a live friend is very different from operating on a dead animal . I administered morphine and ethyl chloride , and went three-quarters of an inch into Bill 's muscle . I was pretty scared , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave him more antibiotics , and within a week he was up and catching snakes with his other hand . " After two and a half months in northern Australia , Mr. Peterson 's group moved on to New Guinea for a few weeks more snakes , mammals , and bats , some of the last with a fiveand-a-half-foot wingspread . " I was able to make detailed field sketches of the soft parts of animals , such as ears , which dry up in preserved specimens , " he said . We asked whether he 'd lived off the land in the bush , and he said , " Some of the time . Young kangaroos and wallabies are delicious , better than venison ; sea-turtle liver is fine ; and cassowary liver is even better . But I prefer the pate at ' 21 !

In limited but adequate English , the driver told her exactly how to do it . She then pulled up in front of Trinity Church to show her cousins the graveyard , and there she ran into the Japanese again . They were taking photographs of it . They bowed , she bowed , and then she asked them if they were , by any chance , visitors . " Yes , " said the man who had spoken to her before .
