In the matted green jungles of Brazil 's primitive Amazon valley territory of Amap sits a surprising little town . With its broad , paved streets , ranch-style houses , well-stocked supermarket and air-conditioned club , it looks more like a suburb of New York or Los Angeles than a settlement in the wilderness . It is the town of Serra do Navio ( pop . 2,200 ) , and it is run by a company that has become a Latin American model of profitable cooperation between local and foreign capital . <P> The company is ICOMI ( for Indstria e Comrcio de Minrios ) , which is owned 51% by Brazilians and 49% by Bethlehem Steel Corp . ICOMI owns the exclusive rights to one of the world 's biggest known reserves of manganese ore , discovered in the Amazon Basin in 1946 . By careful planning , efficient management and plain luck , it has not only launched a highly successful mining operation but completely avoided the abuse that Brazil 's ultranationalists have heaped on other mining firms that have foreign interests . <P> ICOMI has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to make its presence felt all over Brazil . It recently joined with Sweden 's SKF to build a ball bearing plant near Sao Paulo , is making plans to expand into the sugar , plywood and palm-oil businesses . With world manganese prices once more moving up after a slump , ICOMI expects soon to have even more money for seed capital and diversification . <P> Looking to Bethlehem . After manganese was discovered in the Amazon , a mineowner named Augusto Trajano de Azevedo Antunes obtained the mining rights and began looking for foreign help to swing the operation . A number of U.S. companies turned him down , insisting on 100% of the business or nothing at all . Finally , in 1949 , Bethlehem Steel agreed to supply Antunes with financing and technical know-how in return for a minority interest . The arrangement has proved so successful that it has been imitated of ten by other mining , oil and industrial companies getting started in Brazil . <P> ICOMI laid a 122-mile railroad through the jungle , dredged a stretch of the Amazon so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The World Bank helped out with a $35 million loan ; the Export-Import Bank provided $67.5 million . Major construction was finished in 36 months instead of the projected 48 months , and the first big shipments began moving down the river and out to sea in 1957 , enabling ICOMI to cash in on the unusually high manganese prices caused by the Suez crisis . Since then , ICOMI has shipped 5,900,000 tons , grossed $224 million in all and netted between $12 million and $15 million each year . Moreover , it was able to repay its Export-Import Bank loan three years ahead of schedule .
