THE PAT HOBBY STORIES ( 159 pp. ) -F . Scott Fitzgerald-Scribner ( $3.50 ) . <P> Scott Fitzgerald wrote short stories with the speed of a tabloid rewrite man , and for the journeyman 's unvarying reason : to satisfy a desperate and constant need for money . The legend is familiar ; when dun notes piled too high during the bright , wild days with Zelda , Scott could lock himself in a room and come out next morning with a story salable at $3,500 . <P> But by the late ' 30s , Fitzgerald was living on faltering nerve and occasional movie jobs . Then in 1939 he began what were to be the last of his short stories-a series of brief burlesques about an over-the-hill Hollywood scriptwriter , Pat Hobby . The Hobby stories are no more than good copy , and occasionally , when the author 's wonderful facility wears thin , they are not even that . But their publication in hard cover rounds out the body of Fitzgerald 's work in print , and the bitter humor of the Hobby characterization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talentless Pat Hobby-his eyes are " red-rimmed " in most of the 17 stories-is part a caricature of Hollywood , part Fitzgerald making faces at the mirror . Hobby , who once drew $2,500 a week , now connives to get past the studio gatekeeper ; Fitzgerald , who once could finance a summer at Juan-les-Pins with a weekend of woodshedding , was reduced to begging Esquire Magazine Editor Arnold Gingrich : " The address is the Bank of America , Culver City , and I wish you 'd wire the money if you like this story . Notice that this is pretty near twenty-eight hundred words long . . . " <P> With each story came the desperate plea to wire money , and eventually , although Esquire paid only $250 to $350 a story , enough was wired so that years later , Fitzgerald 's daughter Scottie remembered Pat Hobby fondly enough to speak his epitaph . " He sent me to Vassar , " she said , saying it all .                  @ @ @
