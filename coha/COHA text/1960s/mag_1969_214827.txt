LETTERS FROM ICELAND by W. H. Auden and Louis MacNeice. 253 pages . Random House . $7.50 . <P> <P> Even a tourist-class guidebook-the kind written in hoked-up feature writer 's prose-furnishes vicarious travel . Letters from Iceland is a first-class VIP travel book written by two poets ; it provides not only the usual armchair transport but also a vicarious voyage into the past . <P> The period is 1936 , and those who read this minor masterpiece for the first time will be given a lively sense of what it was like to be young in that year and possessed of an eloquent dread of what the near future held . Its two gifted and high-spirited young authors-Wystan Hugh Auden and Louis MacNeice-have , in fact , put time on ice . <P> Now that future is our ruefully remembered past . Today we are threatened by fear of the Bomb ; then it was the spread of Fascism that gave the young a sense of doom and justified revolt against the Oldies : <P> Down in Europe Seville fell Nations germinating hell . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iceland on ponies , never lost their awareness of the active political volcanoes of Europe , which had first erupted in Spain . The last line in the book , " Still I drink your health before/The gun-butt raps upon the door , " crystallizes in a phrase the tone of the period . Although no gun-butt ever knocked on the doors of Auden or MacNeice , the two poets were better prophets than most politicians . They sang of Armageddon and the man . <P> On the surface , of course , politics and history have little to do with a simple , slightly offbeat excursion to Iceland . But for the two young poets the laws of metaphor applied . The ancient island democracy was a place where " Ravens from their walls of shale/Cruise around the rotting whale . " Europe was the beached behemoth and the ravens , the Blackshirts and the SS . Out of their few weeks spent getting saddle sores on bad-tempered Icelandic ponies or in rattletrap buses on boulder-paved roads , eating terrible meals of smoked mutton in smokier hovels , Auden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems ( satirical , epistolatory and familiar ) , letters , guidebook information , parodies , private jokes and public protest . <P> A minor decoration of the original volume , unhappily left out in the re-edition , were Auden 's hit-or-miss photographs . Its principal treasure was and is his long poem , Letter to Lord Byron . Few poets since Byron have tried to crack the great romantic 's seven-foot whip , and only Auden among Englishmen has succeeded , as here : <P> For since the British Isles went Protestant <P> A church confession is too high for most . <P> But still confession is a human want , So Englishmen must make theirs now by post <P> And authors hear them over breakfast toast . For failing them , there 's nothing but <P> the wall <P> Of public lavatories on which to scrawl.
