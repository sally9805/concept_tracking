Now New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller , 54 , blue-penciled the 21-word last paragraph from his official biography in the revised edition of the Legislative Manual and New York Red Book , thereby eliminating all reference to the fact that he was ever married , had five children , and is a grandfather eight times over . <P>
