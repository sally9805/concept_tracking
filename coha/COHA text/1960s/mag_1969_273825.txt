Tom Jones thinks that the only thing his women fans really want to unbutton is their emotions . " That 's as far as it goes , " he insists . " If I really went after a girl in the theater , I 'm sure she 'd run a mile . " These days , some people find that hard to believe . At the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas , Jones launched into / Want a Woman , and a chic brunette leaped atop a table and offered herself . Part of the act ? Perhaps . Another woman tossed her room key onto the stage . If that was part of the act , her husband knew nothing about it : red-faced , he had to plod backstage later to retrieve it . <P> At 29 , Welsh-born Pop Singer Jones is the hottest entertainer in the U.S. Six of his nine LPs are on the Billboard chart , and the latest four have won gold records in the past two months . His weekly TV show on ABC is clobbering the competition as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copacabana in May , the lines began forming as early as 3 o'clock in the afternoon . The Flamingo paid him $280,000 for four weeks , and he paid them back by selling out every concert . <P> Sprayed-On Trousers . Jones ' manager , Gordon Mills , has a one-word explanation for the fuss : " Sex . " That is accurate enough-and the effect is carefully calculated . When Jones growls through a song in a black , bluesy style , the emotion seems to come more from the throat than the heart . The throat itself is a bit suspect : his keening , virile baritone has an alarming tendency to wobble . What seems to the air rhythmically with both arms and strains his pelvis and thigh muscles against trousers that seem to have been sprayed on . He is taunting the women in the audience as much as any torch singer ever taunted a man . As Jones puts it : " I 'm trying to get across to the audience that I 'm alive-all of it , the emotion and the sex and the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the asking . " <P> Unlike the pubescent teen-agers who once doted on Elvis and Frank Sinatra , the Jones fans are primarily well-coiffed young matrons . Jones has programmed his entire career style around his appeal to the mature woman , starting with the neat trim that edges his thick , curly head of hair , and continuing with his tuxedo and matching vest . " You can sing to the kids in a pair of denims , long hair and a sweatshirt , " he says , " but not to the adults . " ABC has had no trouble at all selling commercial spots to makers of sewing machines , bras , eye makeup and suntan lotion . <P> Bigness Has Its Price . Thomas Jones Woodward , son of a coal miner , had an inauspicious start in his home town of Pontypridd , Wales . Trying to stay out of the mines as a youth , he chose instead to crowbar his way into movies , drink with the boys and fight in the streets . That was a far cry from his younger days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guild or the grocery store to warble popular songs like Ghost Riders in the Sky . Tom had to answer for every song to the fellows in the back alley-usually with fists .
