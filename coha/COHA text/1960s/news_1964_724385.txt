txt With the long drought this fall in much of the United States , increased attention is focused on rainmaking . Despite recent rains and snows , reservoirs and underground water levels in many areas remain extremely low . And interest continues high in the success of mankind 's efforts to hasten and increase rain , and in their future direction . Los Angeles Public - utility companies throughout the American Far West keep on seeding the clouds for rain . They say the results are good . But meteorological experts continue to regard the results as inconclusive . " Nobody knows , " says one of these scientists , " whether the extra rain would n't have fallen anyway . " Major power producers , however , seem to have no doubt that cloud seeding is worth the cost . Southern California Edison , Pacific Gas &; Electric , Portland General Electric , and other companies contract with cloud-seeding firms as a regular practice . One such firm has been doing business for some 15 years . It points out that , to the big utilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly more than the cost of cloud seeding . An expert like Dr. Morris Neiburger is fully willing to concede that such cloud seeding may have good results . But he stresses that the findings are not conclusive . Much remains to be learned about what can be done to increase rainfall . Dr. Neiburger is past president of the American Meteorological Society and professor of meteorology at the University of California at Los Angeles . Modifying the weather , here in the West or anywhere , he observes , is n't a new concept . And its future has really just begun . Early Attempts " Inadvertently , " says Dr. Neiburger , " we modify the weather by our cities . We find that the temperatures of cities is usually higher near their centers . There is some evidence that our cities affect the precipitation of rain . " J. P. Espy , the first American to call himself a meteorologist , Dr. Neiburger recalls , tried to induce rain early in the 19th century by building brush tires . The French scientist Dessens came along with experiments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much talk of starting precipitation by firing cannon . Then the Swedish scientist Bergeron saw that the problem was converting " cloud drops " into " rain drops . " Silver Iodide Used " Cloud drops . " Dr. Neiburger explains . are tiny , with diameters of about ' 1/5,000th of an inch . The typical rain drop diameter is around 1 / 10th of an inch . Dr. Bergeron found that ice crystals can act as nuclei on which drops can grow to be big enough to fall . Then the American scientists Irving Langmuir and Vincent Shaefer learned that ice crystal formation can be encouraged by seeding with dry ice . Among other things , this will clear away stratus or layer clouds . It is a method now used regularly to disperse fog , for instance , over the runways at Salt Lake City 's airport . Then silver iodide was introduced as a seeding agent . It has the advantage that it can be sent aloft from the ground . North American Weather Consultants , a firm that uses silver iodide almost entirely , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West to meet demands for increased precipitation . Its offices are in Goleta , Calif. , just north of Santa Barbara . // Utilities Favor Cloud Seeding // " Our work is mainly with utilities , " says John T. Walser , vice-president , who explains that North American Weather has been in business since 1950 . " The public utilities , " he adds , " have hydrologists and engineers who are able to ferret out the most probable conditions for increasing precipitation . " These companies know that they can increase it by 10 to 15 percent a year . Their experience has convinced them . " Southern California Edison , for instance , has been doing it year after year . They get their power from the High Sierra , where it means a lot to them to increase the runoff . " Mr. Walser says that , besides dealing with this big public utility , his firm has contracts with Utah Power and Light and is conducting tests for the University of Nevada . It has new contracts with Portland General Electric and the Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " observes Mr. Walser , " is analogous to that of a farmer who plows his field , and then by fertilizing and other good practices increases its output . " In other words , he says , his firm is n't a " rainmaker . " If it has what he calls " a target area where Mother Nature might provide 10 inches of rain a year , " by cloud seeding it aims to increase the yield by , say , an extra inch . California requires all such operations to be licensed by the State Division of Water Resources . The state has also made one three-year random study of cloud seeding in the Santa Barbara area . " We got nothing very conclusive out of it , " according to one official . " We do not see much evidence that cloud seeding is productive , but people go on doing it year after year . " Dr. Neiburger , from his standpoint as a university researcher , says that " so far what has been done in the United States shows very negligible results . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to find ways to develop really scientific testing .
