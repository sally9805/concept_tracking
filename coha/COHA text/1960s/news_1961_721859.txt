txt The hank consolidation trend slowed matkedly last year , /mu ever under the impact of a new Federal law requiring closer policing of bank acquisitions by Government agencies Cuttently the Justice Department is suing to block sever al important merger proposals . claiming they violate antitrust laws . The first of these suits comes to trial today in Philadelphia , involved ate Philadelphia National Bank and Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank . Nevertheless , many banks feel compelled to continue expanding " Banks are under constant pressure to enlarge their resources and services , " says Baldwin Maull , president . of Marine Midland Corp. , a large New York state bank holding company . As a result of this pressure , some banks are seeking to move ahead with mergers despite the Government 's stricter attitude toward such consolidations . And a growing number of banks are turning to the addition of new branches as an alternative though usually more costly  --  method of expansion A record 815 new bank branches were opened in 1960 , up from 650 the previous yeat Holding Down Costs By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby keep pace with the mounting requirements of growing customers . Another consideration is that larger banks are often able to make more efficient use of machines , such as computers , and thus hold down costs . The growth of the suburbs since World War II has prompted large city banks to move to acquire smaller banks in outlying areas or to open suburban branches . Figures on deposits indicate the rate of growth of major urban banks has lagged behind over-all commercial hank growth . In the 15 years through 1960. total commercial bank deposits in the U.S. increased 49% to $223 billion : deposits . if major New York City banks rose only 4% in the same period . For major Chicago banks , the comparable gain was 165 . Increasingly fierce competition for funds from other types of financial institutions has also spurred some commercial banks to try to swell deposits  --  and hence lending capacity and earnings  --  via the merger or branch route . From 1915 through 1960 , savings in savings and loan associations soared 744%. and deposits in mutual savings banks rose 136% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merger trend saw the number of bank mergers drop to 133 from 169 in 1959 The decline is attributed by bankers largely to the closer regulation resulting from the 1960 Federal Bank Merger Act . In some ways , this act left regulatory procedure unchanged . As had been true previously , the Treasury Department 's Comptroller of the Currency has the final say when the would-be acquiriQg bank is a Federally-chartered institution . But the act for the first time gave Federal agencies jurisdiction over all mergers in which the surviving bank is to be a state-chartered institution . Previously , Federal agencies had passed on many such mergers  --  chiefly those in which offices of the acquired bank were to he operated as branches But this freed some mei gers from Federal scrutiny ; the laws of 11 states bar banks from operating branches In such states , mergers in which a state bank acquired another bank generally were the sole province of state regulatory officials Under the new law , in all cases where the state-chartered bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state bank is not a Federal Reserve member , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , as well as state officials , must consider its merger proposals The Bank Merger Act also provides that Federal agencies , when they consider merger proposals , must solicit opinions of the Justice Department on the competitive aspects of such proposals The opinions are not binding on the agent ies Between mid-May. 1960. when the act went into effect , and the end of the year , the Federal Reserve Board approved 17 mergers , although the Justice Department had filed adverse reports on six of these proposals . The Justice Department has been far from content with its advisory role . Its officials argue that bank mergers really are subject to the antitrust laws , and that the department thus should be able to block any mergers that it can prove will substantially lessen competition . Resolving the Issue That 's the issue that may be resolved by the Federal District Court in Philadelphia in the trial beginning today . The Clayton Act , in the case of banks , specifically covers only mergers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sherman Act , the other major antitrust statute . is vague on this point . In hank mergers , one bank merely purchases the assets of another bank  --  not its stock Commercial banks are forbidden by law from buying stock in other banks Justice Department lawyers . however , argue that this difference is more apparent than real , and should not free banks from antitrust law surveillance The proposed merger of Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank and Philadelphia National Bank , the department lawyers complain . would create a bank 505 larger than its nearest Philadelphia competitor . First Pennsyl- ? , Iinia Banking &; Trust Co. , now the city 's largest hank . They argue that this would sub . stantially lessen competition . The proposed merger already has been approved by the Comptroller of the Currency .

" Holding Up Approval Until the courts clarify the issue , the Justice Department has prevailed on the Comptroller of the Currency to hold up approval of any merger applications to which the department objects . Department lawyers have been seeking similar agreements with the Federal Reserve Board and the I " . D I.C. on merger proposals that conic under their jut isdictions . Perhaps partly because of Justice Depart . ment prodding , the Federal Reserve appears to be taking a stricter attitude toward bank mergers than it has in the past . Last month , for example , the board denied the request of an Elmira . N.Y. , subsidiary bank of Marine Midland Corp .. a bank holding company , to acquire a small independent bank in Ithaca , about 30 miles away . The board held the proposed merger would sharply curtail bank competition in a wide area . President Maull of Marine Midland is fighting the ruling . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad blow for smaller banks of the state who from time to time find it advantageous to join with other banks , " he argues . The anti-merger sentiment in Washington Is affecting some banks ' expansion plans . " The Justice Department may lose or it may win in the courts , but this much is certain : The current attitude of the department has not only C111181. ( 1 uncertainty over pending mergers , it has undoubtedly put a brake on actual or planned negotiations , " says M. A. Schapiro , a New York City bank stock dealer .
