txt If you hear soft noises of rebellion on the college campus , it is not likely to be the protest of freshmen confined to their quarters after a " panty raid . " Nor is it the explosive revolt of political radicals or of idealistic reformers . The voices are not violent . They are only impatient . They seek escape , not from the social order but merely from the protective , peaceful ivory tower . A student at New York 's City College , asked to write an article about student life " then and now " for an undergraduate publication , called an alumnus who had been graduated in the early Forties to find out how the older half had lived . He listened to the accounts of " peace strikes " and political feuds , student rallies and protest picketing . " It must have been exciting , " the current freshman said , with a tinge of disbelief .

" The students are asking for something better . " On some campuses the student is ahead of the faculty , " said Dr. Eddy .

Movement Spreading Commenting on today 's student , Edward D.

" This , Dr. Eddy believes , has led to an attitude he calls " privatism . " The student " searches for a rich , Ah " li life for himself . His strong interests are centered on the material benefits which he and his family may be able to enjoy * * . The constant question is first : ' What 's in it for me ? ' " A retired professor , looking back over a forty-year-long parade of passing students at the College of the City of New York , says : " It must be hard for kids today . I do n't envy them . How can they get involved in the problems of the world when the problems are so big ? What can they do ? " What can they do ? Some students  --  not all of them ; not even the majority but a top layer of intellect and sensitivity ? ask this question today . The answers they give are quite different from the violence of the Thirties and from the hopeful dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Recently , students from six colleges met in a special " student government conference " at Carleton College in Northfield , Minn . They represented Antioch and Oberlin , both in Ohio ; Pomona College in California ; Reed College in Oregon . and Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania . The delegates agreed that student government must take a more active part in " academic affairs " and in the creation of a real interest " in social and political issues beyond the limitations of the cam pus . " Admittedly , in their attempt to achieve this , the students appeared to be floundering . Like their elders , they left many of the " issues " to be clarified later  --  presumably by committees and surveys , the modern substitute for action . But in this stirring  --  from Yale to Wisconsin , from Swarthmore to the West Coast ? there are signs of recognition that " privatism " is not enough . It would be naive to pretend that the question , " What 's in it for me ? " wo n't be asked any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to say : " We 're in this together . " ' Left Out ' Typical of the questions and the new answers are those that have come from a group of Yale undergraduates and their new venture , " The Challenge . " It is described in the prospectus as " a student program at Yale University to confront with realistic concern and responsible action the crucial issues of today 's world . " Stephen Kass , one of the undergraduate leaders of the program , sums up the reasons for " The Challenge " more simply : " We felt left out . Most of the problems  --  take atomic energy , for instance  --  are just too big . What are we to do ? As a result , many students are either just cynical or they get lost in
