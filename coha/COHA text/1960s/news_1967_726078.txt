txt The antilabor lobbyists are on the move . Encouraged by the recent elections , they now are coming forward with a whole fistful of proposals designed to curb some of the political and economic power of big uinons . One such group , the National Right to Work Committee , aims to turn the tables on the advocate of repeal of Section 144(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act . " The atmosphere in Congress has changed , " says Reed Larson , executive vice-president of the committee . " In race after race , proponents of compulsory unionism were defeated . " He cites the defeat of Ross Bass ( D ) of Tennessee , a leading proponent of ( 14b ) repeal . His replacement , Sen Howard H. Baker Jr . ( R ) of Tennessee opposes 14(b) repeal . In other races , similar changes took place . Sen. Charles H. Percy ( R ) of Illinois who opposes 14(b) repeal , replaces Sen. Paul Douglas ( D ) who supported it . The same with Sen. Robert Griffin ( R ) of Michigan who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern is even more apparent in the House . In this context , the Right to Work Committee , housed in a shiny , new , glass-face office building just a few blocks from the White House , for the first time has taken the initiative in proposing new legislation . Until now , the committee devoted full time attacking repeal of the " right-to-work " provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act . This allows for compulsory unionism , except in states which specifically exempt themselves . Now , Right to Work Committee officials are pushing a turnabout proposal . They want to amend the Taft-Hartley Act to set as national labor policy the standard of voluntary unionism , with a state option allowing for compulsory union membership . " Now , " says Mr. Larson , " the government sanctions compulsory unionism . We think it should be on record for voluntarism . " A copy of this proposal has been sent to every member of the House and Senate . They have no firm takers as yet . But they are encouraged that several members are looking closely at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R ) of Illinois , leader of the opposition to 14(b) repeal , is interested . Another one is Sen. Sam J. Ervin ( D ) of North Carolina . Prepared to wait A spokesman for the AFL-CIO said that his organization is taking a " wait and see " attitude toward this and other such proposals . He said he is reserving comment until the legislation is actually introduced . Mr. Larson does not expect his ideas will catch fire overnight . " We 're not kidding ourselves about passage of these proposals , " he says . " We just want to get the merits of the legislation before Congress for discussion . " " While a total federal ban on forced unionism may still be several years away , " says Mr. Larson , " we believe that a drive now for appropriate federal legislation will go a long way in helping us end the compulsory union shop , " They think they are getting a slightly more sympathetic hearing in Congress .                @ @ @ @ @
