txt Mayor Wagner asked National League baseball club owners yesterday for an " early indication " that they would include New York City in the league 's proposed expansion to ten clubs , The assurance of a franchise , the Mayor said , would mean that the city could expedite construction of a proposed stadium in Flushing , Queens . The stadium , planned to hold 55,000 persons , could be completed in 1962 , perhaps in time for the start of the baseball season that year , he said . The Mayor 's request was made iv telegrams sent to members of the National League committee on expansion , which is scheduled to meet with other National League club owners in Chicago on Monday . When Baseball Commissioner Ford C , Frick was informed of the Mayor 's action he said : " Well , I guess we 've got it . " " By this I mean that if these plans are fulfilled we 'll finally have what we 've wanted all along , another major league Club in New York , " Mr. Frick said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they meet in Chicago on Monday , will give every consideration to the New York group 's application for a , franchise . The assurance that New York will have a new sta .. ' dium should help . " The club owners were told by the Mayor that the proposed new stadium , now4estimated to cost $16,226,250 , Was " past the , drawing board stages , " . with every prospect that plans and specifications for a construction contract would be ready for bidding by Dec. 1 . An application for the New York franchise was filed on Tuesday by a group headed by Mrs. Joan Whitney Payson of New York and Manhasset , L. I. Mrs. Payson was a member of the syndicate that held a franchise in the proposed Continental League , which for all intents and purposes died when the National and American Leagues indicated that they would each add two new . teams to form ten-team leagues . . The National League meeting on Monday is expected to approve the expansion to ten teams . It may also act on the New York application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other franchise to be added . Approval Awaits Commitment A commitment by the National League to expand and to award one of the two new franchises to New York would pave the way for approval of the stadium by the Board of Estimate and the City Council . The Mayor has indicated that the city will not commit itself to a construction contract until a lease of the stadium has been signed , calling for an annual rental sufficient to cover interest and principal payments on thirty-year bonds the city would issue to finance the project . The stadium project is listed in the City Planning Commission 's proposed 1961 capital budget . The Board of Estimate has already appropriated $170,000 for plans . The proposed 1961 capital budget calls for a construction cost allocation of $16,056,250 . Until recently the annual rental required to cover debt service on the bonds was estimated at $900,000 .

Carpenter Jr . of the Philadelphia Phillies ; John W. Galbreath of the Pittsburgh Pirates ; Warren C. Giles , president of the National League , and Mr , Frick .
