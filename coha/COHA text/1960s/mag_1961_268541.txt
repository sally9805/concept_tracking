Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay is another who seldom makes public speeches-and minces no words when he does . Last week , attending an Air Force Association convention in Philadelphia , LeMay said that the U.S. , despite all Nikita Khrushchev 's boasts , is well ahead of the Soviet Union in its stockpile of " superbombs , " and could have , if it had wanted to , built a 100-megaton bomb " a long time ago . ' ' <P> There was no doubt in LeMay 's mind about the will and purpose of the U.S. people . Said he : " Never before in our nation 's history have we as a people been more patient and more determined to stand together to meet aggression . ' ' But LeMay had another concern : " Deterrence of aggression is composed of three basic elements-forces in being , public understanding of this force , and national determination to use this force if necessary . These are the three elements that make our force credible to our friends and to our enemies . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <P> To LeMay , there seemed to be a danger that public understanding of the U.S. " aerospace " ' force has become fuzzy . " Yet , " he said , " our basic concept has remained firm through the years-national security requires that we build , maintain and modernize our aerospace power , and that we emphasize forces that can survive an attack and react with war-waging and war-winning capabilities . Today , for the first time in history , we can be attacked by strong aerospace forces ... <P> " Because of my service in the Strategic Air Command , a lot of people think I am only interested in big bombers and have little faith in or use for missiles , tactical air power , air defense , and the many other essential elements that go to make up total aerospace power . This most emphatically is not true . <P> " I seek weapon systems that I think can do the best job and afford the nation the most protection . I am a military conservative in that I believe we should n't discard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that is able to replace it and do a better job . In short , I believe in having protection along with progress . ' '
