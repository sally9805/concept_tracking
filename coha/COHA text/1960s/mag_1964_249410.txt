The bikini could n't have weighed more than a couple of ounces . The girl up on the runway showing it off last week at a London charity fashion show was Debutante Caroline Maudling , 18 . Her father : Chancellor of the Exchequer Reginald Maudling , known to British newspaper readers just now as the man who must announce the new budget to Parliament this week . When the bikini-clad picture splashed across the papers , the Daily Mirror headlined it as " Caroline Maudling 's Budget Look , " while the Daily Express observed that " Far from damaging her father 's career , she probably added hundreds to the votes he will get next election day . " That was just about the only hopeful electica prediction the Tories got all week . <P> A Maneuver That Failed . The worst news came from London . For years , London 's local government has been solidly in Labor hands because of the capital 's working-class majority . Last July , on the Tories ' initiative , Parliament created the Greater London Council , to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much stronger . By this device , and by redrawing voting districts , the Tories hoped to capture the administration of Greater London , which contains one sixth of the British population . Labor bitterly condemned the gerrymander . As it turned out , the Tory maneuver failed . Last week when the voters went to the polls in the first Greater London Council election , they handed the Labor Party a thumping victory . <P> Of the Council 's 100 seats , the Conservatives who had hoped for at least a majority , won only 36 to Labor 's 64 . Other local elections throughout the country confirmed Labor 's current lead with the electorate . The outlook for the Tories in the forthcoming general elections ( the Conservatives ' present fiveyear mandate expires Nov. 5 ) , changed from dark grey to deep black . <P> A Hope for Fall . Three hours before the polls closed in London , Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home ended months of suspense about the timing of the elections . He announced that the present Parliament , already the longest in peacetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Labor Party Leader Harold Wilson explained the delay with deadly brevity : " It is now quite clear why Sir Alec did not go to the country in June . I think he realized he had no chance at all . " <P> For a better chance in the fall , Douglas-Home hopes to heal the Tory party 's rifts , notably about the government 's recent repeal of " resale price maintenance , " a system of manufacturer-pegged retail prices like U.S. " fair trade " laws . And he is also counting on the additional time to put himself to the electorate .
