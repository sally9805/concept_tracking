The first salmon streaks of dawn were coming up over Washington 's National Airport when the darkened Convair winged in from West Virginia . Jackie Kennedy lay curled in sleep on a back seat , but her husband , the hero of the night before , was wide awake . As soon as the plane door opened , he hurried over to a vending machine , plunked in a dime and plucked out an early edition of the Washington Post . KENNEDY SWEEPS WEST VA . VOTE , proclaimed the headline . Chuckled Jack Kennedy : " I would n't be surprised if Lyndon and Stu might be having a conference today . " <P> It was a logical guess . Kennedy 's big victory had produced a sinking feeling in the camps of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination . Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey withdrew from the race and hurried home to campaign for the Senate . Texas ' Lyndon Johnson and Missouri 's Stuart Symington , the candidates who had sidestepped the primaries , now had every reason to form a grand alliance . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The primary will not be any more decisive than Wisconsin . " Said Johnson : " The nation can start judging on the basis of merit . " But nobody was fooled ; the political hour was growing late for Johnson and Symington-and later still for Adlai Stevenson , whose friends indicated that if someone would just promise to make him Secretary of State , he 'd be happy . <P> Liberal List . Washington waited in vain for the stop-Kennedy summit meeting . It never came . Neither Symington nor Johnson was willing at this time to bow out in favor of the other ; Stevenson was urged to endorse Kennedy , but decided to wait out the results of this week 's Oregon primary , where all hopefuls-including Oregon 's own Wayne Morse-are entered . In the lull , United Auto Workers ' Walter Reuther , political shop steward of Michigan 's Governor G. Mennen Williams , came out for Kennedy . So did Humphreyman Joseph Rauh , vice chairman of Americans for Democratic Action. * 9And even Eleanor Roosevelt , who has had her reservations about Jack Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than either Symington or Johnson , " will be considered the candidate of the liberals . " <P> The Ichabod specter of Estes Kefauver clomped through the stop-Kennedy speculation and talk . In 1952 , with a successful string of 13 primaries behind him , the Keef was stopped cold in mid-convention by President Harry Truman and the Democratic bosses simply because he did not fit their image of a nominee . No such feelings exist about Kennedy , and his one big bugaboo-his Catholic religion-was gone with West Virginia .
