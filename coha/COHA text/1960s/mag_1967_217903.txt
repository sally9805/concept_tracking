To protect them against enemies and intruders after death , Egypt 's pharaohs were entombed with their treasures in cleverly concealed chambers deep with in their monumental pyramids . Most of these royal burial vaults have long since been discovered and looted , but some archaeologists suspect that others still lie undisturbed behind tons of lime stone and granite blocks . Egypt 's pyramids may soon yield their remaining secrets . In a speech before the American Physical Society last week , University of California Physicist Luis Alvarez reported that his ingeniously conceived project to peer into the pyramids with cosmic rays is about to get under way . <P> Some time in March , in a chamber 400 feet below the tip of the Great Pyramid of Cheops , Egyptian and American scientists will set up a spark chamber to detect a component of cos mic rays called muons . Actually sub atomic particles traveling close to the speed of light , some of the muons will be energetic enough to penetrate the dense structure of the pyramid and pass through the spark chamber , a device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be cause the muon leaves a wake of ionized gas , which conducts electricity , a spark will jump between each pair of plates along the path of the particle . <P> <P> Patient Computer . The relative locations of the two sparks , which determine the direction from which the particle came , will be noted electronically and stored on magnetic tapes . Every evening , the tapes will be sent to Cairo 's Ein Shams University . There they will be fed into a computer that will calculate and memorize the point at which each recorded muon penetrated the surface of the pyramid . Because cavities within the pyramid offer less resistance to speeding muons than does solid stone , a greater number of muons will penetrate to the spark chamber along paths that take them through corridors and burial chambers . The computer will thus remember that certain well-defined areas of the pyramid 's surface were penetrated by more recorded muons than the remaining surface area . <P> After patiently accumulating the muon data for two months-the time necessary to get statistically valid readings-the computer will spew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen of the oscilloscope , the data will be converted into images resembling X-ray plates , one for each face of the pyramid . Chambers and corridors within the pyramid will show up as dark areas on one or more of the faces-defined by the surplus of recorded muons that penetrated these areas . <P> The two-dimensional oscilloscope images , like X rays , will show the presence of cavities but will not indicate how deep within the pyramid they are . <P> To pinpoint their location , the scientists will move the spark chamber 35 feet away to another point within the pyramid and repeat the muon-recording process . The resulting images , combined stereoscopically with the originals , will precisely locate the hidden chambers .
