Ever since World War II , Yugoslavs have talked only in whispers about the dreaded UDBA ( for Uprava Drzavne Bezbednosti ) , or State Security Directorate , a faceless army of 20,000 or so state snoopers who modeled themselves after the Soviet secret police . But after finding a listening device in his own bedroom , Marshal Tito two months ago called for sweeping reforms and fired the security chief , Vice President Aleksandar Rankovic , 56 . As a result , UDBA has become fair game for exposes . <P> There was plenty to expose . Capitalizing on their privilege to leave and enter the country at will , UDBA agents apparently bought stolen Fiats for $200 from confederates in Italy , then drove the cars into Yugoslavia , where they fetched $1,240 apiece . Using concentration-camp prisoners as laborers , the secret police turned a marble quarry on the Adriatic isle of Goli Otok into a thriving business . <P> Operating behind front men , UDBA owned several ocean-going cargo ships , and engineered its own trade deals with foreign merchants . UDBA also maneuvered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kickback from their salaries . <P> <P> In addition , it ran farms , dealt in antiques and trafficked in drugs . But perhaps its biggest racket was protection . If the bribe was right , UDBA could hush up crimes or fix sentences for defendants facing stiff penalties . In fact , UDBA was not above framing . <P> So far , at least 1,500 UDBA officials have been purged , and many more seem certain to lose their jobs , for the government intends to reduce the secretpolice strength by two-thirds . More important , the UDBA has lost its state-within-a-state status , and its ability to hold an entire people in a grip of fear .
