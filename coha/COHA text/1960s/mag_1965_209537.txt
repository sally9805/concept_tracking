Cactus Flower . Humor is often the puckish shadow cast by national character . English comedy is a running display of oneupmanship , reflecting an indelible class system . The Teutonic cast-ironies of Brecht seem manufactured by Krupp . The classic American comic event is the chase , a drolly tangible version of the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream . And the French sex farce is logic run rampant , reason carried to an unreasonable and absurd extremity . That is why French sex farces are innately sexless : Descartes wrote them all . They begin with cogito ergo sum , and they rely not on seduction but sophistry , not on rolled-down beds but revved-up minds , not on fervid matings but frenetic misunderstandings . <P> Cactus Flower is such a French farce , seasoned to U.S. tastes with local situation gags by Adapter-Director Abe Burrows , garnished with appealing humanity , and served with unerring timing by a well-chosen cast . Lauren Bacall plays a dentist 's nurse who looks " like a big white Band-Aid , " speaks with an antiseptic voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . The dentist ( Barry Nelson ) holds a master 's degree in bachelorhood , and while he appreciates spinsterish efficiency in the office , he turns for amour to a Greenwich Village post-adolescent ( Brenda Vaccaro ) . This child wants to be a bride , but the dentist has lied to her that he has a wife and three children . In distress , the girl turns on the gas oven , and the suicide attempt , foiled by a friendly neighbor ( Burt Brincker-hoff ) , convinces the dentist that he has been hit by a depth charge of love . <P> He proposes , but his concerned young mistress wants to meet the wife and see if divorce will agree with her . Grudgingly , Bacall agrees to the role and the ruse . Nelson butters the lie by telling his bride-to-be that his wife has a boy friend whom she wishes to marry . This makes Vaccaro extravagantly solicitous : she must meet Bacall 's supposed lover and see if he is a good sort . By the time the fictional couples are locked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cactus Flower is a prickly web of deceit . Inevitably , Bacall kicks over the old-maidenly traces and turns into a bewitching torso-twisting temptress , while the dentist drops his dentures . <P> As a vastly accomplished jokesmith , Abe Burrows is up against tough and lonely competition-himself-and there are some cavities in his comic lines . But the cast fills them handsomely . Besides looking good , Lauren Bacall handles dialogue like a bone-dry martini . Barry Nelson 's whole being winces with boyish mock innocence , and Brenda Vaccaro 's characterization draws royal flushes from mental blanks . <P> Cactus Flower is beguiling rather than robust . It skips a comic beat now and again , but it is watch-proof , an amusing way of forgetting time and not merely killing it .
