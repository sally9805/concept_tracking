THE PEACEMAKERS by Richard B Morris . 572 pages . Harper &; Row . $10 <P> " O God ! It is all over ! " cried Lord North , the British Prime Minister , when he heard of the U.S. victory at Yorktown . He was wrong . It was all over ; but the peacemaking-which went on for almost two years before it concluded in the fateful Peace of Paris tha established the U.S. as an independent nation . To retrace the incredibly intricate course of this negotiation , Columbia 's Professor Richard B. Morris spent five years puttering in French , British and U.S. archives . He came up covered with dust and glory , clutching original documents that compel a radical reinterpretation of Franco-American relations in the revolutionary period . <P> The Morris thesis is that France was not , as most historians have assumed , the great champion of American independence . France , he demonstrates , was primarily interested in its war with George III , and considered the U.S. just a handy stick to beat Britain with . Even before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to reduce , partition and even scuttle the brash young nation that had dared dispute the rule of royalty . And during the peace negotiations , France cynically tried to sell the U.S. down the river for the sake of an overall settlement with Britain and Spain . <P> Master of the Peace . For the historians Author Morris supplies page on page of fascinating new facts , and for the general reader he supplies plenty of human interest . The Peacemakers tells a tall but true and often heroic tale of three shrewd Yankee traders-John Jay , John Adams and Ben Franklin-who sat down with the biggest double-dealers in Europe and played a bad hand so skillfully that they made off with the better part of the pot . <P> Shrewd was scarcely the word for Adams when he arrived in Paris early in 1780 to take up his duties as U.S. peace commissioner . He was green , scared , pompous , moralistic and tactless . Vergennes , the French Foreign Minister , who intended to be " master of the peace , " gave a sharp tug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to divide its peacemaking powers among five commissioners. * A little later he also forced Congress to instruct its commissioners " to undertake nothing in the negotiations for peace without the knowledge and concurrence of the ministers of France . " To make sure these incapacitating instructions were honored , Vergennes had the commissioners shadowed and their mail opened before delivery . <P> Adams was indignant , and so was the proud and subtle Jay . But wise old Franklin advised the younger men to wait patiently for the main chance , and in the spring of 1782 it came . Lord Shelburne , soon to be named Prime Minister of England , invited Franklin to initiate a correspondence . A few weeks later Richard Oswald , a sagacious Scot , arrived in Paris with authority to negotiate . Franklin dutifully informed Vergennes , and then informed Oswald of the principal American peace conditions : " compleat independence , " territorial integrity , freedom to fish on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland , freedom to navigate the Mississippi , no treaty without full French approval .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
