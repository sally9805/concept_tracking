Comic Dick Cavett is a menace . That low-key , gracious approach should fool nobody . He is a cool operator who plans to sweep the American housewife off her feet before she has a chance to sweep the floor . Hosting a new 90-minute daily talk show called This Morn ing on ABC , he has plunged into that grey Sargasso Sea of morning game shows and reruns , and already he 's making steady , perceptible waves of laugh ter . There is something vaguely immoral about one-liners at 10:30 a.m. , but Cavett has no respect . Amid all the yak , yak , yak on daytime TV , he has snuck in a genuine yuk . And mean while the breakfast dishes are stacking up in the sink like poker chips . <P> The threat would not be so dire if he were charming just any old house wives . But according to the television flackery , they are " today 's younger , more sophisticated homemakers , " those " recently deposed go-go people , " those Green Berets of the broom brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims that he also draws a good share of night watchmen with insomnia . Just two weeks ago , he brags , a letter poured in . <P> It was from a 58-year-old housewife . <P> She confessed that her go-go had gone years ago , but wondered if it was all right for her to watch anyway . And last week there was a letter from Cavett 's idiot cousin Clarence . He is the simp who lost his job at the St. Louis Zoo after he decided to run the place on the honor system . Recently , reports Cavett , Clarence registered his own feeble protest to the Viet Nam war . He boiled his draft card . <P> Clinging Power . Lest anyone get the idea that This Morning is a kind of hangover from the Tonight Show , on his premiere Cavett brought on as his first guest Master Builder Buckminster Fuller ( TIME cover , Jan. 10 , 1964 ) . " I 'm only 72 , " said Fuller . " You do n't look a day over 70 , " said Cavett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future centuries women would revert to wearing fig leaves . Cavett asked : " What is it about fig leaves . Do they have some peculiar clinging power ? " Fuller : " They are relatively large and durable . . . " Cavett : " And washable and 90% Dacron . " <P> Last week Cavett interviewed Comic Pat McCormick , who discussed the possible effects of a steel strike on the California Christmas-tree market . Cavett is still too innocent to prevent a veteran pitchman like Art Linkletter from wresting the show away from him and giving a 15-minute spiel for a new game he helped invent . But in defense , Cavett , a former gag writer , can fall back on old material . Once , he said , when he was out of work , he used to write dirty jokes for kids to use on Linkletter 's TV House Party . <P> If Cavett is not stopped before he gets more practice , this Nebraska citybilly , this con merchant in a Brooks Brothers special , this yahoo Yalie , this literate , witty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then who is going to wash all those dirty dishes ?
