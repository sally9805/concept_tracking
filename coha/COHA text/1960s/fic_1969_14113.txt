The living room of a middle-class suburban home . A picture window faces the audience . A sofa , a coffee table with trendy magazines and a work table where Keith sits at his typewriter . He glances furtively at the kitchen door , pecks listlessly at his typewriter and when he has finished what he is writing , leans back with slight satisfaction . Kate , as if on cue , bounces in from the kitchen with an evil smile on her face . KATE Oh , boy . New words . Thought ' em all up while Katie brewed the beans , huh . Put ' em right next to each other in the right order , too . ( Kate reads the sentence to herself , then reads it out loud . ) " The sun rose pink over the misty morning park and flooded the silent forest in a radiant  --  pink . " KEITH ( Sarcastic . ) Well , what do you think ? Does it hold you ? Does it have impact ? KATE Yeah , Keith , it sure does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you manage it , snake-eyes ? KEITH I suppose it 's got something to do with the stimulating environment , Kate . KATE The sun rose pink Arrgh . ( Kate begins to wad the paper , but notices something on the other side . ) A sentence on the back ? My , my , have n't we been a busy little beaver . Why on the back , sugar ? Economy , or were we trying to pull a fast one on the little woman ? ( Kate reads the sentence to herself , with feigned interest . ) Who are you trying to kid , Keith . You did n't write this . p. 3 KEITH And what happy little turn of perversity put that idea into your head ? KATE Come on , snuggles , play straight with me . You could n't write something like that in a million years . ( Keith , mistrustful , rises and takes the paper from her . He looks it over . ) KEITH Yes , that 's my sentence . I wrote that , Kate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught between uncertainty and pride , reads slowly . ) " The hild stepped closer to have a better view but tripped on a hidden stone and scared the frightened doe away . " ( They stare at each other seriously . ) Do you like it ? ( Kate ca n't control herself any longer . She bursts out laughing , nearly doubling up with pleasure . ) KATE Oh Keith , it 's too much , baby . How goddamned awful can you get . KEITH ( Shaken . ) Fuck off . KATE Hey , mittens , do you think you could , just for once , just for a dirty old laugh , why do n't you try to write something that is n't perfectly fucking ridiculous . KEITH Would you like me to do that for you , dew drop . KATE ( Bitter . ) Yes , Keith , I would . I 'd like that just a whole lot , I really would . p. 4 KEITH If you 'd like to think so . KATE Not me , lover , you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day you 'll be able to put three whole words together that would n't make an elephant puke with embarrassment . KEITH Behind every great man Kate . Oh do n't be cute , rabbit-ears . ( Pause . ) You do n't even disgust me any more . Keith , why are you so , so little ? How do you manage to be so un-something ? Would you tell me that ? I mean , I 'd really like to know . Come on , Keithy-boy . Tell me all about it . Make chit-chat . Chit-chat . Chit-chit-chit-chit-chit . Chit-chit-chit-chit-chat . KEITH ( Gripping the side of his table . ) SHIT ! KATE Was that " shit " in the scatological sense , Keithy , or was that a snap appraisal of your literary contribution to western civilization ? KEITH No , Kate , that was a private , a wholly private and I suppose somewhat desperate attempt to summarize your character , so that I 'll be able to remember this golden moment in the bleak years ahead . KATE ( Smiling . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good . I mean , for your age . So , there 's still a little spunk in there somewhere . p. 5 KEITH Maybe , Kate . I would n't rule out the possibility . No , strictly speaking that 's not true . I mean , if I had my way , I 'd certainly rule out the possibility , but I 'm sure you would n't , would you ? Well , go on . Yum , yum . Have a bite . KATE No hurry , hot-dog . The day 's still young . ( As Kate exits into the kitchen , Keith checking that the coast is clear , rushes to the typewriter and begins bashing away furiously . Just as he completes his sentence , Kate charges out of the kitchen and beats him to pulling the sheet out of the typewriter . She glances curiously over it , wads it up and throws it away . ) Naughty , naughty . Just ca n't let you out of my sight for one second . KEITH ( Spitting out the word . ) Coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , Kate , leave me alone . You 've already killed me . Now let me decay in peace . KATE Awww , please , Keithy , do the coffee thing . KEITH Then will you leave me alone ? KATE Maybe . It 's a possibility that ca n't be ruled out . ( The following exchange is an old , tired formula which Kate tries to enjoy , but which Keith merely recites. ) p. 6 KEITH Coffee . KATE Coffee ? Coffee what ? KEITH Coffee in a cup . KATE What about coffee in a cup ? KEITH Make it . KATE Oh , you want coffee , Keith . KEITH Yes , Kate , I want coffee . KATE In a cup . KEITH Yes , in a stinking cup . KATE You want some coffee in a stinking cup ? KEITH ( Tiring . ) Shit . KATE Shit in a cup ? KEITH Kate ! KATE How about some coffee in a stinking cup and some nice shit on a little side plate ? KEITH Damn it , Kate , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Go away . Far away . Please . KATE Do n't you want some nice coffee in a KEITH NO . KATE See , see , you got me all worked up now , all tetchy and manic trying to figure out what the sugar-coated little hell you want . Do , you know what you want , Keith ? Keith ? Hey , frying pan , I 'm talking to you . You know , sugar , somewhere in the sad history of our mutual passion I do believe we lost the art of conversation . You never seem to care a sad damn what I have to say . p. 7 KEITH ( Vaguely . ) That 's not true , Kate . KATE What 's not true ? KEITH What you just said . KATE What did I just say ? ( They look past each other sadly , Kate momentarily lost , sits on the couch . She finally smiles , then seriously begins . ) I 've just been thinking , Keith . I 've been thinking that what you really need is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make you passionate . ( Big laugh . ) I 'll get you some coffee . ( Kate starts for the kitchen . ) KEITH Thank you , Kate . KATE ( Stopping . ) In a cup . KEITH You 're too good to me , Kate . ( As Kate reaches the kitchen door there is a huge crashing noise nearby . If possible , the light from the picture window suddenly throws a huge criss-cross shadow across the floor of the room . ) KATE ( Tense . ) What the hell was that ? Keith , did you hear that ? KEITH Yes , I believe I did . KATE What was it ? KEITH On a snap judgment I 'd say it was a sharp , loud noise of indeterminate origin . p. 8 KATE Well are n't you gon na get off your scaley haunches and try to find out what it was . Keith , that noise was very near . Please , Keith , do something . KEITH If I 'm not very much mistaken , fragrance , you 'll find the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Kate , rather uneasily , goes to the window . ) KATE Keith , what is it ? Look at it . What 's it doing out there ? KEITH It 's not an " it " Kate , it 's a " they , " plural . They are called Monkey Bars . KATE Monkey Bars ? You 're pulling my hairies . KEITH No , no , they are , indeed , called Monkey Bars . Monkey , Kate , after your ancestors , and Bars after the smelly backalley fun palaces where you acquired all your inimitable social grace . " Monkey Bars . " KATE OK , hotshot , two points . Now suppose you just tell me what a plural Monkey Bars is doing outside our window . KEITH They seem to be standing there . KATE No , no , Keith , something 's wrong here . Come on , Rex , let 's let old Katie in on the fun . KEITH What fun ? KATE God damn it , Keith , what are you up to ? p. 9 KEITH Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sitting at a typewriter and and I 'm trying yes , that 's right , I 'm trying to write a novel . KATE Keith , I want you to tell me what 's going on next door . ( Kate , agitated , is trying to confront Keith , but is continually drawn towards the window by the spectacle next door . ) KEITH ( Mildly . ) Oh , have I been missing something ? KATE You sure have , buddy . Look what they 're moving in over there . Weights . Bars . A trampoline . They 've got a trampoline . Keith , look at it . It 's enough to make you piss . Literally . A boat ! They 're moving a boat in . ( Keith is now at the window . ) KEITH Actually , Kate , it 's a kayak . KATE A what ? KEITH A kayak . KATE Look , Keith , do n't get cute with me . That 's a boat . I know a boat . That is a boat . KEITH A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEITH It has a light wooden frame inside and it 's covered all around with canvas . Heavy duty waterproof canvas . The rowers sit in those two holes with the top part of their body sticking out , and when the weather gets rough they can crawl way down inside , pull the canvas flap over the hole and hide . The frame is very weak . Unfortunately . p. 10 KATE All right , so it 's a kayak-boat . What do they want with a kayak-boat ? KEITH Believe it or not , Kate , I do n't know . KATE Keith , I do n't want this thing on our lawn . KEITH And why is that , blossom ? KATE This is our house . That 's our lawn . It does n't belong on our lawn . I do n't like it Keith , go over there and tell them to move it . KEITH What if I like it ? KATE Keith , if you do n't move it , I 'll scream , so help me I will . ( Kate starts screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll go , I 'll go . Shut up . ( A knock on the door . ) KATE Who 's that ? Someone just knocked . Someone 's at the door . KEITH Yes , Kate , I 'd say that 's a reasonable supposition . KATE Did you invite someone without telling me ? KEITH Now would I do a thing like that ? KATE There is a visitor out there , snake-eyes . We were n't expecting a visitor were we ? KEITH Not that I know of . p. 11 KATE Then what the hell is he doing out there ? KEITH He 's visiting unexpectedly , Kate . KATE You bet your sweet ding-dong he is . No telephone call . No letter . No nothing . Some visitor . KEITH Well , are you going to open the door and see which one of our countless friends it is ? KATE Keithy-boy , you 're up to something . All that next door . These things outside . Now a visitor . What 's the game ? Katie ca n't play without she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE ( Playful . ) What if it 's a fat , greasy stranger ? What if he plans to throw me on the floor and hump me red under your glassy little eyeballs ? KEITH Well , let him in before he changes his mind . KATE All right , Keith , I 'll get it , but whatever it is you 're up to you lose . ( At the door . ) Who is it ? Hey , who 's there . Speak up , I ca n't hear you . Who the pissing hell is it . Oh , neighbors . They say they 're neighbors . Hey , Keith , we do n't know any neighbors , do we ? KEITH Why do n't you do something incredible and unexpected like open the door and find out . p. 12 KATE ( Biting . ) You open it . I 'm busy . ( Keith opens the door revealing Flash and Powie , two musclemen , naked from the waist upwards . They are nervous . ) KEITH Hello ? FLASH Hi , neighbor ! KEITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . POWIE May we come on in . KEITH Yeah . Come on in . FLASH Here we come . ( They enter and stand awkwardly . ) KATE ( Hard . ) What do you want here ? KEITH Oh , that 's Kate , my pet fungus over there . I was about to water her when you came in . I think you 'll find you can ignore me . POWIE ( To Flash , softly . ) Did you hear what he said . ( To Keith . ) You 're a very well-spoken individual . KATE What ! FLASH Oh , hi , Kate . ( Pause . ) Well , here we are . Inside . Just standing here bantering sociably . POWIE ( Out of the blue . ) The neighborhood offers an impressive diversity of social attractions , from the religious to the educational . ( To Flash . ) That did n't feel right . p. 13 KATE Look , you two , as long as you 're in here , why do n't you come all the way in and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) FLASH Make yourselves at home . Very good . ( Still giggling . ) KATE " Come on in and make yourselves at home ? " Just off the cuff I 'd say that 's pretty unfunny . POWIE Yeah , but you do n't know what our home is like . FLASH You have no idea . POWIE You have no idea . FLASH That 's the truth , too . KATE What the hell is it , underwater or something ? POWIE ( Confused . ) No . At least , I do n't think so . Is it ? FLASH It was n't when we left . KEITH That was a joke , fellows . My wife was just being hilarious . FLASH Oh , a joke . ( Polite laugh . ) KATE Look , did you want something ? POWIE Very kind of you to offer . We could n't . FLASH Much too early in the day . p. 14 KATE Guys , what 's up , huh ? You come barging in here like a couple of retarded ping-pong balls what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , fellows . FLASH ( To Powie . ) We 've messed it up . I told you we should have practised more . POWIE ( To Flash . ) How was I supposed to know they were so advanced in the realm of social intercourse . FLASH Boy , we 're up to our necks in it . Come on . ( Flash and Powie start out , Powie rehearsing under his breath . ) POWIE We just moved in next door and yeah , that 's it . ( To Keith and Kate . ) Excuse us . ( Flash and Powie exit . ) KATE What the hell was that all ab  --  ( A knock on the door . ) KEITH Well , what do you know . More visitors . We must be the new fun couple . Shall I open it ? KATE You stay right where you are , fat-ears , I 'll get it . ( Kate does n't move . ) KEITH Well ? KATE Whatever you 're up to , Keith , it wo n't work . ( Kate opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors . POWIE We just moved in next door and thought we might just drop in and get acquainted . FLASH May we drop in ? KATE Yeah , all right , drop in . ( They step inside . ) POWIE If it 's OK with you we 'd like to forget about that last visit . We were n't prepared for the quality of company we found , I 'm Powie , pleased to meet you . FLASH I 'm Flash . Those are n't our real names , but we think they 're pretty nifty . POWIE ( Pause . ) You have a lovely place here , Kate and Keith . FLASH Modern , but somehow tastefully traditional . ( To Powie . ) Quick , try it now . POWIE The neighborhood offers an impressive diversity of social attractions , from the religious to the educational . FLASH We want to sit down over there , OK ? KATE Sure , sit down , fall around , make yourselves at home . ( Flash and Powie start giggling again . ) POWIE Here we go again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLASH No , you , Powie . ( To Kate and Keith . ) I 'm no good at explanations . My forte 's cooking and biochemistry . POWIE Well , our house , you know . It 's all full of stuff . You should see it . We got dumbells , go-go bells , sculpture bell handles , sissy squat bars , horizontal dipping bars , iron boots , head straps , twist-a-wrist arm bombers , abdominal boards , curling benches , twisters , press mats , benches , wristrollers , revolving sleeves , swimming pool , trampoline , boat , tennis rackets , skis , javelin , hammer and just crates and crates of pure , triple E formula 3RX one hundred per cent cold pressed wheat germ oil for maximum stamina and muscle definition . I think that 's it . FLASH Yeah , that 's everything . POWIE See , we do kneebends at home . ( Pause . ) Kneebends , you know . ( He demonstrates . ) FLASH And butterflies . ( Demonstrates . ) POWIE And push-ups . ( Demonstrates . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demonstrates . They get carried away and end in a laughing heap . They become aware of Kate and Keith staring incredulously , and are suddenly shy and embarrassed . ) That 's why we thought it was so funny when you said make yourselves at home . p. 17 KEITH It was . It was a highly comic situation , do n't you think so , Kate . KATE Killing . Just killing . KEITH She loves your sense of humor , already , fellows . She 's something of a wit herself , my wife . You 've made a solid hit with her . Go make coffee , Kate . POWIE Oh , heavens , no , we simply could n't . KEITH I did n't ask you . I asked my wife . Go make coffee for the menfolk , Kate . Do n't worry . She loves to make coffee . Pots and pots of it , all day long . She loves throwing it out , too . Making it and throwing it out . One pot after the other . It 's a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? FLASH Do you really like to make coffee ? KATE I 'm wild about it . Do you want some ? FLASH Well , perhaps just a drop . POWIE Heck , why not . Live dangerously . Two cups of coffee , coming up . Hahahahahaha . ALL Hahahahahahaha . ( Suddenly stop . ) KEITH Is that all , Kate . What about all the questions . She has this riotous routine worked out when you ask her for coffee . You 'd split a gut if you heard it . Hahahaha. p. 18 ALL Hahahahahaha . KEITH Hahahaha . Go make coffee for the menfolk , hahahaha . Go on , hahaha . Get out . Hahaha . ( The laughter stops . Kate , scowling in the kitchen doorway , turns and exits . The three men , left alone , exchange awkward glances . ) Nice socks . BOTH Whose , his or mine ? KEITH ( Quickly . ) Both . Both nice socks . All four . POWIE We 're glad you like them . I speak for both of us . KEITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like it ? KEITH Wild about it . Very sheek . ( He means chic . ) Nice . POWIE I like your clothing too . FLASH So do I , very much . We all like each other 's clothing . That 's important . KEITH Look , fellows , you do n't mind if I just blow the works and ask a personal question , do you ? FLASH You need n't bother . We get the same thing everywhere we go . Tell him , Powie . POWIE First , Keith , let me explain that we are n't surprised you find it strange . We debated the whole thing . Should we , should n't we , but in the end , you know , with the new apartment and everything . It 's a chaos back there , so we thought it was best to leave them at home for now . p. 19 FLASH Frankly , we think they 're better off there . KEITH Yeah , right , well I 'm a little slow , you see . FLASH Hey , Powie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new neighborhood . Maybe people around here think it 's an insult to come visiting without them . Keith , are you insulted ? KEITH No , not at all . Just wondered is all . FLASH We 'll bring them next time we come , OK ? KEITH Suit yourself . FLASH Hey , then we can come again ? KEITH Sure , move in if you like . ( jokingly . ) You could keep her busy ( Suddenly serious . Has an idea . ) FLASH Hey , Powie , did you hear ? We can come again . POWIE Yeah , I think it 's going very well . FLASH Look , when we bring them , I want to warn you before hand , do n't pay too much attention to them at first . They have to get adjusted to company . They 're very self-conscious about being twins . POWIE Born within a minute of each other , and we married them in the same sequence . p. 20 KEITH Oh , wives , wives , of course , how stupid of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up a song about our wives . We 'll sing it for you . ( They sing raucously and with abandon . ) BOTH Flash and Powie married twins.E-I-E-I-O.They lived at home quite happily.E-I-E-I-O.With a kiss-kiss here , a hug-hug there , Here a kiss , there a hug , everywhere a kiss-hug . Flash and Powie married twins , E-I-E-I-O . POWIE We took the tune from Old MacDonald had a farm , E-I-E-I-O , but we changed the words to fit our own domestic situation . It was Flash 's idea to change the words . What 's the matter , Keith ? KEITH ( Thinking still . ) What ? Oh , nothing , nothing . FLASH Did n't you like the song ? KEITH I loved the song . Very folksy . FLASH So what 's wrong ? POWIE ( Confidentially . ) He 's insulted , Flash . I told you we should have brought them along . FLASH I beg your pardon , Powie , but I told you . p. 21 KEITH No , fellows , believe me . I mean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I really would , but POWIE Then we 'll get them . KEITH Really , Flash , Powie , why do n't you sit down and FLASH It 's settled then , I 'll get them . KEITH Please do n't bother . FLASH No bother at all . Two minutes , biff , boom , bam . KEITH Sit down , Powie FLASH He 's Powie . I 'm Flash . KEITH Flash , then . FLASH Yep , be right back . KEITH I DO N'T WANT TO MEET YOUR STINKING TWIN WIVES . POWIE ( Lifts something heavy and smashes it , then calmly . ) That was n't very nice , Keith . KEITH No , it was n't . It was a lousy thing to say and I 'm quite sincerely sorry , believe me . I got carried away is all . FLASH What 's the matter ? KEITH Well , goddammit look at you . Just look at you . Why ? How come , that 's all I want to know . FLASH How come ? p. 22 KEITH Yeah , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . POWIE You asked us something , Keith . It 's not good manners to stop half way through an inquiry , guests or no guests . FLASH It 's a universal insult . I do n't like the idea of having an insulting neighbor , do you ? POWIE Not me , I do n't like the idea . FLASH That makes both of us , which means you had better tell us the rest of the question quickly before one of us goes berserk and does something we 'd all regret . KEITH Easy now . All I wanted to know is , why the nifty shirts . ( Flash and Powie exchange glances . ) POWIE Keith , does this look like a shirt to you ? KEITH No , that 's what I meant POWIE We 're not wearing shirts , Keith . We 're naked from the waist upwards , as any reasonable person can see . Now why did you ask if we were wearing shirts ? FLASH And do n't get the impression you can treat us like fools just because you function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 POWIE Do n't get that impression . KEITH IT 'S AN EXPRESSION . I meant all I meant was , why are n't you wearing any shirts ? FLASH Because they would tend to cover our nakedness . POWIE They would obscure our biceps and pectorals and abdominals . FLASH Ca n't you see we 're proud of them . I mean , you have to admit , they 're not bad as muscles go . POWIE You have to admit that , do n't you ? They 're nice muscles . KEITH Oh , yes , very nice . Nice muscles . POWIE I hope you 're not just saying that , Keith . I hope you really mean it . KEITH I admire your muscles . Flash and Powie . I stand in deep awe of your muscles . FLASH Do you really appreciate how much they mean to us ? KEITH Absolutely . FLASH Oh man , we 're really going to enjoy living next door to you . KEITH Listen , fellows , as long as we 're getting all thick and heavy , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , huh ? BOTH Sure , shoot . p. 24 KEITH Well , you 've already met the man-eating plant I keep around the house . Do you think you might be able to take her off my hands for a while , just long enough for me to make a ( Kate enters with coffee . ) KATE Coffee , coffee , coffee . Well , what were we scheming while Katy brewed the beans , hm ? KEITH Our new neighbors here , Flash and Powie , were telling me all about how they married twins . Each married one of them . My wife likes me to be accurate about such things . And about how they left them back at the gymnasium when they came to visit . And guess what else they were saying . Just guess . They said they 'd really love to tell you all about their muscles . KATE Well how about if I just do n't want to hear about their muscles . KEITH Come , dewdrop , let 's not make a bad impression on the nice neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you had quite a thing about flesh . Would n't you like to go over there and touch it ? Would n't you like a nice little feel , Kate ? Do n't tell me you 're afraid of a little flesh . Look , they 're dying to have their muscles stroked are n't you , fellows . ( Between his teeth . ) Come on , get her off my hands . FLASH ( Shy . ) Would you like to hear about our muscles , Kate ? p. 25 KATE Yeah , all right . What about them ? FLASH Well , we name our muscles , the way some people name pets or summer houses . For instance , I call this one Lido Beach . It 's a left pectoral . The other is the Riviera . POWIE I call mine the same way . This bicep is Cape Kennedy . The other is Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom . It 's from a seed catalogue . Do you like those names ? KATE Yeah , stunning names . Great . POWIE Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead just to get the feel of things we do n't mind if you touch them . We 're used to it . KEITH ( Watching anxiously . ) Go on , Kate , do n't be shy . FLASH Heck , yes , go right ahead . How about you , Keith ? ( Keith is heading quickly towards his typewriter . ) KEITH What ? Oh , no , thanks anyway . Kate will keep you busy , do n't worry . POWIE Suit yourself . FLASH ( To Kate . ) That 's a bicep . Go on , you can touch it . KATE Not bad . FLASH That 's a pectoral . p. 26 KATE Mmmmm , nice . FLASH These we call abdominals . There 's a separate name for each one . KATE Wowie , hard as rock . Nice . ( Kate is getting excited while Flash maintains a detached , critical attitude . Flash suddenly spots Kate 's buttock muscle . ) FLASH That 's a lovely buttock muscle , Kate . You should be very proud of it . Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density of this glutius maximus . ( Powie joins the two and starts kneading Kate 's ass . ) POWIE Wow , that 's beautiful . And look at the taper , Flash . Are these all your own muscles , Kate . I mean , natural , unexercised ? KATE ( Giggling . ) All my very own . Yippee . FLASH Hey , what are you doing , Kate ? Kate , stop . That 's personal . Hey , Kate , that 's vulgar . Get away . ( They push Kate back . ) POWIE What 's the matter , Flash ? FLASH She started doing that thing with me . POWIE Kate , he 's a married man . FLASH ( Disgusted . ) How can you expect to appreciate a muscle when you 're doing that thing . A muscle is a thing apart . p. 27 KATE What are you talking about ? I was just getting into the spirit . KEITH ( Under his breath . ) She was just warming up . Give her half a chance . POWIE ( Calming Flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let bygones be bygones . FLASH OK . Well , what did you think of them ? KATE Nice . Whew , they were all right FLASH Symmetry ? KATE Symmetry ? Oh , yes , symmetry , very nice symmetry . POWIE What do you think , Flash ? Can we ask her ? Do you think she 'll be impartial ? FLASH That 's going out on a limb , Powie . I do n't know . I just do n't know . KATE What , guys ? Go on , ask me . I 'll answer anything . POWIE It 's no trifling matter , Kate . It 's a critical opinion we want . You ca n't get personal . KATE Go ahead , try me . POWIE All right . ( Flash and Powie exchange looks , then solemnly strike poses . ) Now be perfectly objective , and do n't worry about making one of us feel bad . We just want to know . Whose muscles are better , his or mine ? p. 28 FLASH We got ta know , Kate , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're always improving . POWIE Which ? KATE You know what ? Old Kate ca n't make up her little mind . I mean , I do n't think I brought a sufficiently critical attitude to that last feel . KEITH Conscientious old Kate . KATE You keep out of this , rabbit-ears . You see , I mean if I 'm being called on to give an accurate opinion , it might be best if I had a nice long contact , one at a time . FLASH All right . But watch that thing . POWIE And no favoritism , Brother , I ca n't stand favoritism in the realm of muscles . A muscle for muscle 's sake . ( Kate starts feeling Flash again . Powie makes his way to Keith at the typewriter . ) Hi , Keith , what are you doing ? KEITH Playing pool . POWIE ( Threatening . ) That 's not pool , Keith . KEITH Look , Flash POWIE I 'm Powie . KEITH Powie , then . I 'm writing , is all . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm writing for all I 'm worth , all right . p. 29 POWIE What ? Letters ? KEITH No . POWIE Shopping list ? KEITH No . POWIE Invitations ? KEITH No . POWIE Memoirs ? KEITH No . POWIE Limericks ? KEITH No . POWIE Aphorisms ? KEITH No , Powie , no . POWIE Am I getting warm ? KEITH I 'm writing the first sentence of a novel . POWIE Novel ? You write novels ? KEITH Let 's say I try to write novels . Yes , with the aid of my lizard friend , there . When she comes up for air she 'll tell you all about it in great length and detail , I have no doubt at all . POWIE ( Wildly excited , pulling Flash and Kate apart . ) Flash , Flash excuse me , ' Kate , we 'll get back to that in a minute . Flash , did you hear that ? Did you hear what Keith just said ? He 's writing a novel . He 's a novelist . You know what that means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bach and Richard Rodgers . p. 30 FLASH He creates ? He 's a creator ? POWIE We 've been visiting an artist family all this time and we never even knew it . FLASH I 'd give all the muscles in the world to create . KATE Oh , brother , what kind of billowing blue horseshit have you been slinging . KEITH No horseshit , Kate . They asked I mean , one of them , I think it was Powie , yes , Powie , asked me what I was doing while you and Flash there were discussing the dead sea scrolls , and I told him . I told him I was writing the first sentence of a novel . Now I did n't say it was a good novel , so you can skip that bit when you start in about how badly I write . I just said I was trying to write a novel . KATE And how . And what a novel he is trying to write . Ten years in the making and that 's just the first sentence . FLASH Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEITH The thing is , my wife tends to edit away most of my work . All of it , in fact . POWIE Well , then , what 's that in the typewriter ? KEITH Ah , well now this is something KATE It 's the six millionth beginning of a lurid new pot-boiler , about boy scout knots . p. 31 POWIE Phew , that 's a big one all right , I mean , I stopped at the clove hitch , but I know there 's a lot more to it than that . FLASH It 's a gigantic theme , all right . A Charles Atlas of a theme . Come on , let 's hear it . KATE You want to ? Do you really want a taste of what old slop fingers can do with the English tongue ? How 's this for kicks ( She rips out the page . ) KEITH I would n't , Kate . You 're not going to like it . KATE That goes without saying , Lover . ( She reads , finally moved . ) " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover what I always feared to admit , that I too must inevitably succumb to the unhappiness of this pitiful race called mankind . " POWIE Gee whiz . That is epic . I know just what you mean , too . I could n't say it like that , of course , but I 'm no artist . FLASH Something went " sploing " inside me , and I know I 'll just never be the same again . KEITH Did you like it ? FLASH Like it ? Can one employ such a feeble word ? It had a cosmic ring of sadness , a great truth that can not help but touch the most insensitive of readers . Jeepers , did you hear what I just said ? p. 32 POWIE I just hope you can find some way to tie it in with the boy scout knots/ KATE You stole that , Keith . I 've heard it before . POWIE All great truths are redundant . Wow , get me . KEITH Sorry , Kate , you tried that one once before . This time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powie , do n't you believe him . He could n't write a sentence like that in a million years . It 's not his style . It does n't make you sort of heave inside and break out in tiny bumps on the tongue . That 's how you can tell his style . FLASH Kate , you 're talking about a novelist . KATE That ! You want to hear some original Keith ? You want me to show you something with the real stamp of Keith on it ? KEITH You 've thrown it all away , Kate . This is all I have to show . This is my beginning , fragrance . ( Kate ruffles through the wastebacket in a desperate effort to find some earlier work . Keith sits with Flash and Powie , who treat him like a god . ) POWIE Keith , look into our eyes . No , deep inside , behind the surface . What do you see there ? KEITH Nothing . p. 33 POWIE Sadness , Keith , sadness , do n't you see it ? Novelists always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , Keith . We are well , profoundly sad is putting it mildly . We 're sick unto death . KEITH ( Amused . ) Yeah , OK , I believe you . FLASH I think we can tell him , Powie . I think , I really think he 'll understand . POWIE We 've gone this far . To stop now would be dishonest and undignified . FLASH You 're right , Keith , I do n't know how to tell you this , Keith , but I 'm gon na bomb and blitz ' till it 's all on the table . It started oh , man , how can you say when a thing like this began . Maybe when I was a kid . Wow , is this ever difficult . POWIE Look at him , Flash . Does he look like a guy that 's going to hold it against us ? FLASH ( Deeply . ) No . Forgive me for doubting , Keith . What I 'm trying to say is I used to have this terrible urge . I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was this overwhelming ambition to sell encyclopedias . There . It 's out . I know , Keith , you could take one look at me and find it funny , I know . I have n't got any illusions about my natural endowments , but this one desire colored my entire existence , Keith , and I mean , what is life if you ca n't dream a little . But , you know , a thing like that , selling encyclopedias , door to door well , many are called , but a few chosen . p. 34 POWIE My thing was to breed goldfish . Have n't you ever had that feeling , Keith , a kind of , I do n't know , weakening at the knees when you come across a pure strain of Shubunkin or Calico Fantail . FLASH But life just sort of overtook us , Keith . It just drew us the way of all flesh . Marriage , responsibility , and body-building . Oh , sure , we can still smile a little . We can still pluck a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our muscles , after all . But when the twin wives sit there in the den and watch us exercising , we can see it in their four eyes . The reproach . That look that says , " Boys , we 'll love you because you are what you are , but you have compromised . " POWIE We always thought we were the two most miserable creatures in the world , but it is n't true . You 've held open the door for us . FLASH You 've shown us the larger , eternal truth . Man , I 'm really flying . KATE Hey , what about the muscles . I have n't had a chance to feel his yet FLASH Kate , this is an aesthetic moment . Let 's not talk of fleshly things . KATE Awww , come on , fellows , just a little touch-touch ? Please , just a few more minutes . Either one , I do n't care . POWIE Kate , why are you so anxious to feel our muscles ? p. 35 KATE You started it , damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hysterical . ) I need more . FLASH Keith , your wife is a wanton woman . I did n't want to tell you before . We were guests , you understand . But her behavior bordered on the sensual . POWIE Sensual , hell , let 's call a spade a spade . It was out and out erotic . KATE Keith , get them out of here . KEITH Would you two consider another cup of coffee ? FLASH You 're too kind . A novelist and a sterling host . KATE Get them out , Keith . I 'll scream , so help me I will . POWIE If it would n't be too much trouble , would you mind reading the sentence for us once more before we go ? KATE NO ! ( She lunges at the paper , tears it up and begins screaming . ) POWIE It 's that noise again . ( Powie snaps . He rages around the room throwing furniture around and breaking things . Flash grabs Kate around the throat . ) FLASH Stop , Kate , stop that noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith , please , help me ! I 'm begging you . p. 36 KEITH FELLOWS , STOP ! ( They stop instantly . ) POWIE Wow , what happened ? FLASH It 's OK . It was that noise . Keith , I 'm sorry . He 's like that . He ca n't stand that noise . We heard it just before we came in and the same thing happened . Bang . He snapped . Ripped out your cement doorstep . I 'm sorry , Keith , we 'll replace it . He 's very sensitive . POWIE Hey , Flash , where 's the sentence ? KATE I tore it up . ( Powie starts to snap again and lunges at Kate . ) KEITH Do n't worry , fellows . Powie ! POWIE ( Rage . ) She destroyed the sentence . The most beautiful sentence I ever heard . KEITH Actually I memorized the sentence in anticipation of just such an outbreak of rampant affection on the part of my wife . FLASH Look , Keith , it 's going to take Powie a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell your wife to leave us alone while you recite , because he might flip again and kill her . KEITH Perfectly understandable . Kate was just about to make coffee anyway , were n't you , dewdrop ? p. 37 KATE You son of a bitch . ( Powie 's eyes flicker again . ) I 'm sorry . I did n't mean it . KEITH You 're what ? ( Kate backs towards the kitchen . ) KATE I 'm I 'm sorry . ( She exits into the kitchen . ) KEITH I 'll be damned . That 's the first time . The very first time . POWIE OK . Now you can recite . FLASH Recite , recite , recite . KEITH Once upon a time I was a promising writer . Can you believe that ? Of course you can . You 'll believe anything . I was praised and published in a minor journal , true , but what difference to a young writer as full of hope as I seem to remember I once upon a time was . All I ever wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I could reign supreme in silence and write . Then one day , oh , many centuries ago , Kate spotted me on one of her daily jaunts to the veterinarian to have her hair done . I was enchanted by the fetching way she filed her teeth to sharp points so I stood and watched , and before I knew it , she 'd struck up an uncharacteristically friendly conversation with me , starting with a rabbit punch between the legs , and ending with a halfnelson . And lo , and behold , when I awoke , imagine my surprise upon finding my ego neatly pinned to the ground at each corner with four slightly larger than medium-sized safe-deposit boxes . p. 38 FLASH Wow , our courtship was much different . KEITH Yes , well , I was young then , and did n't fully realize that the knife and fork which Katie had the strange habit of carrying around with her everywhere was intended for me . Yes , I just lay there and laughed and laughed , and she just sat down and dug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken to discover one day upon looking downwards towards where my feet used to be , that there was nothing left . And do n't get the idea that Kate , after such a heady entree , was by any means sated . No . ( Kate sticks her head out of the kitchen door . ) KATE Keith , I want to KEITH We 'll call you when we want you , Kate . ( Kate exits . ) See , still hungry . FLASH Hey , you do n't mind if we move around , do you ? KEITH Go wild . Lay an egg . It 's almost over anyway . That 's how it is . Kate nibbles and I I look around for new bits and pieces she 's missed . There always seems to be a new corner somewhere , but Kate has a fine eye for meat . And that 's the story of how Kate and Keith lived sadly ever after . Until today , that is . Yes , today , for some reason I found words . She turned her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 FLASH Say it , say it KEITH With the long passing of a single painful day , I discover what I 've always feared to admit , that I must inevitably succumb to the unhappiness of this pitiful race called mankind . Chapter one . FLASH ( Exhausted . ) I ca n't find words . POWIE What a day , huh ? May we pay another visit some day , Keith . KEITH Sure . The door 's always open . FLASH Do you think this might be the first step in an acquaintance ? KEITH You may consider me an intimate friend . POWIE Oh man , intimate friends of a novelist . Wow . FLASH Wait a minute , Powie . Words are easy . Especially for a novelist . He has n't even agreed to you know . POWIE Yeah . Well , we have to ask sooner or later . Keith , if you really mean what you said about being our friend , you wo n't say no to this . Can we keep the monkey bars out there , just for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEITH Flash and Powie , I 'll be honored to have your Monkey Bars outside my window . FLASH You wo n't mind the neighbors . I mean , it 'll be known that you 're keeping our company . Would you be willing to countenance a sceptical eyebrow for our friendship . p. 40 KEITH You 're welcome to pour a cement foundation and set those monkey bars for all eternity in my front yard . POWIE Flash , we 've done it . We 've made contact . FLASH Yeah , our first taste of upward social mobility . Right . Exercise time . Happy , happy exercise time , thanks to you , Keith . ( Flash and Powie start out . They turn . ) POWIE If she ever tampers with art again , we 're right next door . ( They exit . Kate , almost immediately , comes through the kitchen with some coffee for Keith . ) KEITH Funny how you can get to like almost anyone in time . Nice neighbors . Unusual . KATE ( Setting down the coffee . ) All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fat explanation coming to me ( Keith slowly pours the coffee out of the cup on to the tray . ) Now why the hell did you do that ? KEITH Just playing it by ear , Kate . We 'll set a routine in a few weeks . Make another pot . Go on . ( Kate rips the fresh sheet out of the typewriter . She reads Keith 's latest sentence . It 's good . Keith looks up at her . ) What 's the matter , Kate . No chuckles left . All gone ? p. 41 KATE ( Like a child . ) All gone . ( They regard each other carefully , Kate begins to smile , and when Keith smiles back she thinks everything is forgotten . As she goes to kiss him , he halts her abruptly with a cold command . ) KEITH Coffee , Kate , ( She starts towards the kitchen , turns and with tears just manages to squeak out ) KATE Bastard ( As the lights dim on Keith , typing happily. )     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
