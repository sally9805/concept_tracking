Like the distant thunder that precedes a monsoonal line squall , the rumble of Communist guns last week signaled an end to the long lull in Viet Nam 's ground war . Moving out in strength from their jungle strongholds for the first time in nine weeks , the Viet Cong struck in half a dozen spots-and only the hard , hot application of U.S. air power saved Saigon 's forces from severe defeat . <P> The first Red lightning bolt struck at <P> Songbe , a scruffy cluster of hamlets atop a bluff just 75 miles northeast of Saigon . As the capital of Phuoc Long province , Songbe ( pop . 2,000 ) was a perfect target for the Communists , who would like to capture a governmental seat and proclaim their own " provisional government " - thus permitting Communist and nonaligned sympathizers to recognize their regime . <P> Tight Clutch . Songbe ( literally " Little River " ) was defended by a force of 1,000 Vietnamese Rangers , militiamen and U.S. Special Force advisers . Two days before the assault , the Rangers captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force numbering nearly 2,500 men had moved into the area and was preparing an attack . Though the Songbe garrison intensified its guard , it was n't enough . In the dark beyond midnight , while the sky intermittently flared with lightning , the Reds attacked . <P> Mortar and howitzer shells crunched into military compounds , while Viet Cong riflemen , clad only in khaki shorts , swept into the heart of the village . Setting up machine guns and 57-mm. recoilless rifles on an open helicopter pad , they slashed at the barracks , mess halls and headquarters of the Songbe garrison . Said one American survivor : " It looked like the Fourth of July . " Five Communists slipped through the perimeter beyond the U.S. compound , but four were gunned down . One managed to reach the mess hall and flip in a hand grenade . Special Forces Sergeant Horace Young , 34 , who was already wounded in the leg , tried to bat the grenade away with his rifle butt . It exploded , tearing his arm to ribbons . Streaming blood , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : his Special Forces knife . There he found the Viet Cong grenadier , stabbed him and died . When Young 's body was found hunched in the corner of the storeroom the following morning , the knife was clutched so tightly in his hand that it could not be removed . <P> Siesta 's End . First light brought waves of U.S. B57 Canberra jets and prop-driven Skyraiders , which swept in under 800-ft. cloud cover to napalm , rocket and strafe the Viet Cong out of town . Final toll : 161 government troops ( including five U.S. ) , to 184 Viet Cong killed . In spite of its obvious propaganda value , the Communists had been unable to hold the provincial capital . <P> But if air power merely saved the day at Songbe , it turned the tide completely in the Mekong Delta province of Bac Lieu , 100 miles to the southwest . In a sharply executed " search-and-destroy " operation , U.S. and South Vietnamese planes spotted a concentration of some 600 Viet Cong in a dried-out paddyfield , then pinned them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , lashed by rockets and napalm , the Communists finally broke and ran . " It was like shooting fish in a barrel , " said one U.S. adviser .
