In 1946 , Winston Churchill journeyed to the small Missouri town of Fulton to accept an honorary degree from little-known Westminster College . His acceptance speech made Fulton a historic site . " From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic , " Churchill said , " an iron curtain has descended across the Continent . " To combat the forces that lurked behind it , he proposed a " fraternal association " between the U.S. and Great Britain . <P> Seeking to commemorate the occasion , Westminster began looking for a memorial in 1961 . The college decided that nothing could be more appropriate than a church designed by Sir Christopher Wren . As surveyor to King Charles II , Wren had rebuilt London after the Great Fire of 1666 , creating out of its ashes a new city-as indomitable an assertion of man 's stubborn will to survive as was Churchill 's trumpeted defiance when the bombs fell on Wren 's London during World War II . <P> Bold Virtuosity . Wren 's must have been one of the most sizable architectural commissions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he over saw the design and construction of St. Paul 's Cathedral , Chelsea Hospital , most of Greenwich Hospital , portions of Hampton Court , and many lesser secular buildings . His most sustained performance was to design and rebuild the 55 churches destroyed in the fire . <P> Trained as a mathematician and astronomer at Oxford , Wren used an empirical approach to architecture . In general , he kept to the Gothic tradition , with steeples and layers of construction piling upward , but to this he added French , Flemish and Italian Baroque as it suited his purpose , pleased his fancy , or kindled his architectural imagination . He might be called a virtuoso of the eclectic . St. Paul 's combines coupled columns from the Louvre with the triple-layered dome of Mansart 's Hotel des Invalides . It served as a model for the U.S. Capitol dome . At St. Mary leBow , he placed a pyramidal spire atop a Renaissance balustrade atop an antique classical temple , all atop a belfry that stands slightly catercorner from the church itself . <P> End of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on was St. Mary the Virgin , which was more simple , restrained and less celebrated than some of Wren 's other churches . Still , in many ways it has a classical elegance equaled by few . The church was built on the foundations of an earlier church ; its facade was constructed with a triangular pediment surmounting a Romanesque window flanked by Baroque volutes . The slim neo-Romanesque belfry contained five bells and was surmounted by a lead-sheathed clock tower . <P> On the night of Dec. 29 , 1940 , St. Mary took a direct hit during one of the Luftwaffe 's heaviest air blitzes . Only the stone walls and the twelve Corinthian columns that had lined its spare interior remained aloft . After the war , the Diocese of London decided not to rebuild the church , since it stood in what had become the financial district of London . Too few parishioners lived within the old city 's boundaries to attend it . Instead , the church was scheduled to be razed for a city redevelopment project - until dilemma and opportunity met in Westminster 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
