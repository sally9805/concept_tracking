French builders have traditionally been plagued by lagging technology , rigid construction codes and indifferent workers . Now even their ancestors seem to be conspiring against them . Almost everywhere the builders excavate for foundations , it seems , they uncover new and exciting archaeological ruins that Minister of Culture Andr Malraux deems more important than any immediate construction . <P> In Nice , Malraux ordered that work on a new luxury apartment building be delayed to give archaeologists a chance to probe the remnants of a prehistoric village unearthed on the site . Last year he halted construction of an important urban-renewal project in downtown Marseille and unleashed the archaeologists when power shovels uncovered massive fortifications built by Greeks during the 6th century B.C. Malraux has now struck again , using his influence to prevent the Rhne River town of Vienne from building a secondary school over what may well be the most important Roman ruins ever discovered in France . <P> Unseemly Haste . Alarmed last year when ten acres of farm land across the Rhne from Vienne was acquired for the badly needed school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probe beneath a peach orchard , suspecting that it covered ancient ruins of Roman Vienne . Three feet beneath the surface , on their first try , they found a colorful Roman mosaic . They alerted Malraux , then , with his support , proceeded to excavate five acres of the orchard with almost unseemly haste , hoping to prove the historical value of the site before the townspeople of Vienne could realize that their new school was in danger . <P> What they found exceeded their most optimistic hopes . They have uncovered a dozen luxurious villas , a tannery and dyeing factory , a highway and complex sewer and heating systems , all of which confirmed that Vienne was once a thriving Roman colony . Wealthy citizens decorated their homes with multicolored mosaics , 15 different kinds of marble , elaborate basins and fishponds . Because the town was often threatened by the flooding Rhne , there were drainage ditches six feet deep between each villa . To protect salt and wheat stored in villa storerooms from dampness , Vienne 's architects partially buried between 50 and 60 empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus infiltrating waters would trap air in each , providing a dry-air barrier beneath the storerooms . <P> Warm Walls . The diggers discovered a section of the ancient Vienne-Lyon highway consisting of irregular granite paving stones three feet thick interspersed with limestone blocks . Holes cut in the limestone enabled inspectors to keep an eye on the sewer system underneath . The Romans had also anticipated the roadside refreshment stand by building a bar at the edge of the road , complete with earthen vases in which beverages were kept cool . A chariot driver could pull up to the bar and drink standing up while his horses drank at an adjacent fountain .
