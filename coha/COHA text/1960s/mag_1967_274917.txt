The War Game , Suppose the Bomb were dropped on England . Who would survive ? What would daily life be like ? Would the living envy the dead ? <P> Focusing on a handful of ordinary citizens in Kent , this 47-minute film begins with coolly British preparations for a conventional war-rational rationing , orderly evacuation to the safe suburbs . Abruptly , a nuclear bomb explodes off-camera . The screen whitens with the flash , then rumbles with the shock wave . The sound , intones an off-screen narrator , is " like an enormous door slamming in hell . " Children with seared eyes grope for help , fires rage incessantly , food riots begin . The police execute looters-and then turn on the hopelessly ill , shooting them down like horses as they writhe outside the hospital that can no longer help them . At last , apathy envelops the populace like a thick London fog . Asked what they want to be when they grow up , little boys listlessly reply , " I do n't want to be nothin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 31 , The War Game was commissioned by BBC-TV ( which eventually decided that it was too gruesome for home viewing ) , and won an Oscar as the year 's best feature documentary . For the most part , Watkins plays his horror story straight and as close to reality as possible : scenes showing the collapse of order , for instance , are based on the record of civilian be havior at Hiroshima , Dresden and other cities devastated during World War II . Sometimes , though , Watkins ' passion for peace leads him into moments of maudlin melodramatics . At film 's end , the sound track unconvincingly takes the press and television to task for supposedly refusing to discuss the possibilities of nuclear war , and asks : " Is there a real hope to be found in this silence ? " And one scene of nuclear holocaust is accompanied by the strains of Silent Night , ludicrously amplifying a potential tragedy that certainly needs no enlargement .                  @ @ @
