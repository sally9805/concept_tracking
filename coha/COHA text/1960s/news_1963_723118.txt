txt Letters to The Times pg . 34 Letters to The Times Military Pay Rise Urged Citing Inequities , Senator Asks for Wage on Par With Industry To THE EDITOR Of THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was pleased to read your recent editorial " Higher Military Pay . " It is right on point in calling for military pay comparable to private workers and Federal classified employes . Last year , as second ranking minority member on the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee , I helped to draft the pay-raise act for Federal classified employes , wherein for the first time pay scales comparable with private industry were approved . Even so , this year the President has asked Congress to raise Federal classified workers ' pay to bring it even closer to levels in private industry . Now that the principle of comparability has been established for Federal classified workers , it should be extended to military personnel as well . We have only to look at some examples to be convinced that military pay is far out of line with comparable work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose only responsibility is to deliver messages , now make more money than young officers flying jet planes and standing watches on multimillion-dollar Navy vessels . A reactor operator on the nuclearpowered cruiser Long Beach , a second-class petty officer , receives $397 a month . But the civilian doing the same job on the U.S. Maritime Commission 's ' nuclear-powered ship Savannah receives more than $1,200 a month with overtime . High Turnover Low pay is one reason for the great personnel ' turnover in our armed forces . The re-enlistment rate for first termers is only 25 per cent . Every year one-fifth of all our enlisted men leave the service . This high turnover is expensive to the Goverment . Pay scales for military personnel have not been increased since 1958 , although the cost of living has gone up 51/2 per cent . Many enlisted men and officers in the lower ranks receive pay that is near subsistence level . Today there are more than 2,680 , - 000 military personnel on active duty in our armed forces . We depend on them to defend us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decent pay on a par with civilian Government workers and employes in private industry . HIRAM L. FONG , U.S. Senator from Hawaii . Washington , May 12 , 1963 . Maremont 's Ouster Political To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your May 2 editorial " Birth Controller Fired " you state that " it is impossible not to believe that this Arnold H. Maremont 's birth control views was the real basis for his ouster . " To the contrary , it is impossible to believe that there was any other basis for his ouster than his violent attack on Republican State Senators on the grounds that some of them were anti-Negro because the Negroes generally return large majorities for Mayor Daley 's Cook County Democrats . Mr. Maremont 's views on birth control were well known between the time he was appointed by Governor Kerner in August last year and the time he was confirmed in this appointment by the State Senate last month . Our State Senate is not perfect , but it is ridiculous to say that it would confirm him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's views , which had been public knowledge as much as six months prior to the day of confirmation . JAMES R. HOLWAY . Chicago , May 8 , 1963 . Cleaning Metered Streets To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : What magic makes the city 's alternate-street parking signs and with them , presumably , its desire for street cleaning disappear the moment money-yielding parking meters are installed in a street ? MARY T. JONES . New York , May 9 , 1963 . Conquest by Machine To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Russell Baker , in his column in The Times of May 13 , discusses the problem of the clever machine . He says that these machines have seized jobs from millions of American workers , that they have taken virtually absolute control of the nation 's telephone system , and that at the Pentagon they regulate American defense planning . Mr. Baker indicates that he is disturbed by evidences of a developing intellect in the machine community , and he cites as evidence a " mischievous " machine that cuts an Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He indicates that there is a " great machine who is masterminding the conquest of man . . . . " And finally he says , " When der Tag arrives , the cyberneticists will be spared to oil the machines and replace their burned-out tubes . " I want you to know that Mr. Baker has made a bad mistake here , and that I am very mad about it . These . machines do not use tubes . They use transistors . WALTER C. JOHNSON , Professor of Electrical Engineering , Princeton University . Princeton , N. J. , May 13 , 1963 . Pope 's Encyclical It Marks No Change in Stand on Communism , Buckley Says To THE EDITOR OF Tux Nsw YORK TIMES : In. assuming ( May 6 editorial " What Kind of Victory ? " ) that Pope John Mail was talking about Communism when in his recent encyclical he spoke about the mediating impact of reality on ideologically inspired movements , you assume a lot more than some of us Catholics assume  --  for example , Father John Courtney Murray . He wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not sure just what ' historical movement ' the Pope chiefly had in mind . I suspect that it was Continental Socialism , whose primitive inspiration was largely atheist . Perhaps the Pope 's distinction has some relevance to the whole Marxist movement , but here its application would have carefully to be made . In any case , I should think that the distinction may be given full application in regard of the 18th- and 19th-century movements toward political freedom . " And on May 8 your own paper quotes L'Osservatore Romano , criticizing those who misconstrue the encyclical as suggesting a different position on Communism , as saying , " that the position s , of the Church toward Communism remained after ' Pacem in Terris ' what it always had been and that no compromise was possible because truth can not come to terms with error . " Cuban Crisis It is after all unlikely that the Pope should have chosen to remark the dilution of Communism 's revolutionary animus three months after the Soviet Union sneaked IRBM missiles and thermonuclear warheads to within a few miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West which brought us , to . quote The Times , to the brink of war . The Pope , with his exuberant concern for the welfare of all persons , has very special problems , you will agree , to which , in reciprocal charity , we should not add by polemically opportunistic raids on some of his vaguer language . Go ahead and make your points ' about the mellowing of the Communist world , which you are entitled to make , and which others , the Cubans , for example , are entitled not to heed ; but be a separated angel , and do n't co-opt the Pope for your point of view . WM . F. BUCKLEY , Jr . New York , May 8 , 1963 . Mr. Powers ' Beer Mug TOTEM EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am happy to be able to enlighten the White House . According to your issue of April 29 , they do not know the author of the lines that were inscribed on the silver . beer thug the President has given to David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are real : God , human folly and laughter . The first two are beyond our comprehension , So we must do what we can with the third . They were written by Aubrey Menen . They should have been in prose and not in verse , because they are the concluding words of his novel " The Ramayana . " PHILIP DALLAS . Rome , April 29 , 1963 . Encouraged by Birmingham To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Encouragement rather than depression or dismay would seem to be the realistic reaction to the unfortunate turmoil in Birmingham . In the old South where I spent my first 20 years there was no conflict . All was calm , but it was the calm of a whited sepulcher . To expect fundamental social change without some conflict is to show a very unhelpful naivet ? . Men of goodwill should spare no effort to minimize violence and hatred , but they must be prepared for a certain measure of it . GEORGE CRONEMILLER . New York , May 10 , 1963 ,     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
