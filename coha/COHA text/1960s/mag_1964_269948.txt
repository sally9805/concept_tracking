The glass looked as transparent as the standard windowpane , but scientists at the Manhattan meeting of the American Physical Society were impressed by its strange qualities . On brief exposure to sunlight the glass turned grey . Back in the shade , or in ordinary artificial light , it promptly turned clear as window glass again . <P> Chemist S. Donald Stookey of Corning Glass Works explained that the strange " photochromic " glass , which he had invented along with Dr. William H. Armistead , contains submicroscopic crystals of silver halide , 128 million billion of them per cubic inch . They do not affect its color or transparency , but strong visible or ultraviolet light turns the crystals to metallic silver , which absorbs light and makes the glass look grey . The same thing happens to the silver halide particles in photographic film , but their darkening is permanent . The silver atoms in the glass are held so tightly that they can not move away from the place where they were formed . When the light that creates them is cut oft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated , and the glass becomes transparent again . It can repeat the trick indefinitely ; some samples have already darkened and cleared many thousands of times without getting tired . <P> Corning says that its dark-light glass is still in the laboratory stage , but it is no mere scientific stunt , and Corning men are working hard on practical applications . Some possibilities : windows to keep solar light and heat out of air-conditioned buildings , auto windshields with an upper section treated to fend off glare by day and turn transparent when the sun is not shining , and sunglasses able automatically to adjust their density to light conditions .
