Grey-haired , bespectacled Washoe County District Court Judge Grant L. Bowen , 63 , sat in his chambers and peered out the window into Reno 's Virginia Street , hoping to catch a glimpse of the arriving plaintiff . " This is a great break for Reno , " he said to New York Daily News Correspondent Bill Berry . " It may mean Alabama-bound divorce seekers will come here again . " <P> The divorce seeker that morning was Mrs. Mary Todhunter Clark Rockefeller , 54 , who , after putting in the required six weeks of residence in Nevada , was ready to dissolve her marriage to New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller , 53-at his request . <P> At 8:48 a.m. , William K. Woodburn , Mrs. Rockefeller 's lawyer , walked into the county clerk 's office and filed Case No. 197,412 . It was a two-page complaint charging that Mrs. Rockefeller had been treated " with extreme cruelty , entirely mental in character , which caused the plaintiff great unhappiness and injured her general health . " He also asked that " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nevada law . <P> Two minutes later Kenneth P. Dillon , Nelson Rockefeller 's lawyer , filed the Governor 's reply , which he had sworn to under oath before a New York notary four weeks ago . It said , with utmost simplicity : " The defendant denies each and every , all and singular , allegations . " <P> At 9 o'clock , wearing a wool suit , a bluish tweed overcoat and a beanie hat , Mrs. Rockefeller walked through a rear entrance into the courthouse with her sons Rodman , 29 , and Steven , 25 . Mrs. Rockefeller showed some strain as she walked past the popping flashbulbs . Her sons left her for an anteroom , and she walked into the courtroom . It is a large chamber with azure walls and gilded frieze . Except for Judge Bowen , the two lawyers , and three court attendants , she was alone . <P> " When you arrived , " her lawyer asked , " was it your intention to live here indefinitely and make Nevada your home ? " <P> " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present day ? " <P> " Yes . " <P> " Is it still your present intention ? " <P> " Yes . " <P> These are standard questions in any Nevada divorce . Allegation and denial were read ; there was some conversation about the property settlement . Then Judge Bowen said : " This marriage is forever declared at an end . " It was the 694th divorce granted in Reno this year . <P> At 9:23 , the new divorcee emerged from the courtroom , holding tightly to her sons ' arms . She made a wrong turn , which took her to the Marriage Bureau ( which is , indeed , the next stop for many Reno divorcees ) . Leaving by the rear door , she stepped into her lawyer 's car and was whisked off to the airport for the short hop to San Francisco . There she and her sons waited for 3 hours . Then Mary Rockefeller boarded a plane for her native Philadelphia-where she and Nelson Rockefeller had been married 31 years , eight months and 19 days before .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
