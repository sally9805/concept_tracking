many , a glorious Japan , a master race , a nation of heroic warriors destined to conquer the world ; or one joins a revolutionary or religious movement which envisages a new life ; or one actually emigrates to a new country and becomes a new man . The tale of Moses and the exodus is a luminous example of the difficulties encountered , and the outlandish means that have to be employed , in the realization of drastic change . Moses wanted to accomplish a relatively simple thing : he wanted to transform the enslaved Hebrews into free men . But being a genuine leader , Moses knew that the task of endowing the liberated slaves with a new identity and immersing them in a new life was not at all simple and renuire.d the employment of extravarant means . The exodus from Egypt vas the first step . But mare vital was the fiction of a chosen people led by at mighty Jehovah to a promised land the kind of milieu essential for a rastic human transformation . Now the human transformation ' which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slaves into free men but drastic changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution . Here too the sense of rebirth was generated by exoduses ( mass migrations ) , the fiction of a chosen people , and the vision of a promised land . In Europe , during the second half of the nineteenth century , the wholesale transformation of peasants into industrial workers gave rise not only to nationalist and revolutionary movements but also to mass rushes to the New World , particularly the United States , where the European peasant was literally processed into a new man ? made to learn a new language , adopt a new mode of dress , a new diet , and often a new name . Primitive and Plastic The juvenile , then , is the archetypal man in transition . Juvenile impulses manifest themselves in people of all ages ? even the change of retirement may evoke a juvenile pattern in the old . Retired shopkeepers and farmers have made southern California a breeding ground of juvenile cults , utopias , and wild schemes . The Birch movement with its unmistakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maker and is sustained largely by retired business executives , generals , and admirals . The significant point is that juvenilization inevitably results in some degree of primitive social behavior . We are up against the great paradox of the twentieth century ; namely , that a breakneck technological advance has gone hand in hand with a return to tribalism , charismatic leaders . medicine men , credulity , and tribal wars . The tendency has been to blame the machine . There is a considerable literature on the barbarizing and dehumanizing effects of the machine : how it turns us into robots and slaves , stifles our individuality , and dwarfs our lives . Most of the indictments of the machine come of course from writers , poets , philosophers , and scholars ? men of words ? who have no firsthand experience of working and living with machines . It should also be noted that long before the advent of the machine age the same types of men of words looked upon common people who did the world 's work as soulless robots and automated ghouls . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service of man . Anyone who has worked with machines knows that they can be as temperamental and willful as any living thing , and that communion with machines does not blunt our sensibilities . The proficient mechanic is an alert and intuitive human being . On the waterfront one can see how the ability to make a fork-lift or a winch do one 's bidding with precision and finesse generates a peculiar exhilaration , so that the skilled lift-driver and winch-driver are as a rule of good cheer , and work as if at play . Even if it were proven beyond a doubt that the assembly line makes robots of workers , it still affects only a small fraction of the population , and can not be held responsible for the nature of a whole society . No , it is not the machine as such but drastic change which produces this social primitivism . Where a new identity is found by embracing a mass movement , for example , the reason is obvious : a mass movement absorbs and assimilates the individual into its corporate body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , tastes , and values .
