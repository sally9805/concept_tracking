A sewing machine and a pair of pinking shears are the only clues that identify Michele Sapone 's ground-floor flat on Nice 's Rue de Chteauneuf as a tailor shop . Casual visitors are much more likely to mistake it for an art gallery : about 450 paintings and drawings - many by Europe 's best-known contemporary artists - crowd the walls of the waiting room , the workshop , the corridors and even the fitting room . As tailor to more than 100 leading French and Italian artists , Sapone , 56 , accepts payment for his clothes in works of art . Says Sapone : " It has been a fruitful exchange between the needle and the brush . " <P> Sapone 's skillful needle has earned him paintings by Pablo Picasso , Alberto Giacometti , Massimo Campigli , Alberto Magnelli and Hans Hartung , as well as sculptures by Diego Giacometti and a collage by Clave . The exchange began by accident 14 years ago , soon after the mustachioed little tailor , an expatriate Italian from the mountain village of Bellona near Naples , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the Florentine ceramist and painter Manfredo Borsi ordered a suit . " If you prefer , " Borsi imperiously suggested , " I will pay you with one of my paintings . " Sapone did not really prefer . " I had never looked at a painting in my whole life , " he recalls . " I looked at women . " Overwhelmed by Borsi 's forceful manner , however , he reluctantly agreed . <P> Audacious Initiatives . One artist led to another . Poet-Painter Andr Verdet ordered a sport coat of grey velvet curtain material . Picasso took one look at Verdet 's coat and was off to see the tailor . The two men hit it off instantly , and after Sapone had cooked Picasso some Neapolitan spaghetti , the artist gave him three lithographs and an order to " sew something for me . " <P> " He never tells me what he wants , " says Sapone . " He leaves that entirely up to me . I search for special cloth in Naples , or I wander through mountain villages in Yugoslavia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an Abruzzi velvet . Picasso loves velvet . " Once Sapone delighted Picasso with a pair of cuffless , horizontally striped trousers . " I 've always wanted them , " said the master . " Courbet had a pair just like them . " <P> Other Sapone contributions to Picasso 's wardrobe include a white silk suit , which the artist wears to bull fights , and a brown velvet smock with a collar so high and broad that the tailor told Picasso : " Your head emerges from the collar like a flower from a pot . " In return , Picasso has given him about 50 paintings and sketches - including a powerful War and Peace pastel contrasting dancing nymphs with a hideous fire-belching monster . According to a Riviera dealer , the work , which Picasso gave in payment for a pair of trousers , would now fetch $20,000.
