Radio Moscow finally began chronicling the facts : the President 's speech , the proclamation of the blockade , the U.S. military preparations under way at Key West . Moscow even let it be known that a Russian chartered freighter was boarded and searched by the U.S. Only one detail was never mentioned : the Russian missiles in Cuba . <P> Ink for the Embassy .

The imperialist aggressors must remember that if they try to fan the fire of world war , they will inevitably burn in its flames .

Afterward Khrushchev jovially raised a glass as his pal First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan offered toasts in champagne to culture and , smiling at the singer 's pretty wife , to American women . " May God bless you , " responded Basso Hines , still decked out in the Czarist garb he wore for his role . <P> To Americans who knew the facts , Moscow seemed eerily normal .
