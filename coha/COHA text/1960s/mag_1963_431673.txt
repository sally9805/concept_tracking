 | Canyonlands : A New National Park ? IT WAS a full moon , and the guests were standing looking out over the area south . And one man spoke up and said : This is one of the grand viewpoints of the world . ' " This burst of plenilunar enthusiasm appears in , of all places , the transcript of " Hearings before the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States Senate " on a bill to create Canyonlands National Park in southeastern Utah , at the center of one of our greatest wilderness areas south of Alaska . A national park does not simply burst into existence , fully armed , like Athena from the head of Zeus ; Hephaestus and his hammer have a job to do first . A new park can be created , of course , only by Act of Congress . Before such a bill can be introduced , many studies must be undertaken , many questions answered ; public hearings must be held , hundreds of persons with diverse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial question is : " Does the area meet national park standards ? " In a sense those standards were set by the great parks ? among them Yosemite , Yellowstone , Glacier , Mount Rainier ? that were already in existence when the Park Service was established in 1916 . Later they were defined as : " scenery of supreme and distinct quality , or some natural feature so extraordinary or unique as to be of national interest and importance . " @# There is no question on the part of the Park Service or the Advisory Board ( a nongovernmental body ) that the area surrounding the confluence of the Grew ' and Colorado Rivers , now called Canyonlands , meets these standards . There is , however , a sharp difference of opinion about what sort of park we should have . In fact , the amount of heat generated in this debate seems at first out of all proportion to the issues at stake . Men with commercial interests are lined up against conservationists , game hunters against park purists , the s ? nior senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state against the Secretary of the Interior . The political battle over Canyonlands is of national interest because it brings into focus basic conflicts about the proper use of our remaining open spaces . Let us take a quick backward glance at the geography and history of this scenic battleground , which my wife and I visited last summer . Canyonlands lies at the heart of what geographers call the Plateau Province , a dry , elevated plain that in Mesozoic times was a great loop of the sea and now includes most of Utah , parts of Wyoming to the north and Colorado to the east , and to the south the Grand Canyon of Arizona . It is a country of clear air and sharp edges , of utter stillness and sudden violence . In his biography of John Wesley Powell , who first mapped the area less than a century ago , Wallace Stegner describes i2  | it as " scenically the most spectacular and humanly the least usable of all our regions . " Indeed , it is so rugged and so difficult of access that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as scenically , Canyonlands is a country of extremes . The temperature range is 130 degrees . Rainfall is sparse ; what little there is comes largely from thunderstorms and runs off in flash floods . There are virtually no roads ; travel is by horseback , foot , or jeep . Indians lived here in the distant past , but the first organized exploration was made by the Powell Expedition of 1869 , an incredibly daring venture led by that one-armed veteran of the Civil War who was later to found the Geological Survey and shape the entire development of the West . The very year that the railroads were joined with the driving of the golden spike , Powell had three specially built boats transported by flatcar to the town of Green River , Wyoming , where the track crossed the Green River . Leaving the newly built railroad , Powell and his companions literally plunged into the unknown , through roaring rapids in which they often capsized and sometimes almost perished , to emerge eventually , sunbaked , sandblasted , and half starved , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this and the subsequent expedition of 1871 , they recorded impressions of the Canyonlands country with the eloquence of near disbelief : " Nothing was in sight but barren sandstone , red , yellow , brown , grey , carved into an amazing multitude of towers , buttes , spires , pinnacles , some of them several hundred feet high , and all shimmering under a dazzling sun . It was a marvellous mighty desert of bare rock , chiselled by the ages out of the foundations of the globe ; fantastic , extraordinary , antediluvian , labyrinthian , and slashed in all directions by crevices ; crevices wide , crevices narrow , crevices medium , some shallow , some dropping till a falling stone clanked resounding into the far hollow depths . " Or , to borrow a phrase from Ebenezer Bryce , describing what is now Bryce Canyon National Park , " A hell of a place to lose a cow . " THE visitor to Canyonlands today can see what Powell 's men saw , virtually unchanged . And one attraction of this area is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the lower benches , from the canyon bottoms , and from the river . My wife and I planned to explore the canyons by jeep , but we decided to take a hawk'seye view before we took the view of the desert mice and the ground squirrels . We began with the " grand viewpoint " referred to above , one of the few spots in the proposed park now accessible by road . The two-hour drive was a primary lesson in geology and desert ecology . Nowadays , in the light of incontrovertible geological evidence , one accepts the amazing fact that this weird landscape is the product of erosion ; that the principal canyons have been created over aeons of time by the slow rising of the earth 's crust , while the river , maintaining a constant elevation , slowly cut through the rock , as a fixed buzz saw will cut through the log that is pressed up against it , and while smaller streams , rain , and frost ground away at the exposed surface . It is hard to realize that this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When thinking of these rocks , " wrote Powell in his journal , " one must not conceive of piles of boulders or heaps of fragments , but of a whole land of naked rock , with giant forms carved on it . . . all highly colored . . . never lichened , never moss-covered , but bare , and often polished . " Here is a supremely articulate landscape whose very clarity challenges us to interpret its secrets . The color of the rock is , of course , one key to its origin , though it varies with different exposures . From where we stood we could see the difference between the white rim of hard rock and the softer red rock beneath . The former was deposited by the wind , as one can still see from the delicate tracery of matted curves and whorls of what is aptly described as a " frozen sand dune . " The red rock was formed by water deposition when all this country lay under the sea . This difference in hardness results in undercutting of the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created gigantic mushroomlike columns . On this high , windswept plateau we found the vegetation to be sparse , for the competition is not for space and sunlight but for water . The principal trees , pinon pines and desert junipers , tend to be widely scattered ; the latter , often no larger than shrubs despite their great age , are gnarled and contorted beyond belief . Sparse sagebrush on the flats gives the landscape here and there a faint wash of blue-green , and yucca with its spikes of creamy-white flowers reminds one that this is indeed semidesert . But the most striking evidence of desert conditions is the leaf structure of what we think of as broad-leafed trees . The single-leaf ash , the curly-leaf mountain mahogany ? their leaves , designed to allow the minimum evaporation , are almost as narrow and tough as the needles of an evergreen . Here was living proof ? though barely living , it seemed ? that evolving forms will develop some way to use every niche in the environment . On the way out we had met a cowpoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in back . ( The modern cow pony enjoys this form of  | locomotion and is as eager to go for a ride as the family dog . ) Ignorant of the country , he was scouting ahead to find water for a thirsty herd of cattle . We could tell him there was n't any , nor much grass either . Later , as I studied the Senate hearings on the park bill , with all the talk of grazing rights , I thought of this incident . Much of the area can support no grazing at all . It is a soulsatisfying country , but cows can not live on scenery . Two days later , having enjoyed our bird's-eye view , we re-entered the park area from another direction to explore the canyons at close quarters . " During the next hour or so , " remarked our host at the wheel of his jeep , " we 'll be going down about a hundred million years . " The superintendent of nearby Arches National Monument , he was one of the best jeep herders in Utah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the moon , the imaginative pictures of whose surface might have been drawn from the country that now surrounded us . We were already below the dark-red entrada sandstone which , with the softer mudstone beneath it , has made the spectacular forms occurring in Arches Monument ; and we had passed through the Navajo formation below- that . The rock walls were Wingate sandstone , with vertical seams and streaks of blue-black desert varnish , an exudation of manganese oxide which gives the polished effect referred to by Powell in his journal . Here we had our first good look at the Indian petroglyphs , or rock carvings , whose exact origins are still shrouded in mystery . Beneath a slightly projecting ridge , which shielded it from the weather , was a rock wall the size of a barn door and equally flat . Virtually every square inch was covered with some design or picture : six-fingered hands and six-toed feet ( why six ? ) ; lines of little men in silhouette , like a child 's cutout joined hand to hand ; rams with curving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched hides ; squiggly snakelike lines and circles and the tracks of a running rabbit . Many of the pictures stood out sharply , light buff against the dark background , as if they had been cut yesterday ; others had been darkened by the slow deposition of desert varnish - a clue to their date if the rate of deposition can be determined . Farther along we came to a cool moist cave beneath a great ledge of overhanging rock , like the opening of a giant clamshell . At the inmost recess , where the sloping roof came down to the dirt floor , lay a spring-fed pool , with maidenhair fern growing in the crevices above it , as it might have grown in a mist-filled mountain gorge . The contrast between the cave 's microclimate and the arid heat outside underscored the obvious fact , which we sometimes forget in the East , that water is life . As historians like Bernard De Voto and Walter Prescott Webb have pointed out , the Easterner 's concept of land values and the schoolbook stereotype of " frontier independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of water is meaningless . The Indians who once dwelt in these canyons were slowly driven elsewhere , not by warlike invaders from outside , but by unbearable years of drought . The cave where we now stood , with its precious spring , was clearly a focal point for Indian life , as it will be for tomorrow 's tourists if the park is established . On the same wall with the maidenhair fern were pictographs , not cut in the rock but painted in red pigment , recalling the Indian paintings of caribou and moose and other North Woods creatures that we had studied from our canoe in the Borderlakes country seven hundred miles to the north . These fragile rock paintings of unknown antiquity also reminded us how vulnerable is this still virgin land to casual destruction by the machine age , how it cries aloud for protection while yet there is time . One of the witnesses before the Senate committee had been camping nearby : " The cave we camped in had Indian writings on the wall , and among them were thirteen handprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three metates in the top ? you know , where they ground their corn . And I could just picture the Indian women sitting around gossiping and grinding their corn . . . . When we returned to the area a year or so later , someone had had a caterpillar tractor in there and turned over the rock that had the metates am " they were no longer visible . The cave we were in had had a fire right under the handprints on the wall , and they were well smoked out . I think that things like this should n't be allowed to happen . . . . " Fortunately , many of the Indian ruins ? dwellings , storehouses for corn , ceremonial buildings ? are on inaccessible ledges where they have remained largely undisturbed . As we continued down one of the canyons , we spotted several of the low redstone structures , with their neat rectangular openings , perched like swallows ' nests high above us in the canyon wall . One was easy to reach , and I climbed up to explore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls still stood . In the mud daubing between the stone blocks was a thumbprint that could have been made last week , the whorls sharp and clear enough to satisfy any detective who might be on that Indian 's trail . But the trail would have led back to the age of the Crusades . The jeep tract we were following now began to descend in earnest . Below the sheer cliffs were slopes of gray-purple and greenish shales . In 54  | geologic terms , we were descending from the Lower Jurassic to the Upper Triassic period , back to the time before birds or mammals had appeared on earth . The reptiles , of course , had already been flourishing for millions of years . Elsewhere in Canyonlands , on the slopes above the Colorado River near a wall covered with petroglyphs , I had seen fine specimens of dinosaur tracks . What did the Indians make of them ? The walls above us were becoming more strangely sculptured and involute at every turn , ranging in color from red-brown and maroon to a creamy white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our vertical time scale were down to the Permian period , over two hundred million years away . It would be hard to find another place that conveys such a dramatic sense of time ? human time and geologic time , two concepts so different from each other in scale that a single word is inadequate to cover both . The Indian petroglyph and the footprint of the dinosaur . A thousand years , forty or fifty generations , is at least conceivable in human terms . But a hundred million years makes no mental image at all ; one has to accept it almost as an act of faith . Perhaps our minds can not encompass such distances in time because our residence on earth has been so relatively short . Homo sapiens has evolved too recently even to make a respectable fossil . On that now familiar time scale projecting the history of the earth over a single year , he first appears during the last minutes before midnight on December 31 . If we bear in mind the nearby uranium mines , any New Year 's celebration seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate question of a national park . It is an ominous fact that in the long chain of evolution the latest link , man , has suddenly acquired alchemic powers to alter whatever he touches . No other species before man has been able to change more than a tiny fraction of his habitat . Now there is but a tiny fraction that he has left unchanged . A bulldozer undoes in an hour the work of a million years . The natural world becomes a thing to be manipulated . " You do n't push nature around very easily , " one of our leading young scientists is quoted as saying . Then he added , eagerly , " But maybe we are getting to that point . " The point of no return . If all outdoors is to be subdued to our immediate practical purposes , then the entire national park concept is nonsense , and to add a new park to the system is to compound our foolishness . For a national park might be defined as an area in which , by federal statute , nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own peculiar appeal to the amateur of nature . For one thing , the very sparseness of the natural scene gives him some hope of getting reasonably acquainted with it on a short visit . Some years ago my wife and I were dry-camping in a true desert , of a very different sort from Canyonlands ? the Organ Pipe Cactus Monument in Arizona , close to the border of Mexico . Used to pitching our tent in wooded country where so much life goes on unseen , we could not help feeling that here in the desert everything was , so to speak , spread out and on display . It would have taken a blind man not to see the incredibly bright yellow and black Scott 's oriole picked out by the setting sun on a distant hillside or the zebralike Gila woodpecker pecking at the trunk of a nearby saguaro . The cacti which made up the principal vegetation were spaced far apart , as if in a garden , and almost wore their own labels : the organ-pipe ( which the Monument was set up to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staghorn and fuzzy-bear cholla ( beware its needlelike fuzz ! ) , and , dominating all , the giant saguaro , a thick pole with stubby arms raised against the sky . The fresh green stems of the paloverde and the orange spikes of the desert candle shouted their identity ; and when I was slow in recognizing ironwood , it introduced itself by taking a huge nick out of my ax . So here in Canyonlands , which is semidesert , we quickly became familiar with the principal plants composing the threads of green along the dry beds of the so-called creeks , whose scoured rocks and rippled sand provide the only access to much of the interior . Looking down from above , we had seen bands of blue-green bordering the Colorado River and creeping up the Canyons ; now we were among those feathery branches of the tamarisk , or salt cedar , with its delicate pink and yellow blossoms , an immigrant from the Mediterranean that has brought much beauty to its adopted home . There were snowberries and squawberries , corn grass and thistles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , petunialike flower of the thorn apple . A hummingbird was darting from one flower to another . The only large tree was that trademark of the West , the cottonwood , and it was rare enough ; we lunched in the shade of one of the widely scattered groves by a live creek , a sort of oasis with grass underfoot and tracks of mule deer in the spongy earth nearby . A small puddle was full of tadpoles and tiny frogs , whose life cycle must be a continuous crash program to take advantage of the water while it lasts . When I said that everything in a desert seems on display , I was of course omitting the mammal and reptile population . Here even the small animals are nocturnal ; it is not so much a matter of concealment as of avoiding the fierce dehydrating  | rays of the sun . We did flush a few rabbits and ground squirrels during the day ; tiny lizards darted over the rocks , and a larger collared lizard scuttled in front of the jeep before diving into its hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not only tracks of a deer , but small round footprints rather like those of a fox , though not so straight in line ? the bobcat , as much at home in these canyons as he is in our New England woods . In Canyonlands , however , it is not the plants and animals but the fantastic rock formations that bring one up gasping at every new outlook . To be sure , it is sometimes difficult to say whether the gasps come from the beauty of the scenery or the unnatural sensation of climbing up a cliff in a series of switchbacks so sharp that the jeep occasionally has to back up the next switch instead of making the turn , providing an incomparable view over the rear wheel down into nothing . Seat belts fastened , we braced our feet and held our breaths as our mechanical steed pitched and rolled up a hard polished slope to which one would hesitate to put a real horse . On the downslope , another quick change of scene : a flat sunken valley lined with vertical walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave a cavity beneath the rock floor . Then a long stretch of golden grassland , its healthy state paradoxically due to the fact that there is no water in the ' area and hence none of the overgrazing by livestock that has reduced other areas of Canyonlands to thin grass and tumbleweed . And finally , at the edge of this parklike area , we came to the great spires of red and caramel rock that we had studied from afar , rising from the flats as abruptly and improbably as Stonehenge from Salisbury Plain . Back at the canyon bottom , a few hundred yards from a magnificent natural arch , we spread our bedrolls beneath a great rock ledge which sloped outward just far enough to keep off a light drizzle and which conveniently concentrated a puddle of rainwater nearby . Perhaps this natural cistern is one reason why the Indians had liked the spot . For we lay down to sleep between squared stones that still outlined the foundations of four ancient structures . Overhead , black swifts swept back and forth against the fading sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caves in the rock . Our thoughts returned to the crucial issue of the park . THE controversy over Canyonlands is important because , as I said , it represents a conflict of principle . The persons who take such a strong stand on one side or the other are thinking of the future , of the whole thorny question of land requirements for an exploding population . Everyone agrees that a national park is a good thing . But when it comes down to specifics , opinions differ . How big should it be to accomplish its purpose ? Just what , in fact , is its purpose ? How will it affect the local and the national economy ? What , if any , secondary uses , such as mining , grazing , and hunting , should be permitted ? These questions go to the root of national park policy . In the case of Canyonlands , Secretary Udall originally proposed the taking of approximately one million acres , which would have included the entire erosion basin as a geologic unit . The bill introduced by Senator Moss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congressmen King and Peterson , drastically reduced this area to 330,000 acres . ( Grand Canyon National Park is 673,000 acres . ) This area is considered by many who know the country well to be inadequate . The governor of Utah , on the other hand , opposes the bill on the grounds that it is too much ; he would prefer a sort of fragmented park consisting of relatively small areas surrounding the principal scenic marvels . Hearings on the Moss bill were held last spring , first in Washington , later in Utah . Almost seven hundred pages of testimony have been printed . They are not bedside reading , but they do provide a vivid if somewhat chaotic picture of the democratic process at work . Everyone has his day in court : senators and congressmen , Park Service officials , spokesmen for the leading conservation organizations , foresters , state and local politicians , professors , engineers , bankers , miners , cattlemen , motel owners , licensed guides . From this plethora of words a pattern begins to emerge . Practically everyone is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring millions of tourist dollars every year . But a park , if it means anything at all , means rigid control of land use , and that is where the trouble begins . By allowing controlled mining and grazing and hunting under certain conditions within the boundaries of the park , by recognizing the principle of so-called multiple use , the Moss bill represents a compromise with basic national park principles . Conservationists and others concerned with the integrity of the park system consider this a dangerous precedent ; they would strike out this provision in the bill . At the opposite pole , local mining interests claim that the provision is not strong enough ; they point out that the Secretary of the Interior " may prescribe such general regulations for the control of these activities as he deems necessary to preserve the scenic , scientific , and recreation values of the area . " They want no regulation ? which means no park , except in name . As Secretary Udall has pointed out , this is like  | trying to have your cake and eat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding cake to be pulled apart in search of the ring and the thimble ? which probably are not there anyway . What resources would in fact be " locked up " if all commercial exploitation were prohibited ? The whole place has been prospected for uranium with negative results . In any case , to quote Senator Anderson 's haunting metaphor , " We have got more uranium rolling out of our ears than we know what to do with . " A study made by the University of Utah shows that there may be other mineral deposits , but none are of known commercial value . Almost the entire area is under oil and gas lease : ten dry holes have been drilled ; the eleventh , on the edge of the proposed park , recently brought in a producing well and is being excluded from the park area . Grazing rights in this arid country are insignificant ; annual fees from the entire 330,000 acres amount to only $2700 . The Moss bill allows grazing to continue for twenty-five years , though it must be obvious to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists are going to use the same few spots that have water . Deer hunting is a more emotional subject . The Moss bill provides for " the controlled reduction of wildlife in such park by hunters licensed by the State of Utah and deputized as rangers by the Secretary . " Of all the pressures that are put on the Park Service , the one for public hunting seems to arouse the loudest hallo . When the service uses its own personnel , as it has done in Yellowstone , scientifically to reduce the elk herds , there are cries of outrage from those who see wasted chances for sport . When specially licensed hunters are allowed to try their trigger fingers at it , as they were in Teton Park , the naturalists and conservationists cry havoc . The chief naturalist at Yellowstone supports their fears with statistics . Suppose that the reduction of the Yellowstone elk herd had been put in the hands of private hunters : " If their ability was equal to that of the 1,002 hunters in Grand Teton , nearly 18,000 hunters would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 410 illegal elk and seventeen men , along with an undetermined number of bears , coyotes , bighorn sheep , antelope , bison , mule deer and horses . " In Canyonlands the issue is one of principle rather than of powder and shot ; only fortyone deer were taken from the whole region last year . The chances of bagging illegal animals are even more remote . But to legalize park hunting by statute may be a precedent more dangerous than bullets . Mining , grazing , hunting : each has its staunch adherents , yet all are fundamentally incompatible with the basic park concept . The term " multiple use " has become a sort of shibboleth . In the case of our national parks , it is seriously misleading . In the first place , the proper use of our parks is itself multiple ? wilderness preservation , recreation , protection of watersheds , sanctuaries for wildlife , undisturbed areas for scientific study . In the second place , commercial and recreational use are often mutually exclusive . For activities that disturb or deplete the land , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle will be fought to a finish on the floor of Congress . Political maneuver can be expected ; for example , in the final days of the 1962 session the senior senator from Utah , who was up for reelection , introduced a new and weakened Canyonlands bill which might appeal to some of his constituents but not to anyone who wants a true national park . The traditional conflict between federal and states ' rights will be renewed ; only recently the state fish and game commissioners officially went on record urging Congress , in clear contradiction to existing policy , to leave management in their hands " whenever any authority is granted to the National Park Service to create any new areas or to increase the size of existing areas . " The Utah commissioner , at the Canyonlands hearings , attacked " the autocratic and highhanded attitudes of the National Park Service " which threatened " the sovereignty of the State . " None of this , of course , is new , but it does make the Canyonlands issue worth studying . For , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evolution of the species , so the study of a single park in embryo reminds us of the evolutionary history of the park system itself . The issues raised in the discussion of Canyonlands echo those raised when Yellowstone Park was born ninety years ago , when the Grand Canyon was saved , by Teddy Roosevelt ( its rim was once staked with mining claims ) , when the unique rain forest in Washington 's Olympic Park was preserved from the ax , when Jackson Hole in the Tetons was added to the park system against local opposition to become one of Wyoming 's greatest assets . The story of the national park concept is the story of the evolution of an idea , now momentarily spotlighted in those glowing redrock canyons at the heart of the Plateau Province .
