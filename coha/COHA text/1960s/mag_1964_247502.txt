Despite its high purpose , the Negro revolution breeds violence and death . Among its victims have been Baltimore Postman William Moore , shot on an Alabama highway while on a one-man civil rights march ; Mississippi N.A.A.C.P. Leader Medgar Evers , shot in the back by a bushwhacker ; and those four Negro girls killed in the bombing of a Birmingham church . <P> Last week there was more violence , and three more victims may have been added to the grim roster . They were two young white men and a Negro youth , all civil rights workers , missing in the murky , snake-infested swamps of eastern Mississippi , where the charred shell of their Ford station wagon was found . <P> The Trip South . The trail to the Mississippi swamp started on the serene , sycamore-shaded campus of the West ern College for Women at Oxford , Ohio .

Rita taught reading and citizenship , instructed Negro women in how to work sewing machines , while Mickey worked on Negro vote registration . <P> Chancy was one of Schwerner 's most helpful aides . He was a slender Meridian Negro lad who had dropped out of high school as a sophomore , became a plasterer , eventually joined CORE . When COFO called for volunteer instructors for the Ohio training course , Chancy went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodman , 20 , son of a New York City building contractor and a junior at Queens College . The Mississippi project was Goodman 's second active civil rights venture ; he had been among those who picketed President Johnson at the World 's Fair opening . <P> On Saturday , June 20 , their week-long Oxford orientation course completed , Schwerner , Chaney , Goodman and five other young civil rights workers got into a CORE-owned blue station wagon to drive to Meridian . They had scheduled their trip so as to avoid driving through Deep Dixie after dark , always a perilous proposition for integration workers in such states as Alabama and Mississippi . As they passed through Birmingham , Ala. , a car loaded with white teenagers pulled alongside , screamed " Nigger lover ! " at a white girl student sitting next to Chaney in the station wagon .
