THE SUCCESS MACHINE By HENRY SLESAR Mechanical brains are all the rage these days , so General Products just had to have one . But the blamed thing almost put them out of business . Why ? It had no tact . It insisted upon telling the truth ! The Personnelovac winked , chittered , chortled , chuckled , and burped a card into the slot . Colihan picked it up and closed his eyes in prayer . " Oh , Lord . Let this one be all right ! " He read the card . It was pink . " Subject #34580 . Apt . Rat . 34577 . Psych . Clas. 45 . Last Per .

Marked increase in waste-motion due to subject 's interest in non-essential activities such as horseracing . Indication of hostility towards superiors . " Recommendation : Fire him . " Colihan 's legs went weak . He sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making sure he was unobserved , he broke a company rule and began to Think . Something 's wrong , he thought . Something is terribly wrong . Twenty-four pink cards in the last month . Twenty-four out of forty . That 's a batting average of  --  He tried to figure it out with a pencil , but gave it up as a bad job . Maybe I 'll run it through the Averagovac , he thought . But why bother ? It 's obvious that it 's high . There 's obviously SOMETHING WRONG . The inter-com beeped . " Ten o'clock department head meeting , Mr. Colihan . " Illustration : The steel brain was having more fun than people . " All right , Miss Blanche . " He rose from his chair and took the pink card with him . He stood before the Action Chute for a moment , tapping the card against his teeth . Then , his back stiffened with a sense of duty , and he slipped the card inside . * * * * * The meeting had already begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Materielovac operator looked at him quizzically . Damn your eyes , Grimswitch , he thought . It 's no crime to be three minutes late . Nothing but a lot of pep talk first five minutes anyway . " PEP ! " said President Moss at the end of the room . He slammed his little white fist into the palm of his other hand . " It 's only a little word . It only has three little letters . P-E-P . Pep ! " Moss , standing at the head of the impressive conference table , leaned forward and eyed them fixedly . " But those three little letters , my friends , spell out a much bigger word . A much bigger word for General Products , Incorporated . They spell PROFIT ! And if you do n't know how profit is spelled , it 's M-O-N-N-E-Y ! " There was an appreciative laugh from the assembled department heads . Colihan , however , was still brooding on the parade of pink cards which had been emerging with frightening regularity from his think-machine , and he failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimswitch whispered to him archly . " Boss made a funny . Do n't forget to laugh , old boy . " Colihan threw him a sub-zero look . " Now let 's be serious , " said the boss . " Because things are serious . Mighty serious . Somewhere , somehow , somebody 's letting us down ! " The department heads looked uneasily at each other . Only Grimswitch continued to smile vacantly at the little old man up front , drumming his fingers on the glass table top . When the President 's machine-gunning glance caught his eyes , Colihan went white . Does he know about it ? he thought . " I 'm not making accusations , " said Moss . " But there is a let-down someplace . Douglas ! " he snapped . Douglas , the Treasurer , did a jack-in-the-box . " Read the statement , " said the President . " First quarter fiscal year , " said Douglas dryly . " Investment capital , $17,836,975,238.96 . Assets , $84,967,442,279.55 . Liabilities , $83,964,283,774.60 . Production costs are  --  " Moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , " he said . Douglas adjusted his glasses . " Total net revenue , $26,876,924.99 . " " COMPARISON ! " The President screamed . " Let 's have last first quarter , you idiot ! " " Ahem ! " Douglas rattled the paper in annoyance . " Last first quarter fiscal year net revenue $34,955,376.81 . Percent decrease  --  " " Never mind . " The little old man waved the Treasurer to his seat with a weary gesture . His face , so much like somebody 's grandmother , looked tragic as he spoke his next words . " You do n't need the Accountovac to tell you the significance of those figures , gentlemen . " His voice was soft , with a slight quaver . " We are not making much p-r-o-f-i-t . We are losing m-o-n-e-y . And the point is  --  what 's the reason ? There must be some reason . " His eyes went over them again , and Colihan , feeling like the culprit , slumped in his chair . " I have a suggestion , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us just are n't showing enough p-e-p . " There was a hushed silence . The boss pushed back his chair and walked over to a cork-lined wall . With a dramatic gesture , he lifted one arm and pointed to the white sign that covered a fourth of it . " See that ? " he asked . " What does it say ? " The department heads looked dubious . " Well , what does it say ? " repeated Moss . " ACT ! " The department heads cried in chorus . " Exactly ! " said the little old man with a surprising bellow . " ACT ! The word that made us a leader . The word that guides our business destiny . The word that built General Products ! " * * * * * He paced the floor . The chairs in the conference room creaked as the department heads stirred to follow him with their eyes . " ACT is our motto . ACT is our password . ACT is our key to success . And why not ? The Brains do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so effectively , so perfectly , so honestly as the Brains . They take the orders , designate raw materials , equipment , manpower . They schedule our work . They analyze our products . They analyze our people . " Colihan trembled . " There 's only one important function left to us . And that 's ACT ! " The President bowed his head and walked slowly back to his seat . He sat down , and with great fatigue evident in his voice , he concluded his polemic . " That 's why we must have pep , gentlemen . Pep . Now  --  how do you spell it ? " " P ! E ! P ! " roared the department heads . The meeting was over . The department heads filed out . * * * * * Colihan 's secretary placed the morning mail on his desk . There was a stack of memos at least an inch thick , and the Personnel Manager moaned at the sight of it . " Production report does n't look too good , " said Miss Blanche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards from Morgan today . Grimswitch has sent over a couple . That makes eleven from him this month . He really has his problems . " Colihan grunted . He deserves them , he thought . " How did the meeting go ? " " Huh ? " Colihan looked up . " Oh , fine , fine . Boss was in good voice , as usual . " " I think there 's an envelope from him in the stack . " " What ? " Colihan hoped that his concern was n't visible . He riffled through the papers hurriedly , and came up with a neat white envelope engraved with the words : OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT . Miss Blanche watched him , frankly curious . " That will be all , " he told her curtly . When she had left , he ripped the envelope open and read the contents . It was in Moss 's own cramped handwriting , and it was a request for a three o'clock " man-to-man " talk . Oh , Lord , he thought . Now it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating an apple . He ate so greedily that the juice spilled over his chin . Sitting behind his massive oak desk , chair tilted back , apple juice dappling his whiskers , he looked so small and unformidable , that Colihan took heart . " Well , Ralph  --  how goes it ? " He called me Ralph , thought Colihan cheerfully . He 's not such a bad old guy . " Do n't grow apples like they used to , " the President said . " This hydroponic stuff ca n't touch the fruit we used to pick . Say , did you ever climb a real apple tree and knock ' em off the branches ? " Colihan blinked . " No , sir . " " Greatest thrill in the world . My father had an orchard in Kennebunkport . Apples by the million . Green apples . Sweet apples . Delicious . Spy . Baldwin . " He sighed . " Something 's gone out of our way of life , Ralph . " Why , he 's just an old dear , thought Colihan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Funny thing about apples . My father used to keep ' em in barrels down in the basement . He used to say to me , ' Andrew , ' he 'd say , ' do n't never put a sour apple in one of these barrels . ' Cause just one sour apple can spoil the whole derned lot . ' " The boss looked at Colihan and took a big noisy bite . Colihan smiled inanely . Was Moss making some kind of point ? " Well , we ca n't sit around all day and reminisce , eh , Ralph ? Much as I enjoy it . But we got a business to run , do n't we ? " " Yes , sir , " said the Personnel Manager . " Mighty big business , too . How 's your side of it , Ralph ? Old Personnelovac hummin ' along nicely ? " " Yes , sir , " said Colihan , wondering if he should voice his fears about the Brain . " Marvelous machine , that . Most marvelous of ' em all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully . And best of all , it 's one hundred percent honest . That 's a mighty important quality , Ralph . " * * * * * Colihan was getting worried . The boss 's conversation was just a little too folksy for his liking . " Yes , sir , a mighty fine quality . My father used to say : ' Andrew , an honest man can always look you in the eyes . ' " Colihan stared uncomprehendingly . He realized that Moss had stopped talking , so he looked him squarely in the eyes and said : " He must have been a fine man , your father . " " He was honest , " said Moss . " I 'll say that for him . He was honest as they come . Did you ever hear of Dimaggio ? " " It sounds familiar  --  " " It should . Dimaggio was a legendary figure . He took a lantern and went out into the world looking for an honest man . And do you know something ? He could n't find one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimaggio . " Colihan gulped . " And do you know why ? Because sometimes I see a thing like this  --  " the boss 's hand reached into the desk and came out with a thick bundle of pink cards  --  " and I wonder if there 's an honest man left in the world . " * * * * * He put the cards in front of Colihan . " Now , sir , " said Moss . " Let 's talk a little business . These cards are all pink . That means dismissal , right ? That 's twenty-four people fired in the last month , is that correct ? " " Yes , sir , " said Colihan unhappily . " And how many cards went through the Personnelovac this month ? " " Forty . " " So that 's twenty-four out of forty . A batting average of  --  " The boss 's brow puckered . " Well . Never mind . But that 's quite an unusual record , would n't you say so ? " " Yes , sir , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate ACTION , would n't it ? " The President 's face was now stormy . " Yes , sir . But I checked the Brain  --  " " Did you , Ralph ? " " Yes , sir . And the Maintainovac said it was perfect . There 's nothing wrong with it . " " Nothing wrong ? You call twenty-four firings out of forty nothing ? " The old man stood up , still holding the core of his apple . " Well , I do n't understand it either , Mr. Moss . " Colihan felt dew on his forehead . " Nothing seems to satisfy the Brain anymore . It seems to develop higher and higher standards , or something . Why , I 'm not sure it would n't even fire  --  " " WHO ? " said Moss thunderously . " WHO would n't it even fire ? " The thunder hit Colihan squarely . He swallowed hard , and then managed to say : " Anybody , sir . Me , for instance . " The President 's face suddenly relaxed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I 'm just doing a job , that 's all . " " Of course , sir  --  " " Well , all I want you to do is keep your eye on things . It could be a coincidence of course . That 's the logical explanation . " He narrowed his eyes . " What do you think , Ralph ? " " Me , sir ? " said Ralph , wide-eyed . " I do n't think , sir . I ACT , sir ! " " Good boy ! " The boss chuckled and clapped his hand on Colihan 's shoulder . Moss was momentarily satisfied . * * * * * The Personnelovac burped . Colihan picked up the card with a groan . It was pink . He walked over to the Action Chute and dropped it inside . As it fluttered down below , Colihan shook his head sadly . " Thirty-one , " he said . He placed the next personnel record into the Information chamber . He flipped the lever , and the Personnelovac , now hot with usage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . The burp was almost joyful as the card popped out . But Colihan 's face was far from joyful as he picked it up . Pink . " Thirty-two , " he said . The next card was from Grimswitch 's department . It was Subject #52098 . The number was familiar . Colihan decided to check the file . " Sam Gilchrist , " he said . " Could n't be anything wrong with Sam . Why , he 's a blinkin ' genius ! " Flip . Wink . Chitter . Chortle . Chuckle . BURP ! Pink . " Poor Sam ! " said Colihan . He fed the other records through quickly . Pink . Pink . PINK . At the end of the day , Colihan worked laboriously with a blunt-pointed pencil . It took him fifteen minutes for the simple calculation . " Sixty-seven tests . Twenty-three okay . Forty-four  --  " Colihan put his hands to his head . " What am I going to do ? " * * * * * Grimswitch followed Colihan down the hall as he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that week . " Well ! " he said fatuously . " Quite the teacher 's pet , these days . Eh , Colihan ? " " Go away , Grimswitch . " " On the carpet , eh ? Temper a little short ? Do n't worry . " Grimswitch 's beefy hand made unpleasant contact with the Personnel man 's shoulder . " Your old friends wo n't let you down . " " Grimswitch , will you please let me alone ? " " Better watch that think-machine of yours , " Grimswitch chuckled . " Might fire you next , old boy . " Colihan was glad when Morgan , the production operator , hailed Grimswitch away . But as he entered his own office , Grimswitch 's words still troubled him . Grimswitch , he thought . That fat piece of garbage . That big blow-hard . That know-it-all . Almost savagely , he picked up the day 's personnel cards and flipped through them carelessly . Grimswitch , that louse , he thought . Then he had the Idea . If Grimswitch was still chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone  --  If he called her and asked for Grimswitch 's record  --  no , better yet , got Miss Blanche to call  --  Why not ? he thought . After all , I am the Personnel Manager . Sure , it 's a little irregular . He IS a department head . But it 's my job , is n't it ? Colihan flipped the inter-com and proceeded to call Miss Blanche . * * * * * His hand shook as he placed Grimswitch 's card into the Personnelovac . The machine , though still heated by the day 's activity , seemed to take longer than usual for its chittering , chuckling examination of the pin-holed facts on the record . Finally , it gave a satisfied burp and proffered the result to Colihan 's eager hand . " Aha ! " cried the personnel man gleefully . He walked over to his desk , wrote a quick note on his memo pad , and placed both note and card into an envelope . He addressed it to : OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT . Then he dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , he rubbed his hands together in happy anticipation . * * * * * When Miss Blanche announced that President Moss himself was in Colihan 's outer lobby , the Personnel Manager spent a hasty minute in straightening up the paper debris on his desk . The old man came striding into the room , exhibiting plenty of p-e-p , and he seated himself briskly on Colihan 's sofa . " Sharp eyes , Ralph , " he said . " Sharp eyes and a quick wit . This business demands it . That was a sharp notion you had , doing a run-through on Grimswitch . Never trusted that back-slapping fellow . " Colihan looked pleased . " Trying to do a job , sir . " " Put your finger on it , " said Moss . " Hit the nail on the head . It 's just like my father said : ' Trees go dead on the top . ' Colihan  --  " The boss leaned forward confidentially . " I 've got an assignment for you . Big assignment . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sour apple , maybe other department heads are , too . And who knows ? IT knows . " Moss pointed a finger at the Personnelovac . " I 'm rounding up all the aptitude records of the department heads . They 'll be in your hands in the next couple of days . Feed ' em in ! Root ' em out ! Spot the deadwood , Colihan ! ACT ! " " ACT ! " echoed Colihan , his face flushed . The old man got up and went over to the Brain . " Marvelous machine , " he said . " Honest . That 's what I like about it . " As Moss went out the door , Colihan could have sworn he saw the Personnelovac wink . He walked over to it and fingered the lever . It was turned off , all right . * * * * * It was an interesting week for Colihan . Morgan , the production man , was fired . Grimswitch came up to see the Personnel man and tried to punch him in the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blow went wild . Seegrum , the Shipovac operator , was fired . Douglas , the Treasurer , was permitted to keep his job , but the Personnelovac issued a dire threat if improvement was n't rapidly forthcoming . Wilson , the firm 's oldest employee , was fired . In fact , seven out of General Product 's twelve department heads were greeted by the ominous pink card . Colihan , no longer plagued by doubt , felt that life was definitely worth living . He smiled all the time . His memos were snappier than ever . His heels clicked merrily down the office hallways . He had p-e-p . Then , the most obvious thing in the world happened  --  and Colihan just had n't foreseen it . His record card came up . * * * * * " Have you run through the stack yet ? " Miss Blanche asked . " Er  --  just about . " Colihan looked at her guiltily . He pushed his glasses back on the bridge of his nose . " Couple more here , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Moss would like to have the schedule completed this afternoon . " " It will be . That 's all , Miss Blanche . " His secretary shrugged and left . Colihan went to the Personnelovac with the record in his hand . The file number was 630 . " Do n't let me down , " he told the Brain . He placed the pin-holed card into the machine and flipped the lever . It winked , chittered , chortled , and chuckled with almost sinister softness . When the card was burped out at the other end , Colihan took it out with his eyes firmly shut . * * * * * He walked over to the Action Chute mechanically . His hand hesitated before he dropped it inside . Then he changed his mind , walked back to the desk , and tore the pink card into the smallest possible shreds . The inter-com beeped . " Mr. Moss wants you , " said his secretary . " Colihan ! " " Yes , sir ? " " Do n't act so innocent , Colihan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ready by now . " " Yes , sir ! " " You 're not ACTING , Colihan . You 're stalling ! " " No , sir . " " Then where 's your Personnelovac report , Colihan ? Eh ? Where is it ? " Colihan wrung his hands . " Almost ready , sir , " he lied . " Just running it through now , sir . " " Speed it up . Speed it up ! Time 's a'wastin ' , boy . You 're not afraid , are you , Colihan ? " " No , sir . " " Then let 's have it . No more delay ! Bull by the horns ! Expect it in an hour , Colihan . Understand ? " " Yes , sir ! " The boss clicked off . Colihan groaned audibly . " What can I do ? " he said to himself . He went to the Brain and shook his fist helplessly at it . " Damn you ! " he cursed . He had to think . He had to THINK ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swivel chair like a hooked fish . He beat his hands on the desk top . He paced the floor and tore at the roots of his hair . Finally , exhausted , he gave up and flopped ungracefully on the office sofa , abandoning himself to the inevitable . At that precise moment , the mind being Colihan 's own think-machine . Wilson , the oldest employee of General Products , had been the operator of the maintenance Brain . He had been a nice old duffer , Wilson , always ready to do Colihan a favor . Now that he had been swept out in Colihan 's own purge , the Personnel Manager had to deal with a new man named Lockwood . Lockwood was n't so easy to deal with . " Stay out of my files , mister , " he said . Colihan tried to look superior . " I 'm the senior around here , Lockwood . Let 's not forget that . " " Them files is my responsibility . " Lockwood , a burly young man , stationed himself between Colihan and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need the service records of my Brain . " " Where 's your Requisition Paper ? " " I have n't got time for that , " said Colihan truthfully . " I need it now , you fool . " Lockwood set his face like a Rushmore memorial . " Be a good fellow , ca n't you ? " Colihan quickly saw that wheedling was n't the answer . " All right , " he said , starting for the door . " I just wanted to help you . " He opened the door just a crack . Sure enough , Lockwood responded . " How do you mean , help me ? " " Did n't you know ? " Colihan turned to face him . " I 'm running through an aptitude check on the Personnelovac . Special department head check . Mr. Moss 's orders . " " So ? " " I was just getting around to yours . But I figured I 'd better make sure the Brain was functioning properly . " He grew confidential . " You know , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rockslide began on Lockwood 's stoney face . " Well ... " he said . " If that 's the case  --  " " I knew you 'd understand , " said Colihan very smoothly . * * * * * Eagerly , the Personnel Manager collated the records of the Personnelovac . They were far more complex than any employee record , and it took Colihan the better part of an hour . Any moment he expected to hear the President 's angry voice over the inter-com . His anxiety made him fumble , but at last , the job was done . He slipped the record , marked by a galaxy of pinholes , into the Brain . " Now we 'll see , " he said grimly . " Now we 'll find out what 's eating this monster . " He flipped the switch . The Personnelovac winked . It was several minutes before it digested the information in its chamber . Then it chittered . It chortled . It chuckled . Colihan held his breath until the BURP came . The card appeared . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9987 . Mem . Rat . 9995 . Last Per . Vac . " An . None . Cur . Rat . 100 . " Analysis : Subject operating at maximum efficiency . Equipped to perform at peak level . Is completely honest and does not exhibit bias , prejudice , or sentiment in establishing personnel evaluations . Cumulative increase in mnemonic ability . Analytic ability improving . " Colihan walked slowly over to the Action Chute as he finished reading the card . " However , " it read , " because of mechanistic approach to humanistic evaluation , subject displays inability to incorporate human equation in analytical computation , resulting in technically accurate but humanistically incorrect deductions . " Recommendation : Fire him . " Colihan dropped the pink card into the chute . In half an hour , the Action wheels of General Products concluded their work , and the Personnelovac had winked for the last time . THE END
