Only a month earlier , they were prisoners of war . Since their release , Navy Lieut . Robert Frishman and Seaman Douglas Hegdahl have been recuperating at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Md . The third released P.W. , Air Force Captain Wesley Rumble , 26 , whose fighter-bomber went down over Quang Binh province in April 1968 , returned to his home in Oroville , Calif . <P> Initially , all three men remained silent about their treatment in prison , explaining that they feared for Americans left behind ( TIME , Aug. 15 ) . For Frishman , 28 , who is naturally voluble , keeping si lent about his experiences was almost as agonizing as his 22 months in solitary confinement . Last week , accompanied by Seaman Hegdahl , he decided to " blow the whistle " on Hanoi at a press conference arranged by the Pentagon . <P> Sloppy Work . Frishman , whose right arm was shattered in October 1967 when his F-4C Phantom was shot down over Hanoi , said that North Vietnamese doctors had removed his elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloppy operation , said Frishman , because the doctors " are willing only to do what is necessary to keep us alive . " Because of his loosely dangling forearm , he was known to his fellow inmates as " The Grim Reaper . " <P> The North Vietnamese told him that the most seriously wounded among the prisoners was Lieut . Commander John S. McCain III , son of the American commander in the Pacific . Despite " many broken bones , " Frishman said , McCain " has been in solitary confinement since April of 1968 . " Frishman denounced the mistreatment of another fellow prisoner , Lieut . Commander Richard A. Stratton , a Navy pilot who " was beaten , had his fingernails removed and was put in solitary . " His arms were scarred from cigarette burns . Before Frishman left Hanoi , Stratton told him not to worry about telling the truth . " He said that if he gets tortured some more , at least he 'll know why he 's getting it , and he will feel that it will be worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.W.s suffered their worst treatment immediately after being captured . Some were forced to sit on a stool for days until they collapsed . Others , said Frishman , were hung by their arms from the ceiling . The fact that life improved when generals visited the camp led Frishman to allow that " possibly the higher-ups in North Viet Nam may not know the truth about our treatment . " This supposition seems plausible . The North Vietnamese are extremely sensitive about U.S. public reaction to the war ; coverage in the American press is carefully scrutinized by a special section of the government . <P> Under the Geneva Convention , signed by North Viet Nam in 1957 , prisoners are to be humanely treated and identified , sick and injured released . The Red Cross is to be allowed to inspect the camps , and prisoners ' mail allowed to be delivered . Despite the fact that many captured Americans are injured airmen , only nine men have been freed by North Viet Nam during the past five years . Because the North Vietnamese have generally refused to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans held captive , no one knows exactly how many of the 1,300 U.S. servicemen listed as missing are actually languishing in cells north of the DMZ.
