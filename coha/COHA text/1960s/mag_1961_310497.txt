COVERING Communist China is the toughest problem in journalism today . It is foolish to ignore one-fourth of the world 's peoples ; but it is impossible to report the news out of China with any of the accustomed safeguards of trained eyewitnesses , seeing for themselves and able to verify what they are told . Peking allows only two permanent Western correspondents ( Reuters and Agence France Presse ) , and it shuns their requests and restricts their travel . <P> So the burden falls on Hong Kong . There , TIME Bureau Chief Stan Karnow presides over a tedious and essential operation akin to wartime intelligence gathering . He and Correspondents Jerry Schecter and Loren Fessler interview European and Asian businessmen who travel in and out of China , see diplomats down from Peking , pump the occasional Swiss journalist who gets a mainland visa . They keep a man posted at Kowloon railroad station to watch for arrivals from Canton ; they get word of refugees arriving at Macao , and interview them-poor , haggard and inarticulate people who can tell of the rice ration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away . <P> Then there is the required reading , beginning each morning with the 30 or 40 pages of Hsinhua ( the Communist New China News Agency ) and the daily Peking radio transcript . It is turgid , tendentious and tedious . But the attention that the Chinese Communists give to Albania , or to confessions of crop failures in one province or another , provide clues to explore . A small colony of experts from the U.S. , Britain , France , West Germany and Japan does the same job in Hong Kong , and there is much pooling of information . The U.S. consulate assembles a massive and useful Survey of the Mainland Press providing translations from dozens of Communist periodicals , and there is even an excellent weekly China News Analysis put out by Jesuit priests in Hong Kong , veterans of 20 or 30 years in China . They are intelligent and patient scholars . Much of TIME 's own Hong Kong study of China is the work of Loren Fessler , 38 , who comes from Montana and Harvard , spent years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mandarin . His filing cabinets are full of data on Chinese politicians and economic statistics . After preparing thousands of words on Li Fu-chun , this week 's cover subject , he was concerned to find Li 's name lately dropping out of the press . Fessler last week was almost as elated as Chief Planner Li himself may have been to see Li 's name reappear , high on a list of mourners at a funeral for a Central Committee member . Li , despite all the failures of the Chinese economy , still seems to be riding high .
