Robert Maynard Hutchins , who has always seemed most at ease when grappling with the destinies of whole civilizations , is one of the few men around today for whom a discussion of the fate of a single nation might well be deemed small talk . And so what more appropriate title for a book of essays to celebrate his sixty-fifth birthday than Humanistic Education and Western CivilizatiOn ? It has an amplitude rather like his own career . Very briefly , that career can be said to have begun in earnest in 1929 when , at the age of thirty , Hutchins was appointed President of the University of Chicago . Chicago was already a great university , and whether he dashed and completely destroyed it against the rocks of experiment and innovation or made it the most exciting school of itsfore have entirely new political and social repercussions . In respect to social stability , prospects of democracy , the threat of Communism , and the personal life of the peasant , a very great deal would have changed . In any case , who proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America may have lacked ? bread , health , minimal dignity ? has surely not been caused by the absence of God or His accredited representatives . To argue against foolishness can make one feel somewhat foolish ; but I suppose it is necessary , since Chambers has his representative significance . He was perhaps the most dramatic example we have recently had in America of the intellectual manqu ? hungering for prophecy and power , the journalist of ideological melodrama , the man who fancies himself a mixture of Ivan and Alyosha Karamazov , but more nearly resembles their buffoonish half-brother Smerdyakov . Hutchins 's ideas about undergraduate education have always been winged along on the most high-flown language ? the temporary revival of the now twice-dead word " Dialogue , " for example , is his . Stripped of their rhetoric , four of his most useful ideas have been : 1 ) by and large , textbooks stink ; 2 ) you ca n't hope to educate a student in three or four years ? but you can expose him NOVEMBER 28 , 1964 to a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrelated , and this should be pointed out ; and 4 ) a school need not be much concerned with its students outside the classroom . In Europe these ideas would have been thought commonplace ; in America they were taken as revolutionary " concepts , " and , in some quarters , nothing less than an attempt to overthrow the government . And in point of fact one of the effects of their application at Chicago was to attract to the school a teaching staff and student body who did indeed have something of a small ( and salubrious ) penchant for overthrowing the government . Although many of the contributors to this book at one time or another have taught at Chicago and he himself was a student there , Arthur A. Cohen , the book 's editor , has unfortunately not included any essays dealing with the quality of life at the school of which one noted scholar has recently written : " Rarely have those who would gladly teach been surrounded by so many who would rapturously learn . " At Chicago ideas were taken seriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other schools in this country can that same statement be made . The responsibility for this was ultimately Hutchins 's . As Mr. Cohen rightly insists in his introductory essay , Robert Hutchins has always been essentially a moralist and a utopian , and so the stress at Chicago fell on how the world ought to be . It was generally assumed that anyone with the slightest intellect could perceive how the world in fact was and how this simply was n't good enough . Every large school has its little minority of anarchists , alchemists , and Aristotelians , cranks and Cartesians , professional bohemians , groups banning the bomb , and other groups banning the bomb banners , but at Chicago , where tolerance ran high , these seemed to make up the majority . The girls were not merely uncomely ; they were militantly unkempt : legend had it that a panty raid on one of the girls ' dorms yielded only a set of fatigues and a pair of muddy combat boots . Campus figures abounded . The story is told of a large , heavy-set fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak to match ; one night , while quietly engaged in some minor bit of vandalism he was come upon by the police and chased into Rockefeller Chapel ; with the police still in hot pursuit , he bounded onto the altar of that grand edifice and , drawing the black cloak up across his face , cried out : " Sanctuary ! Sanctuary ! " Needless to say , none was available and he was dragged off . While the academic fare in the College was rich and heady stuff , it is patently untrue that the school ever offered a course called Truth and Beauty ( " consent of instructor " ) . It was not , however , inconceivable for a young man to enter at eighteen with a career in mathematics firmly in mind and to emerge at twenty-eight with an MA in psychology . Occasionally a girl of seventeen or so , having just read Civilization and its Piscontents , would peer deep into THE NEW REPUBLIC her own roiling , seething id and , screaming , in a great suicidal leap hurl herself out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft turf below . There were also a great many foreign students at the university , most of them involved in graduate study , and the lobby of International House , where they boarded , had something of the air of the UN lounge . There were the inevitable Indian women floating across the quadrangle ; the grim Burmese who played gin rummy expertly for a dime a point in the student union , never for a moment changing his expression while on the grand piano in the adjoining room some madman banged out Beethoven with his fists ; the tall Nigerian who , when asked to describe the sensation of hunting rhino on the steppe , replied , " I dare say you would feel like throwing up . " The faculty and administration must have viewed all this with amusement ; certainly they viewed it with detachment . Since , for example , fraternities had become rather unpopular after the advent of Hutchins , some had to take in boarders , and in at least one fraternity wickedness and exotica of a high order were reported widespread : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with both his German Police Dog and his fiancee ; on the floor above a young psychiatrist was bedding down with a mulatto chorus girl ; flamenco dancing and classical guitar cracking late into the night were keeping neighbors from sleep . Proper measures had to be taken . A letter was sent out the essence of whose message was : " For God 's sake , let 's keep this quiet ! " Not cut it out , but keep it quiet . Here , at least in part , was how the world ought to be . After Hutchins left , a " sounder " man was enlisted for the job . Curriculum began to change . Some of the most valued faculty started to drift away . Curriculum was further changed . The " sounder " man now left to take up a seat on the board of directors of Standard Oil . A Nobel Prize winner was hired on and is at the job today . Chicago is still a first-rate school , doubtless one of the four or five best in the nation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or , more importantly , it is less different than all the rest . It was probably inevitable . Sometime in the past decade ? Sputnik is generally cited as the watershed ? higher education became a national priority worth the attention and reflection of politicians and admirals and readers of Life magazine . When this time came the time of the great university presidents ended . As David Riesman perceptively notes : " With the rise of an educated elite , with the use of the universities as sorting stations for talent to run society , academic values enjoy a priority which they have never had before in America . This ensures that power will not be centered in the president or his administrators , but in the academic guild as such . " And yet , although teachers have never been so powerful , it would appear that powerful teaching has never been so conspicuously in abeyance . In the course of his essay in Humanistic Education , F. Champion Ward , formerly Dean of the College , remarks of present teaching practice : " Scholars and scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught . Certainly , the scholarly teacher who cultivated wide intellectual interests and was encouraged to do so , and who showed a concern for the whole impact of his college upon its students , appears to be in retreat . He is being replaced by the professional with a packed suitcase . To retain the latter , colleges raise salaries , lower teaching ' loads , ' and encourage conventional research , only to find themselves engaged in a losing competition with the universities which , in their turn , aspire to the condition of postdoctoral institutes . Meanwhile , the best undergraduate students appear to be expecting more from their education than their teachers have time or inclination to give . " As one of the leading critics of our colleges ' higher vocationalism , Robert Hutchins 's view of all this is well known . Still , looking down on the current educational scene , the sensation must , I dare say , be a little like that accompanying the sighting of a rhino , red-eyed and angry , charging straight at him from less than fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
