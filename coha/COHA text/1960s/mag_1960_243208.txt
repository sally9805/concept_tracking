Just before dawn , at an altitude of 33,000 ft. , Pan American Airways Flight 2 was about 550 miles out of Tokyo , bound for Honolulu . " Suddenly I saw what appeared to be a bright star with a gaseous-appearing halo , elliptical in shape , " said Captain H. Lanier Turner . " But right away I could see it was moving , and I judged it to be an ICBM , or something the Russians were trying to put in orbit . <P> " Within two minutes the star was in the center of the halo , which appeared to be about ten times the size of the moon . Then the star became elongated , in a dumbbell shape , as if a separation were taking place . Then the missile became a spot of light as it merged with the horizon in the purplish light of the early dawn . " <P> Moments later , the rocket splashed close to its target within a triangle of three Russian recovery vessels 1,000 miles south of Hawaii , 8,078 miles from its launching site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of the distance record set by the U.S. 's Atlas last May . Alerted two weeks ago by a Radio Moscow broadcast warning the world 's shipping to stay clear of the 50,000-sq. - mi. target zone , the U.S. Navy had had airplanes circling the area for days ; Navy planes saw the impact , traced the rocket 's progress by telemetry and radar . <P> Two days later the Russians fired another rocket into the Pacific target area , then abruptly canceled this series of tests , which was scheduled to last until the end of the month . So accurate were the rockets , gloated Russian scientists , that further testing was unnecessary . Crowed Tass : " All the necessary data has been obtained for the development of the carrier rocket intended for the further conquest of cosmic space . "
