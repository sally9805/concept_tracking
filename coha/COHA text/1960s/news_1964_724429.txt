But agreement on a common price level for Western Europe 's wheat and other grains has been made possible here . This means that " in principle " President de Gaulle 's deadline has been met to " agree by Dec. 15 or the Common Market may cease to exist . " That means in turn that the European Economic Community can move ahead again in the new year . It also implies that the fight to keep this an outward-looking Atlantic Europe rather than an inward-looking independent Europe now must be transferred to fresh fields  --  todiplomacy , to defense , and to the " Kennedy round " of tariff cuts .

This time , after West Germany had made the necessary concessions , Italy suddenly threw in a veto . The whole laboriously constructed package deal seemed to collapse .

But the West German Government has accepted the common price level that President de Gaulle insisted on . That 's the crucial thing .
