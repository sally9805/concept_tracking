Betsy was one of the fiercest hellions of them all . Screaming in from the Atlantic , she feinted at the Bahamas and Cuba , veered toward the Carolinas , doubled back again-and stopped teasing . When she did , she exacted a death toll that was expected to go as high as 200 . <P> <P> The hurricane , after hurling 140-m.p.h. winds and massive tides into the Bahamas , blew into the southern tip of Florida , where thousands of tourists and residents fled inland . Winds and the highest tides to hit the state since 1926 flooded buildings , ruined crops , disrupted utility services , splintered boats and shattered waterfronts . In a brave attempt to keep guests from fleeing , luxury hotels in soaked Miami Beach threw cheer-up parties . <P> Then , battering northwest into the Gulf of Mexico , Betsy hurtled full-blast into Louisiana and Mississippi . In the Delta lowlands , where Audrey in 1957 took 518 lives in one Louisiana parish , 250,000 refugees sought shelter in schools and churches . The Delta was even more seriously hurt than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $500 million . <P> <P> Betsy 's 90-mile-wide eye passed over New Orleans , nearly half of which is below sea level . Canal dikes burst , sending cascades 8 ft. to 14 ft. deep through the streets . Army and National Guard amphibious craft cruised about picking up trapped householders from roofs and attics . One man paddled to safety girdled by an inner tube . Telephone service and power distribution blacked out . Scores of boats , from big freighters to cabin cruisers , ran aground or broke up . As the floods receded , they left a soggy jumble of ruined cars , fallen trees and utility lines , splintered glass and timber . Sobbed one homeless house wife : " Everything is gone . I do n't even have a pair of shoes . " <P> At week 's end , as the hurricane knocked itself out over the Mississippi Valley , the Weather Bureau announced that the name Betsy , used once before as a storm designation , will be retired for at least ten years " because of this hurricane 's infamy.
