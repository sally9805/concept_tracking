The bitter division of the colony between the Negroes and the East Indians ( still loyal to their countryman Jagan ) is worsening . Violence is spreading from the Georgetown capital to the countryside , where en raged mobs of anti-Jagan Negroes battle with the East Indian farmers . <P> As the fighting continued , Jagan appointed his wife , Chicago-born Janet Rosenberg , a onetime Young Communist Leaguer and the colony 's most controversial woman , to be Minister of Home Affairs , making her , in effect , British Guiana 's top cop . Neither Janet nor her police have been able to quiet things . All that prevents outright racist civil war is the presence of 500 British troops that Jagan called upon to protect his tottering regime . <P> In London Colonial Secretary Duncan Sandys rejected any suggestion that Britain suspend British Guiana 's self-governing constitution and take charge , but another 145 troops were airlifted to British Guiana " because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , the efforts of a British negotiator finally brought a truce between Jagan 's government and the striking unions . But the racial differences have cut so deep that no easy end to the violence was expected .
