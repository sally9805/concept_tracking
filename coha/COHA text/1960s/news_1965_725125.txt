txt It is often said that the West does too much defending against communism instead of taking strong initiatives based on its own ideals . As crisis follows crisis , the State Department is charged with reacting to daily events and not planning far enough ahead . But - there are men in the department who do chart for the future . This report tells how they do it . Compared to the rest of the building , a small set of offices up on the State Department 's seventh floor is as quiet as a meadow pond . No hourly cables flow in and out . No row tine chores intrude . No staccato of staff meetings breaks up the day . This is the zone of the Policy Planning Council-1 &; men whose task is to plan what the United States can do today to achieve the foreign-policy goals it has set in years to come . Perhaps a council member will spend a day reading a book . Or he might stare at a wall for a while . But that is n't all : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy paths // close touch with the busy floors below . Once he has conceived an idea  --  on disarmament , on economic growth in Latin America , on NATO nuclear sharing , on Berlin , on the shape of foreign aid  --  he stands by it as it goes through bureaucratic examination . If it is approved at the top  --  the council reports directly to the Secretary-of State  --  he then helps the administrative officials downstairs put it into action . Once it is under way , he goes back to his planning . 1111 , F concept traced Currently , the council is making plans on most major areas of foreign policy . The concept of the MLF came from it . Members are wary of giving details of recent council suggestions ; many of them , it is said , are still confidential . It is known that , on the economic side , the council was responsible for the current worldwide program by the Agriculture Department and the Agency for International Development to increase food output in underdeveloped countries . A global-council plan called for cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other methods . PresidFit Johnson pushed the idea in a campaign speech last year in New York , then included it in his state of the Union message this year . The Alliance for Progress steering committee now is implementing it . Again , the council has concentrated recent efforts on modernizing marketing techniques in other countries , showing governments how important it is to build up a national market for local and imported goods , then euiding them through the process . Council traced The council was set up in 1947 by Secretary of State George C. Marshall to provide a long-sighted r erspective on foreign policy . Since then , it has roused a good deal of controversy . Critics have accused it of living in an ivory tower  --  of being Utopian , and impractical , others say it is too enmeshed in daily events . The far right has charged it with subverting the policies of the President . Other observers dismiss it as having no weight within the department . Time magazine recently discounted it as having " little influence . " On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has existed for almost 20 years . Its relative strength has gone up and down , but usually it has been headed by men close to the Secretary of State and the President . Thus , its prestige has been high . One long-time observer says thoughtfully . " A lot of its work goes unheeded . But I 'm struck by its relatively high batting average . " Its current director is Walt Whitman Rostow , appointed by President Kennedy in 1961 . Perhaps Mr. Rostow is not as close to President Johnson as he was to President Kennedy , but he told this newspaper : " The only limitation on our contribution to the government is the council 's capacity to generate good and viable plans . " We can always get a hearing . There is no problem of contact with other parts of the State Department or the government in general , including the White House . " Interests combined Mr. Rostow has written that a planner " does not face a choice between long-run and short-run interests : He must combine them . " So each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to bring about a future based , as Mr. Rostow puts it , on the principles contained in the charter of the United Nations . The planners  --  some from the foreign service , others civil servants , professors , and military men on loan from the Pentagon  --  usually work with one or two problems at a time . William H. ( " Red " ) Duggan monitors events in Africa . A foreign-service officer , he travels extensively . He speaks Swahili . Henry D. Owen , donnish and precise , Mr. Rostow 's deputy . A 10-year council veteran , he has a particular interest in West . European and NATO affairs . Ernest K. Lindley covers international organizations . Tall and reserved , he is also a special assistant and speech writer for Secretary of State Dean Rusk , and a former Washington bureau chief for Newsweek magazine . Officer ' loaned ' Robert N. Ginsburgh ( political-military affairs and Vietnam ) is an Air . Force colonel on loan from the Pentagon . Robert N. Magill ( Western Europe ) is a foreign-service officer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , economics of developing countries , particularly Latin America ) is a foreign-service officer . John Huizenga covers the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , Frederick S. Wyle aspects of pOlitical-military problems , and Joseph A. Yager , foreign ' aid and China . Other members deal ? with arms control , the Far East and South Asia , and the Near East and North Africa . They read the most important cables in their areas each day ; if they need some research done , the department intelligence and reseirchbureau does it for them . Their only staffs are their secretaries . They are responsible directly to Mr. Rostow and his deputy , Mr. Owen . How do they decide what to plan about ? Most importantly , each man himself is a specialist , and he knows what ? the critical problems are . Sometimes Mr. Rostow or Mr. Owen hand him something to work on ; perhaps Mr. Rusk will toss out an urgent issue . Washington is a place where the crisis of the day seems to attract everyone 's attention . " All the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as it has been said . Three questions But the council is careful about what it takes up . It asks three questions : Is the problem important ? Is there something lacking in policy that must be provided ? Can the council make its own unique contribution ? Thus the council became involved in the India-Pakistan fighting ? looking at ways of promoting harmony between the two nations , at what Washington could do to end the fighting and strengthen the subcontinent 's economic growth . But it did not - have much to do with the Dominican uprising or the aftermath of United States armed intervention last April 28 . " A planner must be willing to see many problems go by without becoming involved , " one observer says . In the past , the council has worked on many issues  --  and had its ideas accepted on many . Its first director , George F. Kennan  --  former ambassador to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia  --  concentrated on European recovery and the Marshall Plan . Then Paul H. Nitze ( 1949.1953 ) worked closely with the Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , adjusting American policy on German rearmament , the Iranian oil dispute , and air defense . Robert R. Bowie ( 1953-1957 ) was close to powerful Secretary of State John Foster Dulles ; the council gained somewhat in stature as a result , though Mr. Dulles made much policy himself . The concept of . the Development Loan Fund came from the council during Mr. Bowie 's time . Gerard C. Smith ( 1957-1961 ) worked with the council to develop the idea of the , the " hot line " in 1960 , to formulate the multilateral nuclear force plan , also in 1960 , and to launch the Act of Bogota , much of which later appeared as the Alliance for Progress . Mr. Rostow ' worked closely with President Kennedy . In December , 1961 , he and the council worked out a plan to make hard-pressed West Berlin a more attractive city to its young people . It was feared many citizens would leave . A ' council member went to Berlin , plans were made with the . Berlin city govern . ment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was implemented : Again , the council has been concerned with economic development . In 1963 it noted a tendency for local . resources and effort to , gather in the cities , leaving the countryside neglected . It agreed on an over-all method , encourage national markets in which agri ? cultural production would increase along with industrial expansion . Debate and criticize . . . Council members meet once a week , on Friday afternoons , to debate  --  and criticize ? each ' other 's ideas . ' They also prepare policy papers for particular countries : Working with the regional bureaus , a member specializing in the area draws up a draft , which then goes through successive levels of government . Other departments add their ideas . If approved , the paper is signed by the Secretary of State . It becomes binding policy on the entire executive branch . Mr. Rostow wears several other hats as well . He meets each Thursday with planners from the White House staff , Joint Chiefs of Staff , Pentagon , Treasury , the Central Intelligence Agency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat lunch . This is a coordinating function which , under President Eisenhower , was performed by the Operations Coordinating Board of the National Security Council . President Kennedy abolished the OCB in 1961 as " too . bureaucratic . " In addition , Mr. Rostow is counselor of the department  --  once a full-fledged job but now largely a title  --  and United States member of the Alliance for Progress steering committee . Between times , he manages to act as chief American representative on the Atlantic Policy Advisory Group consisting of countries on both sides of the Atlantic , and to be a chief articulator of American foreign policy . " Whatever new intellectual and operational virtuosity we develop , " Mr. Rostow has written , " it is essential that we retain . . . the conviction that , within limits , the future can be shaped , that problems can be solved , and that , with strength , , patience , and insight , the long tradition of which we are a part shall continue to be the mainstream of human history , to be joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our nation was born out of a commitment to ideas  --  incorporated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution  --  which transcend our own borders .
