President Johnson 's moves to correct the U.S. 's balance of payments deficit were painful to some , controversial to many , and likely to damage the nation 's own interests if left in effect too long . Yet the objective was beyond cavil : to prevent recent attacks on the dollar and the speculative rush for gold from growing into an international financial crisis that could undermine prosperity around the world . <P> Having temporized for years , the President finally was forced to act under the goad of unexpected pressure . During the fourth quarter of last year , the deficit soared to the alarming rate of $5.7 billion a year , giving the nation a total deficit for 1967 of between $3.5 and $4 billion , the highest in seven years . By coupling his New Year 's Day announcement of those figures with his stern prescription for lopping $3 billion off the deficit in 1968 , the President managed to minimize the consequences . Despite the Treasury 's subsequent disclosure that the U.S. lost nearly $1 billion of gold during November and December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the exchange markets of London , Paris and Frankfurt last week . <P> <P> The main elements in Johnson 's com plex bag of restrictions : <P> BUSINESS SPENDING . The President 's goal is a $1 billion reduction in corporate investment overseas , which reached $5 billion last year . Under an obscure provision of the 1917 Banking Act , he decreed the first mandatory controls in U.S. history on such outlays , replacing the half-effective " voluntary " restraints in force since 1965 . In South Africa and continental Western Europe ( except for Greece and Finland ) , new investments of money from the U.S. were barred completely . Companies may finance new projects from foreign earnings and depreciation allowances , but only up to a ceiling of 35% of the average level of such expenditures in 1965 and 1966 . In Latin America , Africa and Asia , investments will be held to 110% of the 1965-66 average without regard to the source of funds . Anxious not to deal the British pound another blow , the President in his edict allowed U.S. business investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a maximum of 65% of the 1965-66 base period . On top of that , U.S. companies were ordered to reduce foreign bank balances to their 1965-66 average and to repatriate at least 65% of their European profits . The order , affecting about 1,000 U.S. firms , will be enforced by a new Commerce Department Office of Foreign Direct Investment . Violators face criminal prosecution and fines up to $10,000 . <P> <P> BANK LOANS . In hopes of achieving a $500 million contraction in last year 's $9 billion of bank loans to foreigners , President Johnson ordered a tightening of still voluntary controls administered by the Federal Reserve Board . As with investment controls , the new rules will hit Europe hardest . The Reserve Board asked banks to refuse to renew outstanding loans on the Continent when they mature and to reduce their short-term ( less than a year ) loans in the region by 40% during 1968 . Just to make sure banks cooperate , the President also gave the Fed stand-by power to make the restrictions compulsory .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
