Although it rose no higher than 266 miles above the earth during its eleven-day mission in space , Apollo 7 and its three-man crew last week lifted U.S. space officials to new heights of optimism . " Apollo 7 goes down in my book as the perfect mission , " said Lieut . <P> General Samuel Phillips , Apollo program director . " We achieved 101% of our objectives in this flight . This is a very major step toward the manned lunar landing , and I have every confidence that it will be accomplished by the end of next year . " <P> Before they splashed down in the Atlantic 230 miles south of Bermuda , Apollo 7 Astronauts Wally Schirra , Walter Cunningham and Donn Eisele had completed 163 revolutions of the earth , com piled more man-hours in space than all of the manned Russian flights combined . <P> They conducted scores of experiments , produced the first U.S. live TV shows from space and rendezvoused with their discarded Saturn 4B booster ( see color pictures ) . More important , by checking out Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they confirmed that the craft was completely spaceworthy . If no unexpected difficulties are uncovered as technicians decipher the mountain of data that ac cumulated during the flight , an Apollo 8 crew composed of Frank Borman , James Lovell and William Anders may be sent into orbit around the moon with in as little as six weeks . <P> Buoyant Bags . Successful though it was , the mission ended in tension . For several minutes after splashdown , there were fears that an accident at sea had nullified Apollo 's triumph in space . After a last voice transmission by Command Pilot Schirra from only 200 feet above the surface , Apollo lapsed into unscheduled silence ; recovery helicopters from the aircraft carrier Essex flapped blindly through rainsqualls and fog in a vain search for the spacecraft . Then , Ap suddenly , the helicopters reported that they had picked up Apollo 's homing signals . The spacecraft was only a third of a mile from its selected landing spot . <P> Apollo 's temporary silence was easily explained . As the cone-shaped spacecraft hit the ocean , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . With the capsule in a nose-down position , its submerged antennas were useless . But the astronauts , trained for such contingencies , had to inflate three flotation bags attached to Apollo 's nose . As the bags became buoyant , they swung the nose toward the surface until the spacecraft flipped upright , exposing the antennas and allowing radio transmissions to be resumed . <P> Ferried to the Essex by helicopter , the three heavily bearded astronauts walked unsteadily , obviously weary after their long confinement . But NASA doctors reported that despite colds , loss of weight ( Schirra 41 Ibs. , Cunningham 8 , Eisele 10 ) , and muscles weakened by inactivity , the three space travelers were in good health - and in better humor than they had been for most of the week . The irritability that they had displayed during exchanges with ground controllers , said the doctors , was a natural consequence of long confinement , a rather humdrum flight and troublesome head colds . NASA 's Paul Haney had another explanation : " Something happens to a man when he grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to protest . "
