Aside from the approval of the King , the first thing Greece 's new military rulers sought was the blessing of the Greek Orthodox Church . Premier Constantine Kollias and the chief Ministers were sworn into office by Chrysostomos , the Primate of Greece , and one of the new government 's first decrees was an order solemnly commanding Greece 's young people to attend church . Last week the junta 's reforming zeal turned on the church itself . With a curt de cree , the government dismissed the 86-year-old Chrysostomos and the twelve bishops of the Holy Synod , the church 's highest governing body . In as the new Primate went Archimandrite leronymos Kotsonis , a professor of canon law who happens to be personal chaplain to King Constantine . The government also replaced the bishops with churchmen of its own choice . <P> <P> Though the spectacle of soldiers meddling in ecclesiastical affairs was unpleasant , the fact is that the Greek church , which commands at least the nominal allegiance of 96% of Greece 's 8.5 million people , has hardly set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges that its newly elected Primate was a homosexual ; he was subsequently deposed . It was shaken two years later when a bishop was dethroned for committing adultery with his housemaid . In 1965 , after the bishops became embroiled in a violent public scramble for wealthy sees , the civilian government of Premier Stephanos Stephanopoulos stepped in and ordered the Assembly of Bishops to stop shuffling the sees to the highest-bidding bishops . The junta justified last week 's invasion of church affairs on the grounds that it was trying to make the church more attractive to Greece 's young people . <P> No Beards . In temporal matters , the junta took the first step toward a return to parliamentary rule by creating a 20-man commission of jurists and professors to revise the new constitution . It formally charged the military 's archenemy , Andreas Papandreou , 48 , with conspiracy to commit high treason as the leader of the neutralist Aspida plot . As it ordered his trial , probably within the next few months , the junta gave assurance that it would not demand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andreas ' 79-year-old father , former Premier George Papandreou , and promised soon to set free at least half the 6,000 or so suspected Communists who were rounded up in the early hours of the April 21 coup . <P> The junta , however , showed no mercy to the beatniks who normally swarm into Greece each summer in search of fun and inexpensive living . From now on , declared Interior Minister Stylianos Pattakos , no traveler will be allowed to enter Greece if he has a beard , scruffy clothes , or less than $80.
