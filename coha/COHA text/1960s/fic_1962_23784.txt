A Compound in Passalonia A Story by RICHARD ROGIN 0 N H IS last afternoon in the army , Private Dale Grissom , RA 12390671 , seventeen years in , lay deep in the sag of his silver bedsprings , his shoulders and head resting on a mattress snaked at the end of the bunk : thirty-eight years old , sharp-nosed , smoking the end of a cigarette . his blue eyes attempting a private wisdom . Grissom came from no part in particular . He had joined up in the summer of 1939 , acquiring in the stark pine barrens and sand-colored frame barracks a vernacular , the accent of the Regular Army . Now he did n't even seem to have a first name . Delayed by two wars he had arrived at a comfortable place with an AWOL bag full of westerns and comic books , a place shaped like a PX , a bed , a barracks . " Once I got as high as corporal , " he would smile ; but he was n't used to the imperial and fell soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't remember all of them though he sorted through the years and countries . What AWOLs where ? What drunkenness ? What assault ? He had a deft light-footed way of walking . his solid body crouched slightly , muscles bunching on his half-raised arms , as if ready to turn quickly and fend off something . When he slept hisbreathing was deep , slow , and regular . sounding like cheering crowds on a distant field or a company , faint , far away , shouting in cadence . Grissom had been transferred to Headquarters &; Headquarters Company six months before but his assignment was the same as always : working on the jeeps and two-and-a-half-ron trucks in the motor pool . He seemed to be rarely oui ( ) I ' his fatigues . He would sit with others , drinking coffee and watching television for hours in the aquarium dark of the night mess hall or swiftly empty pitchers of beer in the PX , his cap tipped back , his childish wrinkled face relaxed in a boozy grin . He joined the endless army talk  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripes , women , cars , and epic drunks  --  but Grissom 's exploits somehow had an odd antique air as though they had happened a hundred years ago , if at all . In the barracks his foot and wall lockers were scrupulously neat and uncluttered ; the boards under his taut bed whitened with vigorous mopping ; shoes and boots , gleaming and evenly lined up : uniforms starched ; GRISSOM stenciled clearly on the white cotton strip over the right breast pocket of his fatigues . Indeed , he seemed after long travail to have 58 A COMPOUND IN PASSALONIA memorized the ritual as if he knew an cyc chart by heart and could reel off the letters in a rush . There were lapses though ; the motor pool sergeant would find him stretched out asleep under the engine of a jacked-up truck . " I do n't have the course made , " Grissom would say , " no siree . But I got some of it knocked , no sweat . " Now on this pleasant June afternoon it was coming to an end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field jacket ; his bivouac gear had been spread out on the floor of the supply room and checked off . His M-1 and bayonet had been given their final inspection and cleared . Grissom had spent a morning taking apart his rifle , ramming a lightly oiled patch in and out of the bore , then holding it to the sun and peering into the swirling brilliance as if it contained a picture of the future . Then , as if there were a choice , he had put his finger over the open end and darkened whatever he saw . He was going out , away from the army on a 368 discharge as an undesirable ; in the morning he was to report to the Separation Center and pick tip his discharge papers . Taking a train he would get off at his destination and hind himself in another country : a place the Regulars called , with distaste and awe , The Outside . So on his last afternoon Private Grissom lay on his bunk in a pair of summer pants and a light , gray windbreaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the souvenirs of seventeen years , under the springs , waiting until he was ready to go past the gate MPs for the last time . P F C James Piper , a two-year draftee with a furious desperate boredom with the army , a talent for anxiety , and one hundred and eleven days to go , walked across the firebreak , clouds of dust billowing up around his shoes . It was a hot dry day and his freshly starched khakis were stiff and uncomfortable against his skin . He tried to walk in a rigid fashion keeping the uniform away from his body but it was too awkward . A fireman 's shovel clanked against the furnace door in a nearby barracks fireroom . It was the time of day when the hot-water boilers would be fired up for the troops coining off duty . He walked by the PX , the barbers sitting around idly in the heat of the afternoon , and headed for the supply room . Sergeant Pound was there leaning on the counter , humming movie music . Piper said he was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have a good sleep up there , soldier , " he sassed . Charge of Quarters meant you were supposed to stay up all night in headquarters , answer any telephone calls , and in a general , though make-believe , way look after the regiment until Sergeant Major Orlando came in the next morning . The officer of the day would be there ( the bedding was for him ) but he usually went to sleep around midnight : then the privates could sleep , too , For a few hours . Most soldiers liked the detail because it was easy , no rank kept watch over you , and the next day was free . When CQ came on a weekend , though , it meant duty twenty-four hours straight ; Piper always sold his for ten dollars . In an army life of exaggerated depression and small saving comedies , where nothing was trivial to him , Piper was determined to get off post on pass every weekend . Saturday noon he would slowly drive his faded blue Chevy down the winding road toward the wire fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always fearful that a white-gloved MP would halt him at the last moment for some obscure infraction and order him back to the barracks . Then when he was past the gate on Route 2 , on his own , he would feel physically lighter , as if in just passing the gate he had undergone a transformation . Ever since that first soft blue day on the noon bus for Fort Dix , riding by the reek of the Hackensack marshes , Piper had been waiting for it all to end . He was twenty-three and had recently decided during a five-hour drive from his Massachusetts post to New York to become a teacher . He was now probing army regulations to try and get out in time for summer school At Columbia . If he could only get out to start work on a master 's degree , he knew with impatient certainty everything would be all right again . Captain Ericson , his company commander , had told him , fixing the angry dismay on Piper 's face : " All you 're losing is a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have to fight a war . " But Piper , untouched by the moment of candor , did n't want to lose even that ; he was n't convinced of his fuck though he knew he might have been some nameless recruit going off to Troy to fight ten years on that hot plain . Richard M. Rosin spent two years in the army ( mostly in newspaper work ) and was later a reporter on the New York " World Telegram " and other papers . He is a Dartmouth graduate who studied also at Cambridge University ; this is his second story in " Harper 's . " The army had made him strip off his civilian clothes that first afternoon in a vast warehouse , dressed him in an ill-fitting uniform , compelled him to follow its insane logic , which was established and superseded , over and over , issuing forth in an endless parade of mimeographed orders . On the edge of despair Piper would plan a wild coup : he would seize the mimeographing room first , destroy the stacks of stencils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't have to account for his two years ' absence , relieved he had made the trek : marched out from bivouac at dawn , the brown field grass bent and whitened with frost , the woods silent , and had returned long afterward on a summer night in great fatigue , as if through a dream , his rifle grafted achingly to his shoulder , one of a column of helmeted shadows trudging through the warm dark , through the thick dust , rifle stacking swivels swinging up and down in a ceaseless metallic cadence . Washing hastily in the winter dark before morning formation he often wondered , anguished at his loss of control , if it would only all be over in a hundred years as a soldier had said with the sardonic mastery of old pain . Would he always hear the payday craps game like mice running across the floor above , smell the acrid effluvium of coal gas in the gray winter air , or , cold and crowded , huddle in the back of a truck , holding his rifle tightly between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soldier of misery , entered the cool of the barracks . H E could see Grissom lying on his springs halfway down the left-hand row of beds , each made up head to foot . Grissom had been moved in three weeks ago to the bunk next to Piper 's . Piper knew he had been given an undesirable discharge and that this was his last afternoon . If Grissom talked of his 368 lie did so to his buddies , RAs who might understand the prospect of no more barracks : what it would mean to he always on your own time only three years from retiring , if you wished , on half-pay . Piper had read in the Arm Times of the directive from Washington : discharge all problem Regular Army enlisted men , get rid of low-IQ personnel . It had seemed just , he thought : they should have exiled guys like Grissom long ago . The army was incompetent enough without him around . Some colonel at post had decided after all this time that Private Grissom would never make good noncommissioned officer material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard shat Grissom hid been cinnismat tialed more times than he could remember . Now he said hello and Grissom nodded back , his eyes still preoccupied . Piper stuffed the bedding into the bottom of his wall locker and locked it away . He lay back on his bed , hands clasped under his head . Though he considered Grissom with barely softened contempt  --  a dumb Regular who had made his home in the barracks and PX  --  he was curious to find out , if he could , how he felt about going out . " I hear you 're leaving tomorrow , " he said . " Yuh , " Grissom answered . Though he already knew , he asked : " What happened ? " " I screwed up , ' ' said Grissom , and then added with a grin , " by the numbers . I clone nothing for three-four years , but they got the record . " There was a pause . " Did you get to travel much to good places ? " asked Piper . " You know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piper with a memento , " I was stationed once in Passalonia . In Spain . " " Where ? " asked Piper , slowly curious . " Passalonia . " " Where 's that ? " " I do n't know , " Grissom said , " but I was there . In ' 46 . We had a compound and it had every-thing . We never went out . I tested parachutes . There was a big tower  --  just high enough for a ' chute to open  --  and we jumped . That was the life . " " Do n't you mean Barcelona ? " Piper asked , searching for the closest-sounding name . " No , it was n't that . Passalonia . " " But we did n't have any troops in Spain in ' 46 , " he said , though he was n't entirely sure . " I was there , " Grissom declared . " Testing ' chutes . " It rested at that . Piper was sure he had been somewhere in ' 46 but it was probably a stockade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptical silence Piper asked : " What are you going to do now ? " Grissom was quiet for a while , giving the appearance of ending a deliberation which had started early in the clay . " I 'm going to do some firing for effect out on the range , " he said slowly in a tense voice . " I 'm going to get my old M-1 and lie down in the prone and squeeze away , round by round . Then when I 'm zeroed in , I 'm going to close my eyes and keep pulling the trigger until there 's nothing more  --  just a hole where the bull's-eye was . I always wanted to shoot the bull's-eye right out of the target . " When he finished his voice was harsh and breaking , his eyes moist with tears , the skin tight against his cheekbones . Piper had never seen GO A COMPOUND IN PASSALONIA Grissom show any major emotion at all before , so when the private gave a snorting laugh , Piper joined in , laughing with relief since he didn't. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fm going to do it , you see , " he said . kseries of dry mirthless laughs exploded from his mouth . " Get the colonel another shooting trophy , " Piper tried to joke . But at this Grissom swung his body up and his face hardened as if ready to deal or receive blows . " Damn the goddamned colonel , " he said abruptly . And then reducing his angry posture he propped himself on an elbow and expertly flicked his cigarette , sizzling , into a butt can on the floor . ' What I meant , " Piper continued lamely , " what are you really going to do now ... for a living ? " He did n't care anymore , even indifferently , about Grissom 's future . He should never have started a conversation with this jerk , Piper thought . Who cared how he felt about leaving ? Whether he thought he had it coming ? Piper wanted to get back to the familiar cadence of his own anxieties , keep his imagination exclusively occupied with what he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know for sure , " Grissom answered . " I may get me a job through my brother-in-law in a trucking outfit in Kansas City . " " Sounds good , " said Piper , surprised that Grissom had relatives , silently thinking that he better have four thousand dollars in Soldier 's Deposit , hoarding it against catastrophe , because otherwise he 'd be walking the streets . Not that he cared a damn . They both lay quietly for a few minutes until it was time for Piper to leave for a quick meal with the KPs . He nicked the bedding and a copy of Tristram Shandy under his arm . " Good luck , " said Piper . Grissom said thanks like a stranger grateful for directions in an alien city . * AWOL . AWOL , where you been ? Out in the woods drinking gin . AWOI .. AWOL , where you been ? The chanted words died away as the soldier passed under the windows of regimental headquarters . Sitting at the sergeant major 's desk on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PFC Piper knew he was headed for the pickup point down the road . A car stopped , started again , and Piper could imagine it passing the post gate , swinging left on Route 2 toward Boston or right toward Worcester . " Might go AWOL some day myself , " Sergeant of the Guard Ulysses Smith said without conviction . The sergeant had come into the office with his .45 slung across his right hip and a roll of girlie magazines and comic books in his left hand , as if to balance his destiny . He had a neat small mustache and lustrous dark brown boots laced with yellow leather thongs . The starch crackled in his uniform as he moved about , talking , parting the air with his right hand for emphasis . Before he left for the guardhouse the sergeant told Piper he came from Long Branch , New Jersey , and wanted to get out and be a policeman there . He had been in twelve years , he said , and that was enough . Piper nodded in silence . It made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for belief . Night duty was another habit ; you said different things than during the clay . Piper even envied Grissom now , leaving in the morning . The colonel and his captains and sergeants had all gone home from their barren anonymous offices and the headquarters was resuming its old air of desuetude . Abandoned several years before as a Bachelor Officers ' Quarters for reservists during their summer training , the ramshackle two-story frame building had been salvaged and painted white that spring for the regiment . Standing off the road with sparse woods on three sides it looked like a dormitory for waiters , lifeguards , and cooks at a large summer hotel in the mountains . In back of the building , in what appeared to be a gesture by the management , a lawn was struggling out of a patch of rocks and sandy soil under the colonel 's window . A private whitewashed wooden fire escape led down into the midst of this brave effort . Piper made the OD 's bed in the first-floor trophy room with more care than usual ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star leading the remnants of a platoon from a machine-gun slaughter on Pork Chop Hill . The cot and two glass cases of pistol and rifle trophies barely furnished the large cool room . He checked the first-floor lights and made sure the rear door was locked ; the front door was always left open . In a few hours , he knew , when the lieutenant had gone to sleep after his last jeep inspection of the guard , would be the best time : dark and quiet , alone with his book , American Airlines ' " Music ' Til Dawn " coming softly over the radio . Then with the multitudinous bootfall of the parade grounds over for the day , the murmurous barracks stilled , the sense of the regiment lying about him in the dark , Piper would have the rare feeling that he was not only the night caretaker of the regiment , but , somehow , of the world . The only noise now was the whirring of the wall clock in the S-1 office across the hail on the second floor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the world had gone mad with age . Later the moths would start battering against the copper-screened windows opposite the fluorescent light . Around eleven-forty-five the company fire reports started coming in : sleepy voices from orderly rooms around the regiment , company Cgs passing away the night . Everything was secure ; it always was . He called up several laggards  --  Heavy Mortar Company and two companies in the Second Battalion . When the report was complete he called the firehouse . Though he was ready for the bell that clanged on the telephone , it always startled him . Mr. Rogers answered and PFC Piper , CQ for the Fifth Regiment , told him all was secure . He knew he had about another good hour and a half before he would hunch over , the sudden sour taste of fatigue thick in his mouth , his eyes heavy and tight . He would come out of the bad stretch after several hours ' dozing the night cold in the adjutant 's dirty orange leather chair or head down on the sergeant major 's desk . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he easy then and full of anticipation . Piper 's system was to do his cleanup dusting and emptying of wastebaskets at night . The whole routine irritated him but he tried to do a thorough job ; the consequences were unpredictable . He wiped off the adjutant 's desk and dumped his ash tray . At the end of the hall he first cleaned the executive 's office , riffling casually through the papers in the In and Out boxes to see if there was anything interesting to pass on , and then the adjoining office , the colonel 's , with its big glass-topped desk . Leaving the cleaned dark office , Piper returned down the hall to the sergeant major 's desk and turned off the fluorescent light . The barracks across the road had now disappeared in the night except for the red and white fire lights , gleaming like ships ' riding lights . Standing by the window he thought how the dawn would start coming up over , the motor pool in a few hours : pale rose , lemon , and green , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cleanup detail would come , grumpy and tired , to sweep and mop . Sergeant Orlando would make them do the latrine once more or give the colonel 's desk another wipe ; there was always one more thing . But after that therewould be breakfast , a hot shower if the fireman was n't lazy or unlucky with his fire , and then he could sack out until noon while the others went off to duty . It was good to lie there like a tourist and have the sergeants come in for a look . Imagining this prospect , PFC Piper moved on to his routine fantasy which he ran through with professional ease : all over post , company commanders made a surprise appearance at morning formation to announce the end of service for draftees ; those who wished to leave could do so at 1100 hours . He had a vision of cheering men streaming from the barracks like the campus rush on the last morning of classes before Christmas holidays . He put his head down on Sergeant Orlando 's desk but instead of dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking into a dark warm barracks after a weekend pass . It was summer and the men were sleeping restlessly on top of their sheets . He came slowly and surely clown the aisle like a sleepwalker . It was as if he were entering a dream  --  a dream within a dream  --  as if this would always be happening . Then in one of those instant transitions peculiar to dreams , a scene shift engulfed Piper in sudden terror : he was now in a darkened aquarium . He could hear the great pale sea turtles giving a final bump against the thick glass with their mottled beaks and gliding past ; huge fish swimming in close upon him in the dark , their slimy flanks touching him . PIPER woke in the dark office to hear the front door below banging shut . He pulled the light cord . There were no noises of a jeep driving away which would have signaled Lieutenant Collier being dropped off after his last , late inspection of the guard . He figured it must be some guy hauling in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then have to be told to go down again and go across the regiment to Personnel , and be tired and angry . But almost before he could finish his thought , Piper could hear running steps up the narrow stairs . He got up fast , curious and a little fearful , and went to the doorway . He could see a figure pause at the landing , stare at him in the darkness , his breath coming in gasps , and then breaking the momentary spell , turn and run down the hall toward the colonel 's office . In the deft moment of turning Piper could see what had fixed his attention from the start : the man was carrying an M-1 . Piper stood tranced at the opening to the dark hall . Someone , he thought , is setting off fire-crackers in the colonel 's office . Then , completely alert , he heard the sounds of a rifle firing , the noise of glass shattering , bullets ripping through the wall planking . There was a sudden brief silence , the sound of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then renewed bring , wood splintering ; then there was another pause and a heavy thud as though a desk had been heaved over . Piper could hear excited voices from the barracks across the road , could sense , without seeing , the lights going on . He wished Collier were back ; he 'd give him an oak-leaf duster for his Silver Star now . He ran back to the desk and crouching , called the MPs . A high-voiced corporal answered the telephone . " This is CQ at the Filth . " Piper cried softly into the mouthpiece . " There 's a nut down here shooting up the colonel 's office . He 's got an M-l . " His words ran together , flurried by excitement and the need to talk quickly and quietly . " Where 's he at ? " the corporal asked . " The Fifth Regiment headquarters . The colonel 's office . " " Where ? " the corporal asked again , idiotically . " The Fifth Regiment , the Fifth Regiment . " " OK , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation . The telephone clicked and went dead . Piper wildly conjured up the scene on the hill . The high-voiced corporal would have given the alarm . Troops would be pouring out of the MP mess hall as if they were going to war , shoving cups of coffee aside , leaping into jeeps and roaring down the road from the stockade , red lights winking away , carbines ready , .45s unfiapped , ready to shoot a million Reds . They 'd even be waking them up in the guardhouse and soldiers would come running down the worn stairs . In no time at all there would be ten MPs ganging around headquarters hunting for some berserk guy who had broken into an arms room , swiped a rifle , a handful of clips of ammo , and gunned up the colonel 's office . It was several seconds before Piper realized it was quiet down the hall . Had he left by the fire escape ? An excited babble came from the road , and above the running feet , the shouts and roaring of jeep engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeep , bellowing , " What the hell 's going on around here ? " There was a brief whispered conference and then a charge of boots up the stairs . Piper got the hall lights on just as Collier , his .45 out , leading three MPs , reached the landing . " He 's down there , " Piper gestured . The lieutenant , without even the flourish of a " Come on out of there or we 'll shoot , " which Piper somehow expected , rushed to the colonel 's office , He tagged along , safely behind , but close enough to hear Collier 's whistled goddamn as the fluorescent tubes flared in the office . The first flickering light revealed a man hunched over in the colonel 's bullet-punctured leather chair , a rifle propped neatly against the splintered overturned desk , the flour glinting with broken glass and golden shells . Collier yanked him up by the front of his windbreaker . With a sudden and plangent sorrow , Piper looked into the clenched sharp-nosed features of Dale Grissom as if he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , look who done it , " cried a soldier in the mobbed room . The lieutenant released his hold and two MPs took his limp arms . Grissom lifted his head with deliberate effort . Nobody had asked , nobody doubted ; but he answered , " I done it , " in a weary defiant voice , as though , in truth . he had not only leaped from a towering platform , testing parachutes . but had survived , too . He kept repeating , " 1 done it , I clone it , " as they led him awkwardly over the debris , through the crowd . Piper watched Grissorn 's back , the shoulders sagging with exhausted rage , as he disappeared through the doorway . He left behind the acrid smell of gunpowder like desperation in the room . Piper still heard his words : it seemed to him the old private had , painfully , with pride , finally confessed his first name . Piper was overwhelmed with a soft unraveling fatigue . Burdened with an almost forgotten joy , lie implored all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without honor , dreaming in the dark barracks , would find their way back to Passalonia .
