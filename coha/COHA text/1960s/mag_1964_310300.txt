Democrats , quite understandably , wish that the Bobby Baker case would quietly disappear . Republicans , also understandably , would like to keep it wide open at least until November . This conflict of interests has caused some spectacular fireworks in the staid Senate chamber . <P> Slow Burn . New Jersey Republican Clifford Case helped bring things to a head by urging that the Rules Committee reopen the Baker probe and question Senators . " When I hear of an employee of the Senate boasting that he has ten members of this body in his hand , " said Case , citing a statement attributed to Baker , " I do a slow burn . " Delaware Republican John J. Williams followed with a resolution that would authorize the committee to quiz Senators and to look into " any illegal , immoral or improper activities " including the misuse of campaign funds . <P> Democrats practically went through the rotunda at that , particularly Washington 's Warren ( " Maggie " ) Magnuson . Noting that some of the Senators sponsoring the resolution were up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not run their campaigns on hot air . They might , but I feel certain they do not . " Replied Williams : " The Senator from Washington has a great voice . But he reminds me of my favorite animal when I was a boy on the farm . I always refer to my good friend from Washington as ' Maggie . ' That was the name I gave to my old friend on the farm - Maggie . He was a jackass . " For a moment Maggie looked as if he had just been kicked by one . Finally he came back with a retort that was , at best , second best : " The Senator keeps some gabby old hens down there too , does he not ? " <P> Shouting Match . The shouting match got worse the next day when the Senate met to consider Williams ' resolution . <P> Majority Leader Mike Mansfield was on his feet , attacking the resolution for its " sly innuendo , " when suddenly Case bolted from his seat . " Mr. President , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , " a point of personal privilege ! " Mansfield ignored him . Case , arms waving and face purpling , kept shouting . By now , Mansfield was getting pretty hot himself . " I do not yield the floor for any purpose ! " he cried . For nearly 20 minutes , the two men yelled across the aisle at each other while Teddy and Parliamentarian Charles Watkins flipped frantically through the rule book . Not quite sure of what to do , Democrat Teddy repeatedly thumped his gavel and ordered Republican Case to sit down. * The Democrats then defeated the Williams resolution . <P> Virtually shamed into action by the G.O.P. 's prodding , the Rules Committee did begin studying an 18-page draft report on the Baker investigation prepared by its special counsel , Lennox McLendon of North Carolina . The report noted " the existence of a breeding ground of practices inimical to the public interest , " offered three recommendations to Senators and Senate employees : 1 ) that there be " compulsory public disclosure " of their financial holdings ; 2 ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business with the Government ; and 3 ) that they be required to testify at the request of Senate committees . There was not much chance that the Senate would accept these recommendations . <P>
