txt Controversy swirled instantly around President Johnson 's new $112.8 billion budget . It is one of the least certain , as it is unquestionably the biggest , in history . Basic facts of the budget estimates have been known for days or weeks . The so-called " administrative budget " shows a deficit of S1.8 billion for the 12 months . July 1 , 1966 to June 30 , 1967 ( receipts $111 billion ; expenditures , $112.8 billion ) . The more comprehensive " cash budget " shows a surplus of $500 million ( receipts S145.5 billion ; expenditure , $145 billion ) . Flexibility sought But from President Johnson on down , officials acknowledged that the Vietnam war hangs like a big question mark over the figures . " Because of the uncertainties inherent in this situation , the 1967 budget is designed to provide flexibility of response to changing conditions , " Mr. Johnson told Congress . And he added grimly that " If events in Southeast Asia " require it , " I will not hesitate to request the necessary sums . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have " guns and butter , " too . The administration position is that the booming American economy can provide both  --  without inflation . At a briefing here , Treasury Secretary Henry H. Fowler said that this is a " moderately restraining budget . ? . avoiding further stimulus and moving in the direction of moderate restraint . " Basic reasoning here is simple . When the government spends more than it takes in , it stimulates the economy . Such stimulus in the past five years has given the United States this year the fastest growth rate of any big nation in the world  --  estimated at 5.5 percent . This federal stimulus , or pump priming , now is to be removed , theoretically at any rate . In the current 1966 fiscal year ( ending next June 30 ) federal payments on the cash budget to the public are postulated at $6.8 billion more than receipts . In the next fiscal year Mr. Johnson proposes to take $500 million more from the public than the government puts back in . This should be a mild brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's critics . They are skeptical over some of the government 's " economies " ; they charge that costs have been minimized and argue that demand has not been damped down adequately . President Johnson , however , presented his version first , contained in a 35-page message , supported by the huge official budget . He said , in essence , that he was not going to stop the war on poverty to fight the war in Vietnam . Figures comnared " Inflation need not be the price of social progress , " he said , " nor should it be the cost of defending freedom . " Except for the additional costs of Vietnam , Mr. Johnson said , the regular 1966 budget ( administrative ) would have shown a balance this year . ( It is expected to show a $6.4 billion deficit . ) He is budgeting $10.3 billions for Vietnam next year . This year it cost S4.6 billion . Budget increases for 1967 will be almost all due to the war , Mr. Johnson said ; regular expenditures will rise only $0.6 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // *Guns - butter budget stirs up debate // $3.25 billion , but cuts will counterbalance this elsewhere . Thus , Mr. Johnson budgets an additional $1.4 billion for the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , but cuts $1.8 billion from the Department of Agriculture . Receipts expected He expects $11 billion higher receipts in 1967 than in 1966 ; of this , $3.6 billion will come from new tax measures and most of the balance from rising national income . The new tax proposals have been explained before : Reinstatement of excise taxes on cars and telephones and faster collection of corporate and individual income taxes . President Johnson is keeping his options open . " Should unforseen inflationary pressures develop , " he told Congress , " I will propose such fiscal actions as are appropriate to maintain economic stability . " Critics call some Johnson proposals financial " sleight of hand . " For example , one " reduction " is from a $1.5 billion increase in the sale of government assets . By a quirk of governmental bookkeeping this is budgeted as a spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devices used Other presidents have used such devices , however . Critics are up against high administration prosperity , and the belief that , so far anyway , the administration has been right oftener than not in economic planning . Mr. Johnson told Congress that since 1962 taxes have been cut " $20 billion , " despite which budget receipts are estimated to be " about $21 billion greater in 1966 than they were five years earlier in 1961 . " At a briefing , Secretary Fowler intimated that he expects an inflation of 1.9 percent this calendar year and the same next year . Other guesses have ranged to 2.5 percent . Doors left open Mr. Johnson left doors and windows open as escape hatches . Tax policy , he said , " must be used flexibly . " He added , " We must be equally prepared to employ it in restraint of an overly rapid economic expansion as we are to use it as a stimulus to a lagging economy . " He viewed present prospects calmly . " The current situation calls for a modest measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier requests to Congress for more highway and airway taxes . There were few purple passages in the message . He said briefly that he would ask for " full use of the rent-supplement program . " In a curt , seven-word reference , he asked repeal of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act , but without a single supporting argument . 211 Budgets compared These are comparisons between the United States budget estimate for fiscal 1967 , that of the Soviet Union , and the budgets of other countries and South America .
