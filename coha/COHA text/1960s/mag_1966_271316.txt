<P> To Berkeley 's aging young agitators , it was a dreamlike revival of past hell raising . To Berkeley 's recently confident administrators , it was a sickening replay of two-year-old nightmares . Cops swung clubs on campus . Angry students scratched and bit policemen , or defiantly lay prone . The perennial martyr , Non-Student Mario Savio , exhorted cheering students , some perched in trees , to stay out of class . Nearly 2,000 of them did , and Berkeley again seemed close to coming unhinged . <P> There were significant differences between last week 's disorders and those of November-December 1964 . Two years ago , well-organized campus rebels cleverly exploited broadly held malaise over the coldness of the " multiversity " to bring the school " to a grinding halt , " as Savio put it . Last week the protesters were chaotic and focused on issues that were either trivial or phony-but the students , as though by reflex , were stirred up . " We have an emotional snowball on our hands , " conceded Chancellor 's Assistant John Searle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been facing student pressures with a growing firmness . He refused to readmit Savio as a student when Savio broke rules against nonstudents distributing literature on campus . Heyns said that the students ' public-address system in front of hallowed Sproul Hall disturbed classes , carried " speech that is often vicious , dishonest , laced with slander and character assassination and often charged with hatred , " and proposed moving it . <P> Searching for a trigger for a new tumult , activists lit on U.S. Navy recruiters manning tables inside the Berkeley student union . A nonstudent , anti-Viet Nam , anticonscription group called the Draft Information Committee set up a table next to the Navy recruiters . Campus police ordered it removed . A crowd appeared , including Savio and Communist Student Bettina Aptheker . A fist fight broke out between two students , which drew more spectators . Some set up picket lines around the Navy table , then sprawled on the floor when police said picketing inside was illegal . <P> Bad Bites . Police sealed the doors of the building after about 200 students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to let conscientious objectors set up a table beside the recruiters , and Dean of Students Arleigh Williams said that no one would be arrested if all would move on . Both offers were ignored . Several hours later , Executive Vice Chancellor Earl F. Cheit , filling in for Heyns , who was attending meetings at Harvard and Princeton , summoned about 100 campus and local police . Armed with warrants , they arrested six nonstudents , including Savio . <P> The arrival of the cops enraged the demonstrators . They shoved the officers , tried to prevent the arrests , blocked their path to the paddy wagons . The police , in turn , lashed out with their clubs . A girl cried , " They 're killing me ! " A boy , dragged out by his long locks , screamed , " Damn fascists ! " One officer , his hand bleeding freely , said he had been bitten . The officers forced their way through some 400 jeering students outside the building . Three students were arrested for interfering with the police , one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
