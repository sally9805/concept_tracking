After watching its best team suffer through that football game that might someday deserve to be called the Super Bowl , the American Football League should at least benefit from a hard but presumably valuable lesson : the AFL is as far behind the NFL as the Chiefs were behind the Packers . The way to figure it is not in points but in players . // There is nothing embarrassing about losing to Green Bay by 25 points . If there were , most teams in the NFL would have , at one time or another , given up the game in shame . But the Chiefs were not just another Packer opponent . They were to the AFL this season what the Packers were to the NFL  --  the champions . The AFL has claimed for two or three years that it has arrived at a position of equal strength . Were that the case , the Chiefs  --  regardless of the score , which in championship games can be as unlikely as Cleveland 's 27-0 over Baltimore in 1964 or Green Bay 's 37-0 over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any major weaknesses . // The fact is , the Chiefs showed several obvious ones . The Kansas City players knew before the game what their soft spots were . In conversation they kept using phrases like " with our personnel , " the way you would say you were going to do the best you could under the circumstances . What the Chiefs did not know was how much those soft spots would hurt . Against Denver they might get away with a weakness that Buffalo would use to beat them . Against Buffalo they might conceal a weakness that the Packers would leap on with yelps of pleasure . // By studying three films , the Packers saw they could strike to their left . Most pro football offenses are right-handed , lining up strong to the right , but the easy place to hit the Chiefs was to the Packer left . Kansas City 's defensive right end , Chuck Hurston , is listed as 6 ' 6 " and 240 pounds . Hurston , who has ulcers , was down to 208 pounds for the championship game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kansas City 's right corner back , Willie Mitchell , looked like a lamb to the Packers . Mitchell is no star , but he is not really as bad as the Packers made him appear by throwing post patterns to the weak side for first downs and scores . With Free Safety Johnny Robinson rolling mostly to the strong side to help Corner Back Fred Williamson and with Strong-side Safety Bobby Hunt tied up by Packer Tight End Marv Fleming , Mitchell was left alone with the weak-side receiver . It takes an exceptional cornerback to stay in single coverage throughout the afternoon and not get blistered . Mitchell is not exceptional . Neither is Williamson . // By the fourth quarter the Chiefs ' soft spots were pitilessly exposed . Green Bay moved as it wished , and Kansas City seemed to lose its spirit . Even the fine defensive end and captain , Jerry Mays , who is assuredly no soft spot , was discouraged . As the Packers came up to scrimmage for one of the last plays of the game , Right Guard Jerry Kramer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregg . " You block my man this time , " Kramer said , " and let me have Old Idle over there . " // The Packers were scornful of the Chiefs ' physical condition , calling them " a lot of big , fat guys . " It is startling that after seven years of operation Kansas City went into the Super Bowl game with such glaring flaws . It is a good thing it took seven years for the NFL to consent to the game . If it had been played the first time the AFL wanted it , the farcical result might have caused the game to be abandoned forever . // Green Bay Coach Vince Lombardi said after the game that , in his opinion , the Chiefs are not in a class with the top teams in the NFL . As usual , Lombardi is right . Other than not being as good as the Packers , which was made quite clear , the Chiefs are not as good as Dallas , Baltimore , St. Louis or Cleveland , either , and are no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention a few . Bob Hayes , the Dallas split end , thinks the Atlanta Falcons could beat the Chiefs . That may be too harsh a statement , but the Falcons would have shorter odds against the Chiefs than the Chiefs would in a rematch against the Packers . // Ram Defensive Tackle Merlin Olsen recognized the Kansas City  --  and AFL  --  problem , which is depth . " The Chiefs , " said Olsen , " have about 17 good players . " Olsen was being generous ; 15 might be more accurate . With 15 or 17 players capable of playing in the first division in the NFL , the Chiefs could not be champions but would win some games in steady competition with the older league . So would Buffalo , Oakland and San Diego . The Jets could certainly beat the Giants , perhaps more often than not . Boston has the ability to win an occasional exhibition game from the NFL . The two leagues start playing each other in exhibition games this summer , and the results may be surprising . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AFL , but it must be considered that the AFL clubs are likely to be going for a win , whereas the NFL clubs are likely to be using rookies and preparing for the season . // Back when some people still believed the AFL and NFL might be equal , or close to it , one of the arguments was that the Dallas Cowboys , who began playing at the same time as the AFL , advanced rapidly enough to win the NFL 's Eastern Conference this season and come within a yard of forcing Green Bay into an overtime in the championship . " We 've been around as long as the Cowboys , " said Kansas City Linebacker E. J. Holub , who was a first pick of the Cowboys . " We 're bound to be as good as they are . " Not so . // The big reason for the AFL 's too-slow progress is that most AFL teams started in business in 1960 with amateurs in the front offices . With a few exceptions they had to learn how to organize a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how to handle players . Denver 's quarterback once drew the plays on the ground with his finger in the huddle , and the Broncos have never recovered from that beginning . Another club had one scout to cover the entire country . Most teams far underestimated the operating costs and almost fled in panic when they saw the arithmetic . Lamar Hunt saved the league in those years . // In the early 1960s , the country was full of rumors the AFL would fold , rumors that sent hundreds of players flocking to sign with the NFL . What remained for the AFL were players who got paid so well they did n't mind the risk , or players who wished to avoid the competition in the stronger league . The AFL made a lot of noise about the stars it won , but there was nothing said about the stars being surrounded by journeymen , rejects and erstwhile second-stringers . To a much lesser extent , that is the trouble with the AFL today . Each team has its stars . Some teams have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disastrous under the pressure applied by a good NFL club . // The AFL has had time to remedy those weaknesses , but not even the better teams have done so . To be sure , it is a difficult job , and one that some NFL teams have never accomplished . However , the better AFL teams have deluded themselves . Without quality competition week after week , as the NFL has , the soft spots on the better AFL teams could be dismissed as minor flaws . The AFL leaders thus committed " one of the deadliest of errors . They have believed their own propaganda . The Packers performed what should be a valuable service for the AFL by proving exactly what the gap between the leagues is. // It will be 1970 before AFL and NFL teams start playing each other in regular season games and the AFL needs those three years , for the common draft will slow the AFL 's chance to improve . If red shirts are included in the common draft , as Lombardi wants , the AFL will be slowed further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to catch up . They can do it with expanded scouting systems to find the free agents and low draft choices who will be vital in the common-draft era . It is a safe bet the NFL will be searching , too .
