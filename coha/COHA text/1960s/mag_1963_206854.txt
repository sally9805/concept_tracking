Hans Weidner had been hoping for months to escape drab East Germany and make his way to the West . The odds were against him , for Weidner , 40 , was a cripple on crutches who lived in the village of Neugersdorf , 115 miles southeast of the frontier of freedom . But Hans Weidner did have one major asset , the 30-passenger bus that he operated for the local Communist regime . It was an ugly thing , and ancient . Its chassis creaked , and the engine coughed ; a cream-colored coat of paint could not disguise the welts and bruises of two decades of chugging service . In fact , the bus was ready for the junk pile when Weidner decided to press it into service for one last run . <P> Sharp Blades . The hazards would be great on the journey to the border ; so Weidner signed up a fellow villager , Jrgen Wagner , 22 , to take the wheel . Eight days before Christmas , the pair began the feverish preparations in Weidner 's garage . First Weidner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus , not to plow snow , but to scoop away the heavy obstacles they knew awaited them at roadblocks ahead . <P> To all six lugs on each front wheel they bolted sharp blades of the toughest steel , affixed so that the whirling edges would chop barbed wire to bits . Then they wedged one-quarter-inch sections of steel plate inside the bus to stop bullets . <P> At last all was ready . On Christmas Eve , Weidner and Wagner piled their wives and four children aboard , not forgetting three tons of household belongings . For added protection the plotters shoveled a ton of coal and potatoes into the back of the bus . Then they chugged off north toward Berlin along back roads to escape Communist patrols . Just before they reached the Wall , they planned to swing west in order to enter the East-West Autobahn leading to the U.S. sector of the city . <P> En route , the radiator froze in the subzero weather . That fixed , they were only a few miles farther when a tire blew out . The kids were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , they arrived at Drewitz , the most heavily guarded checkpoint on the entire Autobahn to Berlin . It was no time to stop and reconsider . <P> Flying Potatoes . " Wah-ah , wah-ah , " shrieked the police-type klaxons that Weidner had thoughtfully installed in advance . The Communist guards obediently raised the first of three barriers . But what was a bus doing on emergency duty ? Suddenly the shooting began-too late . Wagner , at 40 m.p.h. , was already crashing through the second barrier 100 yards ahead , then the third , only 20 yards away . <P> Its windshield smashed , its passengers shaken , its cargo of coal and potatoes in every corner of the cab , the old bus finally lurched to a stop a few miles down the road where the Communists no longer mattered-at the U.S. checkpoint , a foot or two inside West Berlin .
