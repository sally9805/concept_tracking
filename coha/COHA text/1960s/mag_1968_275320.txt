Beneath crystal chandeliers inside Hradcany Castle , on a high hill over looking Prague , the party and government leaders of Czechoslovakia gathered to observe the 50th anniversary of their independence from Austro-Hungarian rule . The moment was solemn - and cautious . " I beg you not to demonstrate , " Josef Smrkovsky , President of the National Assembly , had pleaded with the students of Prague 's Charles University . " Would it be surprising if tanks appeared ? If you demonstrate , we might all be sorry . " Most of the university heeded the warning , marking the day quietly with a philosophy-department " teach-in " against the Russian occupation . But other Czechoslovaks refused to cooperate in the campaign to avoid giving offense to the Soviets . <P> As the leaders met at the castle , 3,000 young people , mostly workers and high school students , swarmed up the narrow streets of the Mala Strana quarter to the gates of Hradcany . Waving red-white-and-blue Czechoslovak flags that they had torn from buildings festooned for the anniversary , the youths shouted what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Better dead than shame ! " When they spotted Soviet Ambassador Stepan Chervonenko 's black Chaika limousine behind the barred iron grille of the castle , the crowd cried , " Russians , go home ! " " We have the truth , they have the tanks ! " For a moment , the gates threatened to give way , but a squad of Czech police and militia managed to push the crowd back . The Soviet ambassador left by the back door . <P> It Will Overcome . For the next twelve hours , demonstrations swirled across Prague in a release of pent-up animosity against the occupiers . In the afternoon , 10,000 people marched through the city 's center after a protest rally in the Old Town Square in front of the monument to the 15th century Czech reformer Jan Hus . In the evening , demonstrators waving Czech flags marched to the National Theater , where the audience later gave a thunderous , emotional ovation to the final aria of Smetana 's opera Libuse : <P> My beloved Czech nation will not die <P> It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> When some demonstrators tried to march on the Soviet embassy , Czech police halted them . Had such outbursts continued , the Soviet tanks outside Prague could easily have rolled back into the city . But the police herded the last protesters home about midnight . Communist Party Chief Alexander Dubcek 's government promptly made it clear that it could not tolerate such demonstrations . Police , a spokesman warned , will carry out their " duty of maintaining public order . " <P> Next morning , when the country 's leaders took a train to Bratislava , capital of Slovakia , another crowd of 10,000 broke police lines , scattered the band and the honor guard , and mobbed the railway station , shouting : " Long live Dubcek ! " " Long live Svoboda ! "
