The key word in Paris , wrote the New York Herald Tribune 's smart Eugenia Sheppard . was " sex . " The prim Times sidestepped and called it " femininity . " Last week , as the high-fashion houses of Paris put on display their latest notions of feminine architecture , it was clear that bosoms , knees , waists and hips were back . With that psychic unanimity that seems to animate the Paris fashion world , just about every big designer apparently had decided that the days of loose-fitting , shape-hiding dresses are gone . <P> As always , the pressagents were hard at work on the swarming fashion reporters and editors . With an eye on Elizabeth Taylor 's movie Cleopatra , designer Guy Laroche imposed " the Cleopatra look " on his models-square hairdo , elongated eyes and all . One publicist outdid herself by describing a new line as " a silhouette that looks like a poop deck . " <P> To emphasize the sexy look , Jacques Esterel showed-for low-slung pants-a tasseled gold button that glints , eyelike , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bareback bikini that anybody can make at home with three or four pot holders and a long , thin necktie . For evening wear , Grs grew more conservative : one closely draped jersey dress covered the midriff completely , except for two good-sized diamond-shaped picture windows just south of the rib cage . Jules Crahay of Nina Ricci finally closed the neckline of one dress at the navel . Michel Goma and other designers offered evening-gown backs bare down to the coccyx . Patou loaded down daytime costumes with shoulder bows , capelets , streaming stoles and back skirt panels . Dior 's Marc Bohan , however , departed only slightly from the closed-Dior shape of the past . Although he lowered belts until they fetched up on the hips , Bohan stubbornly stuck to a squared-off silhouette ( " Dior has squared the fanny , " said Sheppard ) . <P> Most designers snugged in waistlines and billowed skirts , perhaps to allow freedom to Twist . Everybody had his say about hemlines : Laroche and Cardin lowered theirs ; Desss , Patou , Crahay . Goma and Bohan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : almost every designer stuck ruffles on his models , snapped wide belts around everything-even evening dresses ( Balmain , who dresses Thailand 's Queen Sirikit , belted a wedding gown ) . Apart from sex , the only other area of general agreement in Paris was color . Apricot was very big , followed by orange , yellow and the so-called sherbet colors.
