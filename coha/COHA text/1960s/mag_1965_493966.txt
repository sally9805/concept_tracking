The Eternal . Manager by Richard L. Strout What are we serious thinkers to make of Herbert Bayard Swope ? We are duty bound to discover his Social Significance . But what did he do ? He ran The New York World till it was sold out from under him . He was as irrepressible and inexhaustible and ego-centric as George Bernard Shaw . He bet on horses . He either did , or did n't invent Bernard Baruch ( evidence is that BB got off the ground by himself , as chairman of the War Industries Board in 1918 , but that Swope took him over from then on ) . He ran 3 fashionable , witty , high-spirited salon in which he joyously cast himself in the principal role . He probably coined the phrase " cold war . " He said , too , " I can not give you the formula for success , but I can give you the formula for failure : Try to please everybody . " He did these things . But thinking it over I suppose the greatest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ace foreign correspondent , raconteur , confidant of statesmen , adviser to the rich ; all he wanted was lots of money and to have his finger in everything and to know everybody . He would dash a telegram off to a President at the drop of a hat , and get back prompt answers , too . Admittedly , there is something irri-tating about Swope . After all , he turned out to be glorified public relations man . Swope and Baruch needed each other ; they were symbiotic ; Baruch the eternal stuffed shirt , Swope the eternal manager . Unfair ? Well , yes , little , but Swope began as a really fine journalist and ended as a rather fancy manipulator , fixer and wire-puller for the very rich , with an air of self-importance that was always a little absurd . On the other hand , men like Roosevelt and Churchill and heaven knows who all beside , took him seriously ( or seemed to ) ; and he did commit himself with his customary bounce and gusto to many good causes . Kahn does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorker-style , 5oo-page biography that ripples anecdotally along , and allows you to stop only intermittently to ask , " Why am I and Kahn wasting our time on a man who , really , when all is said and done , is not very important ? " The answer ( if there is one ) is in a footnote in which the author drops phrase about Swope 's part in the " manipulative society . " There 's your social significance . Swope was right at the heart of such a society and helped manipulate it . Let 's offer one episode and let it go at that . Swope was on a consulting-advisory basis with many big corporations , Alcoa , Standard of N.J. , Schenley distillers , RCA and the like . While working for Twentieth Century-Fox the latter produced Gentleman 's Agreement whose theme was anti-Semitism . The picture was being released in December and to win a nomination for an Academy Award it had to make its mark before the end of the year . " But Hedda Hopper , " Kahn reports , " whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of people who make nominations for Oscars , was hesitant about giving it a plug . The reason was , Zanuck wrote Swope , that she 'd heard that Baruch , an old friend of hers , had some reservations about Mrs. Hobson 's Laura Z. Hobson 's ) book . " Thus Swope 's job was to take Baruch to the movie quick and get his blessing in order to appease Hedda Hopper . In a sense Baruch was Swope 's client , too . Swope arranged a special showing of the film in New York and escorted Baruch to it . But Baruch had no particular reaction . Why ? because , as it turned out , Baruch , who was quite deaf , could n't hear the sound . A script was rushed to him . Swope in desperation meanwhile wrote the columnist a " Dear Hedda " letter , saying that " BB " had seen the film and was so deeply impressed " that he sent for the script , which Moss Hart supplied personally . " The film got the nomination its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twentieth-Century Fox had repaired the breach with a tribute saying , " Gentleman 's Agreement is an important contribution to the literature of today . It is among the great pictures I have seen . ? Herbert Bayard Swope . " Well , it was good picture . And if you want a chatty account of a flamboyant figure in the manipulative society this is it .
