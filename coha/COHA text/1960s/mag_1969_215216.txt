Whatever happens at the Met , there is no reason to go without opera this Christmas . The record companies have been as productive as ever and some of their releases are of extraordinary quality . <P> Cavalli : L'Ormindo ( Argo ) . Something practically unheard-of : an authentic , workable masterpiece miraculously retrieved from the past . One of the 17th century Venetian composers influenced by Monteverdi , Francesco Cavalli wrote melodiously , with great penetration into the personal relationships of his characters . The present recording stems from an edition pieced together by Raymond Leppard from musical fragments for a Glyndebourne production in 1967 . The result is musically and dramatically spellbinding . <P> Mozart : Idomeneo ( Philips ) . Like most opera seria , this one depends on gods , a sea monster , women pretending to be men and an unusual ability on the part of the audience to take the whole thing seriously . But the music is Mozart at his best , requiring only a great conductor and a great cast to do it justice . It gets just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady glow . Highpoints : George Shirley 's rocketlike traversal of Fuor del mar-a crippling catalogue of coloratura devices - and Elettra 's two arias sung by Pauline Tinsley , a British dramatic soprano whose voice has an electric radiance that recalls Ina Souez and Ljuba Welitsch at their best . <P> Richard Strauss : Der Rosenkavalier ( London ) . Conducted by Georg Solti , this Rosenkavalier neatly obliterates its recorded competition . Three lush-voiced ladies ( Rgine Crespin , Helen Donath and Yvonne Minton ) keep the story poised convincingly between spring and autumn and the music teetering tenderly on the verge of tears . The big cast is stuffed with the names of well-loved Viennese singers , as well as the Met 's sensational new tenor , Luciano Pavarotti . <P> Donizetti : Roberto Devereux ( Westminster ) . Just as memorably melodic as Lucia but far more powerful . Beverly Sills ' Queen Elizabeth has all the expected coloratura dazzle but with chest tones and a dramatic style that should raise her already formidable reputation several notches higher . <P> Henze : Three Cantatas ( Deutsche Grammophon ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes mistily modern and weirdly beautiful music . In this score , German Soprano Edda Moser floats through the vocal stratosphere with astonishing ease , and demonstrates a bewildering range of sound and color .
