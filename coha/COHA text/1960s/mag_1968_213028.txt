SOUTH KOREA <P> Outside the official armistice meeting hall in Panmunjom , a bullet-riddled truck and some bloodstained clothing were put on display last week in mute testimony to North Korea 's latest truce violations . A band of ten North Korean soldiers had ambushed the truck 1 mile south of the Demilitarized Zone , killing two American and two South Korean soldiers . Before the week was out , the North Koreans had made two more attacks on allied forces at the DMZ , killing two more South Koreans . <P> <P> The incidents were part of a growing pattern of provocation and violence by the North - and as such , a major reason for President Chung Hee Park 's trip to Honolulu last week to meet with President Johnson . In private conversations attended only by the two Presidents and their interpreters , Johnson briefed Park on U.S. plans for peace talks on Viet Nam , apparently convinced him that the U.S. intends neither to make reckless concessions to the Communists nor to leave South Korea . Their joint communique noted President Park 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the past few months , North Korea has speeded up the recruitment and training of its 1,200,000-man " People 's Militia , " massed most of its 340,000-man army in the southern part of the country , and organized a special 20,000-man commando force for sabotage and guerrilla warfare missions over the border . It has launched 321 raids in the past year , a 600% increase over the year before . One such mission was designed to assassinate Park , but it failed ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) ; not long after , the U.S.S. Pueblo was hijacked . The South does not expect a full-scale invasion , but it believes that the current raids are part of a gathering spring offensive that is aimed at undermining South Korean confidence and morale . <P> To help Park meet the threat , Special U.S. Envoy Cyrus Vance visited Seoul last February and promised to give Park $100 million in additional U.S. military aid this year on top of the normal $160 million . Drawing on this new account , Park is organizing a 2,500,000-man reserve that , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground-surveillance radar stations and perform other such duties . He is also trying to modernize the country 's 600,000-man armed forces , replacing World War II rifles with the new M16 , buying U.S. helicopters for better troop mobility and adding new tanks .
