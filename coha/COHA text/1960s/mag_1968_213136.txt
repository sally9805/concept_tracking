Any work by Philip Roth commands attention . Lately , the author of Goodbye , Columbus , Letting Go and When She Was Good , one of the best of America 's younger novelists , has chosen to exhibit his new fiction piecemeal in various magazines . His theme-the psychological problems of a modern Jewish-American-is not exactly new . But to judge from what has appeared so far , Roth 's latest work looks like the most brilliant piece of radical humor in years . <P> It takes the form of a series of monologues ranted by a patient at his psychoanalyst . The patient is a 34-year-old bachelor named Alexander Portnoy , high-school honor student from Newark , first in his law-school class , and now assistant human-rights commissioner in New York City . At first glance , the chronicle of Portnoy 's pain , rooted as it is in Jewishness and the urban environment , may appear to have only specialized appeal , but Roth gives it a universality that reaches beyond ethnic boundaries . It is a coda of rage and savagely honest self-lashing reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail is varnished , no lust or act nice-Nellied as Portnoy complains , clowns and laments in his desperate efforts to claw his way to sanity . The result is a spontaneous emotional release of enormous authenticity and power . <P> The first monologue appeared in the April 1967 issue of Esquire under the title A Jewish Patient Begins His Analysis . It is a short , tame outline of Portnoy 's problems . Things loosened up in a hurry with the 6,000-word installment published last August in Partisan Review ; called Whacking Off , it is a frantic confession of boyhood sin . Portnoy recalls how , as an adolescent , he always had to please his parents publicly , while he privately and obsessively masturbated to please himself ; this experience sentenced him to a chronic condition of shame , which he begs his analyst to cure . The Jewish Blues , which reveals the Portnoy family guilts and secrets even further , appeared the following month in the first issue of New American Review . The fourth and by far largest section ( 28,000 words ) appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperback ; $1.25 ) . Titled Civilization and Its Discontents , after Freud 's famous essay on the conflict between the individual 's instinctual urges and society 's demands for restraint , the latest monologue is the freest , funniest , most touching-and terrifying-of the lot .
