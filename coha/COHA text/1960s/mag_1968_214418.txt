Just before the start of the 1960s , Edward N. Cole , then a General Motors vice president , exuberantly forecast that before the decade was over Detroit would sell 10 million cars in a year . Cole has since been promoted to the presidency of the world 's biggest manufacturer , partly because of his record of seeing the future clearly , but his fellow automakers have yet to prove him right in his most optimistic prediction . This year , however , they will come tantalizingly close . <P> When the ' 69 models were introduced in October , the industry had its best one-month record in history , selling 886,000 . In November another 786,000 new cars were sold . That was predictably fewer than in the previous month of model introductions , the usual early impulse buying and fleet orders ; still the total was 27% higher than in November 1967 . This month the automakers are scheduling about 8% more production than in last December . Ford Vice President Matt McLaughlin sums up the expansive mood : " It looks like the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9,600,000 this year , but whether we can reach 9,700,000 . " <P> If so , sales will surpass the all-time peak of 9,300,000 set in 1965 . Purists may note that this year 's total will include about a million imports , way up from 600,000 in 1965 , but that scarcely diminishes the cheer at the Detroit Athletic Club . All the automakers are marketing more than last year , when a strike at Ford stalled production , and sales amounted to 8,300,000 . Ford has won a 27% share of this year 's bigger market , a gain of 2.8 percentage points , mostly at the expense of General Motors , whose share is 51.8% , down three points . Chrysler has advanced much in sales and a bit in market share , with 18% , while American Motors continues to hold 3% . <P> What They Bought . The ' 69 model buyers tend to go to extremes in their choices . Luxury cars and economy compacts are both selling well , proving Detroit 's contention that there are two ways for the market to grow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an electric rear-window defroster and the longest hood in the industry and retails for $3,777 without extras . Pontiac sold 24,874 of them in October and November , more than during all of the 1968 model year . <P> Buyers are also ordering many more accessories , including air conditioners , push-button windows and supersize engines . In 1966 only 12% of the buyers wanted vinyl roofs ; now 33% do-at an extra cost of $80 to $100 . Power steering is ordered with 80% of the cars , up from 66% two years ago , and 90% have automatic transmissions . <P> While such options may enhance appearance , convenience or safety , they also figure in the high cost of repairs .
