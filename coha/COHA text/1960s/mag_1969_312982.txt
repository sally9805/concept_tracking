The pitch was disarmingly simple . If the superrich could set up tax-free trusts and foundations , why could n't the moderately wealthy also build cozy little shel ters from income and inheritance taxes ? <P> The answer , according to an Illinois-based outfit called Americans Building Constitutionally ( ABC ) , was a decided yes . ABC 's expert tutors showed businessmen , small industrialists and well-to-do professionals how to set up family foundations , hire themselves and their relatives as directors , and then all but thumb their noses at federal and state tax collectors . The trick was to minimize income taxes by paying themselves small salaries and by writing off such things as cars , general-expense accounts and life-insurance policies . <P> In two busy years of operation , ABC helped to organize hundreds of small foundations , raking in at least $1,000,000 in fees . Texas ' Democratic Congressman Wright Patman deplored ABC 's tactics . " If this sort of thing is carried to its logical conclusion , " Patman complained during congressional hearings ( TIME , Jan. 5 , 1968 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Absolute Secrecy . Nowhere was ABC more energetic than in California , where it mixed its usual shrewd salesmanship with strong appeals to patriotism . Describing a typical approach , Dr. Jack Hagadorn , a Costa Mesa physician , said that ABC representatives displayed a right-wing tract denouncing the use of tax money to aid Communist countries . By depriving the Government of such money , they argued , an individual could decide how it should be spent . <P> ABC 's sales pitch was also its undoing . <P> On closer inspection , the California attorney general 's office decided that the organization 's spiel was sufficiently false to warrant prosecution as a felony under the state 's anti-fraud statutes . <P> The basic flaws in ABC 's tax-saving system , the state 's fiduciary experts explained , were that : 1 ) the founder of the trust never really relinquished his control or interest in it ; and 2 ) he never redly intended it to be set up exclusively for charitable purposes . Though ABC knew that this was contrary to federal statutes governing tax-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the fact by enjoining its clients to absolute secrecy . " The cleverness of the scheme , " said California Deputy Attorney General H. Warren Siegel , " was to get you to join by saying ' Only we have this plan , ' and then saying ' Do n't tell anyone what we told you or we 'll boot you out . ' And then no one would know until after the founder died that they could n't really avoid inheritance taxes . " <P> Real Losen . Five ABC officials , including founders James Walsh , 52 , and Robert D. Hayes , 68 , were convicted by an Orange County jury after a five-week trial on charges ranging from conspiracy to grand theft ; three others pleaded guilty . None received jail sentences , but they were placed on probation for up to three years and given fines as high as $7,000 . Hayes and Walsh , among others , said that they would appeal on the ground that no criminal intent was involved , but their careers as tax consultants have already been ruined .
