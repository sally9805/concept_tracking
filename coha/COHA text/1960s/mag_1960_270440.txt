As Foster Furcolo , Massachusetts ' two-term Democratic Governor , was edging his way through the crowded lobby of Boston 's Sheraton-Plaza Hotel with campaigning Lyndon Johnson fortnight ago , a Boston postman hailed him in friendly fashion . Cried he , loud and clear : " Hiya , Governor ! Ya dope ! " That evening when Furcolo appeared on a rally platform with Johnson , Furcolo got a hearty round of boos . Clearly , something was amiss in Democratic Boston . Indeed , for hapless Foster Furcolo , something was amiss all over his state , and last week it was amiss by a mile : Furcolo , 49 , running in the primaries for the Democratic senatorial nomination , got trounced , bounced , stomped and whomped by 35-year-old , crew-cut Springfield Mayor Thomas J. O'Connor Jr . In Boston alone , Furcolo lost by a staggering 10,000 votes . <P> The Governor 's defeat came from a combination of Tom O'Connor 's razzledazzle campaign and Furcolo 's own shabby record . Despite his party 's longtime pledge against a state sales tax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feuded endlessly with the Democratic legislative majority , got into whiffing distance of a scandal involving an appointee to Massachusetts ' Metropolitan District Commission . Jack Kennedy had refused to endorse him in Furcolo 's unsuccessful 1954 senatorial race against Republican Leverett Saltonstall , and this time studiously avoided endorsing either Democrat in the primary . <P> Fleet-footed Tom O'Connor left nothing to chance . One of seven children of a milkman , O'Connor grew up in Springfield 's " Hungry Hill " section , has battled his way through politics ever since he ran for ( and won ) the presidency of his junior high school student government . After Georgetown law school ( 1951 ) , he served in the legislature for three terms , then beat a twelve-year incumbent in the Springfield mayoralty elections , carrying every precinct in the city for the first time in history . As mayor , he put through a dynamic modernization and urban renewal program , reduced the tax rate . Billing himself as " Springfield 's Great Young Mayor , " O'Connor showed himself over and over again on TV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " argued that only a vigorous , forward-looking candidate such as himself could beat Saltonstall . Last week Lev Saltonstall , 68 , incumbent of 16 years , was beginning to run scared . <P> Other footprints on last week 's primary trail : <P> <P> In Washington , back-slapping Democratic Governor Albert Rosellini won renomination for a second term against lackluster opposition , though he ran far behind other state officials , all from his own party . Winner of the G.O.P. nomination was the man who might be able to turn Al ( " The Rose " ) Rosellini out of office : Spokane Orchard Owner Lloyd J. Andrews , 40 , the state superintendent of public instruction .
