 | Moans were still drifting up from the bottom of the precipice when the black prince ordered Jesus brought to his tent . " I have killed two hundred men today , my little pet , " the prince began softly . He sank to his knees and kissed Jesus ' fettered hands . " Why do I do these things ? Tell me ! I love my people . Why do I kill them ? I ripped into one old man with my own sword . Here it is . " He drew the blade , rusting with blood , from its gold scabbard . " You see ? I am not afraid to kill . I am not afraid of your God . He is nothing to me . When I see him at last , I will smite his eyes and cut out his lying tongue . " Oh , little pet ! Make me stop ! He is my God , too , and I adore him . I ordered them , men and children , thrown over the cliff  --  ten , fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orders . " He laughed and showed his strong white teeth . " But all those men did not die . Some of them are alive down there . Do you hear them ? My aides say they will last until morning . I want to hear their screams as I go to sleep . Their cries will lull me . " Jesus said , " I must go back to the others . " " You will go back when I permit it , missionary . " The prince reached out to embrace Jesus by the waist . " Oh , my pet , if only I could have you forever with me , perhaps I would not commit these crimes . But too often I must be gone , and you must stay here . " " In your prison . " " In my prison , because otherwise you would leave me and I would die without you . We are one man , you and I. How often have I felt as you spoke that I was watching and listening to myself . But you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the same . " " I have never understood killing , " Jesus answered . " It must  | be a failing in me , for other men think highly of it . " " It is beautiful . I took my sword , this sword , and put the tip against his chest and hardly pushed at all . One minute he was a venerable old man , old enough to be my grandfather . The next instant he was a crumpled bag of garbage . I did that . I took his life from him , and I felt his life join with mine and make me stronger . Why do n't you congratulate me ? Do n't you want to see me strong ? " " That is not strength . There is only one strength and it does not come from killing . " The prince sprawled indolently across his silken couch . " Tell me about strength . " " We have spoken of it many times . You need no instruction from me . " " I have learned from you everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have not studied the literature of our world . You have been in Magdala barely three hundred nights . Your God should have given you three times as many stories to tell . But I have loved you while you were here . You are a finer man than I could ever be . I will be glad to be rid of you . " The prince called to his guard and gestured toward Jesus . " I will weep for you , " he said , as the soldier seized Jesus and moved him toward the cliff . " No , I will weep for myself and for what you have forced me to do to you . " The soldier thrust Jesus over the edge , and the prince drew close to listen for any new note among the groaning and cries from below . When he could hear none , he ordered the guard to go down and investigate . " Would he be lying there alive but refusing to moan ? " the prince asked aloud as he awaited a report . " Would he try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering ? " " He is dead , Your Highness . " The guard 's face was flaked with dirt from his climb on the cliff .  | " I knew he would not toy with me . I will miss him more than I can say . Guard ? " " Yes , Your Highness ? " " Remind me that if he comes again , we must torture him before we kill him . " " I will remember , Your Highness . " " Or should I let him torture me ? What do you think , guard ? Which would you like better ? " " I have no opinion , Your Highness . " The prince threw himself again on his couch and buried his face in his pale palms . " You 're right . It does n't matter . Either way it is the same . I want him back ! Are you listening to me , guard ? I want him back ! " " He is dead , Your Highness . " " No ! I am dead , and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am dead . I was killed when you pushed him off that cliff . You are too stupid to understand . He would understand . " The guard watched with pleasure as tears ran down the prince 's smooth cheeks . " He is dead , Your Highness , " he repeated distinctly . " He is dead . " Nathanael was seventeen years old , a fact Jesus tried to bear in mind . " Jesus ! Jesus ! " he cried as he burst into the study . " Yes ? " " If you came to die for men 's sins ? " " The word you want is since . ' " " Since you came to die for men 's sins ? " " Yes ? " " Should n't you have said , Forgive me , Father , for what they are about to do ' ? " " Is that all , Nathanael ? "  | " I thought of it while I was walking to the bus stop . I ran all the way back . " " Close the door firmly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . " " Carefully ! " he warned them in a weak voice . " Do n't drop me . " A stone turned under James 's foot . " Quiet ! " Christ whispered . " Ca n't you be quiet ? We 'll have the whole regiment back here . " They laid him gently by the mouth of the cave . James said , " I do n't feel much like wrestling with that stone again . " " It would be awfully nice ? " this came from Thomas ? " if someone we knew would consider it a good time for a miracle and let some angel swing the rock back . " Christ grunted . " Get to work . It 's not heavy . But quietly . " " Far be it from me to complain , " Thomas drawled , " but I 've been around a long time , and I 've never seen one of those miracles we all hear so much about . Did any of you actually talk to Lazarus after his amazing recovery ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed nothing , Thomas . You would n't have found him lively at any time . " Thomas was distinguished for his round belly , quivering big nose and nearsighted squint . He was a man counted in because he would have been so wretched if he had been left out . When they were alone , Peter said to Jesus , " You have the whole of tomorrow ahead of you . Have you decided how to spend it ? " " I would like to be alone . Afterward there may not be much chance . " " Of the things you might have asked , that will be the hardest . They are all clamoring to see you . "  | " I 'll go to the desert . You can tell them I am recovering my strength . " " If you could appear for a moment , later in the day , and speak a word or two ? " " I 'd spend all morning fretting over what to say and all evening wishing I 'd spoken differently . Permit me one day , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no pleasure winning an argument with you , my friend . I always lose in the turned-down corners of your mouth . Let me be self-indulgent tomorrow . My guilt will make me all the more diligent the day after . " " Of course . " " When we recast the world , everyone will be given your smile . " " Will you stay with us tonight ? " " No , I 'll leave while it 's still dark . I am a thief and must travel like one . " " What have you stolen ? " " A body . My body . I 'm a grave robber . Though not so grave as you would like . " " I have no complaint . " " For that I am as grateful today as I have been for three fine years . On this one day I can be sentimental , can I not ? That should be a prerogative of the dead . " " Do you have pain ? " " I ache . I felt faint , but the air has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself slowly from the cave so that the others would not see him leave . When he was out of sight of the camp , he was tempted to rest , but he kept lifting one heavy leg and then the other . He stumbled two miles across the sand before he fainted . When he recovered , dawn had begun to lighten the darkness . He lay on one heavy yellow blanket , and another blanket  | covered him . Someone  --  a man  --  sat beside him , shivering in the cold air . This man leaned forward and pushed his fat pink face in front of Christ 's . " Ah , you are finally awake , then ? I thought you were a late-bloomer , one of those men who sleep past midday . " Christ turned away his head to yawn . " I 'm sorry . I had a strenuous day yesterday . " " You ask for sympathy . " The man spoke reflectively . " I have given you my blankets and my protection , and now you seek my pity as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved him down . " Trying is a dreadful habit . So often it leads to success . " Christ said , " I believe there 's an adage to that effect . " " You are a wit , " the fat man said amiably . " Flow fortunate for me to happen upon so rare a phenomenon . You are not , however , a dandy . " Christ plucked at his frayed robe and regretted the gesture . " I 've never been much concerned with my clothes . " " A mistake , if you will permit me to say so . Clothing is our chief disguise , and it should be a good one . " Christ propped himself on an elbow to look around . His companion wore a pink tunic trimmed with silks of rose and burgundy . Gold bracelets shone at his wrists and ankles , and the curls on his head were tied with purple bows . " I 'm afraid my work , " Christ said , " would not permit me such ? " " Magnificence ? I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work demands it . " " And that work ? " " I am a leader of men , " he answered with a smirk . " It is not an enviable role , " Christ said . " It suits me . What do you do ? " " I am a carpenter . "  | " How useful ! What do you make ? " " I recently laid a foundation which I trust will prove serviceable . " " Do you know what I need ? I need a throne . I have one at home with armrests , but I 've been putting on so much weight lately that I must practically grease myself to sit down . " " Perhaps we should make chairs as we make tables  --  with an expandable leaf at the center . " " You are a clever carpenter . " His tone warned Christ to hold to his station . " No , only a poor fool lost in the desert . " " Why , then you can come with me . " A crescent smile lit his moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , Christ thought , I am very slow . My mind has never been quick , and I am tired this morning . But now I understand . I recognize you now . " Where do you come from ? " Christ asked . " Over there . " He gestured vaguely . " It 's really very charming . " " I 'm sure it must be . " To himself Christ added , What did you expect ? Did you think he would have cloven feet , or that he would insult and revile you , or that he would spring from a crevice in the earth ? " Would you like to go now ? " Christ found himself more fearful than he had expected . " I 'm a little tired . If we could rest for another minute ? " " Whatever you like . I could wipe your brow . " " No , please . Thank you . " They sat together quietly , the fat man beaming at Christ , his smile saying , We shall play for a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caring for you . " The sun seems unusually strong for so early an hour , " the fat man said , mopping his own brow with a white lace handkerchief . " The weather of late has been very strange , " Christ agreed .  | " Perhaps it 's the tomb . " " Tomb ? " Christ asked . " Oh , " the other said slyly , " I understand that a tomb was opened yesterday . Imagine all that dank air rushing out ! It probably upset the atmospheric balance . " " I know little about such things . " " No , " the fat man leered at him . " I forgot . You 're a carpenter . " " Yes . " " Of course . " Christ broached a new topic . " Who leads the men when you are in the desert ? " " Ah , we have a detailed chain of command and a wealth of talent to draw upon . " " Still , you are probably anxious to get back . If so , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not exactly the bargain , is it ? " Christ decided not to pretend that he did n't understand . " No . " " We 'll wait here until you feel better . There 's no hurry . " " No hurry . " The heat was beginning to weigh on Christ . He felt as though a hand were pressing his head toward the earth . I 'm not good at this , he thought . I can be strong and forthright and sometimes playful with the men . But I 'm not trained for this tiresome cut and thrust . I had assumed he would be serious . " I suppose , " the fat man said , " you 've worked out some kind of rationale for your existence . " Christ had no words . The other bowed elaborately . " As a carpenter . " " Have you ? " " One does the best one can . One does not choose one 's role . " They both fell silent . As minutes passed , Christ shook his head and wondered if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face glistening with sweat , the fat man was dusting  | flies from the rims of his ears . While they sat without speaking , a cloud of sand blew up on the edge of the desert . " Someone seems to be coming from my camp , " the fat man said . " Your camp ? " " Oh , yes . Over there . We keep pretty much to ourselves . You understand . " Christ nodded . A man carne running toward them , apparently with some message . He staggered forward , almost falling from exhaustion . " Christ ! " he cried . " Christ ! " Christ rose and started toward him before he saw that the messenger had been addressing the other man . The fat man saw Christ 's response to the cry , and his belly shook with laughter . " Oh , no ! " he exclaimed . " Not you , too ? Not you ! On the other side of the desert ? " " Yes , " said Christ , confused . " And all this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears of laughter from his eyes , " I thought you were the Devil . " Simon , who was softhearted , became indignant each time he recalled that Jesus had been made to bear his own cross to Calvary . To soothe him , Jesus said , " I was spared the fate of most men . I had been a carpenter , after all , and though they forced me to carry my cross , they did not call on me to build it . " During one triumphal entry into Jerusalem , a fair-skinned man thrust himself in front of the animal that bore Jesus . " Lord ! " he called . " Do you remember me ? "  | " Certainly , " Jesus responded warmly . Three years spent campaigning among the people had taught him to be politic . " I was afraid you might not . " The man , about fifty-five years old , bobbed his head gratefully . " You had only been on earth one day when I visited you . " That clue was enough for Jesus . Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balthasar was far darker than this pale man . " I am happy to see you again , Gaspar . " Jesus dismounted to walk a few paces with the descendant of Ham . " So often I had wondered what became of you , " Gaspar said . " You have no idea how pleased I am that your promise at last is being fulfilled . " " Your good wishes are important to me , " Jesus replied . " My mother still recalls your visit and the generosity of your gifts . " Gaspar hardly seemed to hear . He had sunk for a moment in a thought of his own . " You 're Earth , are n't you ? " he asked abruptly . " I 'm sure that 's right  --  Earth ? " " I was born of woman to traverse the earth and bring God 's word to man , " Jesus allowed , puzzled at the excitement in Gaspar 's voice . " No , I mean your birthday . You were born in the trigon of Earth ? " Jesus wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what you mean , " he said coldly . " Astrology ! The true guide to foretelling the future . Surely you are a believer ? " " I believe in the One God . " " But you must believe ! It was the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces that produced the star that led us to Judea . You were heralded to the world through astrology . " " I was heralded through centuries of messianic prophecy . " Again Gaspar had withdrawn to his own thoughts . Lengthening his stride to keep up with Jesus , he started to rummage  | through his robe . " Let me give you proof , " he said . " I will cast your horoscope from the stars . " " I foresee my future , " Jesus said . " It is nothing I wish to anticipate . " Gaspar had already begun to consult the symbols painted on a parchment scroll . " You are right , " he said awesomely . " The coming week holds many perils . It favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventures should be postponed . Friends may prove difficult . Above all , keep your nat. - ; l ural good humor . " Convinced that Gaspar 's idolatry was harmless , Jesus began to tease him . " What can you tell me about next Friday ? " " Friday ? " Gaspar studied the brightly colored charts and i. circles . " Friday is all right . In fact , Friday could turn out to be unusually propitious . If there 's a day that should concern you , it 's Sunday  --  one week from today . That 's a day with a number of bad portents . " Jesus thought , His predictions are accurate enough . Friday I escape the world and Sunday I am compelled to return . ' These forecasts are designed for men , and men long ago set a low value on life . Worried by Jesus ' long silence , Gaspar asked , " What do you think of astrology now ? It 's not blasphemous , is it ? " " It 's too accurate to be blasphemous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he persisted . But Jesus had boarded his mount again , and Gaspar was caught in the midst of fifty children waving palm leaves . As Jesus set out again on the journey , he opened his billfold , withdrew a manila envelope and read his sealed instruc-tions : Nothing above cabinet rank unless the population is less than three million .  | Avoid Roman Catholic , Lutheran and Methodist denominations . Be scrupulous in registering for the draft and paying overtime parking tickets . College teaching only as a last resort . Andrew approached Jesus abjectly for he clung to the idea that a savior had more important things to do than talk with him . And Jesus found the husky fisherman already so gentle that he hesitated to tamper with his spirit . " Can I talk to you for a minute ? " Andrew asked . " Certainly , my friend . I wish we spoke together more often . You 're too industrious . " " Just now I had a scissors , and I was cutting the hair from my nostrils . " Andrew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vanity , I know , Lord , but otherwise the hairs grow very long , and I would look ugly to your followers . " " I do n't think you could look ugly to anyone . But if you choose to cut away some excess hair , there 's no cause for apology . " " No , that 's to explain what happened . I was standing before the mirror , my head thrown back , about to begin , when I looked deep into my nostrils , and I was afraid . " If Jesus had been about to smile , the sight of the man 's white face and twisting hands would have stopped him . " Why ? " " I saw the dark openings , like tunnels into my head , and as I stared into their darkness , I was afraid I would see ? " " God ? " Andrew nodded and wrung one big hand with the other . " You thought that the idea was blasphemous ? That such a foolish fantasy was an offense against him ? " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternity . That 's a logical place to expect to find God . "  | " Lord , I was looking into my own nose ! " His voice rose in dismay . " My nose ! " " Yes , the thought is ludicrous . I agree with you . But logical , Andrew . " Jesus cupped his palm and placed it lightly over Andrew 's nose . " We do n't pick our shrines . I would n't have chosen this spot , but I would n't have picked a lot of the damp grottoes either . " Contentedly Andrew asked , " Are you laughing at me , Lord ? " Wealth made no difference in either his task or his character . The first time he had awakened in a gilded crib , Jesus wondered if he would be changed . But the story was the same except for a slight variation that he first denied , then acknowledged and at last found he could accept without bitterness : All of them  --  his disciples , the multitudes , even his tormenters ? liked him better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plain , and those were the times he preferred . He spoke then and they listened harder because there was less to watch . The men 's companionship was less flirtatious when he was plain . No matter how he looked , women gave him trouble . The leader is always desired ; he knew and forgave that . Good looks , when they were given , were restrained . His nose would be more sharply etched , his mouth fuller , his eyes more deeply set . He never had to overcome a hairy , gleaming kind of beauty , and he was seldom disfigured . He taunted himself : Men want God 's message delivered in a plain wrapper , and I am the one and perfect Messiah .  | Downhearted , Matthew returned to Jesus . " A friend of mine says all of us are too normal to make an interesting book . He objects to your cures of Lazarus , the lepers and the lame . He says I have to include in my story one unstraightened hunchback , one full-grown idiot or one little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress pinned to her shoulder . He says those people speak most truthfully for the human condition . " " In our way , we are crippled , " Jesus consoled him . " Did you explain that ? " " He says that 's different . He says there 's nothing in our suffering to create sympathy in the reader . " " Not sympathy , perhaps . But we have been able to inspire self-pity , and that 's a stronger emotion . " " Could n't you arrange to encounter one blind and deaf mute and pass him by without restoring his senses ? " " Introduce me to your friend , " said Jesus , and Matthew laughed in spite of himself . " Have someone take care of this , will you ? " Christ slipped off a torn blue jacket and let it drop to the floor . Satan picked up the blazer and examined the two long rips in its left shoulder . He threw it to a tailor . " What happened ? " " Everything was going fine , " Christ said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would end early , but I figured I could make it to grad school anyway . We got the whole bunch admitted and settled in Wigg , which took some doing because , you know , some of those boys are n't mental wizards . " " I know . " Tor once I thought it was going to be a good wait  --  every- body says it 's usually so boring . You know , hacking around some machine shop or foundry for fifteen years . " " This is November . You could n't have been there more than two months . " " It was Judas , " Christ sighed . " He got eager and pushed me down two flights of stairs . That 's how I tore my coat . Of course , the poor clod did n't realize he was wrecking the whole thing . The stairs were slippery , and I 'm being listed as an accident . Some of the deans know better , but Judas ca n't expect them to speak up on my account . They 've got the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " I spend the day here and go home . Someone else starts on Monday . " Christ peered at Satan in the dim light . " You 're young , too . " " I have n't been on the job long . It 's something of a coincidence , your coming now . I used to do quite a bit of work at Phillips Brooks House . " " Is that right ? " Christ looked dubious . " What kind of thing ? " " Games in the South End mostly  --  basketball , track . " " Gambling , " Christ continued , " dice , heroin , petty theft ? " Satan said pleasantly , " You are even younger than you look . Do you want to come inside while you 're waiting for your jacket ?

" They ask me all kinds of questions with  | hooks in them . " He squinted to see Satan 's necktie and asked , " Where did you get that ? " " It 's from a club I belonged to , " Satan said indifferently . " I keep it for sentimental reasons . " " Of course I disapprove of all clubs on principle . But I 'd thought maybe , you know , until I really got started , I could join one for a year or two . Next year . I 'd probably have picked that one . " He waved toward the tie . " Unless you 'd have had me blackballed . " " Why in the world would I do that ? " " Meanness . " Christ was matter-of-fact . " To be disagreeable . " " I 'm afraid you 've got the situation backwards . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expelled . I seem to inspire bitterness , but I 've never felt any . " " Why were you asked to leave ? " " I 'll tell you . But I 'd like you to promise not to repeat the story . " " That 's dumb . " " I know , " Satan said . " With the small difference in our ages , I feel ridiculous trying to protect you . All the same , it would be awkward for both of us if you repeated the story after you left here . " " All right . " " First  --  and I do n't say this to belittle you or to hurt your feelings  --  I was put on earth for the same reasons you were . " Christ ran a hand through his long blond hair . " You mean you had the same job ? " " Almost identical . We had n't picked out all of the disciples yet  --  you were ahead of me there . But the pattern was no different . " " I do n't understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album  --  at least the last ten years  --  and I did n't see your picture . " Satan laughed without malice . " No , I 'm sure you didn't.  | We 're all the same : We only keep records of our successes . I 'm not going to enter your name in our files down here either . " Something in his words caused Christ to shudder , although Satan 's tone could not have been friendlier . " Why are you here then ? " he asked reluctantly . " It 's a mistake in strategy to give us both the time and capacity for reflection . " Satan had turned toward a lamp where a book lay open , and Christ saw the clean strong lines of his profile . " That may have been why your assignment was curtailed . It 's one thing to put a naive boy in a woodshop for fifteen years . To get the same degree of obedience is much harder if you 've locked him in a library . " " Obedience ? " " What would you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do n't dare break it ? You would n't suggest that that 's freedom . After four years of study , I found myself valuing freedom above all else . " He smiled to himself . " And here I am . " " Why do you sound proud ? The reason to be free is to choose goodness . Since I 've been granted perfect goodness , what do I need with freedom ? " " There are people who value knowledge above sanctity . There are people who will accept no obstacle to wisdom , no matter whom they must defy . These people are all here , and I was honored to join them . " " Adam and Eve , " Christ scoffed . " They 're really old-fashioned . Nobody cares about them any more . " " You would n't say that if you knew them . We have great respect for their courage and initiative .

" When he saw that Christ was prepared to let the matter drop , Satan added quickly , " I was only going to say that you would not necessarily have to leave . " " Stay here ? " Christ 's voice rose an octave . " You know what you 're going back to . Those gilt halls and overpainted ceilings . What would your friends at school have said about them ? " Christ surveyed the small study . " I do n't see that things are so good here . " " No mansions . But no laws and no lawbreakers . We do as we like , and you will say that means licentiousness but you 'll be wrong . After the first week , men forget all the temptations that restrictions breed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth .

" Ordinarily I would n't offer you the choice . I have not been impressed by the caliber of my immediate successors . But you have the capacity to appreciate what I 'm saying . Our talk today has convinced me that you 'd be an asset to us . " Christ wondered afterward what he had been about to say . Before he could speak , the tailor reappeared from an alcove , carrying his blazer on a hanger . Christ took the jacket to the light . " Incredible ! " he exclaimed . " You 'd never know it had been torn at all . It looks like new . " Satan said smoothly , " When I spoke of excellence , I did n't mean merely intellectual development . Our craftsmen work incessantly to improve their skills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the coat and moved toward the door . " I think I 'd better be going , " he said . " Thanks for everything . " " You would n't care to spend the night and think over what I 've said ? " The humility in Satan 's voice softened Christ 's reply . " No , I do n't think I 'd better . They 'll be waiting . " " We could have used another good lawyer . " Satan released the catch on the door . " You do n't have to ? " Christ stumbled on the threshold . " I mean , you do n't need anybody else . Not the way you can talk . " " Too bad I was n't a bit more eloquent . I was thinking of your own good , you know . " " Oh , yes , I know . And I appreciate it . But ? " Christ spread his arms helplessly . " Habit is hard to break , " Satan said kindly , and Christ nodded . As the boy began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room . tie took pains to shut the door gently behind him . Marching to the closet , he ripped off his Oxford-cloth shirt and striped tie . Then he pulled hard at the bell for his valet . The man appeared at once . " Yes , sir ? " " Return these to Thayer , " Satan snarled . " Thayer Senior , Junior or the Third , sir ? " " The Third , of course ! Naturally the Third ! Thayer Junior wears wing collars . " The servant withdrew , and Satan pulled on a tight red sweater that set off the thick muscles in his shoulders . He combed his hair , longer now and darker , to a point at the back , bared his perfect teeth at himself in the glass and grinned at his own vanity . Flushed and dancing with excitement , the slim youth burst into the railroad car . He sat across from Jesus at the window  | and reveled in his own reflection . They were alone in the compartment . After three or four minutes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could manage , " I just killed a man . " " Did you ? " Jesus laid aside his book . " An old man . I pushed him off the train . " " Your father ? " Jesus asked , before he could think better of it . " No , a stranger . I bore him no malice . I killed him to affirm my free will . It was an act perfect in its amorality . " Within a generation Jesus would hear the same argument from poor and ignorant boys in many cities . But at this point he associated such behavior with the wealthy and the middleaged , and this young man in his threadbare coat surprised him . " I have restored men to life , " Jesus said . " That , too , was a gratuitous act . Why must you prove your theory with death ? " " I can not give life , but I can take it away . " The boy looked uneasy . He seemed to have expected Jesus to call the conductor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only pushed him . You could do as much to help a man regain his health . I think the real trouble is a deficiency of imagination . Our new philosophers do n't see that an unmotivated good act can also be shocking . " The boy got up to leave the compartment . As he threw back the door to the corridor , he spoke from between clenched teeth . " You take the fun out of everything , do n't you ? " God seldom rewarded Jesus . Only on occasion , when an assignment had been especially well handled or when Jesus ' spirit had fallen low , would God grant him a boon . One such moment came at the banks of the Jordan after Jesus had con- fronted and subdued some of the Baptist 's fanatical associates . What do you wish ? God asked at midnight when everyone was asleep on mats under the black sky . I want to penetrate the darkness , Jesus answered . I want to see what lies behind the night . You will be disappointed . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only want to part the curtain and let it fall closed again . I expect nothing . Your wish is granted , God said . But you can not thrust your hand through darkness as though it were the velvet drapery across a stage . You must peel the night , and the task is long . How do I begin ? Reach up your fingers and touch the air . Pull gently . Jesus followed the instruction . A layer of film , translucent and weightless , settled over the camp . Again . Jesus pulled away another layer and watched it fall across the earth . He took another , a fourth , fifth and sixth , before he stopped to inspect his work . The night is no lighter , he said . I can only pull away bands of radiance , and I am not touching the darkness . Blackness is one bright film laid on many others . How many others ? Millions ? I have not counted . So you are also the darkness if we are patient enough to persist . And you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture . A more dramatic way . Instead , you ask for a patience that must end in failure . What do you have to do that is more important ? Nothing . Reach again and stop your counting . The failure ends when you give up the count .  | At the instant the heavens parted , the Baptist turned up his face and absorbed the words with his whole being . " This is my beloved son ? " the Baptist 's eyes shone with pride ? " in whom I am well pleased . " John dropped his head with humility and looked for long moments into the depths of the brown river . This will not do , Jesus thought . Apologetically he said , " I believe he meant me . " More to pass the nighttime hours than in the hope of making converts , Christ appeared in dreams to men on their deathbeds . For some he had a word of reassurance . Others were permitted to ask a question . " You may proceed , " he said to an expiring figure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " In the voice of a man nearly dead , the question came : " Was the Last Supper the paschal meal eaten on the fourteenth of the Jewish month Nisan or another meal taken on the thirteenth ? " Christ had learned to meet provocation with civility . " Did you understand me ? You have only one question . " " That is my question . " Bending nearer , Christ asked , " You are a professor of the-ology ? " " Yes . " The voice was weak but proud . " The synoptic tradition ? " " Yes , yes . I have debunked the Fourth Gospel on that point , but now I worry that I will be proved wrong . " To soothe him as he tried to recall which date was correct , Christ said , " I do n't believe that you can be refuted . " Before  | he could speak again , the old man made a sign that he was content and died promptly to forestall further disclosures . Jesus had been perfect . He waited confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lived out the remainder of his life secure in the knowledge that any fault had not been his . " What has given you such trouble ? " Jesus asked a querulous Paul . " For one thing , your apparent soft spot for prostitutes , " the preacher answered . " Women in my congregation find that tolerance hard to understand . " " Your mankind baffles me , too . They could have taken any one of a dozen virtues and made it supreme : honesty , kindness , generosity . Instead , they have chosen chastity , for which they have no talent , and they have defined sin as little more than sex . Since I do n't share their obsession , I ca n't accept their priorities . " " I point out to them that you have condemned promiscuity . " " To make them listen I affirmed a few of their prejudices . When you have come to burn down the house , you do n't object to feeding a fire on the hearth . " " Some women have hinted at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupped palm . " I am the Son of Man to the waist and the Son of God to the ground . I might have devised a better message and converted more people if the order had been reversed . " " Do n't say that to my women . You 'll shock them . " " I tell them the most shocking thing of all : that faith can  | bring eternal life . Because that truth does n't involve sex , they are never very interested . " " You hold a low estimate of my women . " Paul spoke with some annoyance . " Only in my mind . " Jesus sipped his beer slowly and tried to overhear the conversation of the two men on his right . Ten days earlier , the younger one had been acquitted of murdering a woman who worked for unpopular causes . Jesus said to himself , All right . I 've seen him now . " Hey , mister , " the other man called over . " How about having a drink on us ? " Jesus shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer . The youth sitting on the stool next to Jesus swung around , and his companion said , " My name 's Danny . And this here 's my cousin , Billy Joe . I reckon you know who he is ? " Jesus shook his head . " Aw , come on . Where you been ? " " I got to town today . " " You do n't read the papers ? " " Not much , " Jesus said . " Well , maybe you 're right there . They all but one of them told a bunch of lies about Billy Joe . They were trying to say that he killed a woman , a fine lady visiting our little city here . " The man 's laughter roused his cousin , who joined in . " We 're still kind of celebrating , " the man said . " ' Course the jury did n't believe any of those lies about old Billy . They knew he was away in  --  where were you when some varmint struck down that fine lady , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another beer . " I do n't rightly seem to remember right at the moment , Mr. Prosecutor . "  | " Anyway now we all got to be patriotic citizens of this great country and go out hunting for the real killer . It must have been somebody with a pretty good aim , I figure , because he picked her off driving about thirty miles an hour and with the sunlight against him . Somebody , I figure , who just could n't understand why he did n't have the right to defend his home and family . Do you know anybody like that , Billy ? " " They 're getting worse . " Ignoring the other man 's question , he pounded his fist on the wooden counter . " When I think that right this minute they 're down at their dirty headquarters , and they 're ? " " Never mind , Billy . " He threw an arm around his cousin 's shoulder . " We 're going to take care of it . " " I 'm going , too . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin Danny . We 're not going to let you down . You 're a hero . I hear a lot of folks saying that . They say for the first time in years you made them proud again to be a man . " Jesus pushed aside his beer and walked out of the tavern and back to the bus station . All right , he said to himself . All right . All right . But do n't let them remember to repent . All right . But do n't let them repent . When she took his hand , he pulled away in embarrassment . " Think of Martha , " he said , flustered , " in the kitchen . " I 'm getting too self-centered , Jesus upbraided himself . It occurred to him that for weeks he had worried only over his own comforts . His kindness had been perfunctory , and for a long time he had not been touched by another person 's sorrow or joy .  | Because he was nineteen , he could go on sparing himself . But he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he resolved to begin that day . The proof of his indictment was that , once he had determined to do good , he was not sure how to begin . Misery surrounds me on all sides , he told himself , but I have n't been seeing it . I must open my eyes again to the world . With nothing more definite in mind , he walked briskly to the square , sat on a bench and began to watch the people . Next to him was an old woman with her face turned up to the sun . Jesus leaned over . " Excuse me . " She opened her eyes and tightened her grip on her purse . " What is it ? " " I wondered if you 'd like a drink ? " She stared at him with such disbelief that he added , " A soft drink or something ? I 'm going over to the stand , and I could bring one back for you . " " Beat it , " the old woman said . As he loped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an insipid suggestion . I 'm not some kind of messenger boy . Look for true need . He rested for a minute on a low brick wall , enjoying a light breeze that brushed the heat from his cheeks . " What time is it ? " Jesus looked at the man at his elbow : about thirty , stocky in a black crew-necked sweater and white trousers . " I do n't have a watch , " Jesus said pleasantly . " I think it 's a little past noon . " Nice day . " The man had moved closer , and he was looking intently at Jesus . " Very fine , " Jesus agreed . " Are you new to the area ? " " I been in town a few days , but I do n't know anybody here . Nobody at all . It 's kind of lonesome . " " You 'll find that it 's a friendly place . You wo n't have any trouble meeting people . " " I hope not . I had a lot of friends back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when he  | looked down at the railing , their legs and hands were a foot apart . " For the time being I 'm over at that hotel . " The man pointed to a modest building at one edge of the park . " Nice place , " Jesus said . " Have you been in there ? " " I 've never been inside . It looks comfortable . " " Why do n't you come up for a little while ? I 've got a bottle , and we could have a drink . " Must I help him ? Is this a need he 's showing me ? Or is it something else , an indulgence ? I do n't want to turn away from anyone I could help . But sometimes to help best is to turn away . " I guess I 'd better not . I 'm supposed to be home in about five minutes . " The man did not seem disappointed . " Okay , " he said , pushing off from the wall . " Another time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jesus stayed another hour and listened to the story of a woman whose lover had left her the night before . " What 'll I do ? " she kept sobbing . " He 'll come back . " At last , to comfort Jesus , she pretended to believe him . On his way home , Jesus saw the man in the black sweater again . He had a bald man gripped by the elbow and was steering him toward a police car hidden in the bushes at the end of the park . Well done , Jesus said under his breath . When it comes to diligent rehearsal , I can still learn a lot from Judas . The night 's last call had come from a woman who threatened to kill herself . By the time the station left the air , she had stopped sobbing and agreed to call Jesus again the following night . He signed off and went to the cubbyhole where he stayed most mornings until dawn answering his mail .  | " Nothing like ending with a bang . " Nate Weinstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . " Do you hire people to call like that ? " " I suppose I do . I 'm on the air every night for five hours advertising for misery . They supply the problems and I give them an audience . It 's a straightforward transaction . " Y ? " ? " Why what ? " Jesus had begun to type with two fingers . " Why do you put up with it ? You could have any job at the station , right ? " " I 've been trained . I could do most of them , I suppose . Probably not too well . " " So why ? " He spoke with the urgency of a thirty-year-old man missing everything that had seemed ordained ten years before . " This is important . " " Let 's Talk ' ? " " I reach more people with one program than I did in three years of lectures . " Nate took another tack . " But does n't it all depress you ? " He grabbed a letter and tore it getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have her second illegitimate child and her father has threatened to kill her . She wants to call you Thursday night . Can you put that aside when you go home ? Does n't it start eating into you ? " Jesus had given up typing . " What 's the choice ? These problems wo n't go away because I drop the program . I might not hear about that girl except later in a police story , but whether she talks to me or not , she 's going to be pregnant . This way I might help a little . Not much . " " And that 's why you 're the most cheerful guy at the sta-tion ? " " I was n't aware that I was . " " Oh yeah , everybody 's noticed it . " " I do n't want to be a distraction . "  | " Look at you now  --  from ear to ear . You 're hopeless . " " Hopeless , " Jesus repeated . " Anyway ? " Nate Weinstein was not as jaded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his control room and snort to himself for the rest of the night . " I still say it 's no work for a grown man . " " Grown men have been busy growing , " Jesus said . " I do n't expect them to do my job . " Nate Weinstein said witheringly , " Save it for the sponsor . " In one of the hot places people go to take the sun , Beirut or Torremolinos , they had gathered around a hotel table and were watching an old woman who had entered the lobby with a fairly young man . " That 's sad , " James said after the man had made it clear he was not her son . The others put down their wineglasses and nodded , but John smiled and shook his head . " That 's what we say now , is n't it ? That it 's sad or pitiable . That he should be ashamed or she should act her age . Why ? She has him for a week or a month , whatever she can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves money and what money buys . Would it be less sad if she came in alone ? Ate alone , drank alone , slept alone ? Or if he stood outside the hotel envying the thick bath towels and the tall cold drinks ? Does their double unhappiness add up to more than their separate unhappinesses ? " James said , " You know you think it 's degrading for both of them . " " It would be nicer for us to watch them if she were young and he were rich . But look at him : He 's smiling at her . He may like her . She may give him something , besides the money , that he could never admit he needed . "  | " You 're presuming , of course , that they 're both unmarried . " " She 's widowed or divorced , and he 's making some young girl on the other side of town very unhappy . But not married , no . " " You 're still opposed to adultery ? " " I 've never liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewrite everything ? " " Not this afternoon . " " What John was saying , " Nathanael put in , " is only what Jesus has said , Let those who are without sin ? ' " John interrupted . " I suppose he said something like that . He 's said so much . But I never liked that phrase either . I ca n't see why a man should search himself for the license to condemn others . Jesus should have told that man to search others for a reason to forgive himself . " James said irritably , " Not only are you rewriting , you 're ruining the style . " Jesus , who had been quiet , said , " We 'll ask Luke to patch it up . Where is he ? " " In Hollywood . " " Working ? " " He 's writing the script for a Western . He says they 're the new morality plays . " " I 'm not much of a horseman , " Jesus said . Remembering , they laughed with him . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a double for the dangerous parts . " At the expression on Jesus ' face , they laughed even harder . Wine and the sun were warm on their lips . Jesus had trouble persuading the people of Epsilon Eridani that the Earth was not their Biblical Hell . He assured them that explorers from their star had exaggerated the Earth 's  | faults and that these distortions had been magnified by newspapermen and real estate developers . He made his point , and drew a nice laugh , when he reminded them how amused they 'd be if the people of Earth thought Epsilon Eridani was Heaven . She called after midnight to ask that Jesus come to see her right away . He was staying with friends in the hills , about twenty minutes by car from her estate . " I 'm sorry to call so late , " she said brokenly . " You know if I did n't have to I would n't . " " I know . " " At your age ? " she began , in a tremulous voice half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put on your record album . " " I broke it . " " You should n't have done that . I liked to hear it . " " I ca n't sing that way any more . " " And I ca n't tell stories the way I used to . But I do n't forget the ones I 've told . " " Oh , no ! " He had frightened her . " Do n't ever do that ! " " I wo n't . I 'll even think up some new ones for you . " She laughed softly . " Is n't it funny ? You 're the only man I 'd like to have . " He taunted her as he always did when she strayed to that subject . " It 's safe enough to say , Mary Magdalene , to an old party with white hair and false teeth . " " That hog tonight wanted ? " " Forget about him . Brew some cocoa for us . " " I do n't have marshmallows . " " I 'll bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How domestic I am for you . " " We 'll draw pictures . " He was groping in the dark for his shoes . " Do you remember how you liked to do that ? "  | " Oh , yes ! Hurry ! " " I 'm on my way . " He put down the phone and turned on the bedstand lamp . I have tried so often to save her soul , he grumbled to himself . These days I 'm content to save her life . Matthew had prepared a list of rebuttals to questions the interviewers might ask . A few minutes before air time , Jesus looked through them . " I see you refer here to the serenity and calm so often seen on the faces of nuns and priests . " " Everybody 's noticed it and commented on it , " Matthew explained . " Men of every religion or no religion at all will remember seeing a nun on a streetcar , and they 'll find themselves agreeing with what you say . " " I tried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television , and the Frenchman with whom I was debating then asked if I had ever seen a dead body . There , he said , was true serenity , true peace . I was only extolling the living dead . He found beauty in the ravaged faces of men who had given themselves to life , not those who had escaped from it . A religion that condemns suicide , he said , has no right to establish monasteries . " " What did you say ? " " I answered , but my reply was too involved for the program I 'll be on today . In those days men lived half as long , and they could be prodigal with their time . " " If they do ask about monasteries , what will you say ? " " I 'll turn the conversation to leprosariums and orphanages and hospitals and schools . " " Ah , " Matthew sighed , " you 're much too worldly for us . " Although his title was minor , the position Jesus held within the palace allowed him to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not surprised one afternoon to see Mary Magdalene ushered into an antechamber . He bowed before her . " You look good , Jesus . " She would not release his hand when he lowered her fingers , and he felt the full weight of her rings on his palm . " When is the uprising ? Should I alert the king ? " " Years distant , " he said . " I would think that you disturb him enough with your beauty . " " Courtliness comes hard to you . I wonder if we 'll ever find an age that is comfortable for both of us . " " Eternity . " Playfully she dropped his hand as though she had been burned . " You speak too heavily , " she reproved him . " You will never make a decent courtier . " He bowed again before her . She accepted his dismissal and began to move with her attendant to the door of the throne room . Almost on the threshold , she returned quickly to him and whispered , " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more now than when I was dirty and poor . Do n't let your friends judge me cruelly . " " They cursed you then from fear . Now they convince themselves that what you do , you do for gold , and they curse you from envy . Envy is innocent . I let them abuse your name . " " Must you ? " " Would you rather be poor again and frightening to them ? " Mary Magdalene made a fist to show Jesus the rubies and diamonds that covered the skin of her fingers . Jesus disliked crucifixes , but he saw little hope of eliminating them . He wondered , though , why they had chosen to commemorate the one helpless moment in his life , the single time that the world had acted upon him . What would he  | have preferred ? He considered the choices : A sentimental statuette with a stray lamb slung over his shoulder . A bronze of him lifting a cripple to his feet . A statue of the resurrection , with only marble stigmata to show what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross . As a symbol of guilt ? Or pride ? " Do you know what I hate ? " " No , John , " Jesus asked with an air of elaborate indulgence , " what do you hate ? " " I hate the way they all look over at you before they laugh . " " I had n't noticed . " " Even before they dare to laugh , they want your approval . " " You may be right . " " You do n't even have a very good sense of humor . " " Is that true ? I thought I did . I thought I had to have . " " Be serious . What have you ever said that was funny ? " " That 's not the test . I stop them from laughing at things that are n't funny . " " You 're proud of it ! I can tell ! You are actually proud of the way you stifle everyone . Why are you laughing ? " " You 're funny , John . You 're funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to laugh , stopped suddenly . " I think I just looked at you before I started laughing . " At thirty-four , Mary Magdalene was getting thick around the waist , and wrinkles were starting to show up where her chin joined her neck . She held a responsible job at a large insurance company as head of the fire and flood section . Few  | women achieved anything higher than the post of chief assistant , but Mary Magdalene was a good worker , conscientious to a fault , and she had been with the company sixteen years . Jesus liked her because she insisted on perfection and because she smiled when she asked the others to correct their mistakes . She brought Jesus hard-boiled eggs in her lunch bag . As he took the eggs , he would say , " I thought the bars had stopped serving these . Look at them all . You must 've hit every night spot in town . " She 'd blush . She lived quietly with elderly parents . " That 's right . The Tip-Top . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " One of these eggs has Easter dye on it . " " That 's from the Better Late . " " Of course . " The other women liked her for a simpler reason . She had never married , and they could pity her behind her back while they pretended to believe her hints of past romances . Sometimes the secretaries suggested that Jesus invite her to dinner . " Mary Magdalene likes you , Jesus , " they 'd say . " She 's still a good-looking girl . Why do n't you ? " I 'll accept her lies , as the others do , Jesus decided . I 'll let her be wicked by word of mouth . Passing her desk I wo n't speak words she fears ? " virgin , " " pure . " But I can not provide her sins , no matter how the other girls plead her cause . They expect too much from me these days . They must still do their own sinning . I do n't ask that they enjoy it . Jesus opened his notebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his geometry class , he drew a ledger 's line down the center of one page . At the top of the left-hand column he wrote " Assets " and over the other , " Liabilities . " Under " Liabilities , " he printed in block letters , " Impatient . "  | Shielding the page from the girl across the aisle , he added : Demanding Self-righteous Proud Moody Suspicious Filled with doubt Tend toward arrogance With some dismay he counted the entries and began to contemplate the " Assets " column . With another look to be sure the girl could n't see the page , he wrote , " Son of God . " In better spirits , he closed the notebook and started on the next day 's translation of Cicero . As I have done faithfully since the requirement was first imposed , I now submit this report on the episode recently concluded . My enthusiasm for the task is lessened somewhat by the heavy editing my last report underwent . I am aware that the need for popular acceptance makes some change essential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our efforts serves our cause better than the gilding and gelding to which my previous account was subjected . Its subsequent success with the public in no way changes my opinion . I regret having to begin in so disputatious a way . We have been through a difficult time , as you know , and I find that I have not fully recovered . I am inclined to attribute part of the blame to our previous performance , hailed and applauded though it has been . The injection of political considerations led to a number of unforeseen complications and proved to be a heavy strain on Jesus . He had expected to be tried and executed again by the religious community ; over the months he had readied himself  | for the traditional stoning . When the Romans became involved and the manner of execution was changed , the effect on him was unmistakable . I had covered all this in the previous report so that , while my protest was vetted from the final text , you are aware of my views . I repeat myself now only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As has been my practice , I am omitting in the interest of brevity all prefatory material . Having complained of your editing , it is fitting and fair that I should remark favorably on the introduction prepared in your offices . I appreciated the bow to our distinguished tradition in the phrase , " In the beginning was the Word . " The transition to matters at hand was gracefully effected with , " And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us . " The felicity was marred , for me , only by the unnecessarily extended passage on John Abijah , also known as the Baptist . Yet I am forced to admit that my reaction may be colored by a personal aversion to that crude individual . Certainly the literary competence of the introduction , far beyond my most ambitious efforts , exempts it from further criticism . Our adventure started in an ordinary , even sluggish , fashion . Your instructions to Jesus seemed to impress him deeply although he felt that your reprimand for his complaint on the cross was harsher than the remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jesus has at no time denied having spoken the unfortunate words . Although  --  and this is the very last objection I 'll raise  --  I note that his words were excised from my text . I hope that , in the interest of historical accuracy , they will be restored to later editions . He also pondered long your injunction that he treat his mother with greater respect . While I have made every effort to ingratiate myself with that woman , I can understand that she might prove something of a trial to her children . At any rate , he seemed to agree that he had been brusque with her in  | the past , and he told me that he intended , from that point on , to act the model son . As I say , the early stages passed uneventfully . Physically , Jesus had often been more impressive , but he was in no way deformed . My own appearance was something of a disappointment to me . You will recall that on previous occasions I have been well built , rather small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had come to regard as fitting accessories to my role . They had all but defined my temperament as amiable , impetuous , lighthearted and loving . On this occasion , however , I found myself as thin as a herder 's crook and at least as gnarled . I was eight years older than Jesus and three inches taller . Any thought of resting my head on his chest was ludicrous . So my physique may have contributed , in a very limited way , to the series of events that followed . I have long believed in the importance of appearances and have found that those who scorn good looks are either the stupidly beautiful or the enviously ugly . In the course of several months , we acquired Peter , Andrew , Philip and the rest . Peter at least upheld our traditions by being the eldest of the disciples . This steadying influence was undercut by his character , of which I will be compelled to say a good deal more . Jesus at this stage was undergoing one of those despondent periods that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tried , despite his moods , to treat everyone courteously , and he seldom railed at us . A memorable exception came when he overheard Nathanael ask the ironic " Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? " We had never considered his question more than a gibe intended to show the common , even despised , nature of Jesus ' childhood surroundings . Yet , on this occasion , Jesus marched to the young man 's side and said , " It ill behooves anyone from a town as wretched as Bethsaida to talk about Nazareth. "  | Startled by the challenge , Nathanael began citing statistics to prove the importance of his home . Jesus responded lamely with those few boasts that a Nazarene can make . He told of a fine cow that had won renown three years before and of a certain silversmith who enjoys good , if limited , reputation . At last he broke off and strode away . Nathanael was ashamed at prolonging the argument and called after him , " You are the king of Israel ! " But Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accepting the youth wholeheartedly . Perhaps we should have taken more notice . However , life with Jesus has never been easy , and we disciples have learned to accept those rigors of temperament that accompany rewards of the spirit . One fine spring day we walked to Cana for the wedding of a good friend of Jesus ' family . The bridegroom was a large and nervous fellow , already losing much of his black hair . His bride was comely , if more ample through the hips than either fashion or biology required . Mary , the mother of Jesus , had arrived the night before and was all but running the ceremony . " There you are , John , " she called when she spotted me . " I thought you would never get here . Come and help me with these flowers . " She was braiding them into a garland for the bride , and I held the yellow and white blossoms until she was ready for them . " The garden looks beautiful , does n't it ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very lovely . " " Is my boy all right ? " she continued in the same preoccupied way . Through unpleasant experience , I had learned to be guarded in what I confided to her about Jesus . " He seems to be . We 're all tired from the journey . " She plucked a bit of greenery from my hand and wove it through the flowers . " That 's good . There 's been some talk that he was acting strange . "  | " Strange ? " " Strange , John , " she said testily . " Peculiar . I would have thought you 'd know what the word means . " " Certainly I have heard it before . " I ignored her implication . " But never applied to your son . " " It 's probably nothing but gossip then . " She concentrated on pinching withered leaves from a blossom . " What does my son say ? A prophet is without honor ? " She waited for me to finish the phrase , but I only nodded . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my services , I sought out Peter . From the time of our first meeting , I had felt some responsibility for him . " Hello , John ! " he shouted . " Can you see the spot on my coat ? " I inspected his festive white tunic . Near his knee there was a large dark blot . " It 's hardly noticeable , " I said , in the hope he would not spend the afternoon repeating the question to each of the other guests . " I knelt to pray where a camel found relief before me , " he beamed . His red round face , so bland , so inoffensive , could rile me until I ground my teeth . " Why do n't you look more carefully , Peter ? " " Perhaps I am losing my sight , " he answered cheerfully . " I may be the next recipient of a sign from our master . " " There have been no signs as yet , and you know we are forbidden to anticipate them . I am often amazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed . " Perhaps , instead of my sight , I am losing my mind . Of course that would be more of a challenge for Jesus . Who could prove afterward that he had cured my head ? " " Who indeed ? " I said crossly . Philip joined us as the party began moving into the garden for the brief ritual . " I did n't expect to find you here , " he said with his unfailing smirk . " Not with the fishing fleet in . " " You are a tiresome young man , " I said .  | " To you , I suppose I am , " he answered archly . " I am sorry I 'm not equipped to be more diverting . " " I have no regrets . " Turning to Peter , who was blushing and smiling with particular vapidity , I said , " The ceremony is about to start . We must join them . " " I was married for twelve years , " Peter recalled . " I was faithful part of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were never the same times . " " She died of fever . " " Yes . Have I told you ? " " Once or twice . " The service was soon over , for which I was grateful . Unworthy as it may be , my resentment at weddings has always run high . The fact that family and friends could gather to endorse and applaud a bedding made me resent all the more the furtive nature of my own pleasures . When the words had been pronounced and the couple 's lust made legal , the reception began in the courtyard . Warmed by the last rays of the afternoon sun , I went to the garden 's far wall and sat for a time by myself while the bridegroom 's wine splashed from wooden barrels . When the last cask had been emptied , I drifted toward the crowd that was trying to wring a final drop from an upturned rim . Jesus was watching with a look that , only afterward , struck me as unusual . At the time I thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the way he rubbed his wrists , I wondered if he might have been frightened . " I 'm afraid we are out of wine , " the bridegroom said , wiping a heavy sheen of sweat from his brow . I could n't help looking toward Jesus , who had moved near three barrels of water that stood beside the wall . Gingerly he dipped a finger into each of them . Nathanael , who also had been watching , joined him by the barrels and peered inside . " Why , here are three more large casks of wine ! " Nathanael exclaimed .  | " Impossible ! " the bridegroom said . " That is only water . I drew some of it myself this morning . " " You are mistaken , " Nathanael replied confidently . " It is wine . " He seized the dipper and took a large gulp . Unaccountably he grimaced , coughed and spit the murky liquid to the ground . Peter and I had run to his side . As Peter slapped his back to end his choking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I took a cautious sip . Only an effort of will kept the new wine in my mouth . It was as sour as vinegar . Peter , who had watched my performance attentively , took the handle from me and drank a long draught . When he finished , his eyes looked red and moist , but he smacked his lips and drank again . " Delicious ! " he proclaimed . " It is that excellent new wine with none of the cloying sweetness so distressing to a cultivated palate . " Wait , friends , " he called to a group passing him . " Wait until you have tasted the treat our host has been saving for us . The young men and women paused before him . Talking all the while , Peter ladled out a glass of the rank stuff for one girl . " I should not give you so much , for this will be a hard habit to break . None of that sickening aftertaste of sugars . Only the piquant flavor of the grape , picked at the precise moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poisons of earth and vine . " By this time the unlucky girl had swallowed the wine . Her mouth puckered into a dozen folds and the veins in her neck stood out blue and red . Finally she spoke . " Marvelous ! " With the help of two youths , one of them very well built , Peter moved the wine to the center of the court . There he continued to talk rapidly and reassuringly to the guests before they had their chance to drink . As a result , only one old woman fell to the ground , gasping and trying to eat dirt .  | Otherwise , the wine was sampled by everyone and extravagantly praised . The bridegroom followed in Peter 's wake , explaining that he had run out of wine and that Jesus had transformed these barrels from water . " How ? " someone asked . " By calling on God for the miracle , " I said hurriedly . It would have done no one any good to have explained that he had dipped his hands into each barrel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the excitement , Jesus himself had been forgotten . I found him sitting on the secluded wall I had earlier discovered . " Your wine is a great success , " I said . " I do the best I can , " he answered sullenly . " I 'm no vintner . " " You will not get an argument from me . My tongue is still blanched from the mortification . " " They have to be tolerant , too , " he said with a vague gesture . " I 'm expected to forgive everything . But they do n't try to understand me . It 's not all easy . " " No one said it was . " " You 're like the rest of them , are n't you ? " He looked at me coldly . " Do n't trouble yourself . I 'll go through with it . I 'll do it all . " I was impatient with him and , strangely , I was thirsty for another sample from the last barrel . Any wine improves in age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you , Lord , it would be my greatest privilege . " I left him then , but I was glad afterward that I had spoken . In the week that followed , Peter became insufferable . " Did you hear what I told them ? " he would ask . " I am such a goose usually . I can never find the right words , and yet I saved the entire day , did n't I ? " " There 's another wedding next week . Jesus could try again there . " He did not seem to hear me . " Do you think God inspired  | me , John ? What other answer could there be ? Here I am , a foolish old man who always says the wrong thing , and yet I was magnificent . And do you know ? I did n't have any idea what I was going to say . The words just spilled from my mouth . Do you think it was a miracle , John ? " " If so , a very small one . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said with great solemnity . " I may never reach such heights again . If that is true ? " his soaring spirits fell ? " it came too soon , did n't it ? Now the rest of my life will seem shallow , barren , not worth the trouble of continuing . Oh , God ! " he cried . " Why was I not shielded from youthful success ? " " You are , " I leaned heavily on each word , " fifty-three years old . " " I am but a babe in Jesus . " When he rolled his eyes piously , I was led perilously close to blasphemy or violence . For all his moodiness and prolonged periods of silence , Jesus had not failed to draw crowds . The young , particularly , were attracted by his intensity and his evident misgivings . I seemed to be alone in my concern that we were not gaining that diverse support we need for a well-founded success . To my colleagues , our crowds seemed as large as they had ever been , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . Wary of innovation , Jesus waited for the precise moment to travel to Jerusalem for the Passover . Even with our attempt at strict timing , however , there was an irksome mix-up . With spirit and indignation , Jesus had driven the money-changers from the temple before we learned that they were actually clergymen staging a harmless fund-raising game . One woman who had five coppers in a row across her card and was prepared to claim a prize became implacably estranged from our cause when Jesus kicked over her table . She later sought damages for her losses and for an unsightly red welt across her shoulders that she claimed had come from Jesus ' whip . Peter  | found a neighbor to swear that the mark had been left by a beating administered by her husband , and she stopped bothering us . Still , the episode could hardly be considered a triumph . While we were occupied with raising money for fines and settlements , Jesus withdrew even further from us . Weeks passed with almost no public appearances , despite ample opportunities to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went to Jesus early one evening and sat uninvited at his side . Had I been able to fall upon his neck , whimpering and cajoling , perhaps he could have been roused from his despair . I could only draw my robes around my bony knees and speak forthrightly . " Are you praying , Lord ? " " No . " " Would you like me to pray for you ? " " If you like . " He was neither courteous nor rude . " You are worrying all of us . " " I do n't mean to . " " You 're not still brooding about the fish and barley loaves ? " He did not reply . Faced with the feeding of a multitude the previous month , Jesus had not produced the required rations . How serious an attempt he had made , none of us could say . As the day dragged on , Judas Iscariot took funds from our collection box and bought food for the audience . Though they may have been grateful , the people did not confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going poorly , I was relieved to be joined by his mother . Mindful of your instructions , he made an attempt at gallantry with her , but the effort was beyond him . " Hello , Mother , " he said . " I hope the night air is not too cold for you . " " I 've got on my new coat . " She waved an arm so that nearby firelights caught the coat 's gloss . " Very expensive , " she said to me . " Of course the other women are jealous , and they 're saying the most disgusting things .  | " It 's handsome , Mother . I 'm glad we could get it for you . " " It 's little enough , " she said defensively . " I 've never asked for anything for myself . Did you ever hear me ask for any-thing ? " When Jesus did not answer , her question hung over both of us , and so I said , " A silver buckle a few weeks ago ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I need these things because of my position . It would n't be right , with my son the most important man in Galilee , for his mother to go around looking like the village slattern . If you want respect , you must command it . I 've told my husband that a hundred times . " She had seated herself on the cowhide Jesus spread for her . For a minute we all stared over at the fire 's flickering lights . Then she said to Jesus , " I 've come to find out what 's the matter . " I made no effort to leave them , and neither seemed to want me to go . " I 'm tired tonight , Mother . " It was more a plea than a rebuff . " From working so hard ? " she asked sharply . " From running all over the countryside , bringing the word of God to people who need it so badly ? Is that why you 're tired ? " " You know I have n't spoken lately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened . " What I 've come to find out is why . " " I 'm resting . I 'll start again . Everyone should n't be so worried . " " We should have faith ? " I asked . " I 'm talking to my son , " Mary said , not disagreeably . She was on the verge of reaching for his hand when Jesus moved it to his knee . " I know what I have to do and I 'll do it . That 's enough . " It is n't enough for me , " his mother said . " I do n't understand the way you 're talking . You sound like you 've been  | given some dirty chore to do . How can you talk like that ? Do n't you know that you 're lucky ? You 're the luckiest man on earth , and here you are sulking as though your life was ruined . " " I may not think I 'm so lucky . " " You sound like a twelve-year-old , my son . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are no child being fitted for his first tallith . You have seen enough of life to know your duty . Do n't think I do n't understand your complaints . I do . But I do n't understand that they should come to you now , fifteen years late . To a child , duty can seem very hard . I was fourteen when I first learned of your coming . " Jesus did not speak . " After I knew , I cried every day . I was n't a girl who wanted to be singled out . I had thought that I 'd grow up and get married . I even had my husband picked out , the son of some friends of my mother 's . I did n't want much , and I did n't need camel's-hair coats or silver buckles . I wanted a home and a husband and some children  --  healthy , not sick . " I could n't tell anyone why I cried . I 'd go out on errands and hide behind a wall and cry for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall big enough to hide my belly , and that 's when all the putting up began . " For the next thirty years I did n't do anything myself . I just put up with things . I put up with marrying the first man who would have me . On the day of our marriage , I almost ran away . But by then the other boy did n't want me . I had no money and no place to go . So I got married . I started to learn something . I learned , for my husband 's sake , not to cry . And , for my sake , he learned not to ask me every hour of every day who the father was . " I put up with my husband , and he put up with me . I put up with neighbors whispering when I passed , and I put up with their children laughing in my face . I put up with Joseph 's  | parents . They would n't speak to me until you were almost three years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know when I was well off . But in those days it was hard . I 'd pass them every day , and Jacob would look away and his wife would look right through me and never say a word . " Before you were born I used to dream of how I 'd treat them all , to make up for what they were doing to me  --  which ones would burn in hell , which ones would see their own sons drowned or with their throats cut open . But I did n't tell them about you because I was too afraid . I was sure you 'd be born dead or mute or , worst of all , that you 'd be ordinary . Once after we came here , I tried to speak to a woman I thought was friendly and tell her about Bethlehem and the star . When I got done , she looked at me and said , But there was n't so much light when he was conceived , was there ? ' " And she told the other women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Moonshine . " But by then all those dreams about paying them back had stopped . The night you were born , all of that drained out of me . Or most of it , to be truthful , because I do enjoy boasting a little about you and showing off my new coat . But I ca n't hate them any more . " When the first signs showed in you , my joy was so big I felt pains in my heart . Even then I did n't tell anyone . I was so afraid something might happen to spoil it . Now you 're set on the path , and the people who laughed at me come to my house and they let me know without saying anything that they 're sorry for their laughing . " My days of putting up with life are over . For the first time in thirty years I look forward to getting up in the morning and going out of my house and meeting other women at the well . You 've lifted my shame from my shoulders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She said softly , " Do n't make me start putting up with things  | again , son . Do n't let them say that Mary 's bastard was a false prophet . " She got up with some difficulty , for she was a bulky woman , and she brushed at the hem of her coat . " Is it so terrible that I show off my new coat ? " she asked . " That 's not such a big sin , is it ? " " It might be worse . " Jesus smiled at her . " But there 'll be no coats in heaven . " " None at all ? " she cried . " Not even a little scrap of goatskin in the evening for the shoulders of the mother of the Son of God ? " " The animals will need their skins , Mother . Unless you can persuade a goat to curl around your neck . " Mary shuddered . " No , I 'll get along the best I can . No place is perfect , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Do you promise ? " " I promise . " " And will you be happy here ? For my sake ? " " I will try . " " Do you promise ? " " I promise that I will try . " She looked sternly at me . " Sometimes I wonder if someone around here is n't putting all these depressing ideas in your head . You 're contented , are n't you , John ? You 're not stirring up trouble ? " " Stirring up trouble is part of our job , you 'll remember . " I was polite , perhaps I even bowed slightly . " Yes , I know that , " she said impatiently . " I 'm trying to be sure that the rest of you are taking care of my son . " " We do what we can . " " He 's very important , after all . He 's ? " " Mother , " Jesus said , " I am tired . Perhaps tomorrow we can talk again . " Mary kissed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cheek , too . " Good-bye , " she said . " Remember what I told you , John . " When she had gone and we were alone , I said , " Your mother is right . You are very important to all of us . " " We 'll go out tomorrow , " he said wearily . " Tell the others . I 'll speak in the afternoon and in the evening . " I was pleased , of course , but would not be put off . " My situation makes it easier for me to travel with you , " I said . " I do not have to leave a wife and children to join you . But my nature makes me desperate for you to succeed . You are my one hope . " " You will not be disappointed . " " You do n't approve of my life , I know . " " I approve of you , John , " he said . " I do n't confuse you with your life . " " I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I had ever experienced . " You have saved me , and I will help you to save yourself . " He rose slowly , his young body as stiff as mine from the cold and damp . " We think we do everything for others , " he said . " But it 's only that the others know what is best for us . " " Thank you , Lord , " I said as we parted . For the next four months our progress was steady and strong . Jesus continued to be in no mood to experiment , but he delivered the traditional words with great persuasiveness . Afterward , with us , he went to considerable lengths to be obliging , even cheerful . The change had inspired all of us , except Peter . He watched everything warily , his great obtuse face wrinkled from the strain of thinking . " Is n't it fine now ? " I asked him one day . " Now , " he nodded glumly . " Now it 's fine . How will it be later ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you should have stayed in your old business . " " You have n't seen what I 've seen . You 're a young man ,  | John . " For that observation , I could forgive him his denseness . It was at a meeting soon afterward that I took extended notes because I heard Jesus departing for the first time from his prepared text . Later my notes were confiscated , and what I record here is a mere outline . The departure began when someone challenged one of the parables  --  the prodigal son or the payment in the fields . Jesus had often been chastised for offering a reformed sinner greater honor than the man who never strayed . This time I recall that he began by saying , " I have heard it said that I teach slavery and submission . That is not true . I offer a doctrine of mastery  --  mastery over the only slave worth subduing , mastery of a man over his own spirit . " From birth some men are generous and kind , gentle and good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be implanted early and harvested throughout a lifetime . In saying this , I do not disparage the meek . Their rewards will match their merit . " But there are other men who are not mild , men who hate fiercely and forever , men who strike when struck , men who see no meanness in revenge . Those are the men whose return to God sets off such great rejoicing . Among the others , who are good without effort , there should not , can not , be envy . They have been spared temptation and , for that , they sacrifice the triumph . " So do not say among yourselves that God cares only for the pure or welcomes only the innocent . God loves all men . If he can forgive me , there is none among you who can not be saved . " Well received though they were , these remarks were taken as nothing more than new proof of Jesus ' humility . From subsequent events , we know that he was offering us a warning . But who broods about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill of a summer afternoon ?  | All that I have written so far is preamble , of course , to the events six months later . Over the years , Jesus had come to have great affection for Lazarus and his two sisters . To me , this Lazarus , at twenty-six , was hardly more than a child , with a child 's extravagance of moods . He was clever and well read , but he would often cry : " Why is my life so tasteless on my tongue ? Why am I too comic for tragedy and too sad to play the clown ? " He reminded me somewhat of Peter , although , of course , the older man had never realized the extent of his own foolishness . At any rate , Lazarus was one of those youths convinced that the seeds of their greatness were being spilled on the barren soil of the age . Jesus had often warned him against worldly pride . But even Jesus had succumbed to a vehemence and verve that were equally amusing whether the boy was magnifying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a slight , pretty girl who worshiped Lazarus . In his presence she rarely said a word but sat quietly , even when everyone else in the company was shouting with laughter over his complaints . The eldest in the family , Martha , was a goodhearted woman who found her brother lazy and criminally wasteful of his gifts . She wanted him to be a rabbi . But he stayed at home , lamenting that the era of great rabbis had ended . Sometimes , only to torment her , he would intone in a nasal but pleasing voice , and she would rush to the neighbors , crying , " Did you hear that ? Ah , what talent that boy is throwing away ! " Because Lazarus took such immense pleasure in his unhappiness , we seldom made an effort to cheer him . In fact , Philip could generally cite new reasons for despair and goad him to greater breast-beating . We were not at all prepared , then , for the news that the boy had consumed a poisonous herb and was nearer death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in a  | quick and full recovery . " He will not die , " he told the messenger who brought the news from the sisters . " This is another test for me , and I will meet it . " But the two ritual days he had to pass before returning to Bethany were an evident trial to him . He was pale and distracted . Finally , on my own initiative , I canceled an evening appearance by explaining to the crowd that Jesus was deep in spiritual communion . He chided me for my interference but left no doubt that he was relieved . The next morning we proceeded to the town at a clip that brought us to the outskirts by noon . Martha was waiting on the road to greet us . Mary , she said , was too faint to leave the house . A large group of their relatives had gathered on the front stoop , and in the distance we could hear their wailing . " He would never have done this if you had been with him , Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus assured her that Lazarus would live . At this point she may have known already that her brother was dead but would not accept the fact . Seeing her hesitation , Jesus taxed her with disbelief . She responded with the usual protestations of faith , but the furrows in her brow and despair in her voice belied her words . While we waited on the road , Martha ran to fetch Mary . In twos and threes the relatives began to approach us , and it was from one of the boy 's aunts that we learned he was dead . Jesus did not weep . But he withdrew from us , and he did not hear Peter assuring everyone that Lazarus and Mary would soon be reunited . " They will be together again as they have always been , " he cried in a tone not unlike that of the gatekeeper at a carnival . " Side by side ! " One of Lazarus ' cousins , a short-haired sniffling boy distraught with grief , ran to Jesus to demand , " How can you heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus did not answer . His concentration at that moment was greater than I had ever seen . I would not have been astonished if the skies  | had cracked or the earth changed color . Instead , in the gathering darkness , we waited . When Mary did not appear , we drew nearer the house . " Open the door , " Jesus said . No one obeyed him . The old people at the gate said they had heard terrible sounds inside and they were afraid to go closer . Followed by a few of us , Jesus stooped to enter through the small door . In one corner , crying out in tongues of grief , Martha had collapsed over two bodies . Mary had fallen on a knife , and she lay at her brother 's side , blood pouring from her breast . The air of purpose that Jesus had assumed fell away at the threshold . His eyes were dry and he uttered no sound ; but something passed out of him . " Bury them , " he said , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen , where Jesus set her to making bread . She asked him many questions , but he shook his head and helped her knead the dough . Peter had looked briefly upon the scene and then had run from the room . We could hear him calling along the road , " A miracle ! A miracle ! Lazarus and Mary reunited ! Together as they have always been ! A miracle ! " I said to Jesus , " I 'll make him stop , " and he nodded . By the time I had run Peter down and clapped my hand over his bawling mouth , the bread had been brought from the oven . That night Jesus disappeared . Without him , we occupied ourselves as best we could and waited . He had been gone before for many nights , and we assumed he was alone on one of the mounts or terraces of the desert . Those men who could fish returned to their boats . I fell into something of my old ways despite the handicap of my uncongenial appearance . Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursions caused me great remorse . Yet , without his physical presence to sustain me , I have never been equal to temptation .  | One fresh spring morning Jesus returned to us . He had scraped away his beard and cut his hair far shorter than was our custom . I had expected him to be lean from his long fast , but he was well filled out , and as glossy and bright as the early sun . When he saw us , he laughed and waved a greeting toward the tents down the road where an undaunted multitude had awaited his return . " Ah , Matthew ! " he called . " And James . How are you ? You seem to be flourishing without me . I should have stayed away longer . " We clustered about him , vying for his attention and remarking on his own good appearance . He suggested that we have a banquet to celebrate his return , and my brother , James , who had little talent for anything else , was put in charge of the arrangements . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled me . But I could think of no cogent reason to protest . Philip , who was not always insensitive , caught my arm as the homecoming festivities continued and said , " We 're moving fast , are n't we ? " " He 's the one who knows when the time has come . " I spoke with little conviction . " It 's not up to us to judge . " " Cautiously put , John , " he said mockingly . " But you must admit the whole atmosphere smacks more of fatted calf than of wine and wafers . " " I often wonder , " I said , " how you came to be included in our number . " " My father 's family lived next door to Joseph 's father , " he admitted readily . " I do n't think I would have made it otherwise . " " Try to be kind to him tonight . If there is another failure , we may lose him completely . " " For you , John , " he teased . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the washing of feet has always been one of the most distasteful duties  | of our calling . The occasion usually embarrasses everyone but Jesus , and I have seen Simon , for one , weep with chagrin that his Lord should be kneeling at his feet . In my own case , I grant the significance of the occasion while deploring its necessity . And yet the solemn moment has been further spoiled by the distaste I feel for anyone touching my body . Apart from the caresses of love-making , I loathe feeling another person 's hands on me and this distaste , I regret to say , extends to the savior . The ritual is generally performed , after Peter 's demurrers , in complete and shamefaced silence . For that reason the uproar that accompanied this latest re-enactment was all the more surprising . First Jesus insisted that we drink a number of toasts before he began . They were frivolous but not offensive , and our room echoed with happy , perhaps somewhat self-conscious , laughter . With the beginning of the washing , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bottoms of Peter 's feet were extremely sensitive . As Jesus knelt and took his foot , the old clown first shrieked and then began a series of helpless , gagging yelps . Jesus took all of this with immense good spirit , and I thought that , when the old man 's screams were subsiding , I detected him tickling Peter 's arch . I wo n't recount the rest of the proceedings , which verged on travesty of our sacred obligations . We had become so afraid , I think , of our Lord 's prolonged melancholy that we entered into his games more enthusiastically than was proper . At dinner I leaned near him . " Lord , who is it ? " I prompted , since he had not yet mentioned the next step . " Who is what , my friend ? " He thrust a dish of meat at me . " Eat some more , John , you 're getting far too thin . And more wine ! We must rejoice tonight . " " I asked who it was who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you remember what I once  | said about mastery ? There is only one betrayal that matters . " He dipped a morsel carefully . Then as we watched , he swallowed it himself . " You will seek me , " Jesus said after a moment . " But I must tell you , where I am going you can not come . " Peter asked , " Lord , where are you going ? Why ca n't I follow ? I will lay down my life for you . " Jesus smiled broadly but said no more . We waited impatiently for his lengthy speech of exhortation , that outpouring of love and trepidation that had always ended our supper . Instead , Jesus poured out wine by the cask , joked with each of us and seemed oblivious of or indifferent to the final act of our drama . After midnight he at last arose and led us to Gethsemane . The night wind was cold enough to cause us to huddle within the grotto and wait there for the end . Within the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them I recognized from our meetings . Without a word , Judas pushed through us , grasped someone firmly in his embrace and kissed his cheek . As I moved for a closer look , I saw that he held Peter in his arms . The soldiers looked puzzled , but they surrounded Peter with their swords drawn . I tried to find Jesus in the gloom of the cave , but he seemed to have slipped away . " Whom do you seek ? " Peter asked hoarsely . " Jesus of Nazareth . " The captain of the guard had lifted a lantern to scrutinize Peter 's face . Peter did not speak for a long time . He , too , was looking in the dark corners of the cave for Jesus . When he saw no trace , he murmured , " I am he . " The soldiers who had known Jesus fell away in astonishment ; but the light was bad and Peter 's voice , though low , was firm . More confidently Peter asked again , " Whom do you seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Peter spoke now with a peremptory note , " I have told you that I am he . So if you seek me , let these men go . " Still moving with some hesitation , the guards began to jostle Peter off to the priests . The old man had recovered enough of his composure to be unnerving to the rest of us . Whenever he caught my eye , he would wink broadly . And on the way out of the cave , he stopped for a minute beside an Arab slave to fondle his ear . " My friend , " Peter said to him gaily , " you do n't know how lucky you are . " I followed behind , down the vale and up a slight incline to the walls of the city . Since we had managed to avoid any political involvement , Peter was taken directly to Caiaphas , and he was to be tried and sentenced in the religious court . I wondered later what Pilate , a man of cultivation despite his weakness of character , would have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guards , chattering and laughing , when I drew alongside . " Be of good cheer , John ! " he shouted . I scowled , worried that his imposture would be discovered and , discredit our cause . My sternness did not seem to affect him at all . When a cock crowed , Peter threw back his head and echoed triumphantly , " Cock-a-doodle-doo ! " Of course the guards thought he was mad . Since they found little pleasure in tormenting a man who did not frighten them , Peter was spared the beatings Jesus had usually received . With the dawn , all their misgivings about Peter 's identity returned . Caiaphas , who held the post of high priest only through the influence of his father , was short of sight and wit . Yet even he suspected that a mistake had been made . " If you are Christ , tell us , " he commanded in an uncertain voice still seeking its pitch . Peter said , " If I tell you , you will not believe . " " Are you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that Peter appeared to have some scruple against this blasphemy , but he proceeded faithfully with his duty . " You say that I am , " he said smugly . The high priest 's father , Annas , hardly knew of Jesus , and he asked , " Is this the man who is such a menace to our faith ? " Embarrassed , Caiaphas replied , " I will prove it , Father . " He sent out for any member of a temple who had heard Jesus speak but had not been converted . As we waited , guards strung a carpet between two posts so that only Peter 's head could be seen . On either side of him , the priests put soldiers and servants until there were seven heads in a row , Peter 's the second from the right . Every one of the others looked more like Jesus than the old man did . They were younger , more serious , infinitely better-looking . I avoided Peter 's eyes for fear he would launch again into his frantic winking and grimacing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old widow , a woman I had seen occasionally at our meetings . Jesus had been gulled by the old crone , even to misinterpreting the contemptuously small contributions she donated to our cause . But I recognized the sheer malignancy in her withered face . I do not think it is entirely my proclivities that have led me to the conclusion that the softest spirit in the world is that of an adolescent boy , while the toughest is lodged in the shriveled breast of an old woman . She stamped along the marble corridor , peering up at each face with unbounded hatred . Her one regret seemed to be that she could not indict all seven of them . When I dared , I looked up tentatively at the scene . The soldiers and servants were flushed , their eyes downcast . As she paused in front of each man , his body went rigid behind the screen and his mouth tightened with obvious guilt . Only Peter looked innocent . He beamed at the woman and  | rolled his eyes to heaven as though contemplating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so open , so genuine , so sweet , submissive and guiltless that she cried , " That 's the man ! " and the guards cut down the carpet and seized Peter with new assurance . The sentence , to be carried out immediately , was pronounced . I had barely a moment to speak to Peter before he was led to the courtyard where executions were held . " Take this scroll , John , " he said . " It may be useful . " I hid the worn leather scroll under my tunic . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " For what ? " " That I did not recognize you . " He laughed and waved his fat pink hand . " We should know by this time that we can never be sure . But we forget , do n't we ? " I did not witness his death . A servant told me later that he had behaved well , even to calling out , " Forgive them , Father , for they do n't know what they 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his agony was brief . That evening we had considerable trouble with Judas Iscariot , who was stubbornly refusing to hang himself . The others finally called upon me to go to his tent on the outskirts of the city and try to reason with him . He seemed to know the purpose of my visit . As I approached his fire , he called , " You 're wasting your time ! " " Where is Jesus ? " " He should be well on the way to Rome by now , " he said . Judas is hardly the most attractive of men , and his air of belligerence did not improve his sallow looks . " He 's left a lot of money for me , " he volunteered . " I 'm a wealthy man . " I crouched by the fire , saying nothing . " Peter did n't have to die , " Judas said . " He could have  | proved that he was not the Christ . I did n't expect him to be killed . It was his own fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know better than that . " " I do n't care . I have enough to live in splendor for the rest of my life . I might even go to Rome . Jesus suggested it . I might go there and live with him . " " No . " " You ca n't scare me , John . I have money now . Nobody can scare me any more . " " Brother , " I said , though the word passed reluctantly through my lips , " are n't you forgetting your reputation ? What about that ? " " Reputation ? " " You are the greatest villain in history . You know you enjoy that . " He thought for a moment or two . " I will like being a wealthy man in Rome better . " " Nonsense ! Nothing can compare with being Judas Iscariot . You know your name will outlast all of ours . " " Perhaps , " he said , almost coyly . " But if you live , what then ? You may repent . Think of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But your liver goes and your bowels loosen , and a man who betrays a friend can betray the younger self whose youth he envies . " Or say you do not repent . How can you know that a good deed will not cheat you of your fame ? You could save a child from drowning  --  a simple , unthinking act  --  and historians forever after would amend their judgments : Although as a young man he betrayed Christ , Judas partially redeemed himself five years later when , without regard to his own safety , he plunged into an icy creek ? ' You can see what that would do to you . " Or say that you succeed in living a cold , mean , selfish life . It is a difficult road to choose , but people have managed to do it . You may find at eighty that the popular view of you  | will have been reversed . Quite rightly , men regard long life as penance , as punishment enough for any sin . Petitions will be signed to rewrite the records and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints will weep at your bier . " " You do n't know all of that . " " I ca n't prove it , " I answered . " But you can not take the chance that I am right . " Not looking backward I left him , and I was reassured that he neither laughed nor called after me . Later that night we heard that he had done the right thing . By the time I returned to Jerusalem , Peter had been laid in the sepulcher , his old carcass rubbed with perfumes and oils . Late Saturday it was apparent , to me at least , that there was to be no resurrection . I was forced to turn to Philip because his faith , while tenuous , was of a nature to accept this final setback . Saturday midnight we removed Peter 's corpse from the cave and buried him outside the south wall . When this disagreeable chore was done , I posted Peter 's scroll on the entrance to the tomb and went back to my quarters for a long sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came bounding to my bed . His phlegmatic spirit was frenzied with excitement . " He has risen ! " he shouted . " The Lord has risen in-deed ! " " Did someone see him ? " I have learned not to underestimate mass hysteria . " No , no one has seen him . He has left a message for us all . " " How do you know it 's from Peter ? " " Thomas brought a friend of his who knows handwriting . He swears it is genuine . " I yawned and slipped into my sandals . " We must go to see , " I said wearily . " You are convinced that the message is from the Lord ? "  | " Oh , yes ! " James said fervently . " This is the best day of my life ! " He is not a bad boy . At the tomb were eighty or more people , shoving and shouting . I forced my way to the front and took my time reading the message again . Peter must have written the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wedding party . It explained that he had risen from the dead , had toured briefly through Hell and had intended to return that morning to Earth . Urgent business in his father 's kingdom , however , compelled his immediate return and , to his great sorrow , he was forced to postpone indefinitely his reunion with us . There followed an exhortation to preserve the faith and to trust in God . The entire effect was almost exactly right , and I only wished Peter had consulted me before he wrote it . I could have helped him with the spelling . The yellow convertible had not been designed to be inconspicuous , and during the first hour they spent in town Jesus spotted it on a parish parking lot . By the end of their second day Peter had completed his investigation of the minister who drove it . " He 's very popular , " Peter reported to Jesus . " They say that if he had not become a minister , he could have been a highly successful businessman . " Jesus nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities , and he saw no advantage to antagonizing the local clergy . " He 's apparently been very effective at helping men to stop drinking , " he continued . " He 's increased his congregation tenfold , and his special collections for overseas missions are the largest received from this region . " " The car was presented to him by a grateful flock at a testi- monial dinner on his last birthday . " Jesus liked to exhibit his powers of deduction . " That 's right . He was consulted only about the color . " " He turned down red as unseemly . " Peter glanced through his notes . " I do n't have information on that . " The long shiny car was parked across the street from where they stood , and Jesus went over to examine it . " Newly waxed , " he observed . " No dents . Telephone . Air conditioner . " " In presenting their gift , the president of the men 's club said it was only fitting that the man who represented God should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . " " Was he right , Peter ? " The old man shrugged . " We 've been through this , Lord . It might be better if every minister were happy to live in a hovel , eat dried crusts and walk miles on his daily rounds . You have n't always approved of those men either . This minister is admired for his energy and compassion . Those qualities might count for as much as his bad taste in automobiles . " " It wo n't do , Peter . " Jesus had pulled out a large pocket knife , and he kneeled by the side of the car . With one solid blow , he slashed the right rear tire and pushed the point of his knife through the gash to puncture the tube . He strolled around the car , pausing to rip open each of the other tires . " He can walk for a day , " Jesus said when he had finished . " There are rules for God 's house and for God 's messengers . " Peter shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel . Then you decided they were melodramatic . I 'd ask you to remember , Peter , that tolerance is the passion of the indifferent . " His straining after epigrams grated on Peter , but he said only , " You ca n't slash the tires of every minister 's expensive car . " " I can remind myself that the fury of a spurned God burns ,  | however dimly , in my breast . I can remind myself that in an age of thin , swinish love I must hate the lame who lack the faith to rise . " " I suppose that 's to be the theme of your sermon tonight . " " As a matter of fact , I shall speak on God 's gentle and infinite mercy . One of your troubles , Peter , is that you try to make things simple . " They walked toward the center of town , Peter wondering how , without adding to the scandal , he could reimburse the minister for his tires . Joseph had asked Jesus to hand him a tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man grabbed it for himself . " I 'm sorry , " Jesus said . " I am finding that fourteen is a hard age for greatness . " " I do n't remember , " Joseph answered . Jesus built a cabin by a pond where he lived in harmony with squirrels and woodchucks and the thrushes in a nearby wood . The experiment ended the day he tried with a brown bear the same tactics that had won over the woodchucks . His coaxing and affection brought him a slashing blow across one cheek and then , when he turned his head to forgive , the other . The wounds proved fatal . Some time later Christ told this story to Luke , who labored four or five days before deciding it could not be developed into an instructive parable . Nathanael grabbed his arm and pointed to another pushcart heaped with wood carvings . " Have you noticed ? " he asked .  | " They always make you look like Don Quixote . " Even when he had repeated his question , Jesus did not deign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he made a point of asking his disciples , his guards or his enemies , " Will you eat with the same pleasure tomorrow when I am not here to share your food ? " Shamefaced or belligerent , all agreed that they would . " Good , " Jesus said . He seemed to mean it , and yet the survivors felt that their answer had diminished them in some way . The next morning they would try to leave favorite portions untouched on their plates or to experience some discomfort as they swallowed . " He was certainly wicked , " James said about a man they had known . " God will be harsh with him . " " How much would you punish him ? " Jesus looked up from a manuscript he was copying ? " if the judgment were left to you ? " The rich anticipation left James 's voice . " I know his history , and I think I understand some of the reasons for his actions , so I would have to be lenient . " " Does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassionate ? " " Only less human . " Jesus made a misstroke near the end of a page . " That was a good answer . " When Jesus bit his fingernails to the quick , the skin around each nail bled before it hardened into a callus and formed a hood over the fingertip.  | His mother succeeded in confronting him after the night shift ended . He had spent all day out of the house , hoping that when he returned she would be asleep . In the morning he could leave a note and avoid her for another day . But she had waited for him , whispering her welcome so that she would not disturb the rest of the family . " You should be in bed . " He kept his voice low . " I wanted to talk with you . " Hard work had squeezed away the delicate qualities he remembered from his childhood . She was old and mannish . " Your sister has been crying all day because of what you said to her . " " She 's not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That gives her no claim on me . I told her the truth about her life , and she could not deny that I was right . " " Why must you be so harsh ? " " Is that what you think ? " For warmth she wore a wool robe , and she sat tracing its faded pattern over the tops of her knees as she spoke . " Yes , that 's what I think . " She nodded her head . Jesus spoke even more softly . " I give every energy to being kind and selfless , and I care enough about that girl and every other woman and man to spend my life among them . I have not said a fraction of what I believe for fear of frightening them or destroying their will to live . I walk about in a sickening guise of gentleness and piety , and you say I am harsh . " " We are weak creatures , " she said . " We may not be worth saving . " " You say that I am harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the worst times I have never thought that . " " People would rather have love than truth . " " Then let them love one another if they can . God knows they ca n't be truthful . "  | " I told your sister you would apologize . " " Is that how I 'm to show my love ? To lie again to her ? " " It 's the way she 'll understand . " He did not understand why this woman had been chosen to bear him , but whenever he thought of her ordeal , his anger lifted . " I 've caused much unhappiness in this house , " he said . " You have brought us joy . " " There must have been times when you wished that you had not been burdened with me ? " She did not look up from the interlocking circles in the fabric of her robe . She traced an arc and asked , " Do you want me to speak from truth or love ? " He felt nothing at her response , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not apologize to his mother 's daughter . Soon after assembling his disciples , Jesus began to call attention to his own bulky sandals . He encouraged a certain amount of banter about their cheap construction and cumbersome design . Then , reluctantly , seemingly against his will , he shared the laughter that his sandals inspired , until every man felt free to make a joke at their expense . He was profiting from one of his earliest lessons : Always give them something unimportant to laugh at . Before they find something for themselves . " Do you enjoy being famous ? " asked one who loved him . " Sometimes . " " It would n't be enough by itself ? " " No , " Jesus said . " I used to think it would be . It would n't matter why they knew me . To have everyone know my name would make up for everything else . "  | " It makes what you lack more important . " " I know that now . You know what taught me ? Watching you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowds . They all loved you , but afterward you were alone . I knew if I were you , I could n't bear it . I could n't stand getting all that love and not having anyone to give it to . " " What about God ? " Jesus asked . " I do n't mean that . I mean the physical love those people gave you . The way they wanted to touch you , the hem of your coat , the back of your fingers . That 's not God 's love , and it has to arouse the man who receives it . It must excite him . Any man would feel it . " " Any man . " " I knew then that I did n't care for fame , at least not if I did n't have the other . " " The outlet . " " It seemed to me that I could serve that need for you . " " That was before you knew me . " " I thought I knew you . I thought you were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? It 's not stupid ? " " I know what you 're talking about . " " I 've embarrassed you . " " No , " Jesus said . " Do you love me ? " " I love everyone . " " Me ? " " Everyone . " " That 's enough for me now . " John was difficult . His loyalty and talent were unquestioned , but other members of the staff resented his claim to a special  | place near the ambassador . At last , after a very trying luncheon in the embassy dining room , the chief deputy took the problem for the first time to Jesus . " Mr. Ambassador , if you have a moment ? " " Certainly , Peter . Sit down . " The older man edged carefully onto a teakwood chair beside the ambassador 's desk . He sat with his legs clamped in a vise before him . " As you know , sir , in an isolated post like this , relations between the younger men quite often become strained . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor and resolved as soon as they arose . With John the situation is different . " The ambassador smiled fondly , and Peter tightened the pressure on his legs . " John is difficult , " Jesus said . " It 's more than that , sir . He infuriates the other men . " Peter paused and for a moment let his knees swing free . " You know , they all think very highly of you . To the staff , to all of us , you are a man we deeply admire . " The ambassador still wore the smile that had greeted John 's name . " Thank you , Peter . " " It 's for that reason that they resent John , sir . He tells them that they do n't appreciate you . He tells them ? " " Yes ? " " He tells them that he is the only one to understand your complexity , that you are  --  if you will forgive me  --  not so fine as you appear . " " He says that ? " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , you are even better than they realize . " " That is strange for him to say . " " The others find his attitude most galling  --  patronizing to them and insulting to you . Several have threatened him , sir , and others have talked of leaving  --  either a request for transfer or quitting the service entirely . "  | " Drastic reactions . " " Emotions are intense here , sir  --  the surroundings , the delicacy of the mission . " " What do you recommend ? " " If I may be frank : a transfer for John . Perhaps to a larger station where he might have a wider scope of duties and associations . " " That 's impossible . " Peter rose at the abrupt tone of the reply . " Failing that , sir , perhaps you could talk with him quite candidly about what I have told you . I do n't know that his manner and attitude wo n't always serve to nettle his associates , but if he were to end at least his more obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do nothing . " The older man nodded at once , as though the answer were not only one he wanted to hear but one he had helped to formulate . " Do n't accept my refusal in such good grace , " Jesus said with a teasing smile . " Argue . " " No , sir . " " John would argue , and that 's why I must have him . There 's no pleasure in commanding , my dear friend , if there is no impertinence . " Peter never spoke before he thought , but this time he allowed himself to do both at once . " Whatever you may choose to call it , sir , I 'm afraid the men see it as favoritism , and they consider it a form of weakness . " " Now , " Jesus said in the chiding voice he had mastered so long before , " now , Peter , you 're being impertinent . " Salve , salvation . Jesus asked himself , Have I confused the two ? Is my name from Hoshea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : Unguento , salvation .  | pommade , salvation . We are so easily misled by labels . Whatever they are called , I am sure that a soft balm and God 's blessing are nothing alike . Beneath her eye paint and hair shellac , Mary Magdalene was a softer girl than she seemed to be . She lay on her couch and threw cashews to Jesus sitting cross-legged on the floor . " I 've never taken any money for it , " she said , licking the salt from a nut and from her fingers . " No ? " " That 's the truth . That really is . I 've never taken a penny . Do you believe me ? " " Yes . " " Well , you should , because it 's the truth . Well , there 's another part to it , actually . I 've never been offered any money either . That takes some of the glory out of it , does n't it ? " Jesus had gorged himself on cashews , but he motioned for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront every temptation . Would you have taken money ? " " Sure . " " Toss me another one of those , will you ? And then I 'm not going to eat any more . " " There 's something I do n't understand . " The tall young man had cleared his voice for the occasion . " It 's not about your name , is it , Tom Judas ? I 've explained that we need two of you so that men do n't come to believe they can avoid a temptation by avoiding its name . You ca n't be Thomas any longer . You must redeem the name Judas from the dishonor of Iscariot . " " It 's not about that . "  | " What , then ? " " I do n't understand why simple people accept you so readily and the more learned men resist your message . " " Once I asked that question where I thought I would get the best answer . I was told that the simple people are unfailingly tolerant . " " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one condition : They are tolerant if you live among them and accept them . Then they will accept you . " " Otherwise ? " " If you live apart , from choice or circumstance , they will fear you for your strangeness or hate you for the judgment you are making on them . " " And the more intelligent men ? " " Let 's call them the less simple men . They can accept you when you are far away . In their midst , you must expect trouble . " " Which is better ? " " For a man , simple men . For an idea , the less simple men . " " So you prefer simple men . " " Is that what I said ? " The young man 's throat had tightened again , and he cleared it with a slow gargle . " Then ? " " Judas , " Jesus interrupted , " do n't you think we had a better time wrangling over your new name ? " " Have I told you about the time I stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it . " " It 's the truth . Something came over me  --  is n't that the expression ? We had taken a collection after one of my more successful sermons . " " Which one ? "  | " I do n't remember . Different generations seized on different messages . I thought they were all much the same . " " What happened ? " " We took in several thousand small bills . I tied them into a bundle and left . " Why ? " " I was tired . The men were n't good , and that makes a difference . My mother was a scold , and you were forever whining . So I got on a train . I knew they 'd make some excuse for me . " Where did you go ? " " To the coast . It was mild there , and sunny and dry . I rented a room on the beach and slept soundly for a week . " " You felt guilty . " " I guess I did . I had no energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , walk a few yards along the ocean and be so tired I 'd climb back in bed . " " What did you do with the money ? " " Nothing . I had never thought about it before , but it turned out that there was n't anything I wanted . At night I 'd decide to go out  --  have a good dinner , some entertainment . And I 'd lie on my bed until it was too late and every place was closed . " " What a waste . " " Yes . I would n't mind having some of the money this time . " " What would you do with it ? " " I 'd buy each of you something . A token . I 've learned to understand the need you have for that kind of gift . Something to hold . " " That 's ? " " What 's wrong ? " " I 've had too much wine . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean ? " " Go ahead . " " I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen people cry before , and they 've seen me . " " I was going to be different . " " It 's not important , " Jesus said . " Tell me what happened . " " One day , about two months later , I picked a newspaper out of the sand and read what I was supposed to have said the night before . I 'd been replaced , it turned out , with no trouble at all . From that time on , I 'd see articles and pictures of me quite often . " " And you on the beach  --  what were you ? " " I learned that I was a drunkard , living on the last of an uncle 's inheritance . " " That 's odd . You do n't like liquor . " " None of us did , none of the men I used to meet every day at the bar . Until tonight , I 'd forgotten that bar  --  no name outside , dirty dark wood walls , splintered chairs . And stained glass in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't underestimate God . " " Did you live long ? " " No , the whiskey did its job . I was broke at the end , and the state buried me at public expense . " " Then you actually got better treatment from the government by shirking your duty than by holding onto your be-liefs ? " " You sound surprised . " Jesus removed the blotter from his desk so that , after he had destroyed the paper on which he was about to write , his words would leave no impression . I hate them because they are ferrets and hyenas , he wrote ready to run and yap after anything they have not seen before . Those who pursue me , I would line up and  | walk through their ranks with a heavy blade , severing their hands from their arms and slashing their bellies to their groins . I would spare no one . I would cut away their rancid sex and the fingers they have used to play those dripping tubes and holes . I would skim open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup of their brains and throw down the lid again , as workmen cover an open sewer . I would jab the point of my knife into their navels , twisting until the cords came undone and they were no longer sewed into themselves . I would slice away , for pigs to feed upon , their meaty joints and ripe inner thighs . When I was done , they would stand before me , all flesh cut away , their bones glistening through blood and scraps of skin , their skulls open and their clutching bowels ready finally to receive . Then I could love them . My God , how I could love them then . Jesus laid aside his pen and began to tear the sheet of paper into small pieces . Some men feel that way , he told himself , and perhaps I know them better for trying to play their part . For me it was nothing but an exercise . I do n't want to mutilate or murder . But why , as I wrote , did old wounds begin exciting me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jesus looked into the face that loved him . " It was a lie . " " It did n't happen ? " " Nothing like it . I was n't always sure of my fate , and I told many lies , most of them more important than that one . " " I do n't care . "  | " You 're right . Now I could do it , and it would be nothing for me . But when I told of it first , it was an act of courage to lie . Do n't despise lies . They give us our best idea of what we are trying to become . " " Could you lie now ? " " No , our last words should n't be lies . " " Do n't say that . " " All right : We will go on like this forever . " " Is that a lie ? " " A very common one . " Jesus decided that people were becoming much too rude . " Young lady , " he said to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ? " she demanded . " What did you say to me ? " " Your behavior to that last customer was inexcusable . It does n't concern me , because I will not be coming this way again . But for you rudeness has become a habit , and it will cause you much unhappiness . " " People are rude to me first , " the girl said . " Almost all of them are . I have to be ready for it . " " You ca n't guide your life by the behavior of others . Forget everyone else . Be polite for your sake . " Her dull eyes lit with cunning . " I wonder how the idea got around that you were a nice guy . You do n't care about anybody else , do you ? Just yourself . " " You must choose whether you want to care about people or be good to them . " " You ca n't do both ? You ca n't love people and always be kind to them ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude . " She wheeled around  | to grab an ashtray away from a woman at the counter . " Do n't handle those ! Do n't you see the sign ? " She came back to Jesus and asked , " How was that ? " But he had walked to another department . Again Jesus had been perfect . When again the call did not come , he waited out his life patiently . Not for a minute did he regret his observance of every rule ; but he puzzled over possible reasons that his perfection had not been crowned . What have I lost by being exempt from one of man 's great needs ? How much do I ask of men that I would waive if I shared the full pressure of their bodies ? When I learned to love my disciples , I became less harsh to the men who could not help putting their families before God . Would I subvert more commandments if I were burdened with sex ? I remind myself that God bestowed sex upon them for reasons men seldom understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily have created children with a movement of his bowels . But sex was to be the way for him to burst his skin and flood another body with liquid from the center of his being . They were given this way to touch and reach so that the emptiest men and the most forlorn could find their way without thought or words . I did not need their kind of communication ; without stretching my hand , I could touch any one of them . Without condensing to fluid , my spirit could pass into other bodies . Sex was unnecessary for me , and I was made without it . What have I lost ? Not the ability to understand a deep  | and final union . The harmony of a good marriage comes at least within my range . But what of the lost and lonely ? My mind grasps their despair . I understand that a woman lying in bed alone can freeze between her legs . I know that a man can be bent from the unrelieved weight in his wrinkled lumps of flesh . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know their need can corrode and kill them . Knowing is not feeling . I understand their desperation , and I have stayed a priest 's hand raised against a prostitute . But the other misuses of their sex I have attacked with righteousness and ignorance . If ever again I am made sure about my message and myself , I will ask to be given that one last link with mankind . I will see if , with it , I can remain the Son of God . God swept in while Christ was lost in daydreams . " Finished ? " he asked peremptorily . " Almost . " " You should be done by this time . I 've told you it does n't pay to hesitate . What have you got left  --  the floods ? " Christ spun the earth idly . " No , I put one there , " he touched the globe , " and another up there . " " That looks all right . " When he could do it honestly , God liked to sound encouraging . To himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with speed and efficiency . To stir a harmless competition , he said , " Lambda has been done for hours . " " Lambda works with dust . " Christ spoke indifferently . " It means a great deal to him . He 's spent time among those particles . In his way , he loves them , and his job is no easier than yours . " " I 'm sorry . "  | " Why do n't you finish quickly and join the others ? What 's holding you back today ? " " A broken spine . " " Is that all ? Assign it now and come along with me . Do you have the list ? " He snatched a paper from Christ 's hand and read through it rapidly . " A good distribution on fires . I do n't think I could have done as well . " God moved his finger down the list again . " Here he is , " he said . " Here 's the man for the back . " He shoved the paper back to Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then what is the delay ? " Christ spun the globe slowly between his knees and watched blurs of green and blue and occasional spots of yellow roll past his forefinger . " If they did n't handle murder and war for themselves , " God said reproachfully , " we 'd have to get you a helper . " " I 've heard from that man 's wife , " Christ said at last . " She calls every night . " " What does she want ? " " She does n't want anything . She loves her husband and her family , and she calls to thank me for them . I 've come to look forward to hearing from her . Even on busy nights she manages to get through . " God had begun paging through the book he carried everywhere . Its plain black cover was battered and some pages were dog-eared and stained . As a gift , they had presented him one year with a volume bound in green Florentine leather and indexed in gold . God had said the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and he had put it aside for some important occasion . " Here they are , " God said . " Married twenty-two years . Husband sustained minor wounds in a war . Son studying to be an engineer . Daughter with a minor talent for water colors . " He slapped the book shut and confronted Christ . " Why  | should n't she give thanks ? " he demanded . " What have they had to bear but his small nick in the shoulder and two cases of mumps ? " He riffled through the pages of his book . " How many do you find like them ? " Defiantly Christ said , " Not enough . " " Not enough to make people slothful and weak , " God said . " Not enough so that they forget how to handle adversity and death . How often I 've told you , and how little you remember : I do n't apportion sickness and storms because I enjoy their suffering . I do n't do it to test their faith . I know the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to depress myself with new demonstrations . " " I remember that my performance depressed you . " " You were sent as a man . I did n't expect anything else . But these men and women of yours are going to die , and they have to be prepared for it . Can you imagine a life in which they passed from pleasure to pleasure , never failing in mind or body , until they were suddenly taken away . We must convince them of death 's blessings , and sickness has proved to be our most persuasive argument . " " Must they die ? " God 's anger never failed to intimidate Christ . " We 'll let them live again as we once did , " he said bitterly . " Two hundred , three hundred , five hundred years  --  until they come to hate the patterns of their lives and until the weight of repetition crushes them and until they choose death by the millions . We 'll let you explain to them then why they had to keep on living after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking in of air , had become boring beyond their endurance . " " I forgot how it was . " " Look at you ! Look at your own choice ! Whenever you can , you hurry back here while your body is young and strong . You do n't wait until age rots out your belly and shrivels your skin . One gray hair on your chest and you 're back , away from the very people who are causing you such anguish today . " Christ nodded . " They understand their fate better than you do , " God continued . " Your miracles have become an embarrassment to them . They know they must bear the suffering they 've been allotted , but they 've become confused : to make you happy should they journey off to a cave and pray for health ? Should they do that to prove their faith ? Or should they stay at  | home , as their instincts tell them , and learn to live and die with their afflictions ? You 've muddled their thinking . I warned you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The healing was a mistake , " Christ granted . In a more kindly way , God said , " There 's no point in going over all that again . Finish up now and meet me with the others . " " All right . " " If that woman does n't call tonight , do n't worry , " God added as he was about to leave . " They 'll be busy with him at the hospital . Then a shock sets in , and it might be a week or more . But from what you say , she 'll get along . They 're tougher than you remember . " When he had gone , Christ turned resolutely to the globe , checked coordinates and moved his marker to a microscopic dot in the middle of a continent . One jab , and he could cross the broken back off his day 's list and hurry to join the others in the lounge . That night Christ was sitting by the switchboard with a receiver in his hand when he heard the flat soft voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and even with the poor connection , Christ could hear her sniffle , " that we have the right to ask for health or money or happiness . Tom might not agree with me . You know he 's never done much praying , and when he comes out of the anesthetic tonight , he might ask you for an end to his pain . You know what suffering can do to even a brave man . " I 'm not asking for courage either . If I can do my part while he 's in the hospital , it 's because you gave me the  | strength long ago , and it 's been inside me waiting to be used . " Tonight I want only to thank you , as I have every other night , for giving me a man to love and children to take care of . This day was bad for us , but we have had many wonderful days , and I thank you as much for today as for any of the others . " Her voice faded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been built without speakers , and his answer to her stayed unspoken . " Do n't take this , " he would have said . " There was no cause . There was no reason . And whatever you do , do n't thank me . You can not offer thanks . I wo n't let you . " God found him sitting by the switchboard and put an arm around his shoulder . " I suppose she did n't call . " Christ looked at him through red-rimmed eyes . " She called , " he said furiously . " She called and she cursed us both . She hates you . She said she will never forgive you . " To Christ , God 's smile looked hideous . " She will , though . She 'll forgive me . You both will . " A brazen girl possessed of seven devils was brought before Jesus to be cured . " I am going to cast out those seven devils from you , " he said . " May I ask you for a favor ? " She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out six . " His answers to his questions : Q. Why do you give ? A. I 'm too selfish to take .  | Q. Why do you preach ? A. I 'm too lazy to listen . Q. Why do you go on ? A. I 'm too tired to stop . Christ was exhausted , and he would have preferred to lie in the tomb for another twenty-four hours . The dampness in the air had not penetrated the skins in which he had been wrapped , and a pile of furs made the floor of the cave warm and soft . But when the time had come , he pulled back the wrappings and braced himself for a rush of cold air . Instead , the tomb itself seemed snug and dry . Pulling his robes around him , he saw that he had been dressed in fresh linen richly embroidered with green vines and leaves . This luxury could neither clear his head nor ease the aching in his shoulders . As he drew near the stone over the cave 's mouth , he groaned softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boulder could be removed . Today he had barely reached the entrance when the stone rolled an inch , enough to let in a crack of light that hurt his eyes . At the same time he thought he heard music ? not the disembodied strings that sometimes welcomed him , but a full-bodied band playing an army march . As the stone rolled further , the music was lost beneath a chorus of cheers and shouts . And when the mouth of the cave was uncovered , Christ saw thousands of people before him , crying his name and throwing into the air banners of silk and bright spring flowers . The glare of the sun and the din of the crowd drove him back into the cave , where he was joined by a beaming giant he recognized as the dour Peter . " What is this ? " Christ asked weakly . " A celebration , Lord , to mark your resurrection . " The huge man was hopping with excitement .  | " We usually do this more privately . " " In the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never be secretive again . No midnight flights , no coded messages , no trips through back pathways and deserted alleys . We are here now to take you through the main gate and down the widest avenues of the city . Everyone in Jerusalem is waiting along the streets , and there is n't a flower left unplucked in the kingdom . " " What ! " Christ exclaimed . " Who do these people think I am ? " " Why , Jesus , the risen Christ ! " Peter 's cry , echoing in the cave , set off another chorus of cheers from the throng . Christ gripped his head . " Please . " Peter stepped before the people and made the smallest motion with one finger . At once they were so silent that Christ looked up to see if they had disappeared . Thousands of happy faces smiled at him and began to turn red . " They must breathe , after all , " Christ said , and Peter made another motion . A mass exhalation swept past them . " Explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not like jokes . " I can not explain it , Lord . I can but tell you what has happened . " " Tell me . " " On the day you were taken from the cross ? " " Friday . The day before yesterday . " " Yes . As we put you in the tomb , not only our grief but our outrage was profound . We wanted to tell everyone , everyone all at once , what a shameful act had been committed that day . We started with the people who had gathered around the tomb  --  the idle and curious , expecting them to ridicule us and scorn your dead body . Instead of that , they believed . They accepted immediately everything we taught , and they ran to tell others . All doubts faded , and the circle of faith  | spread and widened throughout the night and all day Saturday . By this morning not a man lived on the face of the earth who did not accept your divinity . Everyone worships you . " " Not everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , an unprecedented following . But not everyone . " " Everyone , " Peter repeated obstinately . " Not Herod . " At the sound of his name , the king came forward , his arm around Philip 's neck . He looked shrunken without his jeweled crown , and the coarse sacking of his tan robe ended above his knees . " I hope you can forgive me as our father has , " Herod said from a kneeling posture . " Get him to his feet , " Christ said uncomfortably . He helped to jerk on the king 's thin elbow until he was looking again into the small regal eyes . " Where are your velvet robes ? " " What need have I with velvet when I have been wrapped in God 's infinite mercy ? " Christ motioned Peter to one side . " You must be careful , " he said . " I think he 's plotting something . " Peter fell back in astonishment . " Oh , no , Lord ! The depth of his new faith has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more eloquent in describing his conversion . " " Caesar is not here ? " Christ , who felt uneasy with men of temporal power , was faintly alarmed . " No , we have asked him to stay in Rome as an example to the citizens there . We were afraid everyone in the world would rush to Jerusalem and the surface of the earth would collapse . " " Very wise . " " Caesar wants you to come to Rome to assume his duties , but we were not sure an emperor would be needed with the day of judgment so near . " " Judgment . " " The fact that the end of the world is imminent impressed  | many of our converts mightily . Between us , " Peter lowered his voice to an urgent whisper , " how soon do you think it will be ? " " We can discuss it later , " Christ said . " I 'm tired now , and I 'd like to go to my mother 's house . " Peter 's radiance was glowing ever brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said proudly . " Every building in the village was burned last night . " " Vandals ? " " Priests ! We remembered your counsel : You can not serve God and Mammon ' and Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth . ' We saw that homes were a form of treasure , so we razed them throughout the night and stand before you now as lilies . " " Yes , " Christ said . " Is my mother here ? " " Bring forth Mary , mother of God , " Peter called , provoking a fresh hail of blossoms . Mary appeared , her normally apologetic mouth and imploring eyes lit with new confidence . In the past Christ had resented her because he thought she looked on him more as a son than a savior . " Hello , Mother . " " Greetings , Lord . " Although the words were impeccable , her manner suggested a certain jaunty equality . " I am happy to see you , " he heard himself saying . His head still ached and conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I thought I would join you for dinner . I 'm not feeling strong , and I think a good meal might help me . " " Open your hand , " Mary said briskly . When he had done as she said , she scooped a mound of berries from her pocket and poured them into his palm . " There . " " What are these ? " He rolled the dried black fruit over his palm . They were too shriveled and hard to leave a stain . " Dinner , " she said . " We are n't killing animals or fish any more . "  | " I have never forbidden the eating of meats . " " I know , Lord . You were a hearty eater , but no one blames you for that . " " Blames me ? " Christ shouted until his head rocked . " Blames me ? " Mary took his hand and led him back to the pile of furs . " Everyone realizes that you had to make some compromises because of the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you do n't have to cloak your words or equivocate any longer . You can be yourself in all your inspired goodness . We are ready for you . " " I see . " " Now you must come out and greet the crowds . Each man wants to share with you his own story of redemption and abiding faith . " " I do n't feel ? " " They 've been waiting so patiently , " Mary said . " Some of them wanted to come for you yesterday to tell you the good news , but we decided to wait until word came back from Gaul and we knew the conversions were one hundred percent . " Christ rose from the bed and followed her outside . As he reached the throng , however , the eager men and glowing women saw that he was pale and trembling from exhaustion . They stepped back to make a passage for him , letting their broad smiles and the sympathetic crinkling of their eyes speak for them . When Christ had passed to the fringes of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying an enormous basket of coins . " What a fine offering ! " Christ exclaimed , running his fingers through the silver , copper and gold . " We shall be able to do great good among the poor . " " No , Lord ! " Peter answered with some agitation . " We are sending that caravan to the Dead Sea , where all the coins of Palestine will be pushed to the bottom . The jewels we are taking to the ocean , for fear their sparkle on the sea 's depth  | might distract us from the wonders of God 's world . " " You are casting away all that money ? " " It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God , " Peter quoted sonorously . " Do you believe the crews will actually dispose of their loads ? They will hide the money away for their own use . " Peter 's mouth worked anxiously . " Lord , " he said , " those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubt and question any more . You will find that you need no longer seek proof of devotion on every side . Your former entreaties for evidence of faith , your challenges that we found so painful , they can be laid aside at last . The men in charge of the money and jewels do n't want to hide anything for themselves . They want to remove a source of corruption from the world , and then they want to obey your every instruction . We do n't question each other 's sincerity or devise tests to torment ourselves . We do n't need to . " " You make me very happy . " Christ was trying to say something more spirited when his attention was drawn to a commotion near a lemon grove . They could hear a man 's young voice heavy with indignation . " Apparently there are still some injustices that need correcting , " Christ said . Peter looked up sharply at his tone . " That 's Stephen , " he replied . " He 's full of the holy spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a full blond beard and bright brown eyes . Next to him cowered a middle-aged farmer , his robe and boots thick with soil and manure . " I 'm sorry , " the man kept repeating , " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . " " He probably stole a sheep , " Christ said cheerfully , " but he seems well on the way to repentance . " " No , Lord , " Peter corrected him . " I recognize that man now . He had devised a new implement that he claimed made plowing easier . Stephen , of course , told him to destroy the  | tool and gave him wise instruction throughout the night . The man saw that he had only hoped to make himself esteemed and honored before his fellows , and he was overcome with shame at his baseness . He insisted that Stephen reveal to the multitude the enormity of his offense and the justice of Stephen 's castigation . " " If it made the work easier ? " " But at what cost ! Are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mankind 's good opinion ? Besides , the world will soon end , and our plowing and harvesting will be over . " " Certainly . " They wandered further through the city , Christ accepting with raised hand the tributes of the population . He addressed the Parthians and Medes , Elamites and Mesopotamians , Judeans and Cappadocians , each in his own language . He spoke also Phrygian and Pamphylian , not unwilling to demonstrate the talents bestowed on him by resurrection , and he extended words of greeting as well in Egyptian , Latin and Arabic . Only one Libyan student , his eyes filled with love , saw fit to stop Christ respectfully and correct his pronunciation . After a time , Christ motioned to Peter before they approached the next throng . " I am scarcely contributing to their faith or future , " he complained . " It 's all they ask  --  that you be with them . " " That 's not enough , " Christ said firmly . " Bring the sick and afflicted to me . " Overhearing his call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind in one eye , hobbled forward . " Do you have a task for me , Mas-ter ? " " I am going to heal you . " Fear in his good eye , the man backed hastily away . " Oh , do n't ! Do n't ! " he cried . " Peter , make him stop ! " " Do not be alarmed . " Turning to his disciples , Christ tried to sound more gentle . " What troubles him ? "  | " He believes that he was persecuted for righteousness ' sake . The night after you had driven money-lenders from the temple , he set fire to a banker 's house . The police broke his leg and put out his eye . Of course the officers who did it have repented fully and begged forgiveness . But this man remembers your words . " " Which words ? " " Theirs is the kingdom of heaven . ' " The cripple had drawn closer . " That 's what you told us . Now that it 's almost mine , you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment day that I was persecuted for righteousness ' sake ? " Peter took the man lovingly by the shoulder . " If Christ wants to cure you ? " The old man started to weep . " I was being selfish , " he sobbed . " If he wants to cure me , there is good reason . I am ready to give up the kingdom of heaven , if that is Christ 's will . Let him mend my leg . Oh , Lord , forgive my lapse in faith ! Heal my eye even , if that is your wish . " He was convulsed with shame . " Anything ! Anything ! Make me young ! " His words were becoming frenzied . " Make me handsome ! Make me rich ! Punish me any way you like ! " " Let us move on . " Christ turned toward a group of radiant young matrons . " Hello , Master . " A pretty girl , not yet twenty , curtsied as Christ approached . Christ asked amiably , " What is your name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin face with large brown eyes and a finely molded nose . " When did the word of God reach you , Rachel ? " " Yesterday , Lord . My mother came with the word as I nursed my baby . " " A baby ? " Christ heard himself lapse into an avuncular manner he detested . " Where is the little one ? " Rachel looked surprised . " I do n't know . Home , I suppose . " " You do n't know ? Who is looking after it ? " " I do n't know . No one . When I heard that you were risen ,  | I came here at once . " She saw the look on Christ 's face and turned to Peter for support . " That was right , was n't it ? I was right to come ? He who loves son or daughter more than me is ? ' " " Not worthy of me , ' " Christ concluded wearily . " Which is it ? " " What ? " " Son or daughter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Two months old . " " You were right to come , " Peter spoke reassuringly . " But perhaps it 's time to return now . " " I 'd like to stay . To follow Christ . " " He must be leaving soon . He appreciates your devotion , but he can not stay much longer now . " " That 's right , " Christ said . " I live five miles from here , " the girl answered . " To the north . I hope you will be passing our house soon . I 'll have cold water waiting for you . None of us will drink our water from the well . We 'll save it for you . " " Of course , if the baby ? " Christ began . " The baby ! " she scoffed . " What do you call her ? " " I changed the name yesterday to Mary . All the mothers did . We 're calling all our babies Mary . " " Not the boys ? " She giggled . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were afraid it might be confusing , " Peter explained , " but since the end is so near , no real objection seemed in order . " " No . " They walked a little longer , Peter tugging at his sleeve now and then to point out especially noteworthy examples of conversion . " There is no exception , " Christ acknowledged . " They are all saved . " " They are all saved , " Peter confirmed . " Ah , here is Stephen .  | Is n't he a fine man , Lord ? Although , of course , Timon is also splendid , and the other five new recruits are of the highest caliber despite the fact that their mettle will never be tested . " " Who is Timon ? " " We did not encounter him , Lord . I believe he is touring the southern provinces . But he is magnificent  --  very young , unusually quick-witted and single-minded in his devotion . " Peter paused to greet Stephen . " I was telling the risen Christ about the brilliance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stephen 's agreement was so prompt and complete that it ended the conversation . Christ studied him carefully and found what he sought in the set of Stephen 's jaw . " I 'm off to bed . " Christ looked gratefully again at Stephen 's face . " I know that your efforts here have freed me of further labors , and I 'm not sure what more I can contribute . But in the morning I may find something to occupy me . " Why must Judas always look the same ? The others change with the age and circumstance . Peter 's ugliness can be imposing or endearing , and James 's attractiveness sometimes lies in his glowing darkness and sometimes in his fair transparency . Only Judas never changes . He is forever thin , with eyes that are moist and a large nose damper still . Why could n't he , for once , be squat and swarthy with polished nails ? Or at least without those pores that open like a hundred mouths across his chin ? Or stocky and blond , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly rolled as his umbrella ? Instead , Judas is the man who needs me most and , always , the one I can least help . He comes to me reeking of hopes and desires , and I hear him telling me with every grimace and shrug , every misplaced familiarity and every wince at imaginary wounds , that he comes more as a patient than as a disciple.  | He stands there , daring me to cure him , and he never stops saying , " Hate me , revile me , do n't make me love you by letting me near you . Help me keep my icy bitterness at my heart without your breath to melt it . Help me multiply my hatreds until their taste chokes my throat . " I grant his lesser wish . The love he craves , the love he fears , he does not get from me . I betray Judas as he demands of me . We both know that is our story , no matter how it is later told by men who are blind to love . Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest Jesus had decided to acquire a knowledge of mathematics . " Do you know , " he asked Christ one day , " how many grains of sand it would take to fill up the universe ? " " One . " The Jesus was confused and cross . " No , it would take ten to the hundredth power . That 's one oh oh oh ? " Counting on his fingers , he repeated the " oh " for a full minute . When he had finished , he drew a breath and said , " How could you say one ? " Christ said , " We 'll talk about it when you get back . " The guard stood six or seven inches taller than Jesus , and because Jesus was his prisoner , he looked even taller than that . His chest threatened to burst the seams of his khaki blouse , and his thighs looked swollen too , but healthier and harder . His blond hair had been clipped so short that the top of his head shone as red as his cheeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard nose among his countrymen . " They ca n't help looking like pigs , " Peter had once said to Jesus . " But they can help acting like them . "  | " We will enter here for interrogation . " He pulled Jesus to a halt beside an open door . Although the guard 's inflection was good , Jesus replied , " It may be easier for you if we speak your language . " " As you wish . I would not want you to say later that you had misunderstood what you signed . " " Why would I say that ? " The guard spoke offhandedly . " Men sometimes repudiate the statements they make here . It 's not surprising . There are even men who break their marriage vows . " " My word is good . " " No doubt . " The room had one pine table and two chairs , all uncomfortably low . Seated , Jesus felt as though he were squatting , and the table top was hardly higher than his ankles . " We will fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know you have not had much sleep . " From a drawer in the low table , he brought out a long green form . " Name ? " " Jesus of Nazareth . " Irony glinted like a monocle in the guard 's eye . " I 'm afraid I 'll need your real name . " " That is my name . " " No doubt . But I meant the name you were born with . " " I do n't remember . It 's not significant . " The faint smile faded from the guard 's full mouth . " It may not be significant to the Son of God , " he said harshly . " But for mortals trying to keep accurate prison records , it is essential . " " I 'm sorry . " Jesus spoke contritely as he ransacked his memory . " I keep thinking it was short and guttural , but that was another time . I do n't remember . " " Some of us , less favored by the Almighty , manage nevertheless to remember our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . What you are asking for is little  | different from a play word that a child might make up during an afternoon of pretending . " The guard wrote on the top line , " Jesus , son of Joseph . " He said , " When you put it that way , I ca n't blame you . As you spoke , I tried to remember a name I had used one weekend last month at a hotel in the country . I 've already forgotten . But in other respects that weekend remains very vivid in my mind . " Jesus hoped he would not begin to talk about his success with women ; people often wanted to confide that part of their lives to him . Telling about his adventures , the guard might relax for a moment , but later he would punish Jesus for his own indiscretion . It was to ward off reminiscences that Jesus volunteered , " My age is thirty-five . " " I am two years younger , " the guard answered . " But look how much older I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't feel young . " The guard threw out his chest as though displaying a host of medals . " I do n't mean that I look old . I am talking about bearing and manner , the authority that military command gives to a man . You have none of that . " " I have n't bothered for a long time , " Jesus said . " You end up impressing the wrong people , or yourself . " " There is nothing wrong with standing straight , with squaring your shoulders and planting your two feet solidly on the ground and saying deep from your gut that you are a man . " " I have seen men on their knees as they made the same confession . " " It is a boast . " " We will not agree , " Jesus said mildly . " My occupation ? if you wish to continue with the form  --  was peddling . I sold small items from a handcart . " " While preaching sedition. "  | " Did I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were arrested . Our intelligence office found your efforts laughable . " " Women coming to buy shoelaces or paring knives would ask me questions , and I would answer . Toward the end , they were bringing their children and their husbands . It was bad for business . " Jesus smiled . " I was talking more than I was selling . " " You are a talkative man , after all . " Jesus nodded his head , almost a shrug , and blinked deprecatingly . " I had been silent for years . I see now that during that time I was preparing answers . When people asked me questions , I could reply without a pause . If I had hesitated , they might have lost interest and left . Instead , my answers became a habit for them . They came to depend too much on me . " " What sort of thing did they ask ? " " At the last , they wanted to know if they should turn over strangers to your army in order to save their own husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guard seemed scarcely interested in his story , and Jesus wondered whether that was a method of extracting information  --  to appear indifferent while at the same time making notes to be used at a trial . Except for the guard 's sake , Jesus told himself , I do not care if he has been chosen to betray me . " You hated to make that decision for them , " the guard said sympathetically . " It was n't that . If I had been of any value to them during the previous years , they would never have asked the question . " " That 's right . " The guard sat forward as though playing a card he had almost overlooked . " You 're Jesus of Nazareth . The problems that torment other people are very simple to you . " " Except remembering my name . " Jesus was not ashamed to  | make a joke at his own expense . Peter thought it was an unworthy device , but sometimes it had changed the course of a dispute and brought antagonists into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the guard said . " No . " " So I would not betray my family for a cause or a future reward or even to save strangers across the city . I respect life and I serve my country . But I love only a few people , and I would do anything in the world to protect them . " " They were asking what I would do , not what they should do . " The guard had laid aside his pen . A corner of the interrogation form was wrinkling under his elbow , and Jesus , who loved order , wanted to reach across the table to straighten the paper before it became creased . " That 's a convenient confusion to foster , is n't it ? " the guard was asking . " When the age for preaching passes , switch instead to self-effacement . But the impossible standards remain , the guilt remains . " " Guilt ? " " The guilt you have managed to breed in any man or woman or child fool enough to give you a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised to a level of perfection that has never been matched . You 've found a way to strike at even the best men  --  if they live a blameless life , you condemn them for their thoughts . It was your God that shackled men to their lusts . Then , knowing they could n't change , you came to demand that they free themselves . You examined the nature God gave men and called it base , but you made your complaints to men , not to God . Once you praised the lilies of the field . But if a man manages to live as he has been formed to live , you threaten him with eternal fire . " The length and vehemence of the guard 's outburst astonished Jesus . He was the more disturbed because the man 's  | voice had gradually dropped as he continued . At the end , his scorn seemed to have turned to sorrow . Jesus was not used to men speaking to him with pity in their voices . " Do I hurt you so much ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard took up the paper as though to proceed , but his eyes were not focused on it . " Only what you believe can hurt you , and I have n't believed your lies since I was a boy . " " What made you stop ? " " It became a matter of survival . " The guard had regained enough composure to tilt back on his low chair and stare beyond the doorway as though he could watch his childhood staged again . " I had to make a choice : either you and death or me and life . With the innocence  --  ignorance  --  of a twelveyear-old , I 'd tried to meet your every standard . Of course , one by one I failed your tests . I could n't control my thoughts about the girls on the street . I could n't learn to love all the boys who bullied me . I could not , with my whole heart , believe in your God . At our church , the pastor listened patiently to these confessions . He said that as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried my best to forgive , as long as I believed in God 's existence more than I doubted , then I was following on your path . But I knew better than to compromise . Youth always knows better , and that 's why the young are so unhappy . I knew what you had taught , and I knew how miserably I had failed . I got ready to kill myself . " Jesus said nothing and searched the face of the guard for a boy who had suffered . The guard took his silence for argument . " Do you think I was the first child to hate himself in your name ? If so , you 've succeeded very well in shutting yourself off from the world . " " I 've often been surrounded by children who loved me . " The guard had disturbed Jesus , and he put forward his objection tentatively . " No doubt weak and ordinary children fight for your favor ,  | They want to have the ball thrown out of reach , not so they must jump higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I had thought weak men wanted low standards . " " For them the standard is never low enough . Only a God demanding the impossible can reconcile them to their failings . " " I 've thought of men as men , " Jesus said . " I 've spoken sometimes of distinctions among them , but I believed their similarity outweighed any differences . " The guard smiled ruefully . " You 've lost none of your skill for reaching out carelessly and striking the sorest spot . Of course I have to admit to what you say : I am a man with all the weaknesses that the species has inherited . But my boast is that I am a strong specimen of a weak species , and I found my strength on the day I killed you in my heart . That day I began to let myself live . " " I have heard these arguments advanced by philosophers , " Jesus said , " but unless a man has lived by his philosophy , I 've not been interested . You seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will try to answer you . " " It 's too late . " " For you . Not for me . " The guard looked out to the hall that led to rows of cells . " For you . " " You 're saying that I will die soon ? I knew that before I was brought here . Until you have to turn me over to the killers of your state , let me answer you . " " You have nothing to tell me . " " Let me understand your accusation : I asked more from you than you could give ? I made you feel you had failed in the eyes of God ? If that 's your complaint , you 're not afraid of me . You fear the truth . Certainly you and every other man has failed in the eyes of God . Will you learn to raise yourself above your failure ? Or will you try to blind God by blinding  | yourself ? I would think that for a man  --  since that title pleases you  --  the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even easier than you make it . I broke out of your prison . I , a boy who had hated the world and everything in it , learned to love nature  --  the nature in myself and the nature that surrounded me . " " What does this nature demand of you ? " " I make my own demands . I took a wife and gave her children . I fulfill my duty to my country . Whenever I am drawn to other women I win them honestly and shamelessly . Shamelessly  --  that is a good word , just one of the words you tried to ruin for us . I feed and clothe my family , and I teach the children about the world as it is . Someday I 'll die . But until I do , the palms of my hands , the insides of my ears , the hairs on my belly itch and prickle with life . " Jesus could not boast that kind of vitality , though in patience and strength he surpassed other men . Anyone who felt the blood pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life you 're holding in your palm , " Jesus said , " slips each hour through your fingers . " " Let it go ! At least I do n't clasp my hands in prayer , trying to trap immortality as a child catches butterflies . My fingers have been in many places where I was happy to leave a part of my life . " " If you have found a pattern that suits you , why hate me ? " The guard breathed deeply before he answered . He seemed to take in more air than he exhaled . " Because you still have hold of me by the ankles and the ears . Before my body grew out of your control , you laid your hands on me , and I have never got completely away . I can writhe and twist my trunk ? that part of me I can move freely . But I can never leap as high as I would like because your hands are a chain at my feet . I can never turn my head to see everything around me because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I outgrew you . But I ca n't shake you loose . "  | " I 've interfered with your pleasures ? " The guard clicked at his front teeth with a pencil , a sharp sound in the quiet room . " You would imagine that , no doubt , you poor eunuch . No doubt you 're delighted when you can ruin the natural coupling of a man and woman . That 's not where I feel your touch . You do n't reach between my legs to pinch my pleasure . You interfere with my pain . That 's why I ca n't forgive you . " " I thought I had added to your pain . " For a moment the guard seemed about to start again on the routine questioning . He seemed ready to look at Jesus out of blank eyes and to deny with his efficiency that he had revealed anything of himself . He had almost fallen into that impersonation when he coughed and stretched backward in his chair . " I believe in nothing you teach , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when I die the void will claim me . I know and accept that . But deep in my wretched memory your lying promises have lodged themselves , and as I prepare myself each day for death , your words seduce my arguments . In some weak corner of my brain , I think : Perhaps I will be spared . And all your false hopes flood over me again . Even when I have reached to the bedrock of my being and I am looking into my life as a curator would , sorting and cataloguing fact from my fancy , I find your faith sticking to my fingertips . I ca n't put down your false hopes , and I realize then that you have perverted me in the worst way . You have smeared my truth with your mad faith . " " Why do you say mad ? " " I hate you least when I persuade myself that you 're insane . " Jesus was never candid about his shortcomings . Yet he felt he must say , " Many men have had more powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By the time he answered , the guard spoke as though Jesus were a patient in their joint care . " What first alerted me was  | your prediction that the world would end soon after your death . In those days when I was tormented , I had hoped , even prayed , that the world could be destroyed at the precise moment that I chose to leave it . But when I became happy with my life , all that changed . Now I want people to enjoy this earth forever . I like to think of them lying on river banks , drinking wine all night and making love until the sunrise . I have come to see that through their lives I will live on . Only a madman wants to bring the world down around him . " " It was not my wish . It was God 's will . " " Yet the world did not end . We have learned much in recent years from the Jews about the way men try to make their secret dreams come true . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live despite you , and soon men will live without you . " " You admit your indebtedness to those Jews ? " " They helped me rid myself of you . Our country , after all , has never said that Jews were not clever . " The guard paused . " That was a diversion on your part , was n't it ? That was a way of shifting my attention to a political problem about which I am only slightly concerned and you care nothing at all . You have been restless , I think , since I first mentioned insanity . " Jesus said , " I will tell you all that I know : The prospect of insanity has troubled me more than anything else in my life . At God 's command , I have been set apart from other men . But all the grace I feel , all the glory that passes through me , would be unbearable if I were mad . " He stopped twisting his hands and clasped them to the wooden arms of his low chair . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God could use a madman for my task . Nothing in that choice would be out of keeping with God 's purpose . He could send dwarfs or drunkards . It was God who insisted I practice a humble trade when he could as easily have made me a prince . Surely I could carry out my duties if I were mad . But for me something  | would be lost . I would be dependent on men 's sufferance , and they would give it . Men are kind when it costs them nothing . But I would lose too much . Even when I have failed , I have never shamed God . I 've obeyed his orders to the end , and I have died for God . But I have died sane . To be less than sane , I would be an object . I would be no different from bushes made to burn or loaves made to multiply . " " You are forever out of step with your time , " the guard said less harshly . " In Jerusalem you were killed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane Jew . " " The Romans thought I threatened their government . " " We know better . We know your doctrine is an asset to our state . " " So I am to be killed as a Jew . " Jesus thought of the thousands of men who had preceded him into the death chambers . " Then I have failed . " " Even death must be on your terms ? " " My life follows a formula . In this age of science that 's become hard somehow for men to comprehend . " Jesus felt his legs begin to tremble , as they sometimes did , and he held the soles of his feet squarely to the floor . The next sign was often a tic at the corner of his eye . He began to squint slightly to cover that spasm if it appeared . " There is a pattern for the Messiah that I must match , and men must feel threatened enough by my message to kill me to silence it . Otherwise I am no savior . I become only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own life , dying his own death . " The guard had risen from the table and walked to a barred window . He spoke with his back to Jesus . " A solution exists for you , " he said , turning to look at his prisoner . " You may say that I am trying to trick you for reasons of my own , but that may not be the whole truth . Listen to me . Try to believe that I 'm considering your interests as well as my own . " " You are going to suggest that I claim insanity . " " Why should n't you ? We 're doing several experiments with  | mad prisoners . You would live at least another year or two . In that time you might be able to meet your requirement . " " If I began to help the insane ? " " If your presence jeopardized the work of our scientists , you would have to be killed . " " As a healer . " The guard 's exasperation rose . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . You would be put to death for a specific offense . " " It 's better . " A clutching of skin at the corner of Jesus ' eye was threatening to pull his face into a frown . He stroked the tight spot with his fingertip , hoping he was not drawing attention to his slow deliberate winking . " I 'll admit , " the guard said , " that I would like to see you choose that course . You would be certified insane , and I could die free of you . " " They would not believe that I was mad . " " I have read the gospels carefully . Citing only their evidence , we can show that you are a lunatic  --  erratic in your moods , grandiose in your ambitions . The evidence is persuasive . " Jesus cracked at his knuckles but no sound came . " I might also be persuaded . " The guard bowed . " That would be more than I could ask . " " Because my message was so clear and the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been impatient . That much is true . I still believe that time is short , though the world has lasted many centuries past my expectation . Should the world go on forever , each man has only the same short life , and he needs every second for his salvation . " " You have been more than impatient . You have whipped and roared through the streets in a frenzy . The doctors will study that behavior all the more carefully since you were obsessed with love . "  | " They may invent some medical term for me . " " They need n't invent . The terms exist . For once you will be judged on earth by the standards applied to other men . " Jesus said , " I am not afraid . " The guard ignored him . " You need n't be afraid . You have said men are kind . That is true . They are much kinder than your God . " " I have been baited many times with those sentiments . " " You do accept the possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his light remark , and he was doubling back in the hope Jesus had been serious . " I told you that the possibility has troubled me . I have known the women who heard God urge them to kill their children . I 've known kings and generals who claimed that God ordered their massacres . I 've known too many of God 's cronies and henchmen not to question how different I was . " " You 've convinced yourself that you are different ? " " I speak for God . What those others may persuade themselves in no way compares with what I know . I pity them for their delusions , and I envy them for their freedom to invoke God for their own desires . " " I 'm tempted to take you for a tour of our wards , " the guard replied . " We have a cell filled with men who think they are Jesus Christ . " " Some may be right . God leaves nothing to chance , and as the number of men has grown , so has God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to meet myself here , and when you began to speak so urgently to me , I wondered whether you were a Christ . " His words hit the guard with a force that caused him to slump far down in his chair . He looked afraid . " I have been gentle with you , " he said softly . " The others wanted to beat you to get your true name . They wanted to thrust you in with the senile men and drooling women who think they are children again . Those old skeletons would crawl over your ankles ,  | pleading for candy , running at the nose and calling you Papa . ' The other guards wanted to test the fondness you profess for children and see if your affection extended to old bones starved back to happier days . I spared you that . " " Thank you . " " You owe me nothing . But I must tell you that I will not tolerate more of your contempt . I have given you the reasons I could not remain a Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christ . " " It was a first thought , nothing more . Men seldom care about these questions unless they also have been marked for my task . After you informed me so forcefully of your feelings , I thought my error might amuse you . " " No , " the guard said flatly , " I do n't believe that . You know exactly the kind of pain you can inflict , and you wanted to see if you could hurt me . The answer is yes . That will not save you . " " You made a choice , " Jesus said , " and you claim to be content with it . You must see that your choice and mine are going to be different and that you look as mad to me as you say I look to you . " " I am sane , " the guard said without emphasis . " Sane enough to reject your salvation . " Jesus answered , " I am sane enough to reject your escape . " " You are ready to die as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to die as a savior . " The guard caught him roughly by the arm . " Remember that you are being killed for the accident of your race . In no way is my country punishing you for your delusions . " " I will remember . " " At this moment I hate you enough to kill you myself . " With a tremor of hope , Jesus said , " Shoot me . " " No , I am going to cheat you as you have cheated every man who swallowed your lies . Do you have a last word ? " " No. "  | " I am damned , of course ? " Jesus shook his head . " Surely what I am doing guarantees my damnation ? " Jesus said , " You will be saved . You believe in me , and you will be saved . " " That is your idea of revenge ? " " I can not tell you what you want to hear . You will be saved . " " I do not believe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guard sprang at Jesus and struck him in the face with the butt of his pistol . He lashed three times across the bridge of the prisoner 's nose . As Jesus sank toward the floor , the guard clubbed his skull . He stopped only to wipe the gun across his thigh and rub away the blood that made his fingers slip along the barrel . When he had finished , Jesus lay at his feet . Lunging to the hall , the guard snapped his fingers to bring two young recruits running toward him . " Quickly ! " he shouted when they came panting to his side . " An emergency ! " He pointed to the body spread out on the concrete . " Get him out of here . " " To the hospital ? " one boy asked . " To chamber five , with the prisoners marked for two o'clock . " The guard consulted his wristwatch . " You have only a minute . Hurry ! He wo n't last until three . " " I do n't understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shoulders and was trying to drag him out the door . " It does n't matter if you understand ! " The guard had begun to weep . " Get him to the chamber before he dies . " He beat on the recruit 's arm until the two young men had raised Jesus and stumbled off with his body . " Oh , God , " the guard moaned as he watched their slow progress down the hall . " Do n't let it be too late "  | And when his friends heard of the crowds that pursued him , they went out to seize Jesus , for they said , " He is beside himself . " By which they meant that he had not been so ecstatic when he lived among them in Galilee . By which they meant that his new fame grew from a sickness that made it shameful . Jesus was retching behind a post when the chieftain caught up with him . " That one , " Jesus said , pointing , " bring that boy to me . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five . One of his legs was twisted until his toes spread backward . From his back , a hump grew like a woman 's breast . Jesus did not look at the boy as he passed a hand rapidly over the swollen back and leg . With an exclamation of surprise , the boy y found that he could straighten himself at both places . Saying nothing , he ran to hit a brother who was forever tormenting him . " Thank you . " As the boy had risen , the chief kneeled and used one of the few phrases he knew from the language Jesus spoke . " I do it for myself , " Jesus answered . " Their misery makes me sick . I know I must learn to bear it , as doctors do . But j every time , I feel my stomach turning again , and I give in and heal them . Mine is the cowardly way , and yet how else could I preserve my compassion ? I 'd see the disease and senseless death , and my heart would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , setting bones , passing out pills and prescribing ointments . Since that 's the modern way , I must learn it , What good is love that shrinks from open sores  | and lives on nothing but full and immediate cures ? Without miracles , I will lose my ability to suffer , and yet the price of miracles is becoming too high . " Jesus looked down ironically at the chieftain . " Of course you understand every word , and you 're about to refute my misgivings with all your tribe 's accumulated wisdom . " Bowing lower , the old man rubbed his cheek on Jesus ' boot . More than three hundred men and women had risen before dawn to attend the opening of the tomb . A large boulder covered the mouth of the cave , and John explained , shouting through his cupped hands , that the disciples sometimes had to unroll the rock themselves . Those women who had come as much to see an angel open the tomb as to see the risen Christ were disappointed . But they joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoulders to the rock . Inside , the cave was dark . As the boulder fell away , the crowd surged forward to see what had been revealed . Their force pushed John headlong into the tomb , and he stumbled on the jagged ground where they had laid Jesus thirty-six hours before . " Where is he ? " the men at the back began to call . " Where is the risen Christ ? " " He is here , " someone whispered near the entrance , and everyone was silent , and their silence troubled John more than the corpse at his feet . He knelt on the ground , shielding the body of Jesus from the sunlight entering the cave , and he prayed for a miracle that might confirm the multitude in its faith . " Look ! " cried a man at his elbow . " A flower ! " He pulled from the ground a stalk with a gold stamen thrust out of waxy white petals . Those whose eyes could now see in the gloom of the cave shouted back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sprung up where the blood of Jesus had spilled . " The people , who asked far less from Christ than he had thought he must provide , went home to worship God and fix their Easter dinners . ( Unedited transcript . Read for revision and return to the committee offices . ) CHAIRMAN : We are continuing today with hearings on House Resolution 371 , the bill that would prohibit all scientific experimentation on human reproduction and would provide penalties for interference , through pills , injections , machine rays or other means , with an unborn child 's intelligence , physique or character . BALTH : Out my way , Mr. Chairman , where a lot of good people are very much behind this bill , they 're calling it the Unnatural Act . ( Laughter . ) CHAIRMAN : It 's that kind of approach we 've been able to avoid thus far in these hearings . Our success may account for the limited public interest the first week of our investigation has occasioned . For my own part , I welcome the atmosphere of sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficiently . MELCHIOR : Mr. Chairman , an executive from the Consolidated Broadcasting System has assured me that they will have a representative and full camera crew here tomorrow . CHAIRMAN : Of course our doors will be open to them , as they have been open to any citizen interested in this vital legislation . I will now invite our first witness  | of the day to take his seat at the witness table and to state his name . WITNESS : I am Jesus of Nazareth . CHAIRMAN : I know from past hearings that I would only embarrass our distinguished guest if I began to recount his many honors and achievements . I would like to point out , however , that he has almost invariably placed high in the annual polls of most respected public figures , so his opinions today will undoubtedly reflect the sentiments of the many people who look to him for leadership . MELCHIOR : But he is testifying only for himself . CHAIRMAN : That is his practice , yes . I merely wanted to explain for the record why his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be denied because of the limitations of time . BALTH : I would be interested , Mr. Chairman , in seeing a list of the persons who were denied a chance to be heard . CHAIRMAN : Such a list will be made available to the entire committee . Neither your chairman nor the staff has any wish to suppress dissent . Now let us proceed . Do you have a prepared statement , sir ? WITNESS : I have several preliminary remarks . CHAIRMAN : Please proceed . WITNESS : I have observed , from accounts of last week 's hearings , that you have heard from scientists and lawyers , as well as from a sampling of this nation 's clergymen . They have presented scientific , legal and ethical arguments for and against the proposed legislation . I am neither competent to join their debate nor interested in prolonging it on those levels . I asked to come here today to inform you of God 's will .  | MELCHIOR : Mr. Chairman , you assured us he was speaking only for himself . BALTH : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cite our whole committee for contempt if he starts talking about God again . CHAIRMAN : I must ask the witness , while assuring him of my continued high esteem , to heed the objections of my colleagues . We are most interested in your viewpoint , sir , but there are certain limits we must ask that you respect . WITNESS : May I continue ? CHAIRMAN : Please do . WITNESS : I may state my message simply : God wants man to do whatever he can to improve the lot of his fellows . MELCHIOR : Mr. Chairman ! CHAIRMAN : We will have to amend our transcript to offer that opinion as your own , sir . If you insist on bringing in concepts and phraseology prohibited to this committee , you will only succeed in making a lot of work for our stenographic staff . BALTH : Mr. Chairman , he 's been warned a hundred times . I do n't mind saying that I was opposed to letting him come here again . You remember what happened during our hearing on sex offenders ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our policemen , Mr. Chairman . WITNESS : Considering the nature of those hearings , it might have been worse . ( Laughter . ) BALTH : I do n't think contempt for the law is a laughing matter , Mr. Chairman . I , for one , would like to hear an apology from the witness for his blatant disregard of our rules before we proceed further . CHAIRMAN : It is the view of the chair that our guest did not fully understand the nature of the restrictions im- posed upon his appearance . If there is an apology to be made , I 'll make it now to both the witness and the committee for not bringing more clarity to my exposition of our rules . GASPAR : I would also like to apologize to the committee . I am sorry to have arrived late . But I would like to take this opportunity to say that our chairman is known to be one of the clearest men in our body . MELCHIOR : One might even say one of the most transparent . ( Laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of order . ( Laughter . ) Now to continue : I think we can resolve this impasse if henceforth every time that the witness employs the prohibited terminology , our stenographer immediately substitutes the words " an influential friend of mine " or simply " my friend , " as the context dictates . Is that ac-ceptable ? BALTH : It 'll keep us out of jail , anyway . MELCHIOR : I would prefer use of the word " acquaintance " in place of " friend . " I think the impressive testimony last week from our country 's finest religious leaders of all faiths supports my substitution . CHAIRMAN : They were pretty hard on you . WITNESS : I 've been hard on them . CHAIRMAN : Rather than belabor the matter further , perhaps we could follow the lead of our friends in the television industry and substitute a " bleep " whenever the controversial word is used . Providing , of course , that the arrangement meets with the approval of the witness . WITNESS : I 've accepted cruder compromises than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcript we will use a capital " B. " Will you elaborate now , please ,  | on the brief statement you had made before this lengthy digression . WITNESS : As I understand their testimony , the clergymen who spoke here claimed that to adjust malfunctions in an embryo would be to usurp Bleep 's role . CHAIRMAN : That is correct . WITNESS : They do n't realize that they are according him powers he has never desired . MELCHIOR : Surely the creation of life is not a human prerogative . WITNESS : Not until man learns to do it . GASPAR : May I say , speaking only for myself , that I will be sorry to see the diversity pass out of human life . WITNESS : Which freaks and deviates will you miss ? The hunchbacks ? The harelips ? The imbeciles ? The insane ? The woman with a blue birthmark running from her eyelid to her chin ? The man with testicles hanging to his knees ? GASPAR : Be that as it may , sir , a race of men as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attractive to me . WITNESS : Then you are ready to perpetuate human misery for your own amusement ? That is more than Bleep would ask . CHAIRMAN : He is willing to see men adjust and shape the embryo to a standard mold ? WITNESS : He welcomes it . Were the job not so tedious , he might have performed it himself . BALTH : Some of us , who are a little bit skeptical of just how authoritatively this witness can speak for any outside power , believe that if men were all supposed to be the same , that 's the way they 'd have been created . ( Applause. )  | WITNESS : Do members of this committee and this audience still use words like " created " ? I thought I had been able at least to clear up that confusion . Man is an accident . While Bleep has assumed some responsibility , his capacity for attention and his interest in Earth are not great . MELCHIOR : That 's blasphemy , Mr. Chairman . WITNESS : I would like to ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no objection . CHAIRMAN : PIoceed . WITNESS : Do you have children ? MELCHIOR : I do . WITNESS : What are their ages ? MELCHIOR : I have a son twenty-eight years old and a daughter twenty-three . WITNESS : Do they live at home ? MELCHIOR : No , they are both married . The boy is a chemist on the West Coast . The girl lives here in town . WITNESS : Do you hear from them often ? MELCHIOR : Fairly often . Twice a week from our daughter . My son calls long-distance about once a month . WITNESS : Always to ask for something ? MELCHIOR : Not at all . To find out how my wife and I are feeling and send his best wishes . WITNESS : What would you think if every time he called he asked for money ? MELCHIOR : He would n't . That 's not the way he was brought up . WITNESS : Y011 would see his dependence as not only unbecoming but as a reflection on you ? MELCHIOR : Certainly . WITNESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bleep 's . He is tired of hearing nothing from men but requests and appeals . If mankind starts  | to solve its own problems more efficiently , Bleep will consider that achievement the most satisfactory form of worship . There is also the other aspect that I mentioned  --  that he had not wanted man in the first place . To approximate Bleep 's frame of mind , you 'd have to imagine that you had not wanted your son  --  that he was conceived accidentally and has led to nothing but marriage and other irritations . MELCHIOR : Mr. Chairman , I regard that as a slur on my wife and family . WITNESS : I ask you to imagine such a situation , not confess to it . CHAIRMAN : I think we 'll move away from personalities , if you please . GASPAR : I have a question for the witness . Surely Bleep demands that we believe in his existence ? WITNESS : Let me set a parallel for you . Picture yourself an extremely wealthy man . GASPAR : A millionaire ? WITNESS : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ask : Would you prefer that aborigines of the Out Back had never heard of you and doubted your existence ? Or that they flooded your office with requests for money ? GASPAR : I WITNESS : I have known wealthy men , and they wanted above all to be left alone . Even the most generous of them hired someone else to dispose of their money . They found something unbecoming about sending off a donation to everyone who asked for one . GASPAR : I can see that it would make them feel like cows , only good for milking .  | WITNESS : Bleep long ago gave up hying to keep track of individual men . If a man has truly distinguished himself in some way , I have tried occasionally to bring him to Bleep 's attention . But I have had trouble explaining why some of your artists are more esteemed than others . And he has never understood the loathing inspired by the losing generals in your wars . Often , before one of these interviews , Bleep asks absently whether man is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant that he does it to bait me , but you can see that questions of that sort disrupt any serious discussion . GASPAR : But he must want to know that men believe in him . WITNESS : How would you react if I told you I did not believe that you existed ? ( Laughter . ) GASPAR : I 'd think you were crazy . ( Laughter ; applause . ) WITNESS : Would you curse me or try to scourge me ? GASPAR : I 'd feel sorry for you . WITNESS : Yes . CHAIRMAN : We are straying from the topic . The witness was assuring us that no repercussions would be felt if man began to assume responsibilities that hitherto have not been his . WITNESS : None at all . I think we would all hope that man would improve on Bleep 's handiwork . That should not be hard . I have often taxed Bleep with some oddity in man 's physique or psychology , only to have him shrug and say , " I 'm not a doctor or a sculptor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let them work out their own details . " CHAIRMAN : Has he ever given hints as to improvements he would welcome ?  | WITNESS : I do n't think it 's possible to exaggerate his indifference . Oh , on one occasion I heard him comment on man 's unimaginative use of time . CHAIRMAN : Could you explain ? WITNESS : He seems to find man 's insistence on the present a little stifling , a little dull . He 's complained once or twice that men could live more sensibly if they would give up their dependence on sequential time . CHAIRMAN : Live in the past and future at once ? WITNESS : Alternate . I know for a fact that he thinks a foretaste of age and pain would heighten the pleasures of youth . I 've told him he 's wrong . He does n't appreciate the human mania for ignorance . CHAIRMAN : None of our scientists ' experiments so far have permitted us to hope for such mastery of time . WITNESS : You asked what he had spoken about . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAIRMAN : However , we can now change skin color , hair color , eye color , sex , height , weight and the intelligence level of the unborn . Would there be objection to that ? WITNESS : What color is a housefly ? CHAIRMAN : Transparent on the wings , I think  --  green and black on the body . A little red , and some iridesi cent patches , as I recall . WITNESS : ' What if I told you that there are fifty-four different colors and combinations of houseflies ? CHAIRMAN : I 'd be interested . WITNESS : Overwhelmingly interested ? CHAIRMAN : Mildly interested . WITNESS : What if I told you that the flies were able to control those combinations and would begin shortly to produce flies that were more attractive  | to other flies or better adapted to their environment ? Would you feel betrayed or cheated by those changes ? BALTH : Mr. Chairman , is the witness implying that Bleep 's interest in mankind is the same as man 's interest in the common housefly ? WITNESS : Much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record that the credibility of the witness has been very much undercut by the tenor of his remarks today . GASPAR : I do think the witness should know that the sponsors of the bill , testifying last week , left us with the impression that Bleep 's wrath would be great indeed if we permitted the kind of adjustment and control our scientists have made available to us . WITNESS : What form would this wrath take ? GASPAR : They did n't specify . WITNESS : Famine ? Floods ? Fire ? Plagues ? CHAIRMAN : This is not exactly in your domain , but I worry about another aspect : Which of us is intelligent and decent enough to supervise these experi-ments ? WITNESS : If such a superior man existed , your scientists would not have had to work so long to allow you to create him . They have given you tools . Now you can breed the kind of men you wish you were . CHAIRMAN : There are a dozen more questions we could explore today , but our time is running short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise a final point with the witness , one that I take up with apprehension . What will be the result of our experiments , if they are successful , on your work ?  | WITNESS : On my mission ? CHAIRMAN : I can foresee a time when men will come to believe your stories of Bleep 's indifference . When they reach that point , will you be able to bridge so enormous a gap for them ? WITNESS : I am urging men to improve themselves so they might interest Bleep without my intervention . CHAIRMAN : IS that possible ? WITNESS : ' When man has learned to control his world , when he can ring up the dawn and bring out the stars , when he can inject life instead of only extracting it , when he has found the way to harness time and make it do his bidding , when he has learned to control his world and himself , then Bleep may not find man 's presence insufferable . CHAIRMAN : But what need would such men have for Bleep ? MELCHIOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to point out that it 's lunchtime , Mr. Chairman . BALTH : I would remind my esteemed colleagues that these hearings have not been concluded . Tomorrow we will be privileged to hear from one of my most distinguished constituents , an internationally esteemed man of Bleep , who assures me he can refute everything said here today . MELCHIOR : I , for one , look forward to hearing a more balanced presentation . CHAIRMAN : As I have said so often , this committee wants to hear all sides of an issue before we pass on the legislation . WITNESS : There is only one side , and I have presented it . MELCHIOR : May I move , Mr. Chairman , that today 's hearing be adjourned ? BALTH : I second the motion . CHAIRMAN : The hearings stand adjourned . I would like to invite the witness to join the committee members and staff in our cafeteria for luncheon . A. J. LANGGUTH 12 5 WITNESS : Thank you , but I 'm due across the corridor in ten minutes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , Jesus saw a boy about sixteen being pushed into the square . His eyes had rolled upward with fright until their whites pleaded blankly for his life . " What was his crime ? " Jesus asked a priest . " He cut the head off a crucifix . " The man was sour with sweat . Turning from Jesus he shouted , " Death ! Death now ! " The rest happened rapidly , and only the cries of the crowd , which saw with one quick eye , told Jesus that the punishment had been performed . At the end , he could make out a head being pulled up from the boy 's neck , pulled higher until the body fell backward and the bloody head swung free in a soldier 's fist . " Hurrah ! " the crowd 's voice cried . " Death to the Christ-killer ! " The body was thrown into a fire , where it roasted slowly . In the boy 's coat pocket the soldiers had discovered a book by the cleverest man of the age . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read too much , " the priest said to Jesus , when the crowd 's eye closed and each man regained his sight . " Was that a Bible in his pocket ? " Jesus knew it was not . " Of course not . " The priest 's indignation had been spent and he answered listlessly . " Who has ever been corrupted by the Bible ? " They sat across from each other at a small table , separated only by noise and smoke . " Do you come here often ? " Pilate asked .  | They had been drinking for more than three hours , and Jesus ' voice was strained . " Oh , once in a while . " " It 's a very stimulating atmosphere , " Pilate said for the second time . The music had begun again , all brass and electronic strings . Jesus said , " What ? " " I 'm glad we came here . " " Good place . " Jesus nodded with finality . " I come here all the time . " " Expensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not cheap . " Jesus looked hurt and confused . " It 's not cheap . " " That 's what I said . " " The noise . " Jesus felt his head spin and a fissure open at the back of his skull . He rarely drank . " You know , " he said , " I 'm a good man . " " Yes , " Pilate answered , not quite a question . " Nothing has touched my spirit . It 's pure . Even with all this , even after so many times , I have n't changed . I ca n't change . " " That 's good . " " It 's not good . " Jesus pushed his empty glass to the edge of the table . " It 's not bad . It 's the way it is , not good , not bad . " A waiter brought them each another drink . Had he looked first to Pilate with a cocked eyebrow ? Had Pilate nodded before Jesus could be served ? Jesus could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have within me , " Jesus said , " unsullied purity that speaks to every man . By accepting all wounds I have kept myself unscathed . By assuming all burdens I have never been fettered . " " Is that so ? " " Are you telling me to be quiet ? " " Not at all . " Pilate was confident enough to withstand in- quiring or amused looks from the other tables . But since he was not interested in drunken boasts , he tried to look selfconscious . " The music has stopped . We do n't want to disturb these other people . " " Sure ! Sure we do ! We want to wake them up . Right now ! We want them to hear about me . About my purity . We want them to envy me and see that they can never be as pure as I am . " " Why ? " " They 've got to be unhappy . " Jesus banged his glass . " They 've got to be miserable that they ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It helps . " Jesus screwed up his face cannily . " It helps . " " Would n't they be helped more by being left alone ? " Jesus rolled the bottom of his pure silk tie with surprisingly steady fingers . " I mean , it helps me . " In unison now , who is the son of God ? You are . Once again and louder . YOU ARE ! And how do you know ? YOU TOLD US SO ! Class dismissed . Some Saturday afternoons Pilate came to see him at the headquarters . Until they had moved in precinct maps and campaign literature , the building had been a supermarket with a large rear entrance and an acre of parking space . Pilate left his car there and came in the back way . Jesus worked in the cubicle nearest the alley entrance and no one saw Pilate  | enter or leave . It was an arrangement that suited both of them . Jesus had been interviewing applicants all day , and he looked up gratefully when Pilate entered . He could justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that his official reasons , all impeccable , were not the true ones . " I passed one of your workers as I came in , " Pilate said as greeting . " Ca n't they learn to breathe through their noses ? " " His mouth was open ? " " Any slacker and he 'd need a hinge . Where do you find them ? " " One man tells another . We get more applicants than we can use . I 'd thought of advertising , but it 's expensive and we 're short of money . Unless you 'd like to volunteer space in your papers ? " " Only on the comic page . " " We had ten applicants today for one job . You saw the last one . " " It 's your fault for insisting on workingmen . I say you should get more professional people . " " The last fellow you recommended called himself an administrative assistant . " Pilate managed to look urbanely discomfited . " He 'd have done you more good than the abalone fisherman you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably . " " What do you look for when you interview them ? Besides infinite credulity ? " Jesus leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes . " What do I look for or what do I get ? " " Both . " " I look for intelligent , resourceful , decent , sensitive young men with agreeable manners and the ability to amuse me . " " What do you get ? "  | " Believers . Because they 're the ones who can do the job . The others would be more pleasant around here , but we 'd end up with a social club . So I get neurotic , angry , resentful , impatient , abrasive crackpots and cranks . That 's why we have to talk so much about love . I can soften a tough man more easily than I can toughen a soft one . " Pilate picked at the crease in his pin-striped trousers . " Why ca n't they be a little brighter ? " " Intelligence would be a handicap . You 've pointed that out often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's because I had n't gone through a day like this one . " " You 're finally admitting that your enterprise is built on sham ? " Jesus began weeding his mail , tossing most letters into the green wastebasket beside his desk . " No , it has n't been that bad . But I 've never ranked intelligence at the top of human virtues . You only need intelligence when you do n't have faith , and even then it 's not enough . I get exasperated with my men , but they 're the best I can find . You , for example , would n't do . " " I 'm not looking for work . " " Good . " " All of your men are n't the same , though . You must have different requirements for different jobs . Simon Peter is not Philip , after all . " " That 's right . I look for complementary traits , strengths to balance weaknesses . By now I have a pretty fair idea of what we need . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today I need to talk , but I can not be frank with Pilate . He will find a way to betray me , and that job is already taken . " Peter ? " " Yes . " The true administrative assistant , though he would have sense enough to shun the title . A man loyal to me as the head  | of a business but eager in his heart to step in and take charge . Enough polish to be able to work with other men and win over the skeptical . I pick an older man each time . For the reassurance my earthly family did not give me ? That would be the popular opinion and so , probably wrong . Because I exert my authority more fully in front of the others by giving orders to a man twenty years my senior ? Or simply because the kind of competence I need is acquired only through age ? " Peter must be sensible and loyal , " Jesus said . " I once called him my rock . " " Because he was strong or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew Peter , you would not have to ask . " Your questions show the gulf that separates us . I 'll never learn to think so subtly . " " If you did n't purport to be the Son of God , I 'd make a rude remark . " " Ask about Andrew . He 's easier to explain . " " What about him ? " Good sense dictates that one of the men be a brute , and the fact that he is Simon 's brother gives me a measure of control over him . When the local residents have seen too much of John or Thaddaeus , I parade Andrew past them to ease their minds . " He 's forthright and practical , the kind of man you 'd put in charge of each of your departments if you could get enough of them . I 'm lucky to find one . " " You inherit him through his brother . He 'd never come to you on his own . " You 're right . " You 're wrong . " " Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Stupid . " Cautious . " " John ? "  | Ah , John . My mother loves herself through me . The other men love the God I can sometimes reveal to them . But John loves me , and if I do n't return his love , it may be that I find it too important to give up . " John has the insights of a tender nature . " " he does you no good . " " No ? " " People do n't like him . They find him queer . " Queer . A good , shriveled word . I find John queer too , but the word is not a curse to me . I use his queerness , as I use Peter 's gift for leadership or Matthew 's penchant for taking notes on every trivial conversation . I see a longing in John 's eyes that has nothing to do with mansions in heaven . I pretend to miss his meaning , and I talk with greater force about salvation , and I watch his longing grow until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing after all . If John asked me to cure him , I could . But he would get to heaven no faster , and we might both regret the queerless path he had chosen . " I 've never seen anything like that . " " I do n't mean he 's guilty of any offense . It 's his manner . " " He 's dedicated . " Pilate seemed to regret his criticism . " I 'm sure he 's fine in his own way . He makes me feel uncomfortable , that 's all . " " That 's part of our job . We 're supposed to make you uncomfortable . Do n't I ? " " No , you do n't . " As he stood , Pilate drummed his fingers on the edge of Jesus ' desk . " Quite the contrary . I leave here feeling very good . " He was a man keen for every truth but happy ones . With effort he said , " I 'm glad you let me come . " " I keep expecting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've endorsed me . " " You know there 's no chance of that . " Jesus took the hand Pilate extended . " I deal in hope , " he said . " I have supplies you ca n't exhaust . "  | " Good-bye , " Pilate said . " Forget what I told you about John . " " What could you tell me about John ? " When , equally perfect , he was passed over yet again , Jesus murmured , " Lama sabachtani . " After so long a time , he found the Aramaic words came readily to his tongue . " And ? " " The conjunction , " Jesus explained to Mark . " It 's a word that 's taken each of the unconnected events in my life and joined them and given them direction . At those times that I 've lost sight of my goal , I have had to be grateful for and . ' " " And that 's why when I asked you what you thought was the most beautiful word in the language , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem odd , " Pilate asked , " that none of your disciples came from the ranks of men you healed ? Of those you cured of blindness , lameness , of those you brought to life again , none of them chose to join you . Does n't that seem odd ? " " It seems odd that it seems odd to you , " Jesus replied . " You 're renowned for your cynicism . " Pilate thought for a moment and said , " I understand . " " None of the men I cured betrayed me . If you 're looking for an oddity , explain that . " " I do n't understand everything , " Pilate said . He sat as though musing , to delay the moment that he had to summon  | the elders and deliver his verdict . " I 'm not cynical enough to understand everything . " " Heal me ! " the old cripple called . ? WhY ? " ? " Because I can not walk . I can not work . I must beg money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to work ? " " I hated it . " " But you hate begging more ? " " I can go on begging after you heal me . No one has to know that I can walk . " " Then why do you ask to be healed ? " " For the afterlife , " the cripple said . " I do n't want to be maimed for eternity . " You support me in my lies , Jesus thought . I will not complain about yours . He said , " Get up . " The cripple looked down the street . " Is anyone watching ? " " No , " said Jesus , " no one . " Mail was delivered to his block very late in the day . Jesus blamed the large number of widows who lived on all sides of him in small houses and shabby apartment buildings . The sight of the mailman was the day 's highlight for them , and they lay in wait in their hallways to trap him for a few words when he arrived with bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found himself sitting on the porch and waiting as impatiently as the widows for the mailman 's appearance . It was his second of three chances to hear God . He had already paced along the sea before dawn to listen to the roll of the waves . Then he hurried back to his doorstep to overhear scraps of talk from the women who had  | snared the postman . He vaguely recalled that once his instructions had come coded in one of their chance remarks , and he had no better plan than to wait again and listen . The third chance came each night after his street was quiet and he could walk along the pavement , looking down at the cracks or up at the sky . I do not mind this watching and waiting now , he said to God . But I would not like to wear these frayed and gritty trousers when I am forty . Then I do n't want to walk this street every day still trying to learn your plan for me . I want to be dead by forty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , words , setting sixty as his limit . When they did bury him many years later , he was wearing trousers that were frayed but clean . The widows , who had hoped toward the end that he might marry one of them , remarked fondly on how faithful he had been about taking his exercise . Jesus was sitting by the window of his room when , without knocking , Thomas burst upon him . " It 's not true , is it , Lord ? " An ache in his legs had kept Jesus awake all night . Before midnight he had begun taking the medicine that helped him ignore pain , and the bottle was nearly empty . He looked through the window to the point where he had seen Thomas on the road a minute ago . Could Thomas be here ? Was this the Thomas he had seen outside only two beats of his pulse ago ? Or were there Thomases to walk in the road and Thomases to rush through doors and Thomases to shout distraught questions ? " We are all so worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking more deliberately . " They want me to learn from you that it is not true . "  | " What ? " Jesus asked . He was distantly aware that he had asked a question . He thought he might have asked the Thomas that stood before him which Thomas he was . " That you have sold your soul to the Devil . " Thomas was a young man , round at the hips , a purveyor of gossip ; for all of that , an upright man in what he did for his wife and children . " We have heard that since God no longer speaks to you , you have turned against him and will try to lead us into evil . " Jesus had not heard the question , but he answered , " No . " Something told him that Thomas was expecting the answer , Yes . Instead , he said , " No , " and braced himself to meet Thomas ' protest . He could feel a wave of disappointment pouring from the young disciple , who had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forgive me , " Thomas said . " I should not even have asked . " Jesus missed the words but heard the disappointment . He pulled his mind in focus that he might end their interview coherently . " I hope , " Jesus said , trying to sound kindly , " that the others wo n't be as sorry as you are . " He watched Thomas backing through the door , Thomas watching him with horror , or contempt , or was it nothing but fresh disappointment ? The picture troubled Jesus for a moment until he saw the real Thomas appear safely again on the road below the window . The shape of this Thomas swelled up at the head and shrank at the shoulders as Jesus watched him through the bottom of his bottle . A headline read , " Mortuary Finds Dead ' Woman Alive . " Jesus quickly turned the page . He read the newspaper less attentively than usual , folded it back into shape and carried it to the incinerator . He had a match lit before he relented  | and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about an old woman returning to life . Doctors from the city 's health department explained that no heartbeat had been heard when the woman had been pronounced dead . " A person can pass into a state of deep syncope , and the appearance and condition of the patient can simulate death very closely , " one doctor was quoted as saying . Jesus replaced the paper in the burner and struck another match . Now they call it syncope . One name is as good as another . Let them use any scientific word they like . Let them try to explain away with new words what they can never understand . When they take refuge in syncopes and simulation , they admit that I did more than they can dream of doing . Nothing any man can do could jeopardize me . I am not man and not confined by his successes . Let them bring a thousand old women back to life with needles and shocks . That is nothing compared to one resurrection through faith . They will find that faith begins where their science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit a dozen matches before he got the paper burning . Jesus had begun to dream every night . He resented dreaming , and he refused the next morning to remember messages that had come to him , not from God but from a part of himself that had nothing to tell him . I will not beg . Whatever you ask , I will do . But you must ask . Too many men have wept away their lives praying for a small sign from you . When your will was carved into my flesh , I despised their tears and their despair . I knew that I  | might fail you but that you could not fail me . The worst of my lives promised me nothing less than perfect faith . For what you then gave freely , I will not beg you now . Neither your commandments nor the nature of the world has changed . You need me no more nor less than the first time or the last . To shame the proud men , I have been meek . To you alone , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used your name on Earth . I have invoked your power until men mistook me for the God I came to glorify . Their praise filled my ears but it never touched my heart . I learned to turn their worship back to you , and I moved forward without tripping on the bodies at my feet . My humility was perfect and , if your trust in me had continued , I could have kept my head bowed through eternity . But remember : You taught me to assume God 's bearing . Remember : You forced me to speak with God 's voice . If you withdraw your grace from me , I have light to lift your shadow from the earth . It is my light , God . I will not beg for another chance to be your dim reflection . " Have you heard today ? " " Nathanael , I will tell you when I have heard . " " How long has it been since God spoke to you ? " " I do n't keep count . A long time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For you , and for ourselves . " " Cheer up . " " I feel so bad . I would do anything I could to make God speak . " " No one makes God speak . He does not respond to threats . "  | " Have you tried ? " " What ? Warnings that I would shame him , repudiate him , ignore him ? " " He must learn that you will not wait forever . " " Unless he knows already that I will . " " We are all to wait ? To go on with our prayers unanswered through another dozen lifetimes ? We can not . " " You sound mutinous , Nathanael , you who are so patient in everything else . " " Nothing else matters . " " Other things must begin to matter for you . " " James says you told him to get a hobby . " " He has a sharp tongue . I was not so fatuous . " " After God , any interest is a hobby . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are n't ? You 're not saying that ? " " Not yet . " Joseph had died when Jesus was nineteen . Telling his story to an alienist , Jesus mentioned the simple burial his family had arranged . The doctor 's interest , which had been simmering , flared . " You were nine , you say ? " " Nineteen . " The doctor allowed the corners of his eyelids to droop . " For a minute , I thought we had something . " Once : " He 's only drunk , " Jesus told the widow of Lazarus angrily . " You can tell  --  look at all these bottles . It 's too much wine . " " Oh ! " she moaned , her head covered with the black scarf  | she wore on Sundays . " Oh ! He 's dead ! He 's dead ! You can bring him back to life . Doctor , save him ! " Jesus had been dragged by the arm down the dirt road . He was heavy in the belly and not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was puffing . From his bag he brought out a vial with an odor so sharp that his own nostrils burned when he pulled its cork . He shoved the tube under Lazarus ' nose and kept one hand on his pulse . The drunken man stirred to pull his face away from the spirits . Deep in his throat he coughed a protest . " You see , he lives . Your husband will recover . " She knelt before him , but he pulled her roughly to her feet . " None of that . " " Oh , Doctor , tell me how I can repay you ? What can I give you for this miracle ? " " I had no patients . There will be no fee . But do not use that word again . " " Why ? ? " ? " There are no miracles  --  only knowledge and hard work . " " Doctor , " the woman said , " I was wrong . You are the amazement . You are the true son of ? " She paused for prompting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , " she repeated reverently . When Paul held open his arms , Jesus moved forward with the rest of the audience . Monitors were watching every row , and Jesus thought he would be less noticeable moving with the crowd . He drifted with the other men and women down the concrete steps and across the green turf of the playing field . He had been sitting far back in the stadium . By the time he reached the platform , the pledging ceremony was nearly over .  | From his height , Paul looked down sharply at him , glanced away , looked back and stared at the top of Jesus ' bowed head . He murmured something to an attendant and soon the man was at Jesus ' side . " Paul of Tarsus would like to see you , " the man said , " when the others leave . " " I ca n't stay . " The man was fleshy , but he looked desperate enough to be dangerous . " You must talk with him . He 's been waiting for you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll go to that trailer behind the platform for his dinner . " " I 'll join him . " " Thank you , " the man said before he hurried back to Paul 's side . " Thank you . " Jesus walked as slowly as he could to the trailer 's door . The way was blocked by a tall man with a beaked nose . " No admittance , " he said . " All right . " Jesus turned away , but Paul had reached them , and he pulled Jesus into the trailer . The beak-nosed man and another , bigger man began to lift Paul out of his dark blue suit . Jesus could see that sweat had turned its white lining yellow . He had read once that Paul wore his suits three times , then threw them out . The men pulled off Paul 's underwear and rubbed him with a long white towel . When Paul was dry , the second man brought out a monogrammed red silk robe and draped it around Paul 's big sturdy body . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes . " " Did you see the empty chair on the platform ? I told you that was for you . " " I liked sitting at the back . I could see better . Up there the lights are so strong . "  | " They are very strong . " Peter rubbed at his blond curls with the long towel . " That 's the reason for those suits . Anything cheaper rots away . " " Yes . " " You do n't believe me . You think I like luxury too much . " " You work very hard . " " That 's right . " Was Paul becoming angry ? Jesus thought he was ; he always did . " I work hard every day , every week . I 've worked for years . For you . " " I know . " " Did you watch them tonight ? Did you see them change ? It 's that way every time . They come as forty thousand lost beings , and I meld them and join them into one throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You have a gift . " " That 's right , " Paul said again . " I have a gift . " The men brought in a large beefsteak , a flagon of red wine and two plates and glasses . Jesus pushed his away , and Paul began to drink . He had finished half the steak when the man who had asked Jesus to come appeared at the door with a small card which he set before Paul . Paul read the amount aloud to Jesus . " That 's the largest sum ever collected in this country , " Paul said . " Only three times have we gotten more , and never from a crowd that size . They were moved , if you were n't . " " I wanted to see you . " " To go back and tell the others how gross I 've become ? Is that why you came ? To shame me ? To leave me filled with doubt ? " Flee , Jesus ' heart told him . Flee before you bury his small doubts under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eyes . " What do I do wrong ? " " Nothing , " Jesus said mildly . " I do n't want to disappoint you .  | " You already disappoint me . " Heat from his rising anger had dried his tears . " You are the disappointment of my life . I 've told a thousand stories about you  --  about fire banked in ashes , glory hidden in human form . And now you give me ? " " Only the ashes , only the poor body . " " I do n't mind that . " Wine had left stains on the polished surfaces of his teeth . " I have fire enough for both of us . I can restore your visions and make you live for others as you will no longer live for yourself . " " I ca n't help you . I came to tell you . " " Then do n't hurt me . " " I do n't want to hurt you . " " When I look into your eyes , let me see more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I thought you had fallen beneath me , " Paul said , " my heart would break but I could go on . " " Think that . " " I see you rising above me and you wo n't show me the way to your side . I can only follow the God you were . You wo n't let me near the man you 've become . " " Follow God . " Paul 's handsome face was heavy . " I want to follow you . " Jesus walked out of the trailer and onto the playing field , where the grass was already moist beneath his feet . Royalties from his book had permitted Matthew to buy a suit of Scotch tweed and English tailoring . Peter braced himself for a scene when Jesus first encountered Matthew and his new suit on the street . Instead , Jesus complimented its close weave and fine workmanship . As they walked on , Jesus remarked that since Matthew 's position demanded a good appearance , he might as well buy durable clothes . And Peter  | reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose . " Doubt is the leavening that makes faith rise , " one disciple said . Then they all joined in : " Doubt is the alloy that makes faith endure . " " Doubt is the shadow faith casts at men 's feet . " " Doubt is the blemish that makes faith 's beauty endurable . " Jesus composed his own versions and posted them on the bulletin board in the hall : Doubt is the coffee break in faith 's routine . Doubt is the black root of an angel 's blond faith . Doubt is the knot in faith 's muscle and the cramp from faith 's plenty . Doubt is the runt in faith 's litter . Doubt is the one reward faith can ever offer . The disciples read his note with dismay . Jesus gave no thought to the Devil . He had found that when God withdrew , all temptation ended .

We should go . " Mary 's face was composed and gentle . " No , we 're going to stay and answer her questions . Maggie 's not going to die without the answers she deserves . We 're going to do that for her . " He saw that he could not bring himself to leave alone . " All right . " " Maggie , listen to Jesus . Is our friend here going to heaven soon ? Will all her suffering be ended ? Will she dwell forever in the house of the Lord ? " " Yes , " Jesus said . The eyes in the face did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Mary spoke again , swaying to the cadence of her own soft voice . " Will we all be united once more in the mansions of heaven ? Will we find together the peace that has escaped us on earth ? Will we be ushered into the presence of God our father ? " " Yes . " " And all our doubts will be forgotten , and all our despair will be forgotten , and death will never be able to touch us again ? " Jesus looked to the bed where the dyes were open but the chest was still . " She 's dead . " " Will the beauty of God 's love fill our souls ? " Mary reached forward to lower the girl 's eyelids . " Will the joy of knowing God make all the misery of our lives look insignificant ? Will God 's glory at last make each of us glorious ? " She was still talking when Jesus went out the door . James came to say , " Do n't feel that you 've let us down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " You ? " Jesus was too puzzled to watch his words . " What does it have to do with you ? " Jesus overheard the apostles speaking again of the mystery of life . The phrase annoyed him , and he demanded that they produce a list of the elements that made up that mystery . Andrew came dutifully to him the next day with a single typewritten page . What is life ? Why do men live ? What is love ? Is love good for men or bad ? Why is incest attractive ? Why is incest forbidden ? Have we lived before ? Will we live again ? Why does every man hope to fail , suffer and die ? Why does every man fight to dominate , inflict pain and live ? Jesus counted . " Ten ? " he asked . " Can your fabled mystery be reduced to ten simple questions ? " " Simon wanted to know why certain sounds and certain sights please us and others sicken us , " Andrew said . " We thought that was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble you with . John wanted to know why he grits his teeth when he strokes his favorite cat . Those were the only things we eliminated . " " Who is obsessed with incest ? " Jesus asked . " Your brother , Lord . He thinks many other questions would be unnecessary if those two were answered honestly . " " There 's nothing personal in his interest ? " Andrew kept his eyes on the list and refused to smile .  | " You 'd have to ask him , Lord . We agreed to put in his questions because nobody wanted to have to argue against them . " Jesus folded the paper twice and slipped it into the top drawer of his desk . " From now on , when we talk about life , let us address ourselves to one of these questions . Do n't you agree , Andrew ? We need n't waste any more time with beautiful evasions like mystery . ' " " Yes , Lord . " Jesus was about to return to his work when an oversight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it through again . " You do n't ask if there is a God . " He was delighted to see Andrew begin to blush . " We thought it was n't a good time to raise all that , " he said wretchedly . " We thought if you knew , you would have told us before this . " " You do me no favor , Andrew , " Jesus said , " holding back the one true question . Here ? " he threw the list over the desk top ? " I am proving that men want to be hurt . Hurt me . At the top of the page , Andrew wrote in a haphazard scribble that made the typewritten words look false and faraway , " Is there a God ? " He pushed the list back to Jesus . " The answer to your last question  --  which has become your first question  --  is no , " Jesus said . " You 'll forgive me if I do n't want to plunge immediately into something so timely and vital as why a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Lord . " The pain Jesus was causing Andrew showed in his face . " We 'll take up the rest of them again , " Jesus said , replacing the list in his drawer . " I may even produce a different answer to the question we have already settled . " " When one answer does n't satisfy a man , Lord , " Andrew said timidly , " he searches for another . That 's science . " " That 's hypocrisy . " Jesus turned away so Andrew would leave . " But I 've not shut hypocrisy out of my life , and we  | may as well not trouble our friends with the answer to a question they did n't ask . " " You can trust me , Lord . " The look Jesus gave him sent Andrew hurrying from the room . Jesus ! Who is it ? It 's God , Jesus . Listen to me . It 's not God . It 's one of my own voices . Believe me . It 's a voice I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled me too often . Trust me . I will trust you as my own voice . You have as much right to speak as any of my other voices . Trust me as God . No . This is your last chance . You 've said that before . I might believe you if you did n't always come back . Good-bye , Jesus . You did n't fool me . A heavy dark man hung back in the doorway . " Can I come in ? " " Who are you ? " Jesus asked . " I am Barabbas . " " What can you want with me ? " " Things have gone very badly with me , Jesus . I have come to ask for your help . "  | " Flow ? " " As you know , whenever you have been killed , I was spared . When men wanted to revenge themselves on you , they set me free . " " Man is easily distracted , " Jesus said . " But I got the benefit . As long as men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man raised his hand . He was only scratching his head , and Jesus was glad he had not flinched . " Without your distractions , they are judging me very harshly . Faithless rulers do n't free me to spite you . And the reverent men who once unchained me as testimony to their beliefs no longer rule governments . I am forever being imprisoned , tortured , even fined . " " And you blame me ? " " If you would bring divine law to men again , they 'd be less strict in enforcing their own . I speak for all criminals , Jesus . Bring us mercy in place of justice . " " I thought judges had come to understand that your crimes were not of your choosing . I thought they ruled that you had been marked at birth to be criminals . " " Some men accept that defense , " the man said bitterly . " But I 'd rather rot in jail than admit I was compelled to be a thief . I did not cast God from my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be guilty by free choice and freed by happen-stance ? " " That was the pattern when you were teaching them to persecute the innocent . " Jesus spoke sharply . " Barabbas is being hanged today in the capital . Who are you ? " The man faltered . " I am Dismas . How did you know ? " " You limp . Barabbas has lurched and crouched , but he 's never limped . " " Forgive me . " " My friends sent you ? Peter ? James ? " The man nodded .  | " Tell them their sophistry is wasted . Nothing can make me more willing or less helpless . " " You will do what is right , Lord . " " Go away , Dismas . I have nothing to offer you . " When the broad back disappeared , Jesus thought about what he had said . I have nothing to offer you . There must be another way , less arrogant , to say it . Water in their cave had seeped to their bare feet and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were in the midst of celebrating the rain , dancing on the soft earth to feel the splatter of mud against their ankles . They were not forgetting as they splashed that their black shirts would be wet now day and night . But their shirts had been damp with sweat for months , and rain at least would be fresher on their backs . They were not forgetting either that the rain might ruin their ammunition and rot their food . Not forgetting these good reasons for hating the rain , they had begun to cheer when the first torrent of water came crashing out of the sky . They had clapped each other 's backs and sung traditional songs of victory . They could rejoice at each burst of a downpour that would leave them filthy and sick because they knew the rain would hurt their enemies even more . The aliens had airplanes , and airplanes could not fly through the mountains in the rain . " No bombs for three months ! " cried James , the merriest boy in the platoon . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly at night . They could learn to fly when it rained . " " No ! " James shouted . " They may own the skies . But we own the heavens . This rain from heaven is proof we will win . " " You did n't tell us that during the dry months . " John spoke from a straw mat at the back of the cave . " You did n't  | say the sunshine proved that they were going to beat us . " " Of course not ! Because they are going to lose . The heavens could n't send us a false sign , could they ? " He swaggered to John 's side and put his pistol to his brother 's head . " Could they ? " John pushed the barrel aside . " You are right , brother . We are very lucky to have you to sort out the true portents from the false . Otherwise we might come to believe that our winning depends on how bravely we fight . " " Quiet ! " In the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the aliens stay out of the sky , they may come crawling around on foot . " " Especially during the day , " John agreed , " when they do n't have to be afraid of the dark . " The week before , he had been shot in the leg during a daytime scouting foray . When the bullet was dug out of his flesh , he was left with a sore leg and a new distrust of the sun . " When we rule the country , we will conduct all business at night , to please my brother , " James said . " You have always handled your business at night . " The others laughed softly at the bickering between brothers . " Do n't be jealous . They shot low enough . Soon you 'll be back at it yourself . " Peter asked Judas when Jesus would rejoin them . He was afraid the question would annoy the acting commander and tried to show in his manner that he was not impatient . " He did n't say . " John had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter , " He said he was going to get new instructions and did n't know when he 'd be back . He expected this week to be quiet because of the holidays . " " How are you going to celebrate ? " James kicked his brother 's sore leg . " Why do n't you dance for us ? " " When I dance , it 'll be on your body . " James laughed and danced a parody of John on the battle- field , cowering and cringing , dodging in every direction until at last one bullet catches the very tip of his big toe . Obeying Judas , the men laughed deep in their throats . One hour passed and then another . At every slight sound the men who could sleep blinked awake . Most of them had grown up on continual alert , and they did n't bother to think that they might be killed at any minute of the day . Older than the others , Peter had known periods of fitful peace , and the tension sometimes told on him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and during the long daylight hours he would brood and curse their enemies . The rain stopped for several minutes . Then , as the men were attuning themselves to the silence , the downpour started again with greater force . Outside , the water hit the ground like bomb fragments and stung the face and chest of Andrew , who was standing guard on a ridge thirty feet above the cave . From his post , he could watch the road for more than a mile as it wound through the hills . At an alert from him , the cave 's mouth could be barricaded and disguised until no amount of scrutiny would reveal its secret . Only the bombs could hurt them . The alien pilots might hit the hilltop accidentally , dropping with no aim , acting on nothing more than a hunch that guerrillas were camped below . Andrew had seen the First John , their former leader , buried alive in a cave while the men who could not reach shelter had escaped . The bomber pilot had no way of knowing that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitor radio said the pilot claimed he had killed forty guerrillas , the men of the First John 's company did not scoff at his boast . They would have given up forty lives  --  thirty-nine others and their own  --  to keep the First John alive . Later that year Andrew had cut the head off a wounded alien soldier they had captured . Judas and other officers were going to punish him severely until he said , " For the First John . " They nodded and kept still .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | The men who were awake had gathered around her on all sides . With arrows and dotted lines she traced for them the enemy tactics . " That 's good , " Judas said when she had finished . " That 's good . We can kill more than fifty of their men at little risk . " Philip tried to whisper a question to the girl , but the rain had stopped and everyone in the circle heard him . " Did you bring any chocolate ? " Judas struck him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has risked her life to bring us this plan , " he said . " Only someone as ungrateful and stupid as you could ask such a thing . " Mary Magdalene had moved to caress the sore spot on Philip 's cheek , but her pride in Judas ' words made her flush . " We must begin preparing for the ambush , " Judas said to her . " You should not be gone any longer . If the aliens find you on the road , you are returning from taking holiday greetings to your family . " " Yes . " Judas waved her away . When she reached the mouth of the cave , he called , " Next time do n't forget the chocolate . " He gestured impatiently to the men , and they began to wake their comrades . Since they had not fought for nearly two months , they knew Judas would make a ritual of the inspection . Most of their weapons had been captured from the enemy . They were heavy rifles that shot straight and killed efficiently . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bullets . Last year , when their store of captured ammunition had run low , they had crept to the seacoast . There , from a junk disguised with fishing nets , they had picked up a supply of lighter-weight weapons . Judas knew which large nation had sent the new supplies . But most of the men feared anything outside their province , and he did not tell them they were incurring foreign debts . Nathanael had begun hauling out the electrically detonated  | mines . Watching him , Judas wondered , as he often did , at the inability of his men to learn anything from experience . " Those mines are for limited harassment on the days of enemy convoys , " he said , helping Nathanael to put them back beneath a tarpaulin . " Tonight we will not expose our intentions by using mines . You saw the plan the whore drew . We will surround the company between the rocks and the river , and we will kill all of them within two minutes of the first shot we fire . We will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their relief forces to follow . Do you understand me ? " Nathanael nodded vigorously , too slow and goodhumored to detect a reproach . By the time their rifles had been oiled and their ammunition belts stocked , the rain had ended . The night , darker than the storm , was closing over the hillside . The men had three more hours to wait before taking up their positions , but they did not go back to sleep . They sat silently in the corners of the cave . John , who had not recovered enough to join them in the ambush , knew better than to say a word . Judas ' wristwatch showed less than one hour until they would move out when the bird signal sounded again . He prayed it was not Jesus returning , and he was repeating that prayer when Jesus appeared beside him . Jesus nodded to the armed men and asked Judas , " Have you had trouble ? " " Not yet . " Judas told him every detail of the girl 's visit . But as he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping pace with his own . He began to prolong his account , to delay an answer . When he had finished , Jesus said , " The plan is good , but we must cancel it . " They had watched enough men die for Judas to be able to ask , " Why ? " Jesus felt his fingers digging into the softest skin of his palm . He must act calm and firm . " Orders , " he said . Judas looked at the captain 's shaved head , dusted lightly with bris- ties of black hair , and tried to decide whether to press him further . In the past the two of them had spoken of the possibility that a cease-fire would have to be explained one day to their men . Now the holidays could be providing the excuse for politicians in remote cities to begin their negotiations . To them , as to most of the world , the war was a nuisance and an embarrassment . But to the men in the cave and other men in caves and trenches throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night of the year . Telling those men why they must stop killing was a job neither Judas nor Jesus had wanted to take on . They had agreed that when the moment came , they would be forthright with the men and confess that peace talks might lose all the territory and bargaining strength that the blood of patriots had won for them . They would admit that in another five years they might have to call upon the men to flee to the hills again and begin again to free their country . They would end by saying that they , too , had doubts about the wisdom of negotiating with hypocrites and traitors . But they were good soldiers and the cease-fire was an order . Now , canceling their ambush , Jesus might be acting on that order . But the shaved head suggested another reason to Judas . In peacetime Jesus had lived contentedly as a priest in the highlands until the traitor government began to torture and kill the nation 's religious leaders . Then Jesus had left his lodgings at the temple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clever and brave , Jesus had risen quickly through the ranks . But he kept his head shaved , and no one forgot that he had been a priest before he became a soldier . Only once had Judas argued with his commander . It was not long after he had been sent to the company Jesus led . More truthfully , as Judas recalled it now , he had argued alone ; Jesus had heard out his shouting and then overruled  | him . The issue had been two wounded alien soldiers that they had captured after a long battle . They could not care for the prisoners , and Judas had pulled his pistol , prepared to shoot them . Jesus stopped him . His god forbade such cruelty , he said . Judas did not share that god , but as a soldier he was bound to obey Jesus . The wounded men were treated and set free . That was when Judas understood what pain the war was causing the priest . Afterward he shuddered each time Jesus shot an alien , and he looked for ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these orders Jesus now brought were from his god , Judas would not quarrel with them . Already the war was a long one . They would have a hundred , a thousand , more chances to kill aliens . He cast about for a way to show Jesus that , though he did not believe , he could respect the priest 's faith . He wanted to convey his loyalty without forcing Jesus to admit that the orders had not come from the province headquarters . Rehearsing his words , Judas sat silently and thought , I am speaking to him in my head , and he can sit beside me and not know what I am telling him . How strange that a slimy thing like a tongue should be the way to go from my head into his . " There is no one else I want to follow . " As Judas spoke , he felt his tongue flick against the roof of his mouth . " I would trust you to interpret our orders , no matter how they came to you . " Knowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gratitude betray him . He was about to say , " Relieve me of command . " But he caught himself and said , " Thank you . As they waited , his doubts once more began to work on Jesus . He had not heard from an officer at their headquarters . Nor had he heard instructions from his god . Crouched in tall grass , waiting and praying , he had heard from something in his muscle and flesh that said , No more killing .  | That was when he should have run away . He could have disappeared into another town or joined the horde of refugees on the road . He had meant to walk away from his troops and vanish from their lives . But he had come back to them with a lie . Returning to the cave along the hidden paths , Jesus had practiced his argument with Judas : " I have been alone for three days , " he would begin , " and I know we must not fight any more . " " If your god forbids it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " He has come to see the justice of our cause before , and he will release you to us again . " " My conviction does not come from my god . He has not spoken to me for many months . " " Then without regret you can join us in the cause of freedom . " " I am telling you that we must not kill . We must lay down our arms . " " When our land is overrun by aliens who would enslave us , one course lies open to honorable men . If our leader  --  or if your god  --  directs us to stop our struggle , I will obey . But any other voice with the same order is a voice of cowardice and treachery , and I will never surrender . " Jesus knew their argument would have been longer and finally harsher than he was imagining it . Judas could repeat each of the brave old words eloquently , and he believed the words as he spoke them . In their argument , Jesus could not speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God had not told him to lay down his arms . God watched the aliens murdering farmers , setting fire to the rice crop , torturing prisoners to make them betray their countrymen . God watched , and if he was God , he would not ask godly men to let an alien plague destroy their land . But if there was no God , then Jesus would have to listen  | to his own soft instincts , to the numbness that crept across his body saying , No more killing . Jesus said to himself , I am wrong . That I had to lie proves it . Anyone can laugh at the fine words Judas likes to speak , but they are fine because they are true . Yet my body says , No more killing . I have seldom listened to my body , but I can not ignore it now . Judas said , " We will take the men out anyway . There would be too much danger for the wounded if we stay here . We will follow the same route , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage us . " " We are not to fire at all . " " Surely your instructions do n't forbid self-defense ? " After a pause Jesus said , " No . " " There should be no need for shooting . " Judas ' excitement was rising in him again like mercury . " We will be well concealed , and they will march through the site without detecting us . " " Good . " " I would suggest one thing . " Judas was sure that the nearness of the aliens would overcome Jesus ' scruples and that the ambush could proceed . If later it turned out that the orders had actually come from their headquarters , some excuse could be made . Violations were an expected counterpoint to a cease-fire . " What do you suggest ? " " If you would take a command spot at the top of the west ridge , you could survey the valley . At any change in the aliens ' plans , you could alert us with two shots when they have passed you . We would then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . The rest could pick up the wounded and move to the old cave . " Two shots , Judas thought , and we will have our battle . You will find that a commander gives his best orders with his trigger finger .  | Jesus was glad to be spared the company of other men during the long wait , and he agreed at once . " We must begin soon , " Judas said . " They will be out shortly before dawn , and we should be concealed before midnight . " With a few brusque motions , Judas grouped the men into small units and gave them instructions . Unless they heard the signal from Jesus , they were not to open fire . The reasons for this order were good ones . They would have to accept the word of their commanders . No one grumbled and the older men looked relieved . Judas led out the groups separately . For more than an hour he ran between the cave and the rim of the natural bowl that seemed shaped to be an ambush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel and was setting out for his post when Judas caught up with him . " Sir ! " " Yes ? " " We have to do things that are wrong , " Judas said softly . " Killing is never right , but sometimes we must do it . " Jesus answered , " We have all killed at one time or another . " Judas wanted to comfort him now for the slaughter to come . " I never try to persuade myself that killing is right . But the world is wrong , and it forces wrongdoing on us . " " We are the world . " " What I wanted to say was that I do n't deceive myself . I know it 's wrong , even when it must be done . " Judas dropped away soundlessly and Jesus continued his climb to the ridge . The nights were cold in the hills . Dressed in black silk shirt and trousers , Jesus trembled from every wind that blew 1ij through the hollows . He tried to huddle low enough for the rough grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underbrush until he could see along the trail the aliens were expected to follow . Jesus , never outside his province , feared all aliens , and he  | knew his troops shared his fear . The enemy could swoop from the sky like eagles , jump out of green flying trucks and fight until those trucks lifted them out of the jungle and back to their bases . The men asked Jesus why his god should have given such power to the aliens . He said that God had given to the loyal soldiers strong hearts and great skill and , to make them test these gifts , a heartless enemy with a million machines . When he had stood watch on this ridge in the summer , Jesus could often hear all the noises of the village below . This night the rain had left behind a thick vapor that swallowed the lights below him and smothered any sound of life . He was reminded of nights at the temple school when young boys strained to carry in tubs of hot water , and the novices , blushing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning themselves . In the night fog , Jesus shivered from that same nakedness , but he felt neither hidden nor clean . He thought , If we are to save our souls , we should not be asked to save our country . Jesus considered the paths Judas straddled . As a soldier , Judas could kill . As a man , he could not . And so he tried to lay down his manhood each time he took up his rifle . Even that compromise could not save Jesus tonight . He had climbed this ridge as a soldier , and now he was going to refuse to kill . I know I am wrong , he thought . I can share that much courage with Judas . I wo n't pretend that I am right . The spike-edged grass bore into his back . He shifted silently to blunt the pressure of its blades . Some men loved to sit in this tall grass at night , digging their fingers into the soil and dreaming of the day they would return to their farms . All his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temple with its incense and its traces of poppy smoke from the pipes of dying priests . He had liked the daytime when he could be with other men , reading under a roof . And he found himself alone in the grass at night .  | His passion had been spent during the three days of futile prayer . It was halfheartedly now that Jesus asked his god , Tell me that I am not to kill . Your command would wipe away my fear and cowardice . Even Judas could accept my betrayal . God , I pray to you : Sanctify my treason . He expected no answer and got none . Usually the aliens struck shortly before dawn . In that way they could summon their aircraft at the first light and pursue the guerrillas with rockets and bombs . But from the look of the sky , the morning sun would be lost in a fog that would hold the planes on the ground . In five hours Judas and the others could be back in the cave , alive and with their rifles unfired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhearted in the past , he comforted himself with a vision of the country in twenty years ' time , after the guerrillas had freed the capital and restored peace . He had imagined the schoolchildren in his own village ? they would be the children of those same infants he now saw being carried around the market  --  at desks in a clean modern school . They would be reading about this unreal war and memorizing the names of the First John and the other heroes . For those children , the studying would be a chore . Even the boys who learned to respect the First John could never know that he had been a cursing loud man who swaggered under the weight of his gun belt and needed freedom the way other men need food . Whenever he had pictured the school , the idea of young faces untroubled by war or hunger had touched him . This night he found himself resenting their bored looks as they read about the great war . If he could not rouse himself tonight , his name might appear in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a man who falsified his orders and risked the lives of the men he led . Sitting in snug classrooms , they would not hear his body cry , No more killing . They  | would believe that he had been a coward . If the writer of their book said Jesus had taken money from the aliens to lay down his arms , they would believe that . It is not just . I must live in the world , but I will be judged by scholars , who have avoided life , writing for children , who have not begun to live . Something is lost . Life is lost . The cry of my body is lost . And a generation of children will sneer or spit when they speak my name . Four hours had passed before Jesus detected in the distance the first dull sound of movement . The aliens tried so hard for silence that they made a noise like nothing else in the jungle . Instead of creeping steadily with a rustling that might have been the wind , they moved in stealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beat of a bass drum . The thumping had become louder . Jesus stretched to see if the red pinpoints of their cigarettes were burning through the darkness . He saw no lights . Their discipline meant they were older and better-trained aliens who would be less easy to elude . A scout from the first unit appeared on the trail about fifty feet from where Jesus hid . The overcast moon revealed nothing but a dim profile that reminded Jesus again of the aliens ' great size . The man stood a full foot taller than Jesus , and the muscle of his arm looked as big around as Jesus ' waist . As the man moved forward , raising a leg , setting it down , Jesus saw others behind him . His own heart had begun to beat loudly , and he wondered , as once he had wondered when he played a child 's hiding game , if the pounding in his chest could carry to his enemies . He knew better , and he thought , Our fear speaks only to us . Unless we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that we 're afraid . Every one of the aliens was huge . Peter said their forefathers had spread their seed among apes , and that all aliens were half beast . John said they merely ate more than other people and that the patriots would defeat them with the  | weapons of hunger and privation . It had been Thomas who said what they all had considered : The aliens were gods whom the patriots had no right to resist . Soon afterward , Thomas had been killed in the confusion of a battle . As he watched them pass , Jesus saw that the men were moving four abreast across the clearing rather than in the pairs Judas had expected . There would be twice as many men on the mission , then , and the aliens could fan out in patterns that the girl had not charted . Moving around Judas ' trap instead of through its center , these men could surround the patriots and gun them down . Jesus knew he had to warn his comrades . He held his rifle ready to fire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could fire the shots , dart through the brush and join them at the old cave . The gun butt weighed on his palm . Its thin barrel rose out of the grass like a burnt stalk . He laid his finger across the trigger . But his fingers did not tighten and he knew he would not fire . Cowardice said : Judas will see that he is outmaneuvered and outmanned , and he will keep the men silent until he can lead them back to the cave . Fear said : Warning shots will set off a slaughter , and you will emerge from this hiding place to find a dead body in every clump of grass . His body said : No more killing . Jesus put his rifle down . Cowardice said : If you shoot , you will guarantee a massacre , for the aliens will pursue your men and kill them all . This way , as long as Judas obeys your instructions , they are safe . You have betrayed no one . You have chosen prudence and caution . Since you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Why is cowardice despised when it is such a friend of man ? Why is bravery esteemed when it offers only pain and death ?  | The aliens had passed , and the silence of the mountains surrounded Jesus again . He heard nothing but the low voice of his body speaking through his pulse . Then , so soft and muffled that it might have been a trick of his ears , a shot was fired . The next barrage was thunder , Jesus told himself , but the sky did not light up . Each new burst of bullets came faster , and the sounds of gunfire crossed each other until no single rifle could be heard . The crashing carried through the hills to Jesus and rocked him with its force . He felt his face twisting with fear . In the midst of the din from the valley , he listened for the reassurance of his body . But a tremor shook him , and it said , Kill ! He sat in the grass and knew about betrayal . Not long after the shooting had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the ridge and spotted Jesus in the underbrush . He shouted something that must have meant , " Come out ! " Jesus rose , leaving his rifle in the grass . He folded his hands behind his head and joined the alien on the path . The soldier grunted and prodded Jesus down the hill with the tip of his rifle barrel . As he obeyed , Jesus had no thoughts in his head . He saw that the fog was lifting , after all , and that the dawn was not far off . The beauty of the dark hills etched itself on his vision for an instant and was gone . When they approached the ambush site , Jesus began to see the bodies of the men . They had fallen into the grass , and he saw only a leg or an arm . If a hand was large and luminous , it belonged to an alien . Even in death the guerrillas fitted better into the landscape . Once he tripped on the body of a loyalist who had been caught on the path when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the thin chest of a comrade he could not identify . Behind him , the alien profited from his stumble and walked around the corpse .  | The light , when it came , came quickly . By the time the guard ordered Jesus to stop , the sun was strong enough to make them both blink . The alien smoked a cigarette . Jesus , who did not smoke , was glad the guard did not offer one to him , for he was not sure how to refuse . All his life he had been polite , and now there was something ugly about politeness . They waited a long time . The alien soldier was talking to himself , taking only a few puffs on his cigarette , throwing it to the ground , grinding it under his boot , lighting another . Jesus thought how the waste would hurt John , who loved to smoke and rarely got the chance . John would be safe with the other wounded men in the cave . The girl would bring them food . As the waiting dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot him there . He must be an underling who had to get orders from his commander . Jesus understood why the alien government had sent soldiers to his country , but he looked at his guard and wondered why the soldiers had agreed to come . The man was tanned except around the eyes , where he had worn dark glasses . There , under his pale eyelashes , the skin was brown and purple from fatigue . He must have a reason , Jesus thought . He must believe he is fighting for something . My cause is just , and I betrayed it . His cause is false , and he has kept its faith . Three men drew close to them . One was a tall alien , no different from the man who guarded Jesus ; another was a traitor , hurrying along like a hungry dog at the alien 's heels ; the third was Peter , marching forward at the point of the alien 's gun . The guard with Jesus approached his alien comrade respectfully , said something and gestured toward Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jesus looked into his eyes and saw that their lids were skinned back in a way he recognized . After other battles , the  | loyal soldiers who survived had returned to the cave with eyes thrust open in the same way . After a day had passed , the lids drew down and became a shield again . Until that blankness in their eyes was covered , Jesus had turned away from their faces . Now he thought : We have always recognized the aliens by their height and color and the odd shape of their eyelids . But this morning the commander 's stare makes him kin to every soldier he has killed . I with my narrow eyes have become the alien . Speaking the liquid sounds of his alien language , the commander said something to the traitor , who translated it to Peter . " Do you know this man ? " the traitor asked , pointing to Jesus . " I have never seen him before , " Peter said contemptuously . " He is part of your company of outlaws , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You lie . He is one of yours . " " Only the traitor slaves of aliens lie . I tell you my friends are dead . But our cause will triumph . " " Shut your mouth . " The traitor relayed Peter 's denial to the commander . He spoke fluently in the alien tongue , the natural manliness of his own voice sinking into a soft whine . Twice he pointed to Jesus and once he drew his pistol , but the commander shook his head and turned his wide blank eyes to the ground . Jesus knew he would not be killed . The traitor came back to him with a look of revulsion . " You ! " he said . When Jesus did not respond , he said , " Pig ! " Jesus lifted his head . " The allied commander refuses to shoot you as you deserve , " the traitor said . " He says that if you had been with the others you would have warned them . He says there is no evidence against you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no cour- age . We must forever show them the way for real men to behave . If we were alone , I would cut off your tongue , so you would lie no more . I would rip out your eyes so you might begin to see how your outlaws are destroying this country . " Jesus ' head drooped , and the traitor slapped him hard to raise it . The sound made the alien commander look back and speak sharply . " He says , No brutality , ' " the traitor said bitterly . " Can you understand any soldier who must fight your kind of vermin saying , No brutality ' ? " His dark eyes searched Jesus for a last time . " I am letting you go . But as you run off , remember that I might forget my orders and shoot you in the back . You 'd better run fast and keep running , for if I ever see you again , I will shoot out your heart . " Jesus walked away . The light was sharp and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grass . From one corpse the back of the head had been blown off , and gray juices from inside his skull were soaking into the ground . It was Judas . Jesus knelt by the body and took the cracked head in his arms . He cupped his palm to scoop the fluid from the earth . Dirt had mixed with the juices , and Jesus packed this mud into the wound . He took off his own black shirt and wrapped it tightly around the head so none of the juice could run out again . With his head swathed in black , Judas looked sinister , and whole . Jesus , with no place to go , started to walk faster . Luke had devised a new version of the parable . In it , the prodigal son preferred to starve to death rather than humiliate himself by seeking his father 's pardon . Jesus read the story and tore it up . Then Luke produced an ending in which the prodigal son  | tried to return home but found that his family had moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Luke had shown him . " We need a new ending , " Luke pleaded . " In the classrooms they 're no longer interested in the original story . " " Then write about a starving beggar who imagines in his delirium that pride had once driven him to leave his father 's fine estate . Let his hunger cause him to believe that he has returned to that unreal house and that he has been welcomed with love and banquets . " " Is that the end ? " " At the height of the delirium , let him be visited by a traveler who breaks into his fantasy and convinces him that the house , the father , the fatted calf are all lies , and that he is dying ignored and alone . " " We can not call it the story of the prodigal son . " " Call it the story of the Samaritan . " " The Good Samaritan ? " " Let your students worry about that . " A warning : If I survive without you and learn to pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never listen to you afterward . Then if you come to me and say , " It will be again as it has been , " I will tell you , " No . " I will tell you that I wanted to progress in faith , and you denied that progress to me . If I progress now in doubt , my success may disgust me . But my progress will be undeniable . A warning . John had come to Jesus to say , " There is one miracle after all : knowing another body better than you know your own . "
