In the course of discussing Schema 13 on the church in the modern world , the fathers of the Second Vatican Council last week got around to a touchy question : What should be the Catholic attitude toward atheism ? <P> The most militant answer came from the new Jesuit General , Father Pedro Arrupe . What " the Black Pope " had to say shocked a number of progressive bishops and theologians . Arrupe charged that there is an atheistic conspiracy at large in the world that " holds almost complete sway in international organizations , in financial circles , in the fields of mass communications : press , cinema , radio and television . " Even worse , he warned , this atheistic mentality " enters the very territory of the City of God , insidiously influencing the minds of believers ( including even religious and priests ) with its hidden poison , and producing its natural fruits in the church : naturalism , distrust , rebellion . " <P> In a Crusade . To counteract the great conspiracy of the godless , Arrupe urged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinated action , " to be followed by Catholics in a crusade against atheism , under " absolute obedience to the Pope . " The Supreme Pontiff would then " assign various fields of labor to everyone , in order that the entire people of God may give itself vigorously to this task . " <P> Had such a speech been delivered by a known ecclesiastical reactionary , the response would probably have been a few smiles and shrugs of resignation by bishops and periti in the coffee bars at St. Peter 's . That such an approach should be taken by Arrupe , a learned Basque with a reputation for liberality , produced more puzzlement than anything else . At a press panel , American Theologian John J. King bluntly called Arrupe 's summons to crusade " unfortunate . " Other Jesuits noted that Arrupe did not reflect a consensus of the society . " I think his speech was naive , " said one Jesuit professor in Rome . " It was a speech by a man who does n't understand the situation . His language was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out under the banner of Christ . Of course , if you take it literally , it 's absurd . " <P> Out of the Abbey . On the other side , Franziskus Cardinal Knig of Vienna , head of a new Vatican secretariat for dealing with nonbelievers , argued that the attitude of the church toward all men of good will-including atheists-should be one of dialogue , not damnation . And Mexican Bishop Sergio Mndez Arceo of Cuernavaca suggested that the church should pay tribute to the views of a renowned atheist whom it has long deplored : Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud . Bishop Mndez argued that Freud 's teachings constitute " a useful method of purification " and should be taken into account in the redrafting of Schema 13 . Said he : " There is no field of pastoral activity where psychoanalysis is not useful . "
