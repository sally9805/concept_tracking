In a crisis , the human body is capable of superhuman feats . Last week , by way of demonstration , a slender , ailing woman lifted the rear of a 3,300-lb. car . <P> Maxwell and Florence Rogers were sitting in their kitchen in Tampa . Fla. when a youngster rushed in yelling that the car had fallen on Charles ( Mrs. Rogers ' son by a former marriage ) . Husband and wife dashed out to the yard where Charles Trotter , 16 , had blocked the front wheels and jacked up the rear of their 1954 Ford Ranch Wagon to work on the universal joints . The bumper jack had slipped , and Charles 's right leg was pinned between the car body and the driveshaft . <P> Manlike , Maxwell Rogers knew that nobody could raise the car by hand , so he started to fiddle with the jack . Womanlike , Florence Rogers , 39 , a 5-ft. 7-in. woman of 123 lbs. , went right ahead . She grabbed the rear bumper in the middle . She kept her legs straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car rose enough for Charles to scramble out , with only minor bruises . <P> But as it rose , Mrs. Rogers felt something snap in her back . X rays disclosed a compression fracture , with one vertebra crushed . But despite the injury to her spinal column , she suffered no paralysis . This week , fitted with a special brace , she is at St. Joseph 's Hospital . What amazes Mrs. Rogers ' physician , Dr. William A. Moore III , is the fact that she could have exerted herself at all . She had been ill at home for two weeks , recovering from a rheumatic disorder of the left knee and an attack of thrombophlebitis in her right leg . How far she might have lifted the car if she had been in good physical shape , no one would guess .
