" Now is the time for all who fear seasickness to take to the lifeboats . The rest of you must cling to the mast . " In these ringing quarter-deck tones , President Charles de Gaulle last week warned his ministers that he had set a course into the eye of the storm . His decision : to speed a solution toward an " Algerian republic . " The U.S. had just elected a President who in 1957 stirred up a flurry in France by declaring that " the independence of Algeria " was " the essential first step " in North Africa . The Algerian rebels are pressing Morocco hard to grant passage in the next three or four weeks to the first shipments of arms and " technicians " from Red China . France itself seemed suddenly at its nerves ' ends over a war that has eaten at its vitals for six years . <P> The Wreckers . Storm clouds could be seen gathering . In protest at De Gaulle 's new course , Andr Jacomet , No. 2 man in the Algerian civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response was decisive . Ignoring Jacomet 's resignation , De Gaulle ordered him dismissed from his post and suspended his membership in the elite Council of State . After that , other officials in Algeria who had been muttering about resigning fell abruptly silent . <P> But on Armistice Day , Algiers erupted . in the worst rioting since the January insurrection . Shouting " De Gaulle to the gallows " and " the paratroopers to Paris , " a crowd of 5,000 students and settlers wrecked buses , smashed windows , and fought a pitched battle with police . To clear the streets of demonstrators , police charged again and again , swinging rifle butts and truncheons . The rioters threw stones , pavement blocks and tin cans until dispersed by tear gas . Regrouping a few blocks on , the mob swept down on the U.S. Information Service office and wrecked it for the second time in two years . By the time darkness halted the fighting , 100 were wounded , including 70 cops . <P> In Paris , President de Gaulle rode through a cheering crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France 's Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe . But police headed off a possible riot only by rounding up 1,900 demonstrators , and De Gaulle 's old comrade in arms , Algerian-born Marshal Alphonse Juin , refused to take part in the Arc de Triomphe ceremonies . " I had to do something to protest , " cried Juin , who is France 's only living marshal . His gesture placed France 's most influential soldier beside such disaffected army chieftains as the former commander in Algeria , General Raoul Salan . Ordered by De Gaulle to stay out of Algeria , Salan has gone to Spain for " a vacation , " last week summoned reporters to his seaside hotel in San Sebastin to declare : " The time of false retreats has ended . A categorical no to this Algerian Algeria . " <P> The Surveyors . As the weather thickened , De Gaulle was reported ready to put the question of Algerian peace to a referendum in France . At week 's end he sent Defense Minister Pierre Messmer and Armed Forces Chief General Paul Ely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inform the army that the destination is ultimately an independent republic .
