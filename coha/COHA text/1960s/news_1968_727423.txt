txt Despite the Arab-Israeli conflict , most countries in the Middle East are making economic progress . In some cases the movement is astonishing . This is the first of a series of reports on Mr. Francis ' tour of the United Arab Republic , Lebanon , Iraq , Iran , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , and sonic of the Trucial states . The red-hot steel bar shot through the roller and bent up into the air like a piece of spaghetti . It should have come out straight . The machine was n't working quite right . A group of Iranians scrambled about to correct it . Helmut Settmacher , the West German engineer who manages the new Iranian Rolling Mills Company plant here , made some suggestions . This was the first time the Iranian engineers had been given full responsibility for running the plant . They had been urging Mr. Settmacher and some 14 other foreigners to take a day off so they could manage the plant by themselves . Mr. Settmacher just happened to pass by when the machine was malfunctioning . Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite a lack of experience , general competence . Mr. Settmacher managed the construction of the rolling mill . He now helps run it under a contract held by the builder , Demag A.K. , but he figures that in two years or so the Iranian engineers will be able to take over . Perhaps one or two foreigners will be required to keep in contact with new technology . Sandstorms not uncommon At first glance the rolling mill appears to be in the most improbable location . It stands smack in the middle of desert , not far from the ancient town of Ahwaz . Temperatures inside the mill in summer may reach 165 degrees F. Sandstorms occasionally sweep the area . Drifting dunes keep road crews busy clearing the highway . Mirages usually play on the horizon during the heat of day . The site was chosen for several reasons . It is on the main highway and railway running from Abadan to Tehran . It is at the head of navigation on the Karoun River , Iran 's only navigable river . Thus steel billets from India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout Iran . In addition , enormous supplies of cheap natural gas will soon be available , a byproduct of crude oil production . At present the plant uses fuel oil . Plenty of electric power comes 180 kilometers from the $75 million Pahlavi Dam . An umbrella and chair placed in the sand was the first office here . The first section of the plant was opened by Iran 's Shah , Mohammed Riza Pahlevi , on July 23 , 1967 . A second mill was opened a year later . When the third mill is completed by 1970 , the plant will have a capacity of 170,000 to 180,000 tons . Its production of round bars , angle , T-bars , and flat steel has been designed to match Iran 's domestic consumption . The plant has // Literacy gap Industrialization in Iran is outpacing literacy . But steps to correct the situation have already begun . Sugar cane flourishes as one benefit of Iran 's $75 million Pahlavi Dam *Iran runs own steel plant // complete protection from imports . Thus prices are controlled by the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce steel cheaper than imported steel . Iranian Rolling Mills Company is owned 32 percent by an Iranian businessman , Ali Rezai ; 15 percent by a government corporation , the Iranian Mining and Industrial Development Bank ( IMIDB ) ; and the remainder by Demag and a Swiss firm , Phillips Brothers . Mr. Settmacher figures this area could become the " little Ruhr " of Iran . His company plans to build an electric-arc steel smelting plant using domestic scrap . It will have a capacity of 65,000 tons . Mr. Rezai has been in Germany to discuss plans . IMIDB intends to build a hot-strip rolling mill and pipe mill just north of this town of 150,000 . World 's largest oil refinery Other firms will probably construct a wire drawing mill and cold rolling mill , further fabricating the product of Iranian Rolling Mills . Some 120 kilometers south over the desert is the world 's largest refinery at Abadan . It 's owned by the Iranian Oil Refining Company , a subsidiary of the Iranian Oil Operating Consortium , commonly known as the Consortium . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinery . At this point in time , though , the Province of Khuzestan ( the " land of sugar " ) shows the tremendous contrasts seen in many developing nations . Close by the rolling mill with its complex electronic controls , barefoot shepherds in desert garb look after scruffy flocks of sheep or goats . Some laborers in the plant come from the mud huts of nearby villages . Literacy expanding " Iran ca n't educate the people as fast as industry is growing , " noted Mr. Settmacher . " That is a big , big problem . " The impact of the steel mill and other projects on nearby Ahwaz is enormous . Soon the word gets around that the first question asked an applicant seeking a skilled or semiskilled job is whether he can read and write . The desire for education becomes a nearobsession . Iranians are rapidly becoming literate . About 40 percent of males and 10 percent of females could read and write in 1966 . But among those 10-14 years old , 67 percent of the boys and 34 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures are 94.3 percent for boys and 90.2 percent for girls . Iran 's fourth five-year plan , which started last March , figures on boosting the number of literate persons of ages from 10 to 45 from the present 35 percent to about 60 percent . The number of primary students will rise from 2.5 million to 3.7 million over the five years . The financial incentive to learn is strong . A skilled worker at the rolling mill earns about $6.60 a day . An unskilled laborer may get only 85 cents a day . At present , those who make it to university are chiefly from the middle class or lower middle class . But , Iranians say , the children of newly literate peasants ' sons and daughters should get to university in larger numbers in the future . First of a series .
