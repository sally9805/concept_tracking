txt President Kennedy announced today a program of assistance to the textile industry . The program pointed strongly toward import quotas on-competing nations . J. M. Cheatham , head of the I American Cotton Manufacturers Association , said he was " highly encouraged . " " We are encouraged that this is going to lead to some corrective action , " he declared . His organization has long urged quotas as a relief from the heavy import competition felt by domestic manufacturers , particularly in the last two years . ' Green Light ' Seen While the seven-point program did not mention quotas or tariffs , it was regarded by some in the Administration as a " green light " for the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization to impose quotas on such sources of competition as Hong Kong , Pakistan and other lowwage countries . This view was based on the seventh of the actions proposed by the President . " An application by the textile industry for action under existing statutes , such as the escape clause or the national security provision of the Trade Agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . That the President chose to emphasize this point was interpreted as possible encouragement for the Tariff Commission or the 0 . C. D. M. to favor applications for relief . The commission has rejected such applications made under the " escape clause " of the trade act . The clause is designed to assist an industry when it is suffering from foreign competition . Meeting at White House The 0 . C. D. M. considers requests for relief under the " national security " clause , designed to prevent damage to the national security through damage to essential industries . In 1959 it restricted crude oil imports , the only time it had granted such relief . The 0 . C. D. M. , unlike the commission , is part of the Executive office . Mr. Cheatham and other textile men met at the White House today with Commerce Secretary Luther H. Hodges , Gov . Ernest F.

" Mr. Kennedy 's statement called the industry 's problems " serious and deep-rooted . " He l'had first-hand knowledge of the ' subject when he was junior ' Senator from Massachusetts , ! another textile state . After noting that the 0 . C. D. M. had already cited the industry as " essential to our national security , " he added that textiles had a " direct effect upon our total economy . " The industry is " our second largest employer " with 2,000,000 workers directly affected by its conditions and 2,000,000 indirectly concerned , the President said . He also proposed : II A. conference of the principal textile exporting and importing countries to " seek an international understanding which will provide a basis for trade that will avoid undue disruption of established industries .

On Aug. 1 , the differential will be 8 cents and $42.50. ( lExpanded research on new products , processes andmarkets , with the Commerce Defrartment cooperating with union and management groups . q A review of depreciation allowances on textile machinery , assistance in financing the modernization of this machinery by the Small Business Administration , and a program to be sent to Congress " shortly " to permit industries hurt or threatened by imports to receive federal assistance . No details on any of these points were given . Mr. Kennedy said he hoped the measures " will strengthen the industry and expand consumption of its products without disrupting international trade and without disruption of the markets of any country . " Congressmen . from textile areas have been outspoken in demands for relief from import competition . lkany , / like Representative Carl Vinson , Democrat of Georgia , are influential . The views of these men endangered the trade agreements act . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them without threatening the principle of reciprocal trade . Some informed sources thought that an international conference could not be effective ' in working out voluntary quotas for competing countries because there were too many such countries . When Japan was the chief competitor , she imposed quotas on herself and abided by them in shipments to the United States market . That was in 1957 . Imports dropped that year to 122,400,000 square yards of cotton cloth , from 188,200,000 in 1956 . The effect of this was shortlived , as other low-wage nations developed textile industries and discovered that Japan had opened the way for them to enter the United States market . As a result , cotton cloth imports increased to 140,500,000 square yards in 1958 ; 240,400 , - 000 in 1959 , and 454,600,000 last year . This drastic increase was accomplished by more than a dozen competitor nations , as diverse as West Germany , Switzerland , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Spain . Now the five-year Japanese agreement is expiring and Japan will no doubt seek to increase her quota for next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year .
