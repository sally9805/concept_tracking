Back from negotiating a political settlement in Chicago , New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller last week put his hand to some pressing business in his own state : a 25-day strike of railroad trainmen on the Long Island Railroad , the busiest U.S. commuter line . Neither labor nor management showed any sign of budging , but Rocky was in a mood to push . He summoned railroad executives , union officials , state and federal mediators . Early one morning , they trooped into his sleek , grey-carpeted Manhattan office . Rockefeller briskly ushered management and union men into different rooms and closed the doors behind them . Snapped Rocky to an aide : " This is it . They are not going home until we settle this strike . " <P> Sweating It Out . As mediators shuffled between the two teams , Rockefeller frequently popped in on both sides to let them know that he was watching . He had also hinted that if the strike was not settled , he might recall the state legislature to ask for special powers to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted that . At midmorning Rockefeller slipped away long enough to have a cyst removed from under his right eye ( six stitches ) at the Manhattan Eye , Ear , and Throat Hospital , came back to order ham and turkey sandwiches for all , then settled down-with dark glasses and an ice pack gracing his head-to sweat out the negotiations . <P> By dinnertime the gloomy-faced negotiators had reached no settlement-though they were only $25,000 apart . They begged for a break and some food , but Rocky was having none of it . Said he to his aides : " Let 's keep them here till they finish . " This time , he ordered no sandwiches . At 9:33 p.m. , almost twelve hours after the session began . Rockefeller strode into the pressroom and , wiping his brow , announced tersely : " It 's settled ! " Insisted Rockefeller : " The people of New York State pay me $50,000 a year to make decisions like this , and I 'll assume responsibility for any fare rise . " <P> Undisguisedly Unhappy . Under terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to a five-day week , while continuing to get paid for seven days . In return , they agreed to take 2 instead of the 5.4 hourly wage increase won by the union throughout the industry last month , and to drop some featherbedding practices . The settlement will cost the Long Island $162,041 a year , which the road will cover by raising annual commuter fares for its 85,000 daily commuters by $1 or $2 , adding to a recent $24-a-year fare increase . <P> Chief Union Negotiator Harold J. Pryor called the settlement " an almost complete victory . " Long Island President Thomas M. Goodfellow , undisguisedly unhappy , made it clear that he was the one who had been pushed . Said he : " The settlement we made was n't the settlement we thought should be made . But the Governor felt the effects of the strike overbalanced the cost of ending it . We accepted his recommendation . " Long Island commuters , after nearly a month of overcrowded highways and desperate expedients for getting to work , seemed willing to pay a hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar ride .
