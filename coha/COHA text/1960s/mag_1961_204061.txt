Virginia 's Allegheny Mountains , 160 miles southwest of Washington , where snow usually comes only in unreliable flurries , seems an unlikely spot for a ski resort . Yet last weekend the stately rooms of The Homestead resort were crowded with the parka-and-stretch-pants set . It is the Southland 's winter sport resort , and one thing is sure : there should always be snow . Reason : snow machines , an expensive network of pipes , hoses and nozzles lining the ski trails . Water , atomized by a compressed air blast , turns into snow crystals as it sprays out into below-freezing temperatures . Not only are the machines making of skiing a new Southern custom , but they are bailing out northern areas that have been losing money for lack of steady snow . For the beginner or afternoon skier , they are also creating a new set of small ski slopes <P> Business Booster . The Homestead turned to skiing to fill its rooms in winter , when business drops from 500 guests a day during summer to 30 . Now , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a snow machine , winter business is up to 150 guests a day . Homestead 's success has encouraged other investors to plan a resort near Gatlinburg , Tenn . The investors are dickering with Larchmont Engineering , Lexington , Mass. , the largest manufacturer of snow makers , for machines . <P> In the North the machines are developing a new class of Sunday skiers who do not have the time to spend traveling to the big slopes where the more skilled play . William Ostrander , a Detroit electrician , started Summit Ski Club on 135 hilly acres not far from the city . But in the first year lack of snow forced him to close for two-thirds of the season , and he had only 600 customers . After spending $15,000 on a snow machine , he gets 10,000 skiers in an eleven-week season , now nets about 25% on his $100,000 total investment . " Without that machine we would n't be in business , " he says . One of the most ambitious snow jobs is the result of $225,000 spent by Don Soviero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 acres on Massachusetts ' Mt . Bousquet , an area of uncertain snows . Says Soviero : " While everyone else is crying , we have never lost money , ' ' though his artificial snow costs $1,000 a day . <P> Disaster Area . Even in normally heavy snowfall areas , machines are a good investment . Wisconsin , which usually has plenty of snow in its ski areas , has had hardly a flake this season , despite the snow that buried cities farther south and in the East .
