For more than a decade , half the world 's aircraft manufacturers have been struggling to develop a latter-day replacement for the traditional workhorse of the airways , Douglas Aircraft 's 26-year-old DC-3 . The planemaker that has come closest is Royal Netherlands Fokker Aircraft , whose sleek , twin-turboprop F-27 Friendship is now used by 36 airlines spanning all six continents . <P> An Assist for the Kaiser . Fokker 's past is not all friendship . The company was founded in 1913 in Germany by a ruthless , conniving aircraft designer named Anthony Fokker , who shucked off his allegiance to The Netherlands to build military aircraft for the Kaiser . Baron von Richthofen and his Flying Circus battled to fame in Fokker triplanes . After Germany 's defeat , Anthony Fokker slipped back into The Netherlands , taking along six trainloads of tools and aircraft parts , and set up a new plant . His dependable F-VII monoplane spawned the rise of commercial airlines in the 1920s ; it was in a modified F-VII that Admiral Byrd made his historic flight over the North Pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later Allied bombers reduced the Fokker plant to ruins . After the war , Fokker executives shepherded the remnants of the company 's work force together and began to rebuild . Helped by a $7,000,000 loan from the Dutch government . Fokker introduced in 1958 its first postwar airliner , the F27 . Powered by Rolls-Royce Dart engines , the F-27 ( price $700,000 ) carries from 40 to 52 passengers , cruises at 300 m.p.h . It has a maximum range of 1,270 miles and an enviable safety record of only three crashes-all due to pilot error . So far , Fokker has sold 256 F275 to customers in 25 countries , including 93 made under license in the U.S. by the Fairchild Stratos Corp . <P> The Monday President . Fokker is run by a troika of joint managing directors : Frits Diepen , 47 ( sales and service ) ; Hein During , 58 ( finance and administration ) ; Egbert van Emden , 47 ( production and development ) . " Every Monday morning , " says Diepen , " we sit down together and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunted Fokker 's growth . Its sales have been steadily rising despite The Netherlands ' severe labor shortage , are now running at an estimated $125 million a year . <P> Currently , Fokker has a bulging backlog , including orders to build under license from Lockheed 350 F-104 Starfighters for the Dutch and West German air forces . The company is also developing a vertical-takeoff supersonic bomber , in conjunction with Republic Aviation , which two years ago acquired one-third of Fokker 's stock . But Fokker 's chief hope for the future lies in building a jet successor to the F27 . Already in wind-tunnel tests are models of the short-haul twin-jet F-28 , which would cruise at 500 m.p.h. and carry 44 to 60 passengers . To appeal simple to operate . " The underdeveloped countries will hurdle directly from DC-35 to jets , " predicts one Fokker expert . Fokker hopes they will hurdle into the F-28.
