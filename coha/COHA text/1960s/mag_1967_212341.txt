The state of scholarship at most Negro colleges has generally been so low and the students traditionally so placid that the schools have rarely rated any kind of national notice . One exception is Louisiana 's Grambling College , which has long had a reputation as one of the nation 's most prolific producers of big-time athletes . But the demanding new mood of Negro students is no longer satisfied with athletic fame . Grambling student leaders recently shattered the serenity of the piney-woods campus in such a forceful protest over what they call " a second-rate atmosphere for learning " that National Guardsmen were summoned-and discontent over the incident is likely to last for years . <P> Founded as a high school in 1901 , the college is a pleasant collection of neo-Georgian and modern brick buildings set amid rolling hills in the town of Grambling , whose 3,500 residents are outnumbered by the 4,153 students . The school draws $4.7 million a year in operating funds from the state-more per student than some of Louisiana 's white colleges . Yet Student Body President Willie Zanders complains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a Rhodes scholar , while other protesters charge that there are no " academic pros " on the faculty . <P> Better than Notre Dame . Grambling 's administrators find the school 's emphasis on athletics hard to deny-especially since President Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones , 63 , doubles as the college baseball coach . Since World War II , Jones ' teams have won 463 games and lost only 79 in the mostly Negro Southwestern Athletic Conference . But Grambling 's big sport is football . It has 20 alumni on the pro rosters this year - more than any school except Notre Dame-including All-Pro Defensive End Willie Davis of the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs ' defensive tackle , Junious ( " Buck " ) Buchanan , an A.F.L. All-Star . <P> The grumblers at Grambling do not berate athletics but contend that the priorities are reversed . Since 96% of the students are not athletes , the protesters have demanded that " academics be stressed first " and that students be given a voice in evaluating courses . The dissidents also attack " paternalistic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacks on coeds , and beards . <P> Boycott &; Blockade . The protesters recently organized marches through the campus , boycotted classes and blockaded the administration building for 48 hours . They scattered food and shattered dishes in a cafeteria riot , threatened a " lie-in " on the football field to scuttle a homecoming game . Jones , who has headed Grambling since 1936 , asked for National Guard protection , and Governor John McKeithen dispatched 600 soldiers to the campus . When Jones expelled 39 of the demonstrators , nearly 1,000 other students quit in sympathy but returned a few days later .
