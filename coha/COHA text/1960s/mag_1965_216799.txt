Fowler &; The Dollar <P> Sir : That was a splendid cover story Sept. 10 on Henry Fowler , a very dedicated man and one who is tops in his field . <P> PINKNEY G. DURHAM JR . Natchitoches , La . <P> Sir : The story on monetary reform is shoddy treatment of the issues , with oversimplifications and inaccuracies and misrepresentations . As someone who deals daily with problems posed by deteriorating currencies , I find it notable that plans for reform avoid mention of the most fundamental one-monetary discipline ! <P> GEORGE T. STEVE Chicago <P> Farm Report <P> Sir : Never in such a brief space has there been a better analysis of the " farm mess " Sept. 3 . I want you to know that we appreciate your outstanding work . <P> CHARLES B. SHUMAN President <P> American Farm Bureau Federation Chicago <P> Sir : Your cover story was a colorful puff on Charlie Shuman , but that 's about all . It is obvious that your reporters never got within a country mile of an honest-to-God farmer with manure and dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of farm organizations to solve problems . Most farmers belong to a farm organization only to participate in low-cost insurance programs or cooperatives , which are growing bigger all the time . The Farm Bureau itself is looking into the idea of buying a huge supermarket chain . Farm organizations are big business , as Shuman is aware . <P> HERB KARNER President <P> Newspaper Farm Editors of America Tulsa , Okla . <P> Sir : As past president of Newspaper Farm Editors of America , I found your story well done , much more balanced than farm people usually see in national or big-city publications . Thank you for bringing out some highly important facts that the public seldom hears about . <P> BILL HUMPHRIES Farm Editor <P> The News and Observer Raleigh , N.C. <P> Sir : Your story is a cogent and objective presentation of a complex subject . But under no circumstances can the National Farmers Organization be classed as rightist . Neither is the N.F.O. loath to accept government direction or largess . <P> JAMES C. THOMSON Editor <P> <P> Prairie Farmer Chicago <P> Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent story on Charles Shuman , a man I 've long admired . It was an accurate , fair account of agricultural problems and the Farm Bureau 's position . <P> <P> KEN McINTYRE <P> Harwood , N. Dak . <P> <P> Traffic Solution <P> Sir : Your Essay " Ode to the Road " Sept. 10 has accomplished the impossible . It has solved the traffic problem and at the same time presented the Government with a new , lip-smacking spending program : just think , a subsidy to car manufacturers for not producing cars . <P> PHILIP C.
