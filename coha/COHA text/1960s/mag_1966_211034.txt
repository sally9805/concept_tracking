Lighting the panoramic horizons in every direction , insatiable tongues of fire lapped steadily across Alaska last week in the worst series of forest fires that the state has seen in nearly a decade . Culminating a summer in which more than 200 fires have occurred , the biggest fire of all raged around the Fortymile River 's West Fork , consuming the black spruce , cottonwood and paper birch and turning the green hills to barren black . At week 's end , six other major fires spreading across a 500-mile arc still ravaged the nation 's largest state . <P> As Large as Rhode Island . So far , the fires have devastated more than 650,000 acres of woods and tundra-an area roughly as large as Rhode Island . One fire jumped the Taylor Highway near the Canadian border , making the road impassable at times ; others raged along the Alaska Highway . Around Fairbanks , smoke from the Salcha River fire 45 miles away became so dense that visibility was reduced to half a mile . The mining town of Chicken on the Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been burning for more than a month ; the flames were stopped just two miles out of town . In north central Alaska , a fire near Bear Mountain on the Koyukuk River was also diverted just short of the Eskimo village of Huslia , but it burned on . <P> The Bureau of Land Management used almost 2,000 men to combat the fires . Six hundred men equipped with bulldozers , helicopters and Army personnel carriers struggled to contain the West Fork holocaust by bulldozing a line in its path . Smoke jumpers , some of them imported from Montana , parachuted into the forests with digging equipment ; six converted B-25 bombers dropped chemical retardants on the fires . 150 Years to Grow . Normally , rain controls the blazes that start each summer , but this has been an extraordinarily dry season for Alaska . Chicken , for example , has had no rain since early May . Though lightning started most of the blazes , the woods are so parched that any ignition will do . The Goldstream fire 30 miles west of Fairbanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe , and an artillery shell fired in military maneuvers is believed to have started the Salcha fire . <P> <P> Part of the affected territory is uninhabited wasteland of little value , but much of it is valuable timberland where losses will amount to millions of dollars . For Alaskans , money and inconvenience are not the only toll : they worry about the wildlife that is endangered . The West Fork , Cement Creek and Matson Creek fires are burning through some of the finest caribou grazing lands in the state . The herds feed on forest-floor vegetation called " caribou moss , " which takes between 100 and 150 years to grow .
