The School for Scandal , by Richard Brinsley Sheridan , is a kind of dramatic harpsichord . It has surface vivacity rather than inner strength . It has elegance of style rather than profundity of substance . Thumped by realism 's heavy hand , it would jangle and go mute ; stroked with exquisite artifice , it enchants and amuses . The present import from Britain , top-starring Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson , is iridescently enchanting , contagiously amusing . <P> Gielgud is Joseph Surface , the hypocrite as moral snob , a kind of holier-than-thou heel . Richardson is Sir Peter Teazle , a crusty , crestfallen bridegroom in his 50s , loving , but not loved by , young Lady Teazle ( Geraldine McEwan ) , a predatory country kitten so sure of her city ways that her voice seems to be crunching canary-brittle . The ostensible question is : Will Lady Teazle cuckold Sir Peter with Joseph ? But Sheridan is less concerned with virtue in peril than with vice masquerading as virtue . In the famously comic screen scene , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's library , it is not her folly that is impugned and exposed but Joseph 's bad character . All high comedy is a deliberately moral unmasking of moral pretense , the ultimate poseur being Society itself . <P> What Gielgud the director brings to The School for Scandal is a sense of how the play traps the constancy of man 's frivolity in its high-polish comic veneer . Gielgud the actor evokes an entire social structure with the delicate flourish of a snuffbox . Richardson et al . are similarly and superlatively good . The cast is sumptuously costumed , but its kingliest array is English speech , heard with the ringing clarity of fine crystal on a U.S. stage too long debased by caveman playwrights and actors who are masters of the grunt , the mumble and the slur .
