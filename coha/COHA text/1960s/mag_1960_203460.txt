By land , sea and air , a capacity crowd of 42,269 San Franciscans last week flocked to see their baseball Giants open the National League season against the St. Louis Cardinals-and to help open their last-word , $15 million Candlestick Park . There has been nothing quite like it since the Romans , who had to struggle along by chariot , converged on the Colosseum . <P> Home in the Horseshoe . Since Candlestick Park is on a peninsular sort of culdesac , many a San Franciscan feared a traffic jam to end all traffic jams . But on opening day there was not much cause for worry : Candlestick 's 8,500-car parking lot was left 2,000 shy of capacity . Dreading to drive , hundreds of San Franciscans came by seaplanes , helicopters , sail and motor boats . It was all remarkably orderly. * <P> Candlestick is built for the customer-particularly if he happens to have a fat billfold . In the section known as " the Golden Horseshoe , " and selling at $500 per place for the 76-day home season , each box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on call , waiters ( last week the waiter service was not quite ready ) . For San Francisco 's often chilly weather , there is radiant heating under the seats . <P> Shells in the Eye . At first , the only persons with reservations about Candlestick were the ballplayers . Candlestick was apparently contrived to make the worst of San Francisco 's constant winds . Said the Giants ' Willie Mays , after clouting two monumental drives during practice and seeing them land , wind-slowed , just short of the 397-ft. leftfield fence : " This park is too big . Somebody 's gon na get some salary cuts around here . " Said Giant First Baseman Willie McCovey , after his initial experience with wind-blown debris from the stands : " The peanut shells kept getting in my eyes . " <P> But after the first two games , the Giants , at least , began to agree with the fans about San Francisco 's new park . In those games , the Giants beat the Cardinals by 3-1 and 6-1 , on three-hitters by Right-Hander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giant : " This is a park for ballplayers . " The Cardinals felt differently . Said St. Louis ' Stan Musial : " You 'd think they 'd ask a few ballplayers before they built a park . " <P> <P> * The exception that proved the rule , in spades : Hilary Belloc , son of British Author-Historian Hilaire Belloc , was letting out the anchor of a 36-ft. ketch when the chain tightened , cutting off half of his ring finger . While Belloc went on to the ballpark and got the remaining part of his finger bandaged at the stadium clinic , his 16-year-old son Martin searched in the shallow water , finally found the missing half . It was delivered to the clinic after Hilary Belloc had left , and was placed in a Dixie cup . Outside the park , Belloc heard that part of his finger had arrived back inside , tried to re-enter Candlestick by telling a gateman his story . The reply : " That 's the best yarn I 've heard today . " Turned away , Belloc got in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one to put the finger on . The clinic dispatched a motorcycle patrolman , with finger in Dixie cup , after Belloc 's cab . Finger retrieved , Belloc went to a hospital , got the finger sewed back on , returned to Candlestick Park to watch the last seven innings .
