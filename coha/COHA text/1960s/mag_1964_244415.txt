Even though they can expect precious little support from the leaders of organized labor , Republican politicians remain generally reluctant to take on the union bosses in direct conflict . Last week Pennsylvania 's Governor William <P> Scranton proved himself a notable exception to that rule . <P> In a speech to the state legislature , Scranton blasted Pennsylvania labor officials as " demagogues " whose actions are " blatantly political and frankly hypocritical , " whose weapons have been " distortion , half-truth , and a complete disregard for the future of Pennsylvania and its people . " Indeed , said Scranton , these labor leaders " crucify both the unemployed and the working men and women of Pennsylvania on a cross of falsehoods . " <P> At the time , Scranton was arguing on behalf of a bill that he proposed to reform the state 's unemployment compensation laws . Unemployment among Pennsylvania 's 4,584,000 work force stands at 8.2% , well above the national average , and the state compensation fund seems headed toward bankruptcy . Scranton would close loopholes in the laws , require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund over five years . Some 30,000 small businesses , with little labor turnover , would pay less than they do now . Maximum benefits would be increased from $40 to $45 weekly , but fewer people would be eligible , and benefits would end after 30 weeks of unemployment instead of 60 . <P> Scranton named no names in his assault , but Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O . President Harry Boyer felt certain that he knew whom the Governor was talking about . Boyer retorted that he would like to discuss the issue with Scranton " in a dispassionate and objective manner-singularly absent from his address . " Boyer 's organization , of course , vowed an all-out fight against Scranton 's reform proposals . <P> Since Scranton is prominently mentioned as a possible G.O.P. presidential nominee , his speech set off speculation about how it might affect his national chances . The likely answer : no harm done , and perhaps some good . Big Labor , after all , sends few delegates to Republican conventions . As for his political position in his own state-well , he won election in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor 's leaders .
