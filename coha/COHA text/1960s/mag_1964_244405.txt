COMMUNIST faith is materialism ; Communist history is a chonicle of materialist promises deferred . The first TIME story on Russia in Volume I , Number 1 , March 3 , 1923 , reported a famine in the Soviet Union and U.S. help in feeding the hungry . The first TIME cover story about a Russian , on July 14 , 1924 , dealt with Aleksei Rykov , President of the Soviet People 's Commissars , who had just issued one of those typical , promissory reports filled with soaring but questionable statistics . This week 's cover article on Leonid Brezhnev , President of the Soviet Union , is TIME 'S 70th on a Russian subject . It was written by Michael Demarest , edited by Edward Hughes , and reported from many quarters , but principally by our Moscow bureau chief , Israel Shenker . Despite great changes in Russia , the story has remained essentially the same : present economic crisis surrounded by hopeful incantations about the future . <P> <P> Our 70 cover stories , appearing over a period of 40 years , sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war years it was the Russian generals and marshals who often appeared on TIME 'S cover , many of their names-Budenny , Rokossovsky , Timoshenko , Voronov-now half-forgotten echoes of an era when the U.S. desperately tried to believe in the good faith of its Russian allies . There also were the artists , from Prokofiev and Shostakovich to Evgeny Evtushenko , always on the brink of political disgrace . <P> <P> Above all , our Russia covers constitute a gallery of dead men . Trotsky , who appeared three times , was killed in 1940 by the agents of Joseph Stalin , who in turn appeared eight times before he died in 1953 . The ninth cover story offered this epitaph : " He might have boasted in the words of the Roman song honoring Emperor Aurelian : <P> A thousand , thousand , thousand men <P> I alone , a single man , have killed . " <P> Many other Russian cover subjects were liquidated , physically or politically-Beria , Bulganin , Malenkov , Molotov-after the emergence of Nikita Khrushchev . He made his first appearance on TIME 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Economic Reform Program , again-and still-struggling with the perennially sagging Soviet economy . Soviet Russia is always ready to create heroes , as in the case of the cosmonauts , and always ready to forget them-if not physically remove them from their tombs . One of TIME 'S Russia covers presented famed Shock Worker Alexis Stakhanov ( Dec. 16 , 1935 ) who was then being celebrated as a Hero of Labor . " Pass the champagne , " the story quoted him , " for our last drink . " He has long since disappeared from the Soviet scene , and the word Stakhanovism is no longer used to connote extra effort , but the hortatory spirit is still there , along with the cheap champagne that fails to make up for so much else that is lacking in Russian life .
