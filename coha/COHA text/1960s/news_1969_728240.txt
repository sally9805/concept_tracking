txt Premier Eisaku Sato dissolved the House of Representatives today and scheduled general elections Dec. 27 . He moved before national enthusiasm generated by his Nov. 21 agreement with President Nixon for the return of Okinawa to Tokyo 's control had been dissipated by issues closer to home . Student unrest and the steeply rising cost of living are among these issues , ? and they are expected to play a prominent part in the upcoming campaign . But the most important question in Japan today is what kind of nation her people want to be in the nineteen-seventies ? whether the alliance with the United States is to continue , what role Japan is to play in Asia and how she will measure up to the responsibilities inherent in having the world 's third largest economy . Most political observers here expect the Liberal-Democrats to keep the 272 seats they hold in the 486-seat House and to gain up to 20 additional seats . The Socialists , deeply divided between Marxists and youthful rebels , are expected to lose 20 to 30 seats . They ! now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , political affiliate of the militant Buddhist Soka Gakkai organization , is expected to do well , increasing their representation from 25 to 45 or 50 seats . The moderate Democratic Socialists probably will keep the 31 seats they have . The Communists , asserting independence both of Moscow and of Peking , hope to increase their representation ? four seats  --  to over 10 . There are two independents and 17 vacancies in the present House . Mr. Sato , in speeches both before and after his visit to Washington last month , had repeatedly projected a new image of Japan as a nation of 101 million homogeneous people , controlling all their ancestral lands , except for the Sovietoccupied southern Kuriles . This new Japan , Mr. Sato said in a speech to the House of Representatives yesterday , intends " to firmly maintain " its security-treaty relationship with the United States " over a- considerable period of time . " In other words , Japan will continue to rely on the United States to serve as a " war-deterrent force " in the Far East and will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . Partnership With US . ' Mr. Sato said he considered " partnership with the United States " ' as the foundation of his Government 's policy . The leading elements of this policy , - es set forth in recent speeches , are that Japan is responsible for her own conventional defense ; that the United States is responsible for areawide " delerrance " and that Japan 's is o ' play a leading role in Asia , not Militarily but through substantial and rapid increases in economic aid to the developing nations of this area . However , the questions that were posed in the House today by the three major opposition parties  --  Socialist , Democratic ' Socialist and Komeito  --  showedi ' deep suspicion of the role Mr. Sato envisions for Japan . They . foucused on fears that , as Elichi Nishimura , chairman of the Democratic Socialists , put , it , Mr. Sato might have agreed- to " involve himself too deeply " on - the American side in the EastNest confrontation  --  opening tip the possibility of embroiling Japan some day in wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Okinawa. - Mr. Sato hesitated for weeks : before taking the action today ; till the last minute he kept joking that whether or not to dissolve was like asking the Americans to disclose whether or not they had nuclear weapons in Okinawa . But clearly House members , both in the Government and in the opposition , were ready for the move . They had served three years already , and the scheduled return of Okinawa ! plus the question of whether to continue the security treaty beyond 1970 gave them the required issues with which to go before the electorate . The normal term of the House of Representatives , which together with the House of Councilors constitute the Diet , or parliament , is four years , Only the Premier has the right to dissolve , although in form the Emperor , acting on the Cabinet 's . advice and consent , does this . The imperial order dissolving the House was brought into the ornate , brocadecurtained chamber rolled up on a tray and covered by a purple cloth . In prewar days imperial rescripts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takechiyo , the Speaker of the House , took it and unrolled it with his bare hands . Speaker Is N.Y.U. Graduate The 80-year-old Mr. Matsuda , a graduate of New York University , read the brief message from the Emperor : " Under Article 7 of the Constitution , the House of Representatives is dissolved . " Then the House members raised their hands in traditional but perfunctory banzais . Komeito members did not even bother to make the gesture , and one LiberalDemocrat walking out of the chamber was heard to remark : " Why do we banzai a dissolution , anyway ? It 's a silly custom . " Another , pointing to the maroon and gold rosette in his lapel signifying his status , said : " This rosette ? it means nothing now . We are all exmembers . Until we win the election , we are just candidates ? nothing more . See you all here in the new year . " Smiling broadly , he swept down the corridor to his caucus room .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
