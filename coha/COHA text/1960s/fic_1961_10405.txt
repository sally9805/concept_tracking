would not know why she could never believe him  --  he was childless . But she would know that I did what the child must do  --  hunt for the quick of the parent , and pierce there . " Please believe it , " he said . " He did it against me . " He does this for her too , I thought . How chary I have been to admit it  --  the real motive . But this , that he tells her now , she surely can not believe . Then , as I watched them , as the door inched slowly toward me in its reverse arc , her arm came up around him . I saw her head nod , not in sleep , her eyes close and reopen , and still nodding , she held him , kneading his bowed shoulders with her good left hand . The door came between us like a curtain , leaving me outside it , outside them . Once more I had forgotten to impute the motive of love . Three days later , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had no need to spend the intervening hours in arrangements . My effectswere few and I had always planned to take less ; I was going where abundance was . In a great city , personality itself is to be had for the making ; this is the deep , real reason that carries a clever provincialthere . And in my summertime dreams of my arrival there  --  fantasies bred while I worked at the market , never seeing the hawker'scolors of that evening bourse already undergoing its own fatal change  --  I saw myself arriving in a dawn whose steel-flushed outlines and avenues I had already studied , saw myself facing that chemically rising light with nothing but the brain that had got me there . I could have wished to have awakened like a foundling on one of its paving stones , naked even of swaddling clothes , or to have rubbed my eyes open to those complex rays like some gay stripling who has slept all night in a doorway , and now finds himself hungry , powerful and healthily amnesiac , remembering only his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange preamble of nakedness , under edict in Tuscana , here . The words on the piece of paper had been these : I want himaway . Tell him I do not hold it against him . But I want him away . Nothing further was said , nor was the paper itself mentioned by myp201uncle again . The paper had vanished ; he seemed to assume that I had seen it , that I would do the right thing  --  and that I would know what the right thing was . Only in retrospect does the simplicity of that last seem extravagant . For I did know . I knew that my mother wanted me to leave at once , and without seeing her , without her having to see me again . One learns from the hurt one inflicts as well as from the hurt one suffers  --  this is a lesson elided in the popular self-help primers of love . And at my mother 's bedside I had learned that it is not the victim in us that needs to turn away . My uncle , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he merely registered a cough  --  that dry , aphysical trade-mark of a man who collected neither crotchets nor colds  --  a cough without ponder , a mere punctuation . I think now of how long I lived with it , despising it as the tic of an inner aridity  --  that sound which instead marked time for him while he chose from his heavy store of honesty the least gnomic reply , the answer that would least trouble others with the weight of themselves . " Best , " he said then , " best for all of us . " And then , before he had time to warn himself , cough again quickly : " I knew you would know to do that . " This was the first he had addressed me since our exchange in the hall . " She should have known , " he had said then , and now  --  " I knew . " His blunt expectation , even at this late date , of the best from me , was something new and astringent , masculine , making me suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . How strangely he was making me feel , with his assumptions  --  was it he or I who had changed ? Confused , I waited for more . I did not ask him , as I ask myself now , how he knew . But he required , gave , nothing further . Thereafter , while he absentedhimself from the mill until a nurse should be found , and spent all his hours with my mother , I was left to my vacuum . Except for the fact of going , I was already gone , disposed of as the consciousness must of necessity do with those , good or bad , who are about to be removed from our sufficiently complicated scene . There was no malicep202here ; it was character  --  of the twenty-twenty-visioned eye that , strive as it may not to make a show of anticipating the purblind , can not always keep from anticipating itself . It was the perfect ostracism , one that did not even turn aside . And the perfect punishment  --  for which others are never more than agents  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had wished for freedom from all ties ; now I was left to find out what that freedom was . Friday had been the day in court , Saturday the day I had told him my decision too late for the schedule ; Sunday there were only local trains . I would leave on Monday evening  --  a short interim , but more than enough time to explore the vacuum that has no clock . I often think of that solitary bout  --  it was my first . It was my first step into the sinkhole of identity . Every man , even the most coherent , the strongest , has moments when his foot sinks suddenly in that abyss  --  a voice asking , " Who am I ? " To which echo answers , " Am I ? " Lonelinessis a mere wavelet on that surface , a kitchenmaid 's word for a crater whose term of definition , if there is one , must lie among the philosophical  --  perhaps some black neologism that compounds them all . For these are moments that come by seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of a woman , of a child , of a friend in war , of any appendage of the heart or the body  --  is no vacuum . The sundered body is a bowl that fills with dark . But in the vacuum one comes , pas seal , to that farther edge of ego where , if one does not whirl away quickly in some pas de deux of activity , one might feel what only the dying should feel  --  the loss of loss . As everyone must , I was to find my own ways of dealing with this ; under the aspect of eternity all methods are no doubt equally absurd . But at that time I had none . Three feet away from me was the edge of the civilized world , but as far from my grasp as the far shore in a binocular lens . Meanwhile , flowers came for my mother from Miss Pridden ; some of them had time to fade . In my room I had already had for some days now Demuth 's parting gift , parting shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyleaf " Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit " had been elaborately inscribed . " Perhaps somedayyou will be glad to remember this . " What I remembered insteadp203when I saw it was that other tag , truism from the Schwabisch of his fathers , that other untranslatable , all-translatable sheep 's bawl . But that too came from a distant shore . I had meant to rise hand over hand on the single rope of myself ; now , without the asseveration of others , the rope disappeared . And meanwhile my uncle passed and repassed me in the hall . On Monday evening he drove me to the train with my parcel of books , my one bag . I had expected to walk ; his offer came to me as a surprise , a rescue . It was again one of the long dusks , the air cottonwarmand clogged , but I felt the wonderful , cool renewal of doing , as if I had been ticking away under a bell glass that now was removed . The traveler is crisp with organization , his very flesh hardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behind seem soft and idle in their lack of schedule , safely placed folk but fainthearted , already receding . Seated beside me in the car , my uncle as he drove looked so to me . At the main-line stop , although we were well ahead of time , the red signal was already blinking . The old huddle of sheds and lean-to 's , once piled against each other like domino counters , had long since been cleared away , leaving the ancient ticket office with its iron-ribbandedeaves , although one still had to buy one 's ticket elsewhere . There was no platform ; we would still have to cross to the track from the cindery siding on which a few other travelers were already standing , well back from the huge rush of air that would come with the train . The train stopped regularly now ; there were eighteen thousand people in Charlotte and Denoyeville , and more coming . But Tuscana still had the main line . A light summer rain began falling , welcome on the cheek , smelling of the reviving grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , regarded the sky and spoke of the night , that after such a rain might be clear . Voices were single in note but joined in portent , as they are in the open air and when speaking of weather . A bit of crushed bird 's egg lay pale green in the cinders near my shoe , and I felt the foolish softness , weak happiness of someone long housebound who is admitted again to the range of the seasons , under whose passing in his absencep204people have maintained themselves like sturdy blooms . From a distancea man wearing a hat and carrying a briefcase waved to my uncle , who nodded back , fumbling at his collar . He had lost formality , even neatness , in his nursing ; he had come out without a tie , and his shirt collar was soiled . Between its limp tips his throat seemed newly meager , and the underline of the chin descended in that aging tautness so particularlyhuman when , as with my uncle , the jawbone kept its youth . Far off , communicated not yet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hardening curve of the group waiting , we sensed the oncoming train . My uncle took out his watch . " Four minutes yet . " He held the watch overlong , warmed it in his hand , hesitated , ran his thumb over the chain , before he slipped it back in his vest pocket . Sometimes I fancy now that he meant to give it to me , tried to , failed . " We 'd have had time for a short one , " he said . " For luck . I had the bottle out .. . but I forgot it . " Forgetting that Mrs. Jebb had come over to stay in the house while we were gone , he had run back , just as we were leaving , to answer the tinkle of my mother 's bell . " Well . . . God bless , " he said , and gave me his hand . ' When we came home that day  --  " I said . " You were home before your time , before us . And you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , as we both knew , except for celebration . " Ah . . . yes . " Although the track was still quiet , his answer was almost inaudible . " You will not have heard . " Red tinged his cheek . " Blankenship has stepped down . " The train shuddered in then . We fell back in the smacked air . He is head foreman then at last , I thought , as I lugged my bag up the iron steps to the coach car . I remembered the bottle and pushed-back chair in the sitting-room window , on my aunt 's table the whisky 's slopped ring . Blankenship has stepped down . He had had it ready to greet her with when we greeted him with her . I turned to catch sight of him at the window and found him behind me . He had followed me into the car . " She will want news of you , " he said hurriedly . I nodded without speaking.  | " She will want to write to you . . . after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do it for her . " He coughed . " Tell me then  --  under what name ? " I looked down at the seat , at my bag . " The new one . " " Yes , of course . But I must not ask her . What is it ? " I stared , then gave it to him . Why did I not know him before , I thought ? Neither will he speak , neither will he press others to . He repeated it , spelled it out , tested it . " Pierre Goodman , " he said , not a hint on his face , and nodded . This was the first time I had heard it spoken aloud outside the court . It half felt as if I received it from him , as if in the moment of parting he for better or worse dubbed me with it . The train lurched and he turned . I followed him to the end of the car . There was something I ought to say , but I had no idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train paused again , he clung to the iron handhold of the coach . " Well , God bless , " he said , and swung himself down . The train grooved a few yards down the track and stopped again . Other travelers in the car were leaning out of their windows in the superstitious concentration of the leaver , exchanging with their people on the siding the nods and smiles with which each reassured each that he would be brooded upon until perspective bodily removed him , that not until then would either lean back , even in sorrow secretly relieved . I leaned out with them , though not as far as the rest . He was still standing there among the others , our opposites back there on the cinder path , but his face was hidden by a taller man . Timidly , half hoping I too was hidden , I waved . The tall man moved aside . An exclamation , some formless syllable , came from me , one of those sounds , mysterious to their makers , that unnerve us with the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too far for speech , and I saw that my uncle was not looking at me . He had remained , perhaps out of that inflexible , median courtesy of his that would not allow even the offender to leave town unspeeded , but he was looking , not idly , at others around him who , absorbed in their aye 's , were not noticing him . It seemed to me that his face that could not change had changed . Distance , much more swiftly than I had expected , wasp206showing me its alchemy , teaching me how little apart one needed to move from a man . I thought of the map of the world , of those nervously dotted lines of communication between two places whose simultaneity no speed could outwit , of how two men , dotted next to each other , were not unlike these ; and for the first time in my young life I ascended to that grim cliche from whose height all philosophers , lovers , friends before me had gazed down . For the first time since I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since that last day when Frau Goodman had refused me what I could not even remember , since I had been born , perhaps ) , I thought of it not as my safety but as my prison  --  that all of us , man beside man , friend beside friend , should so incurably coexist . The train moved again , pulling me backward , forward , away . I could see my uncle clearly . He was looking at me now . Surely his face had changed . He was waving at me . Good-by . I leaned out with the rest , as far as the rest , but in the moment that I might have , I forgot to wave . For in the moment that the train , gathering speed , suddenly bore me away with a centrifugal lurching , I had recognized him . Then , like a pinpoint scooped from behind , he vanished , a man of whom I could have asked , whom I could have trusted never to ask  --  the confidantI could have had , the last man on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two ahead we stopped again . I had had no time to do more than sit stiffly within my new name , revelation , the way a boy sits in a new set of clothes , half reluctant to disturb or discover the unfamiliarseams of his housing . Then the lights went on and the two conductorscame down the aisle in their grave , ticket-taking antiphonal , one repeating the passenger 's destination to the other , the other sticking the proper replacement ticket up above . " No , ma'am , " I heard the forward one say , " dining car stays on until Memphis . Just taking coal on here . " Then they came to me . " New York , " said the one in front to the one behind , scrutinized my sheaf of tickets , tore off one and returned it , while his aide placed a long red ticket in the slit before me . " Forward cars only going past Memphis , " said the first one . " Pretty crowded up ahead now , though . You better off shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the talker and hisp207mute , carrying on the craft-ceremony that from then on in all the travelyearsahead never failed to confound and amuse me  --  to require two of them , and for such solemnity , there surely must be more to what they did than met the eye . I watched them in the first of these fascinated puzzlements ; the only other great train I had been on had been the one that must have carried us from Montreal to wherever we had made connections for Tuscana , and all that belonged to that period of hearsay , which I had never yet been able to recall . At the end of the coach they turned and came back . This was the last car . I felt a thrill of confirmation that it should be ; in my reveries " leaving " had always begun just that way . This was my luck beginning , I told myself , my peculiar , personal brand of luck , and indeed it was  --  the chance , fledgling move of an imaginationunorthodox but always earthbound to the possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in foreshadowing events in its way half compelled them . I walked to the rear of the coach and let myself out into the open , onto the short platform of what in my ignorance I thought of as the " observation car . " We were carrying no freight ; there was no caboose . I could look back unobstructed . This was the way I had always imagined leaving  --  looking back from the observation car of my first great train . Behind me the lights went out in the coach and all along the train , blotted out now to a dark serpentine curving far ahead and to the right , between the end where I stood and the engine , uglily knobbed and pygmy-attended , appearing now and again in occasional flashes of red and white , like a magic-lantern slide of a hippo being fed and watered . I knew where we were now , although since the place was approachableotherwise only by roads under construction , I had never seen it . We were in the uncompleted railroad yard that had laid waste a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years plumed themselves on their safe escape from the dams , then had scattered agitatedly before the maw of the dragon called " eminent domain , " then had settled back fatly to advising less fortunate ones to sell out now , even if they had to sell off to niggers , and join them in their newly industrialized lives . The yard was to be an enor/mous catch basin for the toppling traffic of freight sluiced in because of the dam . It was the first such expansion of the railroad in the memory of any local ancient , in this queer new kind of pioneering in which steam no longer opened up a country but followed humbly after more demonic powers , in which townsmen who had moribund rail stock certificates in their bureaus raised their heads again at the thought that the trains might still be the land-language of the nation , and no one , under quiet skies where a steel wing still drew upturned faces , could conceive that the next language to die for us might be the land . For the change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geography , energized into the pocket , was still thought to be only in the terrain ; those riparian banks , convoluted to the heavens , edged by dainty lines of light that outshone day and at night made them look like impenetrably risen Atlantises of the air , were still the land . We must have remained there for as much as twenty minutes . Trainmen ran past us with the special lanterns that as a boy I had always wanted to examine , hold in my own hand . Here and there along sets of track that fanned in every direction , others probed and swabbed at the undercarriages of coaches strewn like huge building blocks between drums of wire , concrete mixers covered for the night , and holes that sent up the strong troll-smell of freshly excavated earth . Farther back , away from the incessant shunting of the front lines , in the dead , starlit aisles of the freight cars , yardsmen slunk suddenly from them like huntsmen from blinds and stooped over cupped cigarettes , over their shoulders the long , faded mottoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only silence needed to melt their Munchausenhorns . I watched , spread below me the vast , smudged final impression of a Biblical woodcut in which I , raised and imperially hidden on my platform , was like the presence concealed in the cloud . " Hotbox , " said one of two men going past me with lanterns , and I envied them the pygmy lore of their black trade and wished to penetrateit , as in the cobbler 's shop I had sometimes wished my fingers tanned or emeried close to his tallowy secrets , or on waterfronts would one day wander past the ship chandlers and wish myself initiate to the creakings and joists of the sea . Yet it was not any of these **25;2444;TOOLONG I wanted ; what was it I would ask for if , as in the Bible pictures , there were an angelic being , its cheek puffed with prophecy , in the upper right-hand corner of the heavens  --  a demandingvoice rayed from a cloud ? Above us , the night was clear , as the travelers had predicted . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks of the dam site were visible ; I was north of them now , they no longer enclosed the world . On each of the two a searchlight of a candle power that erased the humble thought of candles swept toward us at a minute 's interval and disappeared again , passing its pale field upward over the motionless cirrus-sheep that ranged the blue . In that pale federal light even the heavens were neutral ; nothing might ignite there without being seen . Beneath it , on the crest it protected , I could see the fine , suave sodium air of a no-man 's country . There no men ran like burning crosses , no crosses stood like running men who burned . Back of it lay Tuscana , whose little collection of spore-lights I could just see through the divide . But there , on that one strip , the swinging alternate had annihilatedthe bitter and personal dark . If by a like alternation I could annul the bitter personal of my boyhood , then was that what I should ask of my angel ? To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire the gift of tongues but never choose one . To make a noman'scountry of the past . Ahead of me lay all the variorum of living , into which , if I was to step freely , I must do as the parvenu does , who halts only to drop behind him in some crevice his old bundle of the past . For back of me too still lay Tuscana . To hate it would still be to choose it . To hate it would be to stay . So , standing there on my platform , that is what I prayed to the angel . If memory is what keeps us , what saves us from neutrality , then allow me , who can not forget , to forget . For it is memory that keeps us where we are , what we are . If to forget is the cardinal sin , the only failure , then for once let me commit it . For once help me to fail as others do . Allow me to forget . Make this fade . When I raised my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train too could not quite decide . Then we gained speed . As we swung north , northeast in a wide arc , I saw the little collection of spore/lights slip from view . Next the dams faded , showing me how even the four corners of a world could recede . Ahead of me the train gave tongue , as if it had at last made up its mind . It was the long wail , half resigned , half triumphant , that I had heard every night there of my boyhood , the sound of the to-from Memphis train . After a while it was silent . We were running through all those small towns ahead that night after night briefly shone toward it , briefly waned . Above us , in relative motion , the cirrus clouds streamed backward , away from us , yet stayed . And in a dark patch in their center , there was Tuscana ; I saw Tuscana , keeping time with us too . I leaned backward from it as if drawn by the hair , but it leaned forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stratum so thin that perspectivevanished , and I could see it now as never before . It rode lightly with me , that bitter and personal dark . Desire and injustice were there , and people flowing toward me like analogues , and feelings rubbing together like knives , all the shapes of life at their game  --  he did it for her , she did it for me , and I did this , and I did nothing  --  hand over hand over hand . It was there that I had found others were necessaryeven to me , the listener , where I had begun to imagine how peoplemight even hoard trouble in order to feel . Where I had come to the resolve that even if people should be for me always too late or too soon , too open or closed , too near or far , then living itself was the privilege , and interest alone would carry me through . I looked back at it for a long time . Now that I was truly leaving it I could see it most clearly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had left it . I opened my eyes . I looked back at Tuscana and it was beautiful in memory , as are the faces of all those we leave.  |p213So  I shouldered memory , and set out to be a man . Since , like the young everywhere , I had been bred by preceptors who wanted me to believe that life was conducted by choices , I still believed them  --  out of the wonderful disorder that confronted me , no doubt a retributive god would one day demand that order be made . But , like all my fellowpupilsbefore me , I secretly assured myself that that day receded dimly ahead  --  dim as my own death . Our mentors either did not see for themselves or could not bear to say that with each move we would make or that would be made for us  --  and with each permutation thereof  --  the choice was already being formed . So it would happen to me  --  as to all of us who , whatever else we were , were unreconciled to living unexamined  --  that memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuum in which we found ourselves to be floating , it would come to seem the one autonomy we might still retrieve . So , between what I have done and what I have not done , I have come this far . And I begin to see how the chronicle is made . What we do not do persists , classic and perfect , beneath what we do . The final admixture is the judgment.  | . AND so  --  I have written to Ruth . Very morning-clear , that small , lower-case " so , " after thepneumatic , midnight three struck chordally down the precedingpage . I use " pneumatic " as one might expect the part-time pedant would , in the old theological sense of having to do with the spirit or soul ( pneuma  --  the Greek " breath " ) , and yet with a chuckle for its modern usage too  --  " filled with air . " Not that I decry those three others ; they have produced the fourth . Where will it take me , that sudden cap to the winds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is after all quite simple  --  amazing that the switch had not taken place before . For I have been sojourning down there for a long time now , on that long skin-dive into the nether regions of myself , learning to move about in that intense , direct elementof motive which underlies the upper atmosphere of acts . Most men shift about in partial glee , discomfort , behind the facades they see themselves presenting to others ; I differ only in always having been able to reach a minim or two more accessibly behind the facade I present to myself . But one finds  --  or rather , the exquisite , reflexive sanity of instinct finds for one  --  that one can parlay that accessibilityp215only so far . Time up for air . The foray is over , not forever , but for now . For in whatever way I am aberrant from the average , I am not , any more than most , a Jekyll-Hyde . My " split "  --  that cocktail party profundity  --  is no more than the next one 's , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite aware of each other . I have never indulged in much thumb-twiddling over my basic sanity , either in parlor games or in private . Even in adolescence , when the very elasticity of any decent brain  --  its almost felt growing  --  is often a wonder and a worry to its owner , I seldom teased myself with that semidclicious question , " Am I mad ? " Within the unreasonable limits of my species , and the quanta peculiar to this hour in its history , I am sane . Man is a schizoid animal . And Socrates is a man . What has happened is that I have been returned to what , for want of a better term , one must call the daytime mind . A misnomer of course  --  it is rather that part of the mind which moves , according to its own style and accomplishment , at any hour of the twenty-four . Daytimeis , however , its quality . It is the part of us that can mock  --  if it does not wholly mistrust  --  the midnight phrase . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bottle , offering me two forked paths to the absolute  --  one bushy with exaggeration , stalked by the hypertrophic banditti of midnight , and one in which the serious is minced down to the companionable , birds in their nests disagree with jurisprudent irony , and melodrama is put out of countenance by the clear humors of morning  --  I know which I should still have to choose . But for the moment I am removed to the satiric distance . And from it I can see that I am still bound by that insensate word " choose . " As if one could choose between the parts of the whole blood , between the red and the serum , decreeing that only the one shall flow in the vein ! Yes , Socrates is a man . And no one seeing only the " I " of these pages might suspect how antic and buoyant he can be on occasion , how reasonable a citizen of the lower-case world . When I awoke this morning it was , as usual for these past weeks , somewhere before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at about four , stretching out each time in the quiet , sweated relief of a man who is at last at grips with the contretemps which has hoveredp216for years . Each night I had experienced the same seven hours of intensesleep . Normally I dream the good citizen 's mumbo jumbo of the day 's palaver and anxieties , mixed with whatever hints from the vesicles are at hand . But on these nights I slept as if clasped around some chalice that led me from one night 's pages to the next , even the sexual abated in that process , profounder than any autoeroticism , by which I hoped to be regenerating myself . Mornings I awoke into the alert , whole faculty of childhood . City walks by day were no more than sanative plunges from desk to garden , in which passers-by exchangedtheir dioxides with me as impersonally as flowers and I took my meditation among them as the philosopher takes his to the company of the phlox . Each night , reading back on the work of the previous one , I learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each night found the continuity preserved . But this morning , awaking with the start of the malingerer , ears uneasy against the practical echoes of the street , I bounded upright , like a man on holiday who hears the business clock give a sudden , loud tick in the heart of sloth . When I stretched my cheek at the shaving mirror I did it intently ; I was preparing this face for people , and I drank my coffee in the citizen 's modest twinge of retreat from a not too pedestrian dream . Only half awake , as on the groggy mornings before this account began , I could already feel the lack of that deep supportive reverie on which I had floated for so many days . Being gone , its loss is already difficult to describe . It is a sensation known to the good swimmer , drugged almost to the point of no return from his own amphibian ease , bobbed suddenly to the vertical by his ruthlessly mortal lung . His ear drumming with the depth that has nearly murderedhim , he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his garment , and he meets with a shock of sadness the warm , terrestrial pull at his heel . Gravitation warmed me ; I felt saved , but empty of what had been snatched away . Now I felt the familiar urge to lampoon myself , the rising barrage of acrid comment by which a clever man reminds himself he is not a fool . Reaching for the Times , nonexistent on the kitchen threshold , I marveled at how many days there had been , almost a month , since Ip217had canceled it , asking myself now if a man of this time , this place , this ilk could be said to exist without . If the Times says it is n't going to rain , this ca n't be rain . It was not raining , however , but a brilliant morning , the sun spreading like butter on the front of the house opposite , whose flat , limestone-clay color has always obscurely pleased me . A sound truck went by , braying some exhortation  --  to the cinema , to the spirit , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not November but April . And it is Tuesday . I ran a finger along the morning 's deposit on the sill ; yes , this has the look of Tuesday grit . You know very well who , when , and where you are . Day for the cleaningwoman  --  no , cleaning lady , one of the trusty serf-shadows who flit city-wide and only for bachelors , leaving Mehitabel notes useful for breaking the ice at your parties  --  a shadow vaguely Czech , dimly sixty , whom you have not met in the flesh for years  --  was it for her that you shaved ? Outside , in the back garden of the house next door , the superintendent , a richly oily Italian , hitched his brigand stomach , chirked at his dog bac bac bac Baccaloni , and shook his lovelocks don don don Giovanni at the sky  --  all against your private knowledge that he has a Scottish wife , a red-nosed stick of a child always screaming for " swayties , " and was himself born in Throg 's Neck . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you often switch from " Freude ! Freude ! " to " La ci darem la mano . " Yes , this is the morning mind . It has its own diapason . By its wry self-apostrophe a man convinces himself that he holds the reins ; with a thousand surface iridescences it lures him back to the representational world . Do not belittle its powers . It too is " the mind . " And its chief power is to deny its own matrix , to laugh at the demiurge . " Listen , " it says in its cranky , comedian rattle , " we 're not alone . Always somebody under the bed . Whoever told you we were ? " " My dear sir , " it says in a clear , eighteenth-century ratiocinative , " may I present my allies  --  and yours  --  the city , roaring so gently ; the Times , always so ready to fill a gentleman 's empty mind with the issues proper to his station ; and that entrancing garrulity of your era , the telephone . All at your gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philologicalp218joke between us that petarder means to break wind . ' " And so to its French . " Solipsiste ! " it screamed , with the same rancor with which it might have said , " Sodome ! " And then , in softer , chemise-colored tones , " Pauvre solitaire . " Last came the blunt croak of the sportsman it is  --  " Look ' ere , what 's that pogostick you 're ' oppin ' abaht on , call it your singularity ? Picked it to place or show ? " And then I stopped , or tried to , for who can hope to prestidigitate as it does ? As well try to duet with the world 's best harpsichordist , with Chinese back-scratchers tied to one 's hands , and from three feet away . Let it play ; you follow . Most manage that way most of their lives . I drew an experimental breath , and yes , the quondam depth I had come from seemed sunk almost to the nonsense distance  --  all the doggerel of sense dropping lightly to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed from my painter friend Maartens . Looking through the kitchen doorway , I could see down this long room  --  the old ballroom of the house , with a musk of conversationstill in its linenfold and a ceiling high enough to accommodate the fin de siecle . In the dimmest corner  --  farthest away from the oasis of gaiety in the bay , where drink , music and shadow screens interpenetrate their boxes behind a previous occupant 's sofa ( dropped on their modern manner like a Crebillon joke )  --  is this desk , shyly battlemented beneath the books . On it I could see these pages , arrested  --  by some silently sliding safety door of the will  --  before they had come to the incriminating matter . Nothing much was in them as yet except that peccavi , common enough since Rousseau , by which a man might subtly work himself over to the demonstrably good side in the course of revealing his bad . Should I burn them then , as Maartens , in an access of overcritical rage , disgust , or fear  --  whose terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting ? Or should I do as he , get away before the destruction and take a therapeuticturn with what he calls " people outside " ? Of whom , to him , I am one . Those periods are when I see him . I imagine that there are many outside the arts to whom Maartens is " my painter friend , " kept much as a doge might have his dwarf , a cultivated Philistine " my poet , " an alert politician " my Jew . " He bringsp219the dark , dye-pot range of his artistic difference just near enough for them to dip their fingers in its fascination and congratulate themselves against its dangers . When he tells them  --  with seeming naivete and actual insolence  --  that he seeks their company because of their difference , they are flattered to find themselves in possession of what they never knew they had . And finally , he reassures them , since he happens to be an exceedingly ugly man . Maartcns , I 'm certain , has only a callous , professional interest in his own tints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pink , bladdery nether lip and exophthalmic eyes ( whose red-lit brown I once heard him call , in his precise Dutch voice , as he sat for himself , " the exact color of a bedbug who has just eaten " ) , they are comfortably reminded once again that beneath any exaggerated effort to compose the world in order or beauty , the specific neurosis is plain . Maartens rests me . I made his acquaintance without guile and he has none , having as little facade , beyond the skin , as is possible . This is in part because words have no aura for him outside their use ; he uses them for whatever , by the usual covenants , they can perform . Magic lies elsewhere for him ; although he is not physically nervous , I 've grown accustomed to seeing him wander a room not his own , aligning objects and colors , or cavalierly shutting them away , and except in those periods when he ca n't work and is seeking the company of the Philistines for that obverse service he hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees the human only as another kind of " arrangement . " Nevertheless , it 's at those times , when his power " to make , " as he calls it , deserts him , that he develops a certain uncanny ability to plumb its habit for others , the way a countryman , in the city and sick for home , can speak of it like Theocritus , for an afternoon . " Yesterday , " he tells me , " I was at work . " Then we sit a while in memoriam , as if he had just said , " Yesterday I was alive . " Fairly soon he will begin to tell me how it happened , but only in order to be able to dwell afterwards on what he has been exiled from , the way an Israelite , to whom Canaan is as much remembered as promised , might haughtily map its milk-and-honey rivers , not to a kinsman , but to some Gentile stranger who has no hope of it at all.  |p220He  sighs . " Did you happen to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asks . I remark that it was thus and so  --  last time , that it was nice . " Nice ! " he will say . " Superb ! Baked by a pastry cook who put on another flourish every half hour . Cordon bleu . I noticed , " he says with a certain emphasis . " Wind , girls , buses , everything . I spent the whole day at it . " Earlier in our friendship , when he first sought me out at such a time , I would have asked " Why not ! " receiving the answer reserved for fools : " Not with the upstairs eye ! " But now I know that old saw of his and I nod . Suddenly he smiles  --  Maartens is not witty as we verbal ones class wit , but he has the broad humor of those who , lash about as they may , have an ultimate faith in themselves . " Cecile says " ( she is his wife ) " that I always act just the way women do about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or feel the whole world in the small of their back , or see the pimple in the mirror ; still , twelve times a year they will say to themselves , I wonder why . ' And I 'm the same  --  I never see it coming . " And the next morning or the one after , his lapse comes . In the studio , he does not go as usual at once to the canvas , always faced to the wall , away from all eyes but his own , and turn it about , as one uncovers a child . The room 's happy confusion , ignored these six months , worries him . He spends the morning leafing through what judgment has abandoned or completed , roaming his lifework with a housewife 's sour , prophylactic stare . When he can no longer avoid it , he goes to the last canvas and turns it around . And now , shrugging at me , he throws up his hands . " Bad ? " I unwisely ask , and he gives me another of the looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is nothing , neither one way or the other . And now he begins what he has come for  --  to describe , with the sweet roweling of memory , what he has lost . The canvas is the eye , he said once , the eye on a string from the navel . The string one can drop and pick up again . But what he has lost lies behind . Stretching his lips around words , he brings them forth like a dog that , howling for itsp221master , develops human speech . And like the dog , dangling his slack leash , he noses me back to the studio , snuffling at the fled footprint , saying " here " and " here . " " Did you burn it this time ? " I cast a glance at a small work of his , hung over my mantel , that I bought last year . No , he answers , not this time . He has locked the door on all that order , given the key to Cecile , who cries , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stair , and come here . Inside the closed studio , as he makes me see it , the wind streams under the sash like a continuous peal of laughter , bearingin that pointillist surface which none can ever hope to abstract or diffuse . Somewhere back there too is that lost land , lost depth from which he has tried . He falls silent , despairing of its description , that pure , angry country from which a man can presume to pose a four-byfourcanvas against the Augean confusion of the world . " Demiurge , Number Three , " I say . That is the title of the picture over the mantel . " Oh , for God 's sake , Pierre , " he says , " that 's a dealer 's word . The dealer insisted on names and we got it out of the dictionary at random . I like the words that come before and after just as well , " he says , grinning  --  " demitasse , demirep . " Already his voice is a little more arrogant ; in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes . " No , " he says . " To make . That 's as far as I 'll go with you word-mongers . To make . " " Only an auxiliary , " I say . " Make peace . Make money . " " Basic , " he says , getting up to go . " Make water . Make love . " I watch him go down my staircase and stop at the landing . " You know what Cecile shouted after me when I left , " he says , lookingup . " Burn it , why did n't you , ' she says , you fldneur , the ones that are left will only be worth all the more . ' " I laugh , and he joins me , for since he is already being collected by both bankers and museums , that is probably true . " What will you be doing now ? " I call after him , but he has not heard me . On his febrilely merry " Be seeing you , " the door slams . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall . For what Maartens will do now will be to bury himself , at first desperate , then with calculatingp222fervor , in the nonvisual world . He may be heard of as attending a music school six hours a day five times a week  --  he is a fair cellist ; on another of his " tours , " as he calls them , he will earn his certificate at a cooking school  --  two uncles were chefs , on the Swiss mother 's side . On his afternoon visits to me , he becomes less and less expository ; he is forming his secrets again , nursing up his slow , fruitful anger against " the people outside . " It is at that stage that one meets him , as I did first , at their parties , drinking in as if it were elixir the heliumated gabble of those who do everything but make . He listens with interest to their version of him , how to one he is a primitive , to another an artist made healthy by his " hobbies , " to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , Maartens , " says a lady lay psychiatrist , summing him up , " he lives everything out "  --  and she gives him the smile with which the viviparous are regarded by those who have learned , like Jove , to give birth only from the brow . Maartens says nothing but one hand nurses his stomach  --  he has rather a tidy pot  --  the way pregnant women do , and I amuse myself with the surmise that he is congratulating himself on having a navel , in the specious presence of so many who might almost be imagined to have none . For what is he doing there if not using them , by night , as by day he uses modes of expression that are foreign to his , as he would haunt even the world of the blind in order to be sent back with force on his own ? And on one of these nights one meets him in that gay-dreary little backroom cloaca of all such parties . He is looking down at the bed and there is pity on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counterpane , for that touching pile of pupa-cases left in the back room by those who expect so faithfully to find themselvesangels , breathing the Zeitgeist , in the front . As he tugs on his muffler , however , he is muttering expletive in one of his languages  --  dirty Marseillaise lingo maybe , or outhouse Flemish , or perhaps only the universal guttural of nausea . Be seeing you , he says with some embarrassment , for we both know that now he will not . He has got it back again , that hard and temporary country of his dominion . Will he remember from there that I have listened and half understood him , beinghalfway between him and those others outside ? Of course not.  |p223Were  I to call the next day , Cecile would tell me that he is at work . And the messages he sends from there are indiscriminately for all . No , I thought this morning , one does not call upon Maartens . He does what he can by doing what he must  --  while the rest of us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk and looked down at these pages . Through the open sash the greening wind of April riffled them , turning up on page after page the same watermark  --  footprint of the self up from its own depth and pacing its own cubicle  --  I , I ; I , I. I gathered them up roughly and held them over the grate . They trod a circle , but until they crossed its center could I burn them ? Or would they plague me forever , bringing me round again to the dead-end bar at midnight , to the point at which I sat down here and began ? No , until they bore up their trophy they would not burn . Yet even the most doting autobiographer must feel the shame of the ceaseless monotone that to others is only " he . " Was that why the morning wind had brought me Maartens ? The satiric distance has its uses even for him , I thought , and on an impulse to dramatize it , I put down the papers and went round the room snapping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning woman who , imposingher Grundy code , would tour the room again pulling them severely halfway down . Then I flung open the window , leaned on the sill , feeling the hot purr of the sun , and regarded the world . From where I was , am now , one can see only the back gardens of these brownstones . No one was in them at this hour . The superintendenthad gone , and I regretted him . My own voice must be a croak ; for weeks I had used it only when buying food . Behind me , the pages shifted under the breeze , and turning , I gathered them up and slid them into a drawer . One of the heavy spring-binders knocked against the telephone , loosing the steady dial tone . I let it whine on for a moment , then replaced the handset . That tone must be immediately annulledwith a number ; it is not bearable company . In the silence I had an urge to hear a voice , any voice . Urban children , I gather , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondrous rags-anddiamondbag of the directory and hold surrealist conversations with strangers  --  I knew who had told me that , her arms clasped around herp224knees as she rode that charming hobbyhorse of hers , the peculiar delights of a city childhood . We did it as much out of wonder as mischief , she had said  --  we could choose from a multitude and spell one of them into the hollow of our ear . As if we were all together , she had said , in a kind of synagogue of the air . In the city a child is never far away from his fellows , from the vastness of man , she had added with a musing tenderness , and I had not answered , thinking that , daughter of such a father , such a home , she would not have been  --  but of how many there must have been who were . And I had thought of my own game , and of how close it was to that other . " Tell me some different things you did as a child , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did as a man . Now I looked down at the phone , in which hers and mine had been the last voices , and it seemed to me that it still held that residuum , sending up its bouquet of fear . I fear that I may trust . I knew the look of the page on which I had written that , and I had an impulse to lock the drawer . Lifting the phone again , I let the dial tone whine on . There should be a listening service , I thought  --  a mechanical presence that would record nothing , merely registering its attention now and then in suitable syllables . Thousands would use it the first day . And after due survey , it would be found that the same syllables were appropriate to all . Then I reminded myself of a safe number , ME 7 , and dialed it , with a grin for the animism still lurking for us savages in our most inorganic contraption  --  for what Plato would deny soul to an instrument on which , in certain places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the time signal , tiny ant-voice always climbing toward infinity . When you hear the signal the time will be . . . 12:59 . And always falling back again . No , I will do first as Maartens does , I thought , and closing the door without a look behind me , I went down the stair . Outside on the doorstep I shivered in my jacket , blinking at the house opposite like an animal up from its hibernation , then started walking . The air was cooler than it had looked from above , a pre-spring mixture of capricious sun and cool already passing its zenith and on its long afternoon trend downward to the winter ultramarine that was the New York color above all others  --  a blue hour , I had read somewhere ,  |p225of  a purity to be found nowhere else in the world , in a city , except Lisbon . I did not know whether this was true , but I flattered myself that I knew all the prototypes of day bred by this city between its waters and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could construct a semicelestialgloss , a new-sided kind of Diurnal or Hours in which those to whom a day was an entity still evasive behind the weather reports could find the " days of New York " numbered to the closest tolerance , weighed and named perhaps as the elements are in the international table , from actinium through curium , gadolinium , krypton , palladium , tantalum , wolfram , yttrium , and all the others that Demuth had made me learn , down to zirconium . It would be a listing like that one , susceptible to addition but rarely to change , and with no more poetic than is natural . Take the sidereal hour , I thought : angle unit of right ascension equaling 15  --  measured along the equinoctial circle . Let the standard atomic weight be oxygen at 16 . ( According to such measurements and others , herein this book is described , with addenda for industrial precipitations and all others short of cataclysm , a day for instance of such a blend of color , texture , mood , and other qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nonseasonal , opaque rather than overcast , from the air dull over the cardboard Flushing flats and perhaps faintly Bronteesque over the Rocklands , but in the sea-level midtown streets of a caressing , mutton-fat dampness as perceptiblypleasant and undemanding as a held-back , happy tear . Colors without penumbra in that atmosphere . Green especially rises to viridian . Ladies should not wear bluish-reds . Day without edema , good for the purchasing of shoes . No sunset . Evening will impinge without drama , dishes with some condiment recommended , a little fugitive poetry among friends , or the milder forms of conjugal love . No stars . ) This is the intensity of the convert , I told myself , as I waited for the long light at Park , teetering on my heels with a certain bland assuranceat knowing how much longer that particular light was . Alwaysa tendency to press on the natives those evidentials to which the latter were so informally born . That summer I had arrived here , a month before school began , I had tossed my clothes in the dormitoryp226room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes not from dusk to dawn , roving the streets with the same magpie acquisitiveness I had hitherto given to books , learning the city strata with a voyeur scholarship that had soon outstripped the obvious , until remarkably soon , thanks to youth , shanks ' mare and subway , I could botanize any neighborhood  --  until in time I could dispense his own heritage to the native , telling , for instance , a third-generation New York Jew , genus German , habitat East Eighties , of the Ankarese Sephardim in New Lots , of a street , not far from Hester , not quite Mott , where pariah Galitzianer had mingled with Eurasian Chinese . Even now , that punditry , though relaxed , is the only one I am not averse to displaying  --  for though an encyclopedist , like members of some other professions , is , after the American habit , much buttonholed for free in the parlor , I prefer not to draw too much attention to a mnemonic talent outside the routine . The light changed and I crossed , thinking meanwhile what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Christmas , with its evenly illuminatedtrees equidistant along the stream of cabs , it had only a barely standarized faerie , like a hotel salon trimmed once a year for the chambermaids ' ball . One might felicitate oneself , of course ; it was not every provincial who had learned to despise Park . Still , I thought , I was forever convincing myself into the city , mentally possessingand repossessing it ; for all the years I had been here I could never see its towers without a disquieting sense that I must regrow them for myself each day . This was not man 's universal reaction to cities , I told myself ; this was the parvenu 's trouble  --  always trying to forget what he must not remember . Or always refusing to remember what he must not forget ? How agile of you , dear harpsichordist , I thought , and how unworthy of both you and the old professor in the course you were so proud of taking in your first year here  --  " Metaphysicsof Vitalism and Pragmatism , " and his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note how little grist was ground by paradox . I turned a corner down a street of embassies , one of them painted the same buff , yellowish cream , slightly grimed , as the house oppositep227mine . I stopped in front of it . Answer me this , then , I thought , still apostrophizing my bright morning musician , there are n't many such houses in New York , and I do n't find any connection  --  why do I find the sight of this one so pleasant ?  --  answer me , you who know so well that free association is never free . Ah , it answered , if one could travel the whole world , know every recondite cave and the tops of all the topless towers  --  as should soon become possible , even laughable , as men find their own planet only a miserable insectarium in the garden of the sky  --  then to such a traveler all places will be analogues of one another . From the boundless store of his impressions he will turn up a bit of yellow Mississippi mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Portugal 's , in the Himalayas , cornered perfect in its monastery , a day out of your gloss . With that terrible weight on his shoulders , any Canaan of place will be lost to him forever . To the man without further hills , who can see on both sides of the horizon , all places will become less dear , none final . No , I will not admit that , I answered , and staring again at the house front , I thought  --  perhaps it reminds me of hers . But that was absurd ; hers was the old brownstone like mine , which , when sanded back to its quarry color , as the Mannix house had been , has a henna-violet tint in the evening and in the last flash from the west almost a carnelian  --  one can imagine a row of them then in their heyday , inflamed by the late-century sun . For a moment I stood there and imagined them . I have always preferred their era to the skinny-shanked nineteen-twenties so favored by this one ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . They too had been all but eaten by the time signal , I thought ; then , how absurd to take flight , as I had done each day , from this neighborhood of their ghosts . Under that aspect , what could it matter , the conjunction of a soon-to-be-ghost woman with a similar man ? No , I answered myself , one does not go down to that subcellar and pull the centuries over one 's head . Between one 's appetites and one 's dangers , one moves on . Down the block a few stragglers waited for the bus . When it came I pressed forward with them and sat down on one of the long front seats that faced in . I knew the strata of the buses also , on these crosstownroutes always more mixed and original , with people less slug/gishly in context than they were on the avenues , men whose selfprimingtouches to hat or collar suggested that their confidence was out of its district , women who worried at each signpost and clutched their purses like women abroad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they vacantly back , no doubt registering the facts of me according to their own lights and preoccupation . Surely the nature of a crowd is that everyone in it thinks himself the godly observer  --  the others are always the crowd . But in the subway and elsewhere when men are disposed en face , it has always seemed to me as if , for the purposes of travel , each man subsides , in truce , to the homunculus . Here , in a subserving silence so remarkably without overseer , a man may examinehis opposite as if the latter were a bit of jeweled dirt , and for this no gauntlet is ever thrown down . And suddenly I was reminded of what my years here had made me forget , of how in those first weeks of wandering the city , what had surprised me , awed me most of all , was this great conspiracy of silence . In towns such as I had come from the streets are a constant ripple of nods and tipped greetings , a bath of human acknowledgment . And before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom all elders are a single , high sentry mouth from which one takes as scripture the handed-down distinction between the seen and the heard . But as I had first walked the streets of New York I had been filled with amazement . Here and there on the tenement stoops there were clusters , and the bicker of children . Yet even these people put their necks in the yoke when they went on the main streets , abroad ; a chance encounter with a known had a tinge of embarrassment at its edges , as if one had been surprised incognito ; even lovers and families fell proudly silent in a kind of disownment , and only the inanimate , unleashedand braying its triumph , gave tongue . It 's this , I thought  --  as the bus came to the end of the line , the driver said nothing , and we all disembarked  --  that makes the countryman say he can not bear the noise of the city . What he finds unbearable is the non-noise of the human . A clump of schoolgirls came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . They were speaking to each other but really to " the gallery " hungp229in each heart like a collective valentine just opened that morning . They rolled past us like a huge sweetmeat ball sugared with giggles , leaving an eddy of smiles or annoyance behind . We dispersed around them , each of us taking his way alone , and as I stood looking down the long street with its busy rodent-fringe of shops , I could see perhaps fifty or more like us , a congress of fifty human beings passing each other as silently as if under edict , like people who walk about under some mutual concept that all assent to and none has authored , under a ban of tyranny or war . I turned westward with some of the others , toward the Hudson . How sunshine muddies the thinking I thought ; the absurdity is mine . The city merely makes demonstrable , in broad daylight and in numbers , the final distance between psyche and psyche , between C sharp and D flat , between one and one . A distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as the naked bum blesses its trousers  --  when abroad . The city is nothing more than anonym on the avenue , in place of anonym at home in double bed or at family table , at his analytical desk or on his painfully self-examining knees . This is the feverish sensibility of the truant still tied to his memoir , I thought  --  now it 's time to go home . Nevertheless , I continued walking . Ahead of me on the broad thoroughfare , two or three of my compatriotson the bus were still with me going my way  --  and perhaps one or two behind . Did I really wish to know them , and why ? Ego , no doubt , in part  --  the concatenation of thirty-five persons and Mr. P. Goodman on an east-west bus on a particular afternoon in the year of our Lord , April , either has a significance toward which all their past lives have tended them , or none  --  in which case neither has he . In which case neither is he . Or who ? But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy to know them all , not themselves but their single story in all its variable , in each of which perhaps there was a chip of mine . And if I could , I should have wished to know not only theirs but all the street 's and the city 's , like some emperor , sadder and less satiable than Alexander , who knew that the world to be conquered never ends , being round.  |p230Behind  me the footsteps dropped off . Up ahead , only one of the crowd on the bus still led me , a small , elderly woman hobbling along with jerky neatness , as if her long skirts concealed an endless wheel of paper-doll feet that one after the other came down . I trailed her , if only because I have always had a hard time making myself let go of the casual , knowing how subtly afterwards it may be seen to have woven itself into the choice . Then too , we were approaching the universityneighborhood and this gave me a practical reason  --  I have always been adroit at finding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with myself . If I can not approach through the depth , I thought , then I shall probe downward through the surface  --  even if it means doing as the encyclopedist does in the office , even if I should have to record the " I " as if it were another 's , as if it were " he . " And these blocks , though not for long , were the next environ in the memoir . The woman ahead , eyes bent , was covering the ground with the tortoise intentness of the elderly . She turned into the doorway of one of the large apartment houses that front the river there , her slow pace allowing me time to make my direction nonchalantly hers . This too was the impersonal advantage of the city . We stood together inside , in front of an elevator that descended somewhere above us with a servile sighing , like an omen that had to please everybody . I knew these old lobbies well , their ochered Ionic plaster and dirty marble from which the corporation had long since removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving behind only what could not be removed and was valueless  --  their echoing , anachronistic space . Above , the middle middle class lived with its pretensions and its roomers , the professor housing the student , the salesman hanging on to his debts by his expense account , while their wives , hunching their collars through the Puerto Rican side streets , protested " the river , the park for the children , " meanwhile keeping up an elegy in tune with the elevator  --  " running down , everything running down . " The old lady , about seventy , had the classless neatness peculiar to some elderly women , flesh faded serviceably toward soap , past creme , long since pensioned off into its black . I had a fancy that she lived here ; this neighborhood , as I knew from my college days , was amongp231other things the habitat of the in-between relict of indeterminate age , ancestry , and bundles . One passed them so constantly , each under her artifact , a black hat , shaped like a pot or a dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that after a while they became the same one , recurring like a figure on a willow plate of blurred , indefinable pattern , or on some humble karma wheel . The elevator was a long time in coming . I studied my lady as one might a shell plucked from a beachful ; her eyes were cast down . Faint iodine stains on the white hair told of blondeness fifty years before . A long nose , patient with its own length , a Hapsburg lip , slightly trembling , one Manila paper bag  --  was she dispensing or receiving ?  --  on which thick leather gloves with a gift shine to them firmed themselves now and again to a crackling in time with the lip . Her cheap scarf caught my eye ; there was always something . Printed with clowns and balloons in the crudely coy dime-store art intended for children  --  chosen by a child perhaps , or borrowed from one . She might be academe 's widow or salesman 's mother-in-law . She might be anybody . This was her mystery . To the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I picked an imaginary destination  --  Gerber , i oA , on the top floor , from which I might then walk down , taking a survey perhaps , hunting a room  --  I had no plan . It seemed odd to have none , after so many years of meeting , as strangers , those with whose dossiers I actually was so often secretly armed . But here , of course , I had no intent to enter her life past her door . Madam , I am investigating accident . Specifically , the accident toward which all our lives may have tended us , and , except for my action , veered us away . I intrude no personal acquaintance ; I crave merely a bit of cosmic gossip  --  what history it was sat so silently next to mine . Doubtless there is no connection other than the slight fortuity of existence . Pardon this amateur philosophizing  --  I attended school in this neighborhood , at the innocent age when such problems had force . The elevator door opened and I followed her inside , stepping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old Negro whose hat was his uniform , we were alone . Her form , bowed in front of me , had thep232simple , touching curve , drawn by a master , that comes with age . PerhapsI might hurt a fly , I thought , but toward you , rest assured , I intendnone . Nevertheless , as we rose slowly together , I felt a heavy sadness . Probing , I recognized it for the familiar , sad portent that comes to us when we are about to enter a relationship ; the shiver that comes even on the brink of love  --  as we descend knowingly toward what will change us  --  and will have its attendant crimes . As it happened , no plan was necessary . We stopped at the third floor . The old woman fumbled in her purse , then turned to the operator . " You know whether she 's home still ? I forget my keys . " " I du n no , " he said . " I don ' take nobody down from there since I get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They let him go out like that , " she muttered . " A baby . " She put her glove on the old man 's sleeve . " You wait , yes ? I give you a quarter anyway . " " Du n no if the super 's around , " he answered . " And he never give me no passkey . " But he waited . She rang a bell at a door down to the left in the dark hall . After a long interval it opened , to a muffled exclamation . We heard the old woman 's whisper , " I forget my keys to that place . I have to come back . " " Oh , for God 's sake , Ma , " said a voice , " that 's the second day you 've lost this week . " " You wo n't lose , you wo n't lose , " said the old woman . " I go back tomorrow . They do n't care . " " All right , all right . Well , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go down again . I 'll go sit in the park by Johnny . " " Now listen . How many times I got to  --  " The voice jammed , then went on . " The kid do n't want . He 's gone on eight years old . " There was another pause . " Well , " said the voice , " out or in ? " After a moment the door closed . The old man peered out of the elevator , then shook his head . " How do you like that ? " he said . " How do you like that ! She do that to me two-three times already . Ai n't never seen no quarter yet . " He put his hand on the starter . " Where to ? "  | " What 's her name ? " I said . " I see her around now and then , but I do n't know her name . " " Do n't know , sir . She ai n't a tenant . " " But she lives here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tote in for her , that th ' oney quarter I seen yet . " He chuckled . " But she ai n't a tenant , " he added fretfully . " Forty-eight tenants here . Got enough on my hands keeping track those . " " Oh , she rooms then . " " Eyuh , she rooms , " he said . " Got her a room in her daughter-in-law- 's house . " A buzzer rang sharply . " Coming , " he muttered , and looked at me again , inquiring . " Ten , " I said . " Ten . " We rode up slowly , the cables sighing . How easy it was to follow , I thought . Got her a room in her daughter-inlaw'shouse . On the way out , I slipped him a dollar . He looked at me , mouth open . " Some of her quarters , " I said , and I heard his " Yessuh , yessuh ! " break into chuckles as the door clanged and he went down . There was a window wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sill for a few moments , looking down at a court , a side street , and the riverside park . Up here the wind brought in a steady precipitation , settling on my arm , grinding like carborundum between the tiled floor and my heel . I knew this day too at this hour , the long , straight shadows peculiar to an island rectangular , as if the side streets , in dark , animal file , advanced on the avenues , and at one strike of the lights fell back and fawned . I still felt the portent . The lone history I had forced my way upon had not slaked it . Down below , the crowd moving on looked speciously joined . Ten flights up , however , need not be mistaken for the aspect of eternity , I thought , and walking on tiptoe , but taking my time about it like a reluctant conspirator , I went down . Outside , I walked downriver . The western sky was peachblow . Underits drag of light , over the seal-colored palisades , one could almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the welkinp234was forming , a blue that steadily accreted toward the dome , toward that mythological center which never leaves our hearts , born as we are of a race of whom each must believe , against all acquired knowledge , that wherever he stands is under the apex of the sky . Once more it was the hour of other people 's assignations . One grows to know , sometimes very late , that the private phenomenon one has nurtured so secretly in the breast is common to all . This hour that had grown along with me , up , up from my childhood , that I had brought along with me from Tuscana , had long since come to seem to me especially identified with the multifarious city  --  the hour when the lights went up willy-nilly in every breast and the unlucky held their breath at the sight of the lucky ones streaming by car , on foot , by wire toward their love or even their hate , their ambition , their piety  --  somewhere . I turned my back on the river that doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall as suggestively as a sky , and walked rapidly eastward through the blocks that led toward Central Park . The streets were mediumly soiled here with a living , neither high nor low , that lacked the black , bituminous drama of impoverishment , and people moved on them still in the convention of silence , but under the pre-lamp , powdery air of evening , one could find a rhythm in that susurrus , as if they came forward in coda , subscribing toward a silent tune . The phlox were moving . They came forward singly , in pairs , and single again as I was  --  the vicious , the sweet , the broken and the indomitable , all intermixed , as who knew better than I ? But my back was to the light and their faces touched to unison by the sunset compline . The ordinary were advancing ; this was the ordinary thing . Once more I looked in at their window frame , this time holding the old woman 's history in my hand like a bit of jeweled dirt that had begged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They bloomed quietly toward me and past me , face linked to domestic face in that temporary gilding , each moving patiently under the small arc of its personal death , pitting its slight shadow against the interplanetary sky , shadow to shadow , speciously joined . I walked hopelessly faster to annulthem , like a man pacing his hitherto perfectly controlled garden and caught there by a sudden hallucination in which bushes burnp235voices , corollas clap their tongues and the power of the inanimate pollinatesthe air . Shadow pressed to classless shadow , they surrounded me and passed me , and I hurried through them as if I were in danger of being snatched into the orbit of the wheel they turned on , drawn forward into the blur of the willow plate . Then the street lamps glanced on , spreading a garish light even more reasonable than day , and I escaped . Through the park I met almost no one  --  a late mother wheeling one child and hurrying another , two mounted police , their heads and their horses ' eyes front , like monuments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slouch and sidewise peer of the slums , who shrank together , hands ganged in their pockets , conspired in excited whispers , and ran off in the self-induced paranoia of some imaginary , adolescent chase . After that I was alone until I reached the exit . There I turned and looked behind me , where there was no one . I listened for him , in the dark hollow of the archway . For him , for them , for whoever it should be . It comes so quietly , the counterstroke hidden in ourselves . I had never feared to be followed . Now I wished it . Three blocks over eastward , I hunted up a stationery store where I might buy my paper . Nowadays a real stationer 's is a rarity in New York , except near the business districts . These crannies are somethingelse again . Tucked in some narrow nook lopped off a larger one and soon to have their trade lopped off altogether by the drugstore and the supermarket , they survive like the last crazy-corners of the off moment , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Small people necessarily keep them , sweatered old men and women , emerging from the mouse-life behind the rear partition , wiping the mouth with the back of the hand . As with a bar , they cater much to the intermediate ; Charon perhaps must keep such a place , purveying the late news and the final , obsessive bit of tobacco , the envelope to catch the midnight mail and the last telephone . There was no one behind the counter , but all its news wares lay disposed in front of it  --  these must be among the last stores in the city to dispense anything at all on neighborly trust . No doubt this is be/cause of the article they vend ; few who followed the news these days would not feel a grim , citizenly obligation to pay for it . I set down my coin , passed over the evening paper and took up a copy of the morning'sTimes , feeling at the same time the dull , required guilt  --  dull because it was so abstract  --  that any conscientious man felt nowadays when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataclysm slide by without him . It was a hopeless guilt , the newsprint conscience , formed in him by being forced to attend the vast panoply of struggle , crimes international and small passional ones , at which he could not assist . He must be present at every agony in the garden , able meanwhile to bleed with only a few . I folded the paper under my arm , thinking of how many such days I had let pass by unsifted through this strange , frustrate bookkeeping . Yet I had been no anchorite  --  at least outwardly ; from my undergraduatedays on I had made the average social gestures of my generation . In a mild way I had campaigned for certain of its enlightened causes that still seemed to have a center to be left of ; later I had fought its war as every young man does , singlehanded even in the absence of single combat . Afterwards I had tried earnestly to catch hold of any discernibleprong reared up now and then from the hetero-homogeneous mass of cause that remained . Along with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fealty or action ; in a modest way my name was available to certain rosters , my voice to certain committees and salons ; I had shouldered my share of those compromises by which the modem man of good will deluded himself that he was engage . Except for my bachelorhood and my somewhat unusual version of the subterranean departure that is in each of us , I could be the very model of the average cenobite , the community man . And I knew that under the mass of evidence accumulated daily against him , tuned in as he was to an enormousrack of sufferings of which he could at best anoint only a few , no medieval man had ever had to be as calloused as he . This was the daytime world . Actually he was absconding from it . Deep down under its superficially hale crust , each of us was keeping what nucleus he could . One might begin to suspect that there had never been such a racep237of anchorites in the history of the globe . One might imagine a host of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store a man stepped halfway out of the one telephone booth , holding the coin returned to him by the coin box , then reconsidered and stepped back inside . He was a short man with a neat fringe of clipped , gray hair , a good suit that ciphered all of him except the wrinkled network of anxiety around his eyes . The booth had a seat in it and he sat there  --  after doggedly dialing what I fancied to be the same number  --  as if he had been tailored for it , gazing absentlyout the door , his free hand vacant on his knee . Suddenly he hung up and tried again . I could hear the signal , not the " busy " but the " do n't answer , " and I understood his compulsion ; " not at home " but one dials again , persuaded that one has dialed in error ; in lieu of that one dials someone else one owes a call to ( if necessary going down the list of those one has neglected for years )  --  unwilling to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . I held back an impulse to pass him the directory . Here , phone anyone  --  here 's a Mr. James Sugrue  --  no , that 's a forbidding name and a Maiden Lane number , wo n't answer at this hour ; here 's a more sympathetic one , Mrs. Anamaria Perez . Watching the hand on his knee , so open , patently waiting to be listened to , I all but addressed it . If all else fails , here 's my number ; I 'll be home in ten minutes , and I understand this brand of telephonitis . Try this number in ten minutes , and at least for a momentthere will be an answer , the blessed gap when the receiver is lifted . No harm in these surrealistic conversations with one another . In ten minutes , try me . I was about to turn away when the man in the booth got up and left it , went by me with a tip of the hand that said " It 's all yours now , " and out of the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not always so craven to the conventional . But it is human to alternate , and at times the very fear of my own strangeness will as suddenly make me bow to what is expected of me . I went in . And once inside , I felt the satisfaction , both fierce and submissive , of one on whom circumstancehas forced what he had not courage enough to do on his own.  |p238Taking  out my address book , I riffled through it in careful pantomime . Some of the names were almost lost even to me , burning in the faintest of recollection . Others belonged to distant cities , although that was no drawback now in a world where the rictus of communicationhad been perfected , stretching all our mouths agape . Some were dead , except to address books like mine . I had never been able to erase any of them ; I kept them all . Still others , fresh and unrubbed , belonged to the present , in various levels : " Flow nice to hear from you ! " it would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And spotted among them were numbers , not many , belonging to certain sorties of the past , through each of which I had drawn a line . Hers was among these , still uncrossed . I studied them , sedulously avoiding the one . I 'll call Maartens , I thought suddenly , and putting in my dime , I dialed . He and Cecile were old hands ; my wish to remain incognito in the city would be received without inquiry ; no sudden conundrumin a friend 's nature could surprise them . The very bourgeois steadiness of the life they led made their place a beacon for certain tremulous acolytes of bohemia , less steady than they , whom one met there sometimes at dinner or of an evening  --  raw-eyed creatures ( " a very fine sculptor , " Maartens might whisper ) just getting over the drink , the dope , the breakdown , the girl . And like so many of my friends , they had never met any of the others . I grinned with relief as I waited , imagining Maartens ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to him , with the proper wryness , " What do you think , eh ? Yesterday I was at work . " All I needed was an interim away from the incessant scraping of my own awareness . Without a bit of company , the strongest of us sank into Schwl rmerei . There was a certain justice in this day 's ending in a bit of his . Then I realized how long I had been listening without an answer . There was no one in . Calm deserted me then , and I too began calling  --  first the Maartenses again , then a succession of numbers from my address book , at random . Hysteria forms , I suppose , at some point of refusal between ourselves and what we at last take to be implacable . And for me  --  as , I suspect , for many  --  a special hysteria resides in the machine , to which we have come to attach that final implacability which used to be reserved ,  |p239with  more dignity , for death itself . For the machine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as I did then , we rage against this . For , as I can remind myself now , I did not really choose numbers at random . I chose numbers belonging to people not quite vanished but superannuated : a faddish man I had once worked with and had dropped for overpressing me socially toward his " circles " ; two jolly , free-talking magazine spinsters of whom age , plainness and lack of much sexual impulse had made substitute aunts to the general ; one or two former girls of mine who had lived in the Village , the village of chancy , evanescent numbers owned by a floating population of such girls . They belonged , all of them , to that useful company in whose members one would never dream of confiding . At this hour , if existing still as I had left them , they would all be drink-hazy , drink-valiant  --  if they were home at all . None was . As I hung up on the last of them , several customers , off some bus perhaps , came in , deposited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store empty again of trade . Through the glass panels of the booth I could see the front windows , faintly barred with neon that cast a fakir 's light on the pens and inkbottlesbeneath . Night air came through the doorway , soft and remote as an animal 's pad on the palm . At his counter the proprietor rang up a sum on the register , then subsided again on his high stool in a semialertdrowse , his fingers poised on the glass over his wares like a man seated at a planchette . Once more I put in my dime and listened . For my own ends , I thought . And at last I dialed . Three rings only , but already relief , alien as a blush , crept over me ; because of her father in his wheelchair it was a household where there was always somebody there . And now that rescue was on its way I could afford , like most of us , to be contemptuous of it . The truth shamed me : that in this moment I would settle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , into the hollow of my ear . Even my past sorties into a life here , a life there , had been more straightforward . They had kept the line of demarcation ; they had come from choice . All that this day had brought me was what classically attackedthe anchorite in his desert , the desperate itch toward the mirage of others . I could almost have hung up now , understanding Maartensp240in fraternal sadness , itching for the more honorable dominion of the nights when I searched for myself . It was Anna , the housekeeper , who answered . The Mannixes are a family of a type that still persists in New York , finding its servitors early , while its own members are young , and keeping them on , often only one and for life , in a manner more steadfast and personal than that of the rich . One recognizes at once in such households the odor of stability , compounded of furniture polish and the other smells of good service , all blended with a faithfulness responsibly returned . Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the nineteentwentiesalong with their own children ; the brief interim of her own marriage and widowhood , long since quenched almost from conversation , had not changed her  --  certainly not her conviction that nothing which happened to her would ever be as important as what happened to them . When she answered , I had an impulse to hang up  --  it was almostenough that the machine at last had listened  --  but I had already said " Hello . " I did not identify myself but I could tell that she knew me , as I knew the waxy cool of the niche in which she stood  --  in the probable aura of one of the meals that unfolded as regularly from her as if she concealed a cornucopia of them in the wide , starched storehouseof her bosom . No , she said , Miss Ruth and her father were not at home . He had gone to a convention in London , and she with him , about a week ago . That must have been when she phoned me , I thought , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those restless eves of travel when , brave with going , one plucked at the string one was to leave behind . They would return in about a week , said Anna coldly , making it clear that any really loyal intimate of the household would know this . Only two months ago she would have teased at me like an auntie , her warmth guided , as all of her was , by what she saw on her mistress 's face . I saw the two faces as I had last seen them together . Honesty impelledme toward the one in the absence of the other . In the smallp241things , I thought , that do not matter . " This is Mr. Goodman , Anna , " I said . " This is Pierre . " " Well , my hosh , " said Anna accusingly , dropping all pretense . " Well , my hosh ! " Her glottal , Czech version of " gosh " was a familiar expletive , long since affectionately adopted by both the Mannixes ; I could hear them exchanging it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair . Yes , I had been away , I said . No , there was no message ; I would get in touch with them when they returned . " Come on to dinner , " said Anna , crafty duenna . " I got nobody to cook for meanwhile . " I was tempted , as I am always tempted to that house . Then I recalled where years ago I had first heard that " my hosh ! "  --  Walter Stern sayingit absently from his hospital bed , then , cheeks flushed , eagerly , givingits derivation . No , I was going away again , I said quickly , and thanking her , repeatingthat there was no message , I rang off . Other humps  --  like his  --  I thought , were inoperable too . Just then a jet plane soughed over the city , taking us all up for a second in its suction , and dropping us back again , each on his own mote of concern , each absurd pea . But it came too late to down me now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance , and striding out of the store without a backward glance , I walked rapidly home , exempted at last from the day . This flat is four flights up , on the top floor . Years ago , when I first rented it , the old mansion , newly renovated , stood empty , and I could have had my choice of the garden floor or any , but , still the stylite on his pillar , I chose the top . An elevator has long since been installed , but there is a small spiral of stairs in the rear that I often prefer to use . Duringthese weeks I have done so . Ritual has mildly obsessive uses for the solitary ; as I climbed the steps on these evenings I liked to imagine that each one advanced me as it were backwards , into the relative composureof the past . And this time I leaned as carefully on habit as on a trusted arm . Night was here again , returning us once again to the illusion of a hiatus in which the world stopped moving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city one could imagine seeing ,  |p242if  one had the proper ray for it , thousand upon thousand ellipses of memory circling like single birds . I am just on the crux of it  --  like a man bending over his own headstone  --  I thought ; I can not stop now . And walking up the last flight I visualized the shades half drawn and even , the desk cleared , the lamp set burning in the way invisible entitiesmanaged the task in a fairy tale . But when I opened the door the flat was dark . I snapped on the kitchen light ; there was my morning cup on the table . In the big room the shades were still up , the curtains wide on the floor-length windows through whose blue-black oblongs the lighted panes of my neighbors crowded interestedly , before this transgression of city etiquette , as if at any moment hundreds of inquiring rounds of faces might start up over their orange sills . Down the long room I saw the neglected stubs and ashes of the week 's living  --  books disarranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spring-binders  --  all sending up the odd sense of oneselfdeparted . No one had been in the place since morning . I turned on the sharp arc-light over the desk , leaving the windows as they were . A city flat is the thinnest of aquariums , whose element , half out , half in , I still perversely love . On the desk there was no usually propped note from the cleaning woman , large pencil script always written ravingly on a grocery bag . As I ransacked for a quick meal and ate it voraciously , calculating that my walk , deceptive as such often are in New York , must have been six or seven miles , I felt a flicker of orderly habit outraged . This was the second time Mrs. Papp had done this , after an unblemished record of three years . No doubt she would arrive tomorrow without explanation , as she had done once before . Yet it was not so much that she had lost her character as that I had lost hers  --  in the city one tended to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were the notes she left  --  the last one posed months ago here to a cocktail party : Tal lenlo . Aints oner cink . I smiled , recallingthe girl who had read it aloud , one of the researchers from the office , the sudden ferret brightening on her face , our laughter . Of course , she had said , with the authority of the best pupil in the class : Middle European accent , just take it phonetically . " Tell landlord . Ants under sink . " Later that evening , after a restaurant dinner with the rem/nants of the party , I had taken the girl home , since no other man had volunteered and on the lees of the drinks , had kissed her mildly at her door . She had misread the kiss as the long-awaited amorous tribute to that intelligence which would someday be so requited , and for weeks after , whenever she had managed to bring her copy herself to my office , her lame , grinding joke , " No aints under the sink , hope I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's note , like everything else , had had a place , small though it was , in the event-chain . And still my mind went ticking along in exhausting clarity ; they say the brain itself never tires but sits like a punkah set in the center of a house at the inception , eternally waving in its own sensoria , eternally clearing them , until the subject sleeps , until he dreams , until he dies . I looked down on the body that fed it , oddly matched , some would say , to its humors  --  the long , heavy-boned body of my grandfather and his farmer forbears , not the desk body of the natural desk man . I was pacing the room now , but each time that I passed the desk I avoided it  --  I , I ; I , I. There must be thousands of such journals , I thought  --  self-tender , scared of the present as it approaches , shut away . Stopping at the window , I stared across at the people outside . I had had my turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thousands like some ruddy philanthropist with a pile of stage money , knowing all the time , as Maartens did , that the minute one ceased to defend the self  --  en garde !  --  from the general , the importance of the picture , of the diary , ends . No , I will get on with it somehow , I told myself , and then if I must , move on . And breaking the circuit , I went to the desk and pulled out the drawer so violently that it sagged in my hand , spilling the manuscript in a wide fan on the floor . Cursing , I bent to retrieve it . The thin pages slid as I reached for them , and I trundled after on my haunches , damning my own clumsiness but relieved by it . And it was just then , as I squatted goose-fashion , that it came to me  --  snapped from anode to cathode quite without warning  --  that the old woman I had followed might have been Mrs. Papp . I must have remained squatting there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of self-ridicule , taking us dimly back perhaps to our preprimate days , or to our childish days at stool  --  ei/then way it is not one in which a man can deify himself . And during all these solitary nights here , that is what I have been doing  --  in memory we all deify ourselves . I sat down on the floor , spotlighted there in my circle of scattered paper for anyone who cared to look , and after a while I began to laugh quietly to myself ; if I had done so aloud it would not have alarmed me now . It was the present , bubbling up in me , humorousand healing , after so long , and it came to me now that I had been scared of the present all my life . I picked up an odd page and regarded it . What tunnels we breed for ourselves , I thought , when at any moment might come the assault from outside  --  death , sickness , and all the other taxes , including the ordinarythat crept like lichen , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years such a self-fancying authority on the variable , had forgotten this . I glanced up at the windows , unshaded as I had left them for her that morning . Let them all look , I thought  --  the others  --  and let me look too , to be reminded that the satiric distance is not one we impose on ourselves . Was it she , had it not been she ? But what did it matter ? I thought of Semple , toward whom in this welter of pages I had always been progressing , and had never yet put down . While I approached him , old dead accident that he was , all that time his counterpart , counterstroke might be approaching me . Memory , though still the powerful vehicle I could not desert , was not safety , and had never been . The present , stealing along my veins even now like some analgesic midnight sun , was the reverse of the medal . This was the variable , and I would no longer deny it . I began picking up these papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant to go on with them , even if I had to write by daylight , as one wrote the biographies of other men ; even if in them I might no longer be " I , " but " he . " In whatever way it had to be done , I would put Semple down . Gathering the pages , I put them into one of the spring-binders , where they looked  --  perhaps as they should  --  much like any man 's . Now that I had done so , I let myself fancy , glancing through the thin windows , that the opposite windows no longer stared back at me quite so unitedly , but came at me each humbled into itself , one by one , onep245and one , and one . I leaned out to look at the house across the way , a foreground floating separate from the crammed pearls of light around it on every side . Unlit itself , the facade moved forward from its nimbus , brooding at me with the clued familiarity of a repeated thing . London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered whether all these years here I had been living in sight of an image of another house , subtly remanded here , but in the same moment that other , oldest house came out to me , clear in its own cincture  --  a cobbled brown-andblackishbrick that any taste but memory 's would call ugly  --  not this pale evocation of Portland stone . The term had slipped in of itself  --  Portland cement , commonly called Portland stone . No , it was not that house nor any particular one , but merely one of the great colors of London , whose semblance opposite , faded by the diamond winters , summer meltage of a harsher city , still remained to obscure and please . I rememberedthem now , long crescents of such houses , laid like gray scythes along the interchangeable dusks , dullish streets of childhood that quake in a man 's mind and are still sickened for as a boy does for a lost , bad home . But I had not thought of them until I had thought of her there . The brain never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed the future except to know that as we advance , erect , upon the body of the new , we hold up the body-ghost of the old . I bent my head on my arms . At last I went to the desk and sat down . It took me long minutes to put the pages in order , several hours to read them slowly , as for the first time I did , from the beginning . The confidant'sconfidant , I saw how he had arrogated beginnings and conclusionsthat might be either , good assaults and bad . I heard him refuse : to listen except for his own ends  --  and doom himself eternally to listen . " Nothing one says face to face avails , " he had said  --  and I watched him look , from his hiding place , at every face that passed . When I looked up , it was the city hour that I have come to know so well  --  the hour of minor horns and major silence , and the constant expectancy of a theme . Absolutist that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat ; in London , where she dreamed , it was break of day . In my window panes the dots of light went on and off in the darkness , one ellipse of memory resting , the next waking . Therep246they are , I thought : I , they , she  --  we who so incurably coexist . Tiring , tireless , until the subject sleeps , until he dreams , until he dies . Until , before dying , he wakes . Is that what she dreams ? I heard her voice again , across the three thousand miles of air that I could annul in a moment , over the distance between us that no speed could outwit . " It 's getting light here , " she said , and I answered , " Here too . " " Have you gone ? " I said again , and she answered , " No , but I can sleep now . Keep  --  keep well . " I knew what she dreamed , and that it was more than the dreams of women , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake in time to cure one another . That this is all the conversationwe have . Time passes , I thought , invisible fluid , rosy and bitter , through which we suspend , can never return . It is the bystander . As is the natural world . When Darwin first made us look at our history , it was not the facts of our descent that set our teeth on edge but the anguish of our final separation from what once had been ours . From the green insentienceof the plant risen and reaped with its brothers , from the unpuzzledface of the animal living inseparable and dying back into it , from all that unconsciously waxes and wanes outside and beyond us  --  slow cactus , piled cloud  --  all saved from the knowledge that they are as impermanent as ourselves . For which we have exchanged this lambent perpetual in the skull , this responsible , ticktock , weeping flame . I looked behind me . Nothing was there except the blank page in the machine , the white , cataracted eye of the present , visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrote her the letter upon it . When you return , I wrote , I may have something to show you . The key word is " may . " No one , except his twin , can divine the hesitance of him to whom others have always seemed less important than he to them . Nevertheless , she watches , I thought  --  how easily I forget that others do . Downstairs at the pillar-box , its iron flange , wet with early dew , creaked as I tipped it and held it . She watches , I thought , and was comforted . She is the present , I thought , holding the letter , and I am afraid of them both . A car passed quietly , a second and a third , with the softly attentivep247sound that tires make on a damp pavement . The citizens were moving again . Then dream as they do , I thought , as she does , as perhaps you dreamed this morning . That we all belong to the same city , the city which is bedouin , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter fall , with the brush of paper on paper , on the others inside . Today , as I sit at the desk here , I face the sign , that reminder which , when I returned , I pinned on the wall in front of me , where it can not fail to meet the eye . In the encyclopedia office , where the seven and seventyof us sweep our mops against the sands of knowledge , the wall over every desk is covered with such reminders  --  clippings in type and in galley proof , in every print from Caslon to Goudy , not excluding that weakened but still tenacious imprimatur , the personal hand . Mine here is in pencil , in the large block letters with which we begin our rubric and end it . FALSE ENTRY . And now to Semple . From now on I shall not read back.  |p248IN  COLLEGE Pierre Goodman learned above all , as so many do , how to handle his humiliations . All around him others were pickingup those surface convergences to the center which would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor boy learningto sport his leather elbow patches with the same worn chic as the quietly moneyed , the rich boy learning to pretend , at week 's end , that he was broke . And Pierre , surrounded by so many who were at that temporarily protean period of their lives when a change of pose was as normal as a change of shirt , learned to bear his own facade more lightsomely , at times almost to the point of forgetting that it was there . It was a happy period , the lovely swaddling time in a company so sharply defined by age , so busy cultivating an intramural difference from the world , that his sense of a personal one could decline . Looking back on it in later years , he often found himself wondering whether even many an Oneida , Brook Farm , utopian blundering in the wilderness , had not really been harking back to this same shorter experiment of youth dormitoriedagainst its enemy elders , swapping clothing as freely as ideas , self-boundaries almost as freely as clothing  --  to that springtime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own curious way he was learning what the rest of them were  --  how to estimate , reserve , and refine his own publicp249impression . He learned , as actors do , that a simulacrum of passion , displayed with taste , is more acceptable to the world than the incautiousgaucherie of the real , also that it was more comfortable to himself . He was confounded to discover ( and quick to use it ) that in those very arenas where the world advised against pretense  --  the acquisition of learning , of honors , of love  --  the natural pretender often had a handicapadvantage . Luckily , if he was saved from venality , it was by other endowments that also seemed to him specious  --  his appearance , of which he had never been vain , and his memory , that he still took pains to hide . His appearance was good enough for vanity ; under the currying of the city it improved even more . What he had never counted on in his rare boyish broodings on mundane success ( one remembers that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of a conventional exterior . Exceptfor his unusual height , which became less noticeable as he consortedincreasingly with the well-fed and the racially intermixed , his looks , he began at last to surmise , were of that healthy " regular " sort  --  too sound to conceal the lacerations of too much intelligence  --  which inspired confidence in both sexes . Most people assigned certain physical configurations to certain psyches ; it was the median that most inspired trust . That his inner self did n't match their conception of his outer gave him a disguise which otherwise he might have been troubledto seek . And in the end this no doubt kept him more median than he thought he was . As to his memory , it seemed now to have found an environment ideally suited to its excesses , if  --  as he sometimes began to doubt  --  such these were . The university was after all a temple to memory , often its Babel . Pierre , concealed in his own expertise like a priest inside the confession box , began to recognize all the devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the amusement of watching the unoriginal steal their opinions from authority ; he grew accustomed to the confrere sadness of listening without protest to a radical intelligence forced to claim authority for opinions that were its own . From time to time he did both himself and benefited accordingly . By hiding what he owed to the spadework of memory , he could sometimes persuade the brilliantp250that he was of their company ; by openly averring it , soothe the secondrateinto the surety that he belonged to theirs . He was becoming that exemplary scholar who is suitable to each side and discountable by both . And being so , he found that each often sought him out privately . No warning musk of ambition seemed to emanate from him  --  people were safe in telling him the story of theirs . Socially too  --  and for much the same reasons  --  he became unobtrusivelysuccessful , never becoming violently partisan to one group , mildly ingested into the pattern of many . Being of the age he was , in the environment he was , it is to be feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he even preached . " Values " were being examined all around him by those still young enough to be convinced that they must do so , by elder instructors pretending that they still were . Later on in life he formed the habit of destroying personal papers as quickly as possible , on the grounds that they detracted from the power of memory rather than aiding it , but there was extant at one time a philosophical essay , written in his third year , whose thesis was that values were only the momentary " clotting " of alternatives . It brought him a second prize , a taste of the terrors of exposure , plus a number of inconvenient confidencesfrom those who are always waiting for some such signal to fall . Later on too he could recall that no such signal on his part had ever been needed  --  that if the bleating of the lamb excited the tiger , then perhaps even as a child he must have had the reverse power  --  a silent cub , unaware of his own stripings , whose orange aura drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life he no longer resented his portion , even pursued it . As with most young men , and young civilizations , the technique of anything attracted him . If , then ( as he told himselfintoxicatedly at this silliest , most ordinary period of his life ) he was perhaps destined to be an eminence grise to someone or some section of society as yet unidentified , he might as well perfect himself now . So , reminding himself that self-interest was the most palatable compromise of any , he accustomed himself to listen once again without rancor . Certain tonalities of confidence became as familiar to him as finger exercises  --  the stop in a man 's voice  --  like the musical hold inp251a measure  --  that preceded a tale of love , the moist phrasing that shaped a woman 's lips confessing it . Women especially liked and trusted him , against any obscure warningsabout himself that he at first might have felt romantically bound to give them . Early on he discovered , like many an intentional blackguard , which he was not , that such warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the range of his seemed to include both the woman of parts and the frivolous  --  it seemed that he had only to assure a woman that he could not be permanently counted upon in order to have her hang on all the harder , first in order to suffer the consequences , then to deny them . If in an affair he made it plain that he was n't serious , his partner tended at once to be convinced that he was  --  and of his honor as well . No , the pose of the frank disclaimer was n't practicable  --  besides , though he 'd felt all his life that he had something to disclaim , he had not yet found out what it was . Altogether , his natural inaccessibility did him extremely well , allowing women to assume in him a lovable " difference " that they could tout to others and to themselves , without ever having to come to terms with it . An ideal lover for most women , he concluded , was one conventionallywell enough endowed to excite public envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norm  --  such as a revolutionarynot averse to wearing a dinner jacket , and carrying it well . But now let us put an end to such reflections , always darted so easily , with twisted , avuncular lip , at our younger selves , and pick up our hero some two and a half years after his arrival in the city , in June Week , say  --  though of course we do not choose this week at random  --  endof-termweek of . .. it would be 1939 . We are sitting , with the dearly bought privilege of retrospect , gazing down at the young man from the rafters of his own future . Augustly situated as we are , he still has the advantage , for we shall not be able to change by one minim what we shall see . But this time  --  very early morning but already broadly past dawn in the way that summer days open  --  no spectator would wish a change here , for as our gaze spirals down , down , it rests on a scene alwaysfair to the benevolent  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sleeping by his side . Indeed , as he leans on an elbow , just awake , wishing idly for the coffee that , if she does not rouse soon ( and she will not ) , he will get up and make himself , he would be happy to be so found , prideful over his membership , not absolutely new but recent , in the ranks of those of whom this sort of thing must be expected . And with some reason . It is June Week , end-of-exam week  --  the best of those sectors of time which the academic year offers , conveniently docketed , to lucky recipients who then may know , without the slightest further personal effort , who they are and where . He is a junior . For another year he will be heir apparent , a year away from exile into a life lacking such markers . Outside , the moist blue morning is turning itself with noises once as sudden as brickbats , still exciting because no longer strange . A bus heaves by , with a characteristicgroan the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a glossary , so welcome to him , that she was born to ; an ash can clangs down and he knows , without stirring , how the afflatus of dust follows after , settling a moment 's visible rhythm on the air . Charming , gritty noises , if one has no pressure to heed them , but can lean on one 's elbow staring into the kernel of this week , the slowly expandingsummer , the future , the ages , meanwhile nestling one 's backside . Backside is one of a category of good old English words that his inhibited share of his heritage had hitherto denied him , mildest of a number that he has learned to use , although not with the insistenceof some around him . In the same way he is not much given to other typical excesses ; on occasion he has been drunk , but seldom as a steady member of that undergraduate virility cult which many will maintain long after graduation , and when he exercises that long muscle on which , smiling backward now at the girl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play her a tune if she would only awaken , he does so with a modicum of the demonic self-consciousness of his time . Something has kept him median here also . We in the gallery can shift in our seats if we wish , remembering certain more intense demons he thinks he has left behind . He shifts too , but only to cuddle into the softness back of him , while our movement has foreshortened our range.  |p253We  are in the room with him now , silent and invisible , looking at him eye to eye . His are veiled and he is still smiling , though more practicably than before . He is thinking of the summer job that awaits him in ten days or so and will keep him up North quite excusably , just as other jobs have the two preceding years . This year he will have one of the universityplums , equivalent to the editorship of the Law Review for a law student , and like it ordinarily given to a graduate student . Pierre 's majoris philosophy . Hindered in his choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been helped to it by one of the university 's real notables , Sanford Serlin , a man whose antennae are always alert for the protege , whose motives for this even the more scurrilous campus gossips do not impugn . Serlin is not the department 's head , having no patience with this factitious distinction , his being more worldly , but the college tolerates this as it will for the few whose reputations will thereby redound . Other scholars of this stamp often keep salons ; Serlin'sis more in the nature of a symposium . For although his large apartment , more like a family place than a bachelor 's , is always running over with Kaffee-klatsches and small dinners ( presided over by a housekeeperof whom Pierre will one day be reminded by the Mannixes ' Anna ) , Serlin is the kind of professor who goes down onto the hustingsand can be found , more afternoons than not , at one of the lowly zinc tables in the soda shop or drugstore currently favored for dawdling . Found there , he looks more like an undergraduate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening  --  a small man whose head , though haired , has the startling all-over pallor of a blanched almond , for he is an albino  --  a former child prodigy who will resemble one to the end of his life . His coloring is the key perhaps , for he is one of those whose flaw has not crippled but become a kindly Sesame to the flaws of others . And perhaps too , his name , with its odd , Judaeo-Germanic echo of Merlin , the " Sanford " a mother 's vanity obscuringwhat might otherwise have been " Solomon . " Not a feminine man , probably never a sexual one , he is one of the rare neuters who make the world 's arch-appreciators , which is what he is in his field.  |p254The  most that the gossips can say of him is that his foible is always for the young , the worst that he tempts these to  --  a bachelordom of scholarship like his own . Each summer he takes two students , chosen as much from the drugstore as the classroom , up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of the classic philosophers , to which he adds a volume every other year . Two young men so tapped will have a chance to meet the really elect on the easy terms of the campfire and the outhouse , will have their names attached to a preface , are already , like their predecessors , marked for observation themselves . And Pierre will be one of these . As he stretches himself , the cathedral tower equidistant between the college and this vulgarly cozy apartment sounds the quarter of an hour he does not know , and strikes him back with it , adding its fillip to the planes of idleness in the room . It is June Week , tune-week of a year , it is true , when Hitler has already entered the Sudetenland , but there has never been a year in the history of undergraduates ivoried safe from history , of which this kind of post hoc elegy could not have been made . It is youth who has the power . And he is here , in a city that gives most of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young ; a city so great for anonymity that it puts a cathedral in a slap-up back street . He is here , far away from what he once knew too well , in a place where no one , even himself , need know him  --  here in the city of coffee-drinkers , where he will seldom even need to refuse the tea which , even when it is pressed on him , is not tea . A truck , rumbling by , dislodges a flake of calcimine from the ceiling , and as it wafts down he waits for it as for an augur to see whether it will anoint him or the girl . It comes to rest on her cheek like a beauty patch . Never mind . The patch is half his , or will be shortly . And he is heir to the ages . Coffee is all he needs . Once he has set it to making , according to her recipe , in the kitchen whose glisten and completeness is part of the whole comfortable sphere of her attractions , he returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ; in the first steps of the ballet he had learned to dance , although that was a long way back , and not with the girl lying here . He seldom thinks of this , except in some popinjay moment when he counts on hisp255fingers  --  of which he still has more than enough to spare . Already he knows how healthily a present woman will expunge prior ones , how obligingly memory will abscond for him there . There all the world and poetry , as well as the funny paper , will conspire to reassure him that men are separate creatures ; here he need not feel himself in the least unique . But this is his first affair , and though come to him in terms as ideal as any young man could wish for  --  menage tout cornpris by a woman , the reverse of fly-by-night , whose permanent plans do not however include him  --  " What a setup ! " as a coarse friend has commented  --  he sees no reason to abolish sentiment because of it . Impermanencebreeds its own sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say so , but  --  how lucky he is  --  not she . We who are in the room with him can doubt his luck  --  and even doubt her . Of her we will never know for sure . Watch him is all we can , while , wearing an air of experience as consciously as a turban , he bends to her cheek and blows on it . Really , a woman who is all comfort can be too much so ; she is sleeping on like one whose every dream is habitable. lie kisses her , knowingbetter . Nevertheless , at twenty-six , lying there with all her chunky prettiness exposed  --  round face and waist , snub breasts whose cocoapinktips match her unpainted mouth , short legs , feet that are unbeautifulin shoes but look , when walking naked and even-toed , as if gravitationwere something they awarded the floor  --  she has the matter-offactaura , even in dream , of a woman who , promising no more nor less than she has , knows that these promises will be fulfilled . Any man who gets her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose made of stuff sterner than roses , house and board more extravagant than he needs but always solid and in the end a bargain , bed as is good for him , and children like the one she already has , all chub demispheres of herself . For this , such a man must give her the means  --  which is money  --  but she will not take money unaccompanied by other worth . In return , gravitation will be awarded him daily . " Mmrn . " He blows again and she answers , eyes closed . Born Leah Appelbaum , she has been known all her life as Lovey , a name that no one has ever thought to decry . The telephone listing here , however , re/mains under the name of Jerome Donegan , Irish jewelry salesman , dead four years ago in a car crash , while on business upstate " for the firm . " The car , a gray coupe scarcely battered , she noncommittally still drives . They used to drive up the parkways on weekends  --  and they were still paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , even on the fine salary of the job she has returned to ( secretary to Bijur , the head of the firm ) ; and the large sum from the insurance she had made Jerry buy before they were married  --  " After all , he was top salesman ; he could afford "  --  is doled out only for the weekday nurse for the child . Besides , the car is needed every Saturday to drive the child to its grandparents in Brooklyn  --  " You ever been on the New Lots train Saturday morning ? "  --  where the little girl , a lovely Irish-Jewish mutation , is the idolizedexcuse , along with tragedy , for reconciliation with a daughter who has married a goy . And besides , as she will say without a quiver , she still likes to drive the parkways . Like her figure are her reasons , a maddeningooze of the soft into the sensible , that only an ingrate , or perhaps a non-Jew , will attempt to divide . One wonders whether Jerry , handsome top salesman , ever wondered which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the listing  --  " This single-girl stuff , in the telephone book , it do n't look good , ever "  --  and before Pierre can speak  --  " Does n't ! " she says , flashing him a smile , for she encourages him to correct her English  --  this too has value  --  and he seldom has to mention the same error twice . It would be his error to think that she values only the tangible . From the cabinet photo , large almost as life , sole object allowed on the immense , polished surface of her proudest and quite good investment  --  " You mean to say you do n't know what a credenza is ! "  --  Pierre knows that he markedly resembles Jerry . In any case , for whatever reason , the telephone listing remains unchanged . " Love that bell . " Her eyelids droop , but are open . " Specially on Sundays . " Now she is staring at the ceiling . Remembering ? Or reminding herself that she is a working girl  --  she never has denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny what is for what has been  --  is this the way tragedy , not annulled , for that ca n't be , vanishes rather like the dry rot under the housewife 's new season ? " West Side bell . "  |p257She  giggles when he says that , teasing reminder of her ingenuous confidence at their first meeting ( in the park , over the child and a ball )  --  " Do n't you just love the West Side ? " She is inordinately proud of living here . Yes , he " does " ; he is as touchingly vain of his new status as she  --  " her nurse is off for the day "  --  is of hers . Bijur himself , the head of the firm , lives here , though of course " a lot further down . " A prince to work for , widower at only fifty , but the whole firm is his family , one son who do n't like the business  --  a college man like you . That 's a Jewish name , Goodman , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows . Ingenuously or not , she soon tells him . As he kneels over her on the bed , he thinks of all he could tell the world and the firm , Bijur , Jerry . A lover always knows more about a woman  --  we see that he is still wearing his turban  --  than all the rest of them combined . Particularly a lover she conceals . Ile could tell her world , so cynically used to the devices of the garment district , that these breasts are real . He could tell the firm , well aware of whom its hard-headed little secretary has her eye on , that she , who quite honestly disapproves of certain girls as " fast , " obstinately keeps a secret that , if once rumored , would burst all her plans . He could tell her boss , in whose office she dresses like all the others  --  satined and teazled as show girls two steps from bed  --  that this one perversely slicks back her hair , washes the paint from her face before she goes to bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who keeps a mistress but is uncomfortableabout it now that he is on the board of Temple Emanuel , that this girl , if allowed to requite permanence with the same , will give up her secret at once , and never have another . Never deny what is  --  or will be  --  for what was . Bijur is the man she has her eye on . And he could tell him , he adds to himself , as he places his hand deeply , that this is the way she best likes to begin love . " Coffee first . " She grins and rolls away from him , and he laughs . At himself  --  give him his due . Then he brings her the coffee . Two apiece , then the cups clink in their saucers , the spoons idle ; anybody can see that this is intermission . There is a scuffle , but anybody , too , knows it for a mock one , can see that the young man in the room here  --  back there  --  is the true heir apparent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week , the bell , to the age and its summer . Then he plays her the tune . Just before she lets him , she does what she sometimes does  --  oftenon Sundays . She reaches up and tugs his hair , dangling so close on herforehead . " Irisher ! " she says , eyes closed . Then nothing more . This is what he could have told Jerry . These were Pierre 's " passionate salad days "  --  a phase he had delightedlydiscovered himself to be in while reading , with his usual fondness for the passe , in old Edmund Gosse  --  and no man nearing forty , least of all his biographer , will pass up the chance to linger again briefly those arc-lit byways . We shall not , for instance , see Lovey , that girl so vivid even in arc-light , ever again after that day . For to date , neither has he . But we have seen what he was , or thought he was , in his twenty-first year . And as indicated , the day is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , swam in the pool and did the funhouses ; she had a bouncing fondness for these places , as if she thought of herself as soon to outgrow them  --  always roved the chance booths with a rube 's faith and could never resist anything eatable from a stall . In the car on the ferry trundling them eastward across the Hudson , she leaned , full of near-beer , on his shoulder , and dreamed aloud of the Bermuda trip with which any groom must make her his down payment , wondering whether she was a good sailor  --  was he ? " I do n't know , " he remembers answering truly , abandoned to his first vision of the city from the river  --  at this hour a city seen through seven veils , unapproachable from the Jersey side or any other . There was no need to be guarded with her ; like everyone up here she knew of him only as a Southerner , and was provincially all but deaf to any accent except her own . Indeed , like his namesake , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that shifted with whomever he talked . But he had touched unwittingly  --  he had been aboard ship once but could not remember it  --  on that uncertain bridge leading to all from which he guarded himself . And the city , seen at the widest angle and just before sundown , before its own lights spring it back to merely an electric marvel , an incredibly soaring funhouse , looks long , blue and Himalayan  --   |p259a  cloudland from whose trajectories any man will slide . In that light , as he has often seen it since , it sometimes looks like its own ruin , an Angkor Vat of itself seen centuries on , monument to its own or any man 's self-assertion . He shivered , as once in the courtroom , feeling all the magnitude of his . Then the old ferry , more a piece of land creaked loose from its moorings , grazed its dock again , shivering with him like a sympathetic old lap , and he set the car in motion , rolling carefully between the ferrymen  --  chewing , noncommittal welcomers hawsering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In front of his house she changed into the driver 's scat and left him , to meet the grandparents he must never meet , and the child  --  who was getting too bright and talkative to meet him often . 1 le was roomingthat year in a former frat house whose delinquent exchequer had finally been bought in by the university management . Two terms of this had not yet quite dulled its sybaritic arrangements  --  the cordovan lounge chairs , bequest of the outgoing brothers of 1927 , the pine paneling , gift of a razor manufacturer 's son . At fine French windows opened to the sunset , musing in those chairs on a square of the river framed like a patron 's commission , one could well end the clay making the grand tour of one 's expectations . But at this season the place was a scramble of trunks and all the catcalls of farewell , a boardinghouse being evacuated by a yearly plague . He turned away and instead walked westward up the hill along the city cross street that bisected the campus , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this privilege in New York , such a street must be closed to public use once a year for twenty-four hours ; this was the night when the corporation , not quite disinterestedly , declared a Campus Night , barricading the termini with guards and a few garlands through which anyone with a bursar 's receipt might pass in order to dance on asphalt that , until midnight , was his own . Tonight hundreds had done so . On the library steps the university band , its ranks already decimated , lumbered along by drumbeat , the brass melody snatched away by the city 's roar . Couples surrounded him , yards from each other but each barely moving on its dime 's worth in the decorous hunch chicly impassive above the knees . Someone had placedp260the ritual insult , whatever it was , on the head of the statue of Alma Mater . Iler dignity , blind and verdigrised in the starlight , had survived it . A tug of war had just died aborning . A few urchins , squeaked in from somewhere , gazed up devotionally at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the hundreds here came from the vast enrollmentof the accessory schools that now all but smothered the austere nucleus of the old liberal arts college  --  boys from the declining school of pharmacy , men and women from the thickening weed-growth of the " education " courses , theological students holding their beaverfaceddates at arm 's length  --  Pierre saw scarcely anyone he knew . It was a dull saturnalia , to the sound of bluchers working enthusiastically on stone . But like so much of what he had extracurricularly learned here , it was a social lesson on the hierarchies  --  so vigorously denied by the country and the college  --  that persisted here and would be met again outside . One could pretty well tell a man 's status , brought here or projected , by what he did or did not do during June Week . Only the most earnest would attend Baccalaureate Day  --  these were the future layers of wreaths , setters of cornerstones , along with the prudently early subscribers to the national habit of public joining . To these would be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging themselves to a girl or leaving one , plus a few late recruits from the fraternity house celebrants , more of whom would never get to the main dance . Most of the " intellectuals " ( except for those who must blush for arriving family ) would abstain from Graduation Day , none of them mount their sheepskins in walnut . At the very top were the men who had attended the university , city-vitiated though it was , because their fathers had , plus a scattering of girls either filling out their postdeb hours or representing the new social consciousness of the old rich . None of these , by now long since off to summer homes or Europe , had ever attended a college function at all . Life made its divisions early , no matter what the Constitution proposed . Still , as he stood in front of his door again , he was not wholly immune to the mood of the season , feeling the loneliness of one who knew too much too soon , yearning , as precocity does , for some more comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riverp261could always affect him , and did so now . Circling the city , indeed its primary vein of extra-human , by day it thrust the streets back upon their own mortality , miserable or effete . At night it ennobled them . Like any great configuration of landscape , it persuaded the spectator that the stretched dimension was in himself . From where he stood on the embankment the shuffling up on the hill , intermittent blurts of the band , traveled down to him like echoes of some midsummer whirligig , carrying the enviable mystery of the party to which one is not bidden . He let himself luxuriate in the self-pity that was always so fine as long as it was baseless , telling himself that he would have gone back up that hill if he could have taken his regular girl like the rest of them  --  even while he felt his limbs still suppled with the morning 's lovemaking , the skin of his face and shoulders pleasantly burned with afternoon . A little angry , a little sad , and quite happy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others could be open , meanwhile preening at the drama of it , descended so early on him , still so young . As he opened the house door with his special key  --  there were only twenty-five of them  --  that outdoors-indoors blend which always excited him followed him in like the heady admixture of life itself , and held him poised . In the swath cast by the hall light the sky looked at once wilder , more blue and shy , visitant piece of that natural world which was the invisible guest outside the most civilized habitation and would end by being the host . Even the weak bulb in the hall , faced with that spectral blue , had gathered to itself the wigwam glow that was the core of all habitation . Life had never been more instant , more real ; he was here , floated in on that current of marvel ceaselessly offered to him , the instrument  --  neither existent without the other . The present suffused him like whisky , as it did in those moments when , reading in some philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book down , stood up and stretched , conscious of teeth strong enough to chew every appetite , loins ready to swell , a mind , dancing in its own essences , that had no need to prove . He stretched like a cock now , ready to stay up all night if necessary , in order that the world might continue . Not at all sleepy , he would lull himself over some book for/gotten by all but him and the faded listing in the catalogue . Generous pity flowed in him for all such , for old Gosse and all those whose salads were over , all philosophers , majestic or piddling , from whom reality , not waiting for definition , had decamped . As he passed the hall table , he ran his fingers lightly over it ; it held no threat for him ; the monthly letter from his uncle , arriving always on the first , like a statement and almost as noncommittal , had come the week before , and he had not yet attained the eminence of bills . His hand stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip at once , half concealed by mail for other tenants  --  the factory stationery on which his uncle always wrote . Your mother has partially regained the use of her hand , he had written over two years ago . She sews at the machine again , and at Rollins ' suggestion has taken on a few clients . One of the blacks  --  a woman who has been to the French convent in Memphis , does the finishing . Any small motion of the fingers still tires them . So for the moment I shall continue . It had been kind of him to explain it so , Pierre had thought at the time . But he forgets that I am a dressmaker 's son . Who does the cutting ? She would entrust that to no one . There had followed , in that letter and subsequent ones , messages of love from her , and at intervals shirts whose workmanship was unmistakable . But the pretense had been kept up and she had never written . He knew why . Still he did not move to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one could think otherwise knowing its author , that gradual man . Whatever it held would take him away from here . Somethinguntoward . He would not let himself phrase it further . Pierre raised his head and listened . Except for the caretaker , far off in the basement where his own trunk was already in place with those of the others who would be returning , he was the sole occupant of the house ; he and this pile of deserted mail . He knew what he listened for and what he heard  --  his biographer hears it yet . He was listening to that blind undertow of self which he had been taught to call selfishness , whose instinctis often surer , more cleansing in the end than the gentle , sacrificial waters that overlie . It told him to leave at once , take off for Serlin 's early , abscond as if he had never seen the letter , let it be lost or pursuep263him too late . Few of us are strong enough to obey that voice . Thetis , when she dips us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us cannily by the heel . One by one he picked up the envelopes that coveredhis own , envying the other addressees this flotsam  --  a few bright throwaways from haberdasheries , a letter , delayed for postage , from WarrenBrown 's girl , whom he had married in chapel yesterday morning , several warning library notices to gay defaulters who were gone for good . There it was : Pierre Goodman . He stared at the name finally come to terms with by the sender . The envelope was written in his mother 's hand . Six hours later , he left for Tuscana . There was no need for this kind of hurry , but after sending his telegram , he had spent the last four hours sitting on his bed , his packed bags between his ankles , and arrived at the One Hundred Twenty-fifth Street Station an hour and three quarters before train time . The station was deserted , as if only his being awake maintained it . Dawn came while he sat , misnomer here for a stir of air the color of bird droppings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses appeared marine and wavering , as if already obscuring , liming with his absence , his banishment , in a beginningrain of invisible ash . Not yet aboard the train , he was already looking back with the paranoid glance of departure , in which cities crumple as we leave them , and the scenes of destination precede us into being one moment before we arrive . Already his was coming out to meet him along thread after thread , respun at a touch , that he had thought destroyed . Down there the house waited to puff into being at his presence , the smell of tea , arrack sweated from a thousand pots , in all its corners ; from one of them his uncle coughed his exact and maddeninginterval ; in another his mother waited with marionette patience , opening and closing her convex eye . In the train speeding away from Grand Central , he told himself that he could still get off at the next station , but when it arrived there he did not move except to take out the letter , grasping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down . As the car filled , he wondered how many others , in all trains , were consigning themselves by their own hand toward destinations which their very cells refused . Placesp264were not upheld by sand and girders finally , but by the heart  --  that sometimes faltered  --  beyond that , to the last trump , by the memory that sometimes tricked but never faltered , that was the heart of life . To know this beforehand was the worst precocity of all.  |p265Lucine  . The Jebbs . The last ditch few of us have time for salutations . " You gotmy letter ? " said his uncle , meeting him at the train , and henodded , not knowing what else to do , because of what his mother had said in hers . Later on I shall have to be in hospital , and would rather see you before . Rollins was wrong . The clinic in Denoyevillegives me about three months at the outside . George knows , but is not sure that I do , so we do not speak of it . Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless , she had said at the end , but no salutation . And as his uncle clasped his hand and looked into his face , he had his first sense of how people , huddled cipher to cipher on the embankment under the great , overarching span of death , might have no immediate use for names . " You 'll find her changed , " said his uncle , and Pierre nodded again , unable to speak , finding his uncle so changed . His uncle 's face , even-featured to the point of anonymity , never in his remembrance sweated or flushed with drama , still persisted , but now it looked as ifp266some gross amateur stagecraft had been at it , puttying at the cheeks , scoring lampblack under the eyes , making of it an anomaly beneath whose exaggerations the median man of fifty had disappeared , leaving the beholder in the wings to choose for himself whether this was an old man or a young . When last seen at this same train , his uncle , in a soiled shirt and tieless , nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disaster with which he still felt able to deal . Now , in a dark suit and collar pin , his dress had the same excessive , finicky neatness of those houses , swept clean of every mortal odor , that wait for bereavement . The car too , the same one , shone in the dark as they crossed the siding to it ; she was still able to take a drive in it afternoons . There were no other cars waiting . Tuscana was no longer the main line . Eastward over the ridge there was a faint palpitation in the heavens that real newcomers might mistake for heat lightning , never suspecting , if arrived from the west instead of the north , the tremendous kingdom of light that lay beyond the hump of this one remaining hill . Once out on the main street , it would surround them , crowd them to the center of its fixed swarm , but here , on the old siding , Tuscana had remained to itself as it had in him , a pocket of darkness that had resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be coaxed . While they sat in it as it warmed up , his uncle fallen momentarilysilent , crouched in the tender alertness toward mechanism that was his bond with the new world , every sluggish throb of gas-tincturedair breathed him , Pierre , back into his boyhood  --  if he loosed memory by one inch from its halter he would see , to the left , a line of cars advancing single in the starlight . . . careful , he must remember that he had seen them going , not returning . . . he would hear a boy 's voice exclaim , " You come through the backs ? " As he had now . He had come through the backs of the present , always accumulating behindone ; the place of arrival , the place of departure were reversed . He was here . Then the old engine caught firmly , with a powerful rejuvenatedpurr in which one could clearly hear the tappets , sounding louder , more capable than the quiet , city-serviced motor of the car he had driven only two days ago  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valedictory walk . He waited , flinching . Instead , his uncle took his foot off the gas , letting the engine die to a pulse , remainedfor some seconds with his hands forgetful on the wheel , then turned and placed one hard palm on Pierre 's knee . The red signal blinked , reflected , a manic point of red in his still steady eye . " I curse Rollins , " said his uncle . " I curse him eternally . " That was his confidence . Then he removed the hand . There had been no stroke , he said , at least not one detached and causative in itself . She had a growth on the spine , now inoperable , that must momentarily have encroached on the neuromuscular systemsback there three years ago , then receded , and was now dexterously busy impairing one vital function , releasing it to pursue another , on its ultimately single-minded path . These last weeks , in a miraculous recrudescence of strength , she had risen from her bed and taken over the household , but the clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such cases , where the heart and other organs were strong ; he was not to hope . It was the last flare-up , in which the body , dominating its damaged parts , held its shape together for one bright image of itself before it fell ; she was being consumed . I curse Rollins . His uncle , rousing the car again , drove them off without repeating the words , but Pierre , hearing their echo , heard Johnny 's in their trek up the hill , blaming Semple , hanging the whole cathedral of the town 's evil , the angel-gargoyle framework of any town anywhere , or all good-and-evil , on him . This was the human mind , simple or profound , unable to face the matrix of causation , gaggingat the sight of the crisscrossed inflections covering what should , must be the central absolute , hunting down some Judas to bear the monotheistic blame . It was she . . . he . . . they ; curse him . And when all else failed , then came that last cry from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of : mea culpa , curse me . Poor Johnny , poor uncle  --  poor Rollins , who must every day be confronted with blame to assign . Where his own mother might assign it  --  whom she would choose  --  he must hold himself in readiness to bear . So he came home , heeding those streets for whose pattern he had been preparing himself all the long train ride down . The street leadingp268to their own was dark as they approached the long line of houses , but as they turned left , a yellow neon sign , far down to the right , imprinteditself as it flared backward : the Bantam Cafe . Not as he had dreamed it , the return , never as one dreams it  --  the wild image treasured or feared . But it had come to be . He was home . One house was widely lit  --  theirs . " You have awnings ? " he said , incredulous , even with a jealous twinge of resentment because the house he had been so reluctant to see no longer jibed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this spring , " muttered his uncle , then , as they drew up , gave one of the exclamations , half resigned , half impatient , with which the tenders of the sick meet the vagaries of the ill one . His mother was standing in the door . Above her the awnings , striped mascara and white , one to a window , projected the house forward with a tropic falseness ; beneath them , around the door , a trellis had been erected , in the center of which his mother 's figure , tiny in its usual dark habit , one hand resting on the latticework , the vine shadows clamberingover her face , seemed that of a soubrette about to sing . As he came up the steps , the porch light was on his face , the trumpet-shaped shadows quivering on hers , but one glance at her dress , upright almostof its own stiffness , told him all he needed . Plain as her clothes were , each of them had always fitted her to the quarter-inch ; it was her one vanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her breast and fell inward ; the cuffs of her sleeves , doubled in circumference , enclosed wrists that dangled within them like a child 's . Glancingdown without meaning to , he saw stockings hopelessly girdling legs like canes , and quickly averted his eyes . Two steps above him , she bent her head toward his , chin thrust forward , mouth turned down at the corners . " Yes , yes , " she breathed , " yes " ; as if he must mourn with her the worst  --  the terrible collapse of her neatness . Gazing up , he held his own breath , thinking that he must never again for one second let her see him flinch from the sight of her  --  the hooded eyelids swollen to casques , lips the color of veal . One step up and he had enclosed her , and circling almost nothing , still sought her . Under his nostrils he smelled an odor that no orris could cover , never met before , instantlyp269known to the full in an animal opening of all his senses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms . There was no scene ; what it came to was that , still upright , every faculty erect , she had faded too far back for one . She had no more perspective , or only one ; therefore all was clear . The great fact , for her , was the general scene ; she could scorn , or perhaps had even forgotten , those fragmentary intensifications of it with which others tried to thrash themselves free of the dull prospect before them . Every day , as she diminished , she knew more incontrovertibly where she was . And what dignity spread from her because of it ; one could almost understandfrom the sight of it why a man might spend his life walking this way , that , around the question of where was he . " This was the mercy , " Pierre told himself later , " that we had read of , had heard accounts of as descending , in their last days , upon the dying , but its heights , if such they were , were too sore for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily mercy , we gathered dimness warmly around us , and told ourselves that she was fading : " That evening she gave them one flash of it  --  one strike of the match to show them in their darkness where she was , then no more . It was after dinner , after they had eaten all they could , watching her not eat , had listened to her find questions for them when they could speak no further . " Let 's not pretend , " she said suddenly , and put her hands forth on the white dinner cloth , then withdrew them , perhaps because of what they now were . He could have told her , had there been any way to say it , that he had already grown used to them , that because of the infinitelyadjustable lens he had just discovered we all carried inside us , even the mask she now wore was once more his mother . His uncle , sitting stiffened in his chair , made him hear her words , delayed . " Let 's not pretend , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each of us not knowing for sure what the other knows . A waste , too . " She leaned forward . " George . . . you know . They told you . " She paused . His uncle sat motionless . " And he knows . I wrote him . To New York . That 's why he 's here . " Would she never name him ? But she was gesturing to herself ,  |p270drawing  a hand down the whole length of her from shrunken bodice to ankle , forcing them to survey her . She looked at them both with pity . " And I know , " she said . In the silence that followed , a great embarrassment stretched between them , as if the three of them were a childish gang caught out by authority in a joint misdeed . Then his uncle , that strange man of actions so few , reached out for her hands and put them back on the table . They lay there like the purest drawings , anatomized by life . The very cloth whitened beneath them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then he covered them with his own . " When did you know ? " he said . She smiled , grinned rather , for in the way of people who die of attrition , the contracting flesh of her upper jaw was daily starving the skull into sight . Looking at that impish , still delicate protrusion , all their triangular pretense , every pretense could fall away , even into a kind of rest , as if health were only a long lapse of memory , now repaired , behind which she was showing them the one certainty that gave life  --  even joy  --  its character . " When I asked for the awnings , " she said . " They had them in France , when I was a girl . In hot summer , there 's nothing makes one feel so cool , so rich . I always wanted them . So , when I asked them at the hospital how much time I had , and they told me , I thought  --  I 'll have the awnings . ' " And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was objects she clung to , not in the way of a person who could not bear to leave her hoard behind , but as if their positive presence were a help in delaying hers . The house had never been so polished , so serene , so stopped in every crevice . The servant Lucine , a quiet yellow woman with convent manners , came daily , and between them they restocked the household linen , rivers of it flowing beneath their hands , as if his mother meant to leave behind her a trousseau of all the things men would never think of , enough to last them forever . In the evenings after dinner , Pierre sometimes caught her scrutinizing the room , almost chairbound as she now was , in the thoughtful way that women did in the springtime , and one of those evenings , his uncle being absent at the " pub , " kept to that habit at her insistence , she made Pierre rearrangep271all the furniture in the parlor , saying exhaustedly when it was over , " There . That will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Otherwise , except for what could not be helped , everything was encouraged to remain the same ; it sometimes seemed to Pierre that his mother was passionately trying to teach them how to live in the present . Never a gossip , always formal , even in private , with the facts of other people 's lives , now she was energized by every account of the daily scene that his uncle could bring her as evidence that the warm , quotidian current of living still lapped their beleaguered household round . Of Pierre 's doings in the years of his absence she never asked , if only because this would have admitted the possibility of his return to them , and the future was the inadmissible danger now . Ike had no stories that could beguile her in the way she wished to be , that were safe . Meanwhile few people came to the house , few had ever done , and the weight of any fresh , real contact was more than she could sustain . Even the phone , across which one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy for her . Interest , daily more disembodied , was all she had . And the burden of feeding it fell therefore , with heaviest irony , on the one who would he assumed to be the most unsuited to the task  --  his uncle  --  a man who all his life long had breasted conversation , tempered judgment , with a cough . What he did with that task was a marvel , equal , Pierre thought as he was forced to watch it each evening , to the feat of a man with some hidden ear for music perhaps but no performance , who , required by the ogre to sit down night after night at the stiff instrument of his own imagination , finds that for the sake of another , if in this way the castle door can be opened to her , he can . It was the worst of summer heat now , and only his mother throve on it , muffling herself in scarves the color of the dead air and the moths that flitted it , waiting on the porch that Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skeletal head as a blind person might , minutes before he himself heard his uncle 's reviving step . Each day he came earlier . As he came up the steps , his face , lifted toward them in the peculiar , refulgent light , showed the black-ashp272daubs under the eyes like a child 's play of spectacles , and although he came quietly , putting down the paper with the air of a man who has done this a thousand times and expects to go on so for a thousand more , he always seemed like a man who had been running . And once Lucine had left them with the tea , his uncle began , opening his day to them like a pedlar 's pack from which he drew one item after the other , watching her face the meanwhile , as if he had done nothing at the mill , the cafe , the street corner , other than buttonhole people for something to add to his stock for home . As perhaps he had , for what he accumulated each day was almost a columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each item to its saga and kept a dozen such going , the power with which he brought her into places where she had never been or would never be again  --  from pub to church meeting , to the new golf club at Denoyeville and the shower talk of the red-faced men there  --  must have been served by a lifetime of behind-the-scenes silence , of that deep , judging flow of comment which his cough must always have forestalled . It was the way a stutterer might have spoken , finding himself suddenly , for a great stake , able to spill . And his rewardwas to see her face , that had faded so far back , slowly transfuse forward again , as if he had brought it blood . Tea would decline toward supper ; the awnings were drawn up against the dew , and the three of them came inside , his uncle carrying her now . Inside , the three of them sat in their old triangle , but Lucine now moved softly behind them , and the windows had long since opened and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather . The years had melded his mother and uncle with the town , and even he , brought here by the gloved hand that arrested all knife-play , had been returned to the trinity . Any envious passer-by , croucher at sills , would have thought them a true family . His mother , if she knew the limits of her triumph , gave no sign of it , as , her face almost a face again , turned toward his uncle , she warmed to the business of interpretingwhat he had brought her . " They 'll send the Denny girl to Martindale , you 'll see , " she would say . " Poor thing . " His uncle would nod , his eyes on the lips that said " poor thing . "  |p273She  would go on , briskly . " Mrs. Emerson , the one who used to keep boarders on F Street , she 'd have let her stay there . But I expect she 's moved on across the hill . " This was Tuscana 's euphemism for the dam site . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was kind . " Martindale was the girls ' reformatory , and Mrs. Emerson , a former client , was a woman in the full-blown tradition of those whose male boarders often went beyond that status , but his mother 's interest ranged wide , and was never scabrous , foraging equally between happinessand its crops , tragedy and its portents , probing restlessly beneatheven the mere drama of what happened to people , to the continuitythat lay below . It was this continuity , blind as it was , that reassured her . And no one could have understood this better than his uncle , sitting there white-knuckled , spending all his breath to keep her where she was . " That Mrs. Emerson , you know , " he would be sure to say , putting down his paper the next day , or the next . " She 's taken over the old Davis place in Charlotte . And you were right about the Denny girl  --  they 've sent her to Martindale . " Nothing ever foundered in his memorythese days ; Pierre , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was brought home , sometimes wondered now if anythingever had . Meanwhile for Pierre the town was being repeopled , all the old names and characters coming out of lodging again , not on the scrawny scale of childhood revisited  --  for staying so close to home , he encounterednone of them  --  but with all their legendary thickness retained . In a way this was better so ; the work of the past three years was not to be undone then , only suspended . So things went on for two weeks , three , and he was beginning to believe that , with luck , painful as that luck would be , the two halves of his life would remain unjoined . And so they might have done , had his uncle 's name not been drawn , just at that time , for the grand jury . All three of them were grave at the prospect . The real history of the world is made by the snailed-in , private lives of millions , a currentp274occasionally muddied by the supposed plenipotentiaries at the top . Historians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hitler 's , know this and ignore it , for they too must work . But the dullestprivate citizen knows enough to equate any public action required of him with disaster , rightly measuring it by the immemorial occasions when he has been most forced to it , in time of war , of political storm , of plague . Thus , even the most minor prod from the public weal  --  a notice to register , a tax bill  --  can make him uneasy out of all proportion to its weight , if proud . " I 'll beg off , of course , " said his uncle , then coughed  --  not quickly enough to hide that unguarded " of course . " Pierre was silent , as mostly these days , under the childish superstitionthat the less he said or did in Tuscana , allowing the Fates the least possible thread with which to reweave him in here , the easier it would be to retain his status as a visitor from elsewhere . But his uncle 's cough had remanded him back to the old , hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at his mother , he found he could even sicken . He got up and turned his back , trying to deny that he was implicated in this scene , unable to deny a twinge of what life held in wait for him  --  that he had just been dealt one " It is so ! " out of a great store of implacables against which the most arrogant " I ! " might be powerless . " That you will not ! " said his mother , just as she had done when his uncle had proposed to give up the cafe . " I shall be wanting to hear ! " Her grin , meant to be gleeful , could look only rapacious on that starveling jaw , reminding them that it was she who , lightly as she could , with the least trace of assumed heroine , now held the reins . It was she , most imminently mortal of their three , who would keep them toeing toward health , on their frail , cliff-perched status quo . Death was remaking her , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom neither Pierre nor the rest of his world now belonged  --  would deem too late . If we might all remember our own deaths , he thought , then none would be villains , and he idled for a moment  --  the one that sense allows the young  --  over a vision of such a world : wars melted , lies cleared , everyone walking abroad in that immediate element , everyp275medley solving under that pure-struck , personal tone . Meanwhile his uncle , doing just as she bade him , was to be the unwitting means of bringing back into her eyrie the final thrust from the world as it unregeneratelywas . On July eleventh , then , 1939 , at the current term of the supreme court for the trial of criminal actions , a grand jury was empaneled in the county ( as known here ) of Banks , Alabama . It is presumed that the names of all those summoned had been drawn under the usual procedure  --  from the annual list of persons qualified to serve as trial jurors , as submitted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal from the list of any whose records contained convictions either for felony or misdemeanors involving moral turpitude . It is true that , as may well often happen in a small community , several of the names were of those who had reassuringly seen service before . But as afterwards recalled , the judge was not local , the district attorney only half so . Nothing had leaked to the county at large  --  or rather to those who considered themselves to be this  --  of any extraordinarymatters to be proposed . It was slack midsummer , in a slack place . Like all small places threatened by growth from outside , it could remember this fact only intermittently . And like such places everywhere  --  where influence has ancestry , authority is always married to somebody 's cousin  --  it still had its contempt for the laws that are written . In any event , no juror , before being sworn , had been challenged on the grounds either that he was insane or that he could not act impartiallyand without prejudice to either party . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , would have been ignorant enough to wish to challenge a roster of such good names as Charlson Evans ( minister of the First Baptist ) , Ian Frazer ( railroad watchman , retired ) , Miles Blankenship ( Rhine 's  --  retired ) , E. V. Semple ( factor of same ) , Treacher Nellis ( formerly of same , now member inspection crew Dam Number Three and federal employee ) , the Jack Lemons , father and son ( horses , and allied arts ) , Robert Rollins ( youngest son , already called " Doc , " though still a student ) ,  |p276Hannibal  Fourchette , Jr . ( also of course the son and associate of justice ) , and others of the like  --  all names ringing like the alphabet on any local ear . Whether or not from the same kind of ignorance , the district attorney also acceded to all names without challenge . Perhaps he was counting on , or at least encouraged by , the presence on the panel of some dozen foreigners . These were citizens , resident within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in by the dam in variouscapacities , members of a group now too prominent and too pushingto be overlooked without trouble . Citizens they were of course , of the nation if not of the region , some from the East , more from the West and Far West  --  all , in local eyes , from the " North . " All twenty-three of the jurors were male , for although women possessed the right to be called , in this neighborhood they were both unlikely to be called and disinclined to it  --  often a matter for comfortable courthouse laughter . Of those special foreigners of the place who would never be called there was never any mention  --  this being a matter buried too deep for laughter . From this group of twenty-three , George Higby ( born in Birmingham , England , grandnephew of Luddite rioter , now naturalizedand presumably neutralized citizen , foreman at Rhine 's ) was  --  by lazy analogy , compromise , or accident  --  appointed foreman by the court . A grand juror performs an important duty to the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a body of men who stand between the people of the State and one accused of crime . No person can be put on trial for a crime of any magnitude until after a grand jury has found a bill of indictment . Its deliberations are secret . It usually hears but one side of a case , and that the people 's side . The accused , who is called the defendant , has no opportunity to appear by counsel , nor ordinarily , even in person . Bender 's Grand Juror 's ManualEarly on the morning of George Higby 's first day of service as juror , the doctor was called to attend his wife , who sometime before dawn had had what appeared to be a slight hemorrhage of the bowel . Even then , still dictator , she had refused to let the doctor be summoned untilp277a more reasonable hour , with the remark that young Lee Rollins , since taking over the practice after his father 's retirement , often looked tired enough himself to stumble into the nearest grave . Besides , what more could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to her " leeching "  --  she called it this  --  she now was ? Lucine , however , must be called at once to make her tidy ; she had had some nurse 's training with the Sisters , and being a woman was used to the sight of blood . " Eh , is n't that so ? " she said , as the doctor was leaving . " We women are blooded early . " She caught sight of Pierre through the half-open door . " Mind you remember that ! " she called . " Any young priss says she ca n't stand it , she 's the bloody liar ! " She was sitting up , elated , consciouslyheroic now for the benefit of the doctor , who must be made to see her as still strong . Until her illness , her language had always minced away from the bodily , in the limbs-for-legs euphemisms of her class , but recently she had seemed to be returning to an earlier speech , perhaps her father 's , before she had been genteelly instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simpler " functional " jokes that sweet old ladies take glee in at their dotage  --  as if her sicknessmust replace her aging . " Only a lady could afford to say bloody , ' " Pierre as a child had often heard her decree . Now death , along with its other purifications , had at least given her leave to be one . " Mind you tell George there 's to be no change , " she said , pushing her chin out , monkey-sharp , at the doctor . " You go on , George , it 's nothing new , " she called out before the doctor could speak . " I 'll be waiting to hear ; you go on downtown ! " Outside , the doctor warned them that her final trip to the hospital ought not to be delayed . " She wants no change , " said his uncle . " We 'll manage things here . " Feet planted wide , his stance reminded Pierre of the day he had scooped her dead weight from the two men returning her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own moment upheld her . Young Rollins shook his head , obviously used to the plea . Only in the city where he had received his training , his sad shrug seemed to say , had people learned to go quietly , even to hurry toward the snag less last rites of the hospital ; everywhere in this backward place onep278still met the primitive suspicion that the hospital , ciphering a man to one bed among many , was itself on death 's side , being so used to it  --  that at home , earthbound to the dirtily personal , clumsily upheld by amateurs , one might still hang on . No , he said , the terminal stage might be long-drawn ; her amazing constitution was against her here . " Against ! " His uncle 's eyes stared from their lampblack . " A day is a day ! " But the young man , still so far from his own terminus , could not agree . Morphine . He let the syllable drop gently . Perhaps to be administered in such quantity that only a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father  --  is responsible . " Rollins flushed . Third doctor-son of a father who , bred in some raw , homeopathic college of the nineties , had had a tough-tender , midwifecompetence with birth but should never have blundered near disease , he was also the only son who had been willing to stay on here , to inherit , it was rumored , more than one such of his father 's mistakes . It was settled that Lucine , with some instruction , would sleep in , the patient to be moved from home only if an oxygen tent , other like impedimenta , were required . Walking out to the sidewalk , the doctor hesitated , remained leaning on his car door . Not long down from the classroom , perhaps he still dreamed of some discovery made by a young backwater practitioner , some digitalis out of old wives ' foxglove . " Really . . . her staying power 's remarkable . . . our man at the clinic says he 's never seen anything like . . . what do you feed her ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uninflected . his uncle , already dressed in his dark suit at her insistence , stepped back from the curb . Turning , he surveyed his house with the householder 's ratifying glance , appraisal of tasks to be done there come evening . He turned back to the doctor 's car . " You might drop me at the courthouse , you going on downtown . " And that evening , carried to her chair on the porch , she was waiting as usual . " Foreman ! " she said . " Foreman ! And who else is on ? "  |p279He  told her . She chuckled , thinking . That lazy crowd . Not many of them with brains enough for the job  --  Charlson maybe . How is it they did n't . . . ? But I suppose they thought a foreman once might as well be foreman twice . " He explained that in this case the foreman was appointed by the judge . " Oh . " Let animation fail her for a second and the skull seamed forward , papier-mache with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding the name , not him , he was away  --  a stranger , from another county . And launching quickly into as many details as he could muster , he described their swearing in , the charge by the court , their retirement to a room in the rear , too small for them  --  but the court was sitting in the other . He did not know why he had been tapped for the job . Accident  --  or perhaps the older hands had got bored with it ; some , he understood , would not turn up regularly ; others , like old Frazer , were only there for their six dollars per . A good lot of them were pensioners ; old Clarence Whitlock had naturally been chosen clerk . For  --  he rattled on  --  once they 'd been left to themselves , it had been like a club rather , at least on one side of the room . The jury had spent most of the afternoon fixing the hours of session and adjournment . The first case would be heard tomorrow . " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the case will be . " She was smiling , almost a visible line between their gazes , as if when he respired , she drew in . He reddened . Perhaps he decried his talent , would otherwise never have revealed it . But this was not the reason now . " Dora . . . the proceedings are secret . . . we each of us had to swear . " His voice was weak , asking to be overridden . At once she helped him , bringing to bear all the advantage she had forsworn . Delicately she rested her hands forward on the tea cloth . " I sha n't be telling . " Leaving the porch , Pierre at first heard nothing behind him . Then , through the thin door as he closed it , the voice of the petitioner came , still powerful . " George . . . tell me the oath . "  |p280The  following oath must be administered to the foreman and acting foreman of the grand jury : ' You , as foreman and acting foreman of this grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such matters and things as shall be given you in charge ; the counsel of the people of this state , your fellows ' and your own you shall keep secret ; you shall present no person from envy , hatred or malice ; nor shall you leave any one unpresented through fear , favor , affection or reward , or hope thereof ; but you shall present all things truly as they come to your knowledge , according to the best of your understanding . So help you God ! " Code Cr . Proc . Section 238The scrupulous man , when he breaks a pledge , often makes a wider sweep at it than the careless . " Oh , come out of there , " said his uncle the next evening , opening the door on Pierre hanging back in the stifling parlor . " You 've to get your tea somewhere ! " And his uncle , who had never been comfortableenough to arrest conversation in Lucine 's presence in the high manner of those born to servants , did not do so now . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so families who must surely now and then have heard scraps from the people 's counsel , none could have had such full account of any one matter as was given here on this porch  --  each cramped summer evening  --  of all . An indictment is an accusation in writing presented by a grand jury to a competent court , charging a person with a crime . That evening they heard the charges against Mary Jo Denny , accusedof infanticide . Evidence connecting the exhumed remains of a newborn infant with the defendant was found to be insufficient , malicious and not corroborated  --  certainly not by several jurors known to have been acquainted with the defendant , who chose rather to be guided by the minister , Charlson Evans , in his role of merciful doubter , and by the reflection that the girl was already at Martindale . No indictment found.  |p281The  grand jury ought to find an indictment when all evidence before them , taken together , is such as in their judgment would , if unexplainedor uncontradicted , warrant a conviction by the trial jury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obscure rapings , small crimes , single and eternal , unaccompliced except by the nature and history of men . On this evening , however , they heard the case of the people of the county of Banks , Alabama , against Arthur Bean , of Tuscana in that county , defendant , former member of Inspection Crew Dam Number Three , dismissed , after two warnings for drunkenness while on duty , April fourteenth last . On the night of May tenth , it was alleged , defendant had been seen on the farm of Henderson Presson , Negro , which farm , including tenant house and several outbuildings , had that same evening burned to the ground . Witness to this , including members of the Presson family , could not be found . Defendant , however , it was further alleged , had on two occasions publicly boasted of setting this fire in retaliation for the hiring in his place of Presson 's son Wesley , the first of these occasions being in front of witnesses in a local cafe that same evening , the second occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dam site . No witnesses of the cafe incident came forward . Two federal clerks , however , both recent transfers from an out-of-state district , did so testify . In the proceedings , it was also revealed that the farm , of which Presson had been tenant only , had been federal property at the time of the burning , having been acquired from the bank , its actual owner , by the dam authority , some weeks before . " So there you have it , d ' ya see , " said his uncle , almost expansive , in the manner brought home with him , these past evenings , from the professional colloquies of the day . Gazing at their view and through it , through the clutter of moths batting at the screen , beyond the line of porches semivisible in the late , astral light , his audience of two thought they did see . They saw the room in which the jury sat daily , the rows of seats  --  fivep282to either side of the aisle , one step up between each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district attorneys , the witness 's focal chair . Clearest of all , allotting their own bias in spite of his uncle 's modest disclaimer , they saw the jury  --  a central cloud of importance , with George Higby , foreman , at its core . Old Clarence Whitlock , retired clerk of the court , sat at his right , once more exercisingwell-known powers of transcription . On the foreman 's left sat the acting foreman , name unfamiliar , quantity unknown and to remainso , excepting as he belonged with others from across the hill , with  --  in town parlance  --  the " new " men from " the other side . " They saw too how the jury had ranged itself , by subtle adhesion , into " old " and " new , " each on its own side of the aisle , and how this separation , having to do neither with the age of a member or the immediategeography of the county , persisted even in the informal hobnobbingsat recess , in the obliquity of a glance , the lowering of a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , however , they saw almost without knowing in passing that they did so , would have assumed it even if his uncle had not accuratelylimned it for them . For , in the sudden craters in the farmland , long since forgotten in the sight of the large one , in the steady tinkle of money on small bourses , the silent tribune without flags between state and nation , the change had come to Tuscana , up to now without guns . Under such besiegement man 's life is still daily ; power shifts quietly , seen only intermittently even by those with hands at their holsters  --  of the twenty-three men likely to have been sitting on such a county jury a decade before , almost all would have been born in the county . Now there were but ten , and they felt the need to sit together , on one side . " So there you have it , " his uncle repeated . " Federal property . Not even the bank 's . " He did not bother to say " Not Presson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event there would have been no case . And , said his uncle , this was not all . Hesitant at first , he now showed the amateur 's willingness to expound , his own growing relish at the discovery that the law , when one had a good look at it , fittedp283together in all its parts not unlike a machine . The grand jury , he told them , was not bound to hear evidence for the defendant , but under certain circumstances the defendant might appear in his own behalf . And this , as per request filed with him that day , was the intentof Arthur Bean . Rumor further had it that Bean intended full confession , along with the names of certain persons he claimed as accomplices  --  members of a confraternity not unknown either to the community or to burning , but never before publicly named . Rumor had it this way at least on the left side of the room . The right side sat mum . " This is why Neil Dobbin 's been hanging about , chaps say , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the absence of the district attorney or assistant , the foreman usually conducts the examinationof witnesses , but his uncle , to his mother 's regret , had been required to do so only twice . Dobbin had been in almost constantattendance , to the surprise of some . " Rum thing , " said his uncle , taking a sip of his tea , now cold . Lucine came around to replenish it , while his mother watched , squintingher eyes away from the sight of a prerogative now taken from her , unable to stop monitoring Lucine 's handling of the pot , too heavy for herself to lift , that she had taken to using only recently  --  a monster of a pot of some thick Irish ware come down to her from her father , big as a hearth in the orange woolen cozy it wore even in this weather . " Rum thing . . . " Arthur Bean 's act , he said , was known to be one of personal vengeance . Because of drunkenness , he had been read out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been hard put to it to find any accomplices , least of all those he claimed . But it would be odd if these , never before having had to account for what they had done , were to be brought to reckoning on what they had n't . " Rum . " Justice , however , was not required to be so specious . On the Mondaythat Arthur Bean , having waived immunity , was scheduled to appear , he did not do so , nor could he be found in any of his haunts on that or any subsequent day . The members of the jury ap/peared as usual , indeed , as had seldom occurred during their tenureso far , in almost full number  --  every one being in attendance on the right-hand side . All of these concurring , a true bill was found against Arthur Bean on charges of arson . No one might say either that they had been afraid to appear , or , having done so , had failed to perform their duty to the people 's side . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only God had marked the sparrow , the disappearance of even a bachelor of low habits like Bean would have left a gap that could not be ignored  --  lack of gossip alone would have been telltale . Tuscana , snubbed as it had been by the dam , by the preferential rebuilding of the two towns destroyed when the earthworks had given , had kept its character far longer than most . But now , in the daily spillover to and from Denoyeville and Charlotte , strange cars , piloted by strange faces , pullulated in the streets like jack rabbits . There were thirty thousand people now in the three towns . In the matter of cars and people both , it was no longer humanly possible even to keep the bloodlines clear in the mind . Only the Negroes , encysted in the body politic , could still do this , sometimes for others , always at least for themselves . But from the advantage of a fixed position in life , they would know better than anybody how to save their breath , when to hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suddenly expanded , his own with it . On this evening , two nights after the verdicton Bean , his uncle came up the steps , slowly as usual , but without his paper , his face red and abstracted , for once outside their trinity , and told them that he 'd been made a fool of . " For fair , " he said , sitting down , his air still angrily distant but already more judicial , now that he was telling . " For fair ! " Repetition had grown on him , carryover from his new work maybe , or perhaps as it grows on the aging  --  a recognition of the sameness of what life has to teach . " About Bean ? " His mother 's face was shrewd , live , in the way that his uncle would normally have rejoiced to see it . Whatever he hadp285to tell her , life was lapping her round . " No doubt we 've all been made fools of there . " " Bean ? That 's the least of it . Or only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George . " His mother stretched her lips in what once would have been a smile . She knew he was no fool . " Of why Dobbin 's hanging so close . And all of them knowing it , I 'll wager , except yours truly . " He paused , then put his fist against his forehead , not distracted but grave , as Pierre had once seen him do long ago . " Of course . Of why yours truly has been let be foremanat all . " " But you said . . . the judge appointed ... " " Before this , the judge was always Fourchette . Or another one of that  --  of the like . A closed corporation , as they say , for judge and jury both . Why , not one of that crowd but 's been on it a dozen times . A fiddle for the foreman it must have been usually  --  any one of them who could read . " He looked up from his twirling of the cup that Lucine had just set before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he 's sitting there . " " Surely all that 's nothing new . Not for here . " Pierre , in his corner , started . He had never heard her speak of Tuscana from such disloyal distance  --  from any  --  or not for years . Frost . Are there frosts here ? Not since then . " No , that 's not . " " George . . . " Impossible for her to shrink further , into a smaller space , one would have said , but now she seemed to . " Then it 's you . With that crowd . Some danger . Because you never  --  " She broke off , glancing sidewise at the servant . Because he never had joined them , she had been going to say . Up to now , Pierre had never thought of this as remarkable . Their reticence  --  his mother 's and his uncle 's  --  had always left so much submerged , unremarked . " No , Dolly , of course not , " he said , intent on the cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , though . " His words came more measured even than usual . " I like to know . I like to know beforehand what 's going on . One does n't like to be used . " Then he looked up andp286saw her . " There 's no danger , " he said quickly . Gulping his tea at a draught , he set the cup down and leaned astride of her , a hand on either arm of her chair . To be a good liar one must have more self-deception , thought Pierre , remembering them seen once through the bedroom door , just so posed . To lie well , especially to those one loves , one must join one 's own self-deception to theirs  --  and he has none . " There 's no danger ! " his uncle repeated . At once his mother sat back , knowing at once that there was . " From where ? " she said . His uncle sat down again . " It 's naught . . . naught . " One of his hands went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew , as if this could not be lied to . What queerly constricted gestures the old made , they made , Pierre thought . He had never seen them kiss . But in times of stress , they always made for each other 's hands . Then he remembered , with a shock because he had forgotten , he had forgotten , the time of stress when this had been their only means of communication . " When the towns went under , " said his uncle . " They 're looking into it  --  you might say . " " When the dam burned . . . " She was quiet for what seemed long . Then she spoke crisply . " Arson . Is that it ? And they meant to hang it on Bean . " " No , " said his uncle , " not on Bean . And not arson . " " Six years ago . " Her voice dimmed momentarily , to the one people kept for the past  --  the good past . " Seven , " said Pierre . His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We were in Memphis , " she said , and Pierre wondered how even on the night of his homecoming , he could ever have thought the three of them , under their evening light , a trinity  --  for here she was , dreaming back on her wedding trip , he of the boy who had been left behind , and meanwhile his uncle , catching his eye , was trying to exchange with him the glance that two men , in the presence of an infinitely wounded woman , will give one another . Only the watcherp287outside sees a unity , he told himself , and still felt his chest fill with longing . " Almost seven . " She came out of her dream . " But that 's so far back . So long ago . . . what are they ? . . . and not arson . . . and not ... " Her needle-finger moved back and forth on her thumb . Soon she would have it , whatever it was , and if time were allowed her , the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martindale . " ) " Long enough , " said his uncle . He reached for his newspaper , and not finding it , held his cup sideways to be refilled . When it had been , he sat without drinking . " Long enough . But they 've ways of getting what they 're after . That thing they call statute of limitations . ' " He pronounced it carefully . " It does n't hold . Not against  --  murder . " A cheek muscle twitched , as if his mouth begrudged the word it had made . Neither of his auditors repeated it , but the word went round the table , joining the three of them like an alerting whisper . Finally his mother spoke . " Whose ? " Pierre held his breath , so sure of the name that would come like a face seen at a window pane and summoned from within , the name of another boy whom by now no one should have remembered . " I doubt if they know for certain  --  or care . But they 're inquiring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy that the hiring office took on a few days before the dam went . Two colored boys  --  by the name of Perry Brown and Lucius Asher . " A low groan came from behind them  --  not a sound that anyone would ever forget  --  a low dove-bubble of woe . Lucine still held the pot . They saw that when she turned . It was not until they turned on her , a phalanx of three suddenly reminded that they were four , that the old pot slid from her hand . She backed up before them , eyes shifting like an animal that has messed , and hunched herself , still backward , through the house door . Inside , they heard her at the closet that held the brooms . They waited withoutspeaking , but she did not return . " Curse the habit here , " his uncle said then , very low . " Never a second name , like dogs . Is she an Asher . . . or a Brown ? "  | " Both , " his mother whispered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from eyes stretched wide in sockets worn down at the temples to two thin , pulsing spots like a baby 's soft one , the fontanel reborn in the death 's head . And her cry , when it came , was terrible , that piercing wail so strangely colonial , so late . " This never would have happened  --  at home ! " But although her gaze was fixed , they could not tell whom it accused , whether it was for his uncle  --  over the deed just done , or because now she knew exactly what was his danger , or for her son  --  because he was a son , or because he too had taken himself from her , or whether it was only for the old smashed pot , lying there with its great shards sticking up awkward as broken bones through wet orange wool and weeping tea leaves . If a member of the grand jury know , or have reason to believe , that a crime has been committed which is triable in the county , he must declare the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . Code Cr . Proc. , Section 252 " There is no statute of limitations against m-memory . " All that night the words inserted themselves through his tossing , in the dreamer 's blind , timbreless notation  --  the first phrase coming with exaggeratedslowness from around a corner , then the final one appearing , always with the stammer , then the substitution . While it was still dark , he forced himself up from sleep , dressed , shivering with the low physical ebb of the hour , turned on the light over his childhood desk and sat down there , still drugged , to wait for whatever people did wait in such vigils  --  perhaps the birds . Long before their edgy cries , he heard the call of a train , one out of all that convocation which used to push up the dawn here , a short , stopped plaint from far across the hill , in the new yard miles away . Then he was left to hear what , since his arrival , he had never quite kept himself from hearing : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  as if valved from a venous system shared by all inhabitants here  --  that had always seemed to him the real sound of this place . Nop289quicklime of leaving , under which his new world had all but vanished , was ever to be proof against it . Across from him was the same window frame at which he had once flung Demuth 's chocolate . He had lost the power ever again to see that clearly ahead of him . On the desk at his elbow were two half-finished letters , one , already crumpled days back , to Lovey , the other to Serlin  --  neither of which he was ever to mail . As he left the room , about to douse the light , he let it stay , for the possible use , maybe , of some crafty presence that must never have left it , his own Doppelganger perhaps that all these years must have remained here holding down the seat reserved for him somewhere between honesty and doom . There was a dim light on in the parlor too . In direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own vigil , in the chair so recently arranged for him , his head bowed over his knees . He has fallen asleep under it , Pierre thought , glancing through the door , slightly ajar , of the second bedroom , where , in the blue light of yet another lamp , his mother lay profoundly still under her sedative . Then his uncle 's shoulders moved , his head bobbed above hands clasped tightly in front of him , and Pierre , frozen where he was , thought " He is weeping , " turned to move away and could not , stayed by the bond in his breast that held him toward the man on the sofa , toward the figure of him seen from the train three years back  --  figure of a man he could ask , could trust never to ask  --  and scarcely breathing , he stood there , thinking " He can weep . " He himself had not wept since the night he had gone to look for Johnny , and now , with the careful stiffness of one reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can weep . " As he watched , these thoughts passed through him , not in confusion , under their own lamp , and he took a step , his own eyes hot , across the distance that had always been too great for speech . " Mind yourself  --  ! " He had been stopped just short of treading on a line of shards spread on the floor to dry , their edges glistening . Others lay on the table , some grouped on a square of paper . A tube of glue lay beside them . His uncle looked up from the pieces he held gripped togetherp290for pressure between his fingers , the undamaged handle protruding . He made the faint , shamed grimace of someone detected at a puzzle not deep enough . After a minute he got up , carrying his hands before him as if he had a cracked egg in them , and leaned over the table , examining the paper . Behind him , Pierre leaned with him , his eyes returning to focus . Neatly , as in a mechanical drawing , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fragments , and numbered them . Very slowly now he shifted the mended pair to the proper spot in the center , imperceptibly released them , and withdrew his hands . He flexed his cramped fingers , uttering a sigh that said nothing distinguishable , cast Pierre the same apologetic grimace , and went out to the scullery , where he could be heard setting the kettle to boil . Bending down , Pierre picked up the fragments from the rug and set them on the table , one by one . Neither will he speak , he thought , neither will he press others to . On a spindle of a chair nearby , a black oilcloth shopping bag hung slackly by one of its worn straps , the shiny surface rubbed down to the fabric in many old creasings  --  Lucine 's tote-bag , used each night to carry back to her own quarters that tithe of the day 's larder which she considered her due . All of the house servants " toted , " in anonymous packages or in bags like these , the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except by those new wives from the North who could not be made to understand the difference between this and stealing , that it was the " squeeze " which still linked servant to household in the old way of owning and being owned  --  a portion which could never be taken care of ( as more than one , to local smirkings , had tried ) in the wage . Lucine , by marriage an Asher and a Brown , by color probably a Booker , or one of the Dibbelaises or Bontemps brought here by whites from Louisiana , came of trusted strains ; she had been away , but not too far , to the convent  --  by virtue of all this , not in spite of it , she still toted . Tonightthe canvas cot she slept on here in the parlor was neatly stacked as usual in the corner in which she replaced it each morning , took it down again after her evening visit to the backs  --  forp291this too , even if they slept in , was their unfailing habit , as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own could renew . But now it was nearly morning . The broom closet hung open , bare of the single change of garment and towel she kept there , and she had gone without her tote-bag . In the hall , the phone , long since muffled by some trick of his uncle , struggled to burr , scarcely doing so before his uncle reached it . He spoke into it at some length , so inaudibly that Pierre could hear the kettle at boil . Mashing the tea , putting the milk in the cups as had been done in his childhood , he peered out the scullery window . All the other houses on the street were dark . To any watcher opposite , theirs , frailly lit at all corners , must seem like some warningcraft cradling disaster as carefully as his uncle had his cracked egg , making the watcher think perhaps of how all households ripened toward dispersal , even of how tonight Higby 's was the safest , since it rode the dark already knowing where its own disaster lay . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 've no nurse to spare us . " He sat down heavily for him , always so neat and median in his ways . The china bits on the table listed faintly , and some of the sugar he was spooning pattered like sand . " We 'll have to manage by ourselves . " " She wo n't come back , then ? " Pierre nodded toward the tote-bag . " They 'll want to stay out of it . One ca n't blame them . Even if she would  --  the rest wo n't let her . They 'll fold their tents  --  now that they 've heard . " " But you 'll be out of it too , then . If you have to stay here . " " Yes , " said his uncle . " I s 'll have to beg off . I s 'll be out of it . Yes . " Pierre drank his tea in silence . The silence of the young , cold with its own fear of compromise , is a bitter courtesy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You chose not to beg off in the beginning . " Last night , when I said what I did  --  that I would not be used  --  I said it in anger . . . . " Last night , when my mother cried out again and said , " Now sendp292me to hospital ! " you refused her . " No , " you said , " you 'll stay here . And I with you . " I saw her grateful look when you said that . You chose . " One way or t' other , " said his uncle , " a man must expect to be used . " You chose to break your oath . You will be . " But one does n't always choose for oneself , d' ya see . . . you see that ? " I see that you can speak , in your way . " For that matter . . . rather by Dobbin . . . than by that crowd  --  " And I listen  --  in mine . " That man , Dabney Mount  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scrap  --  you remember ? " I remember . All the characters are coming out of lodging . " Stopped me yesterday , as I was leaving . Asked after your mother ... that dirt . Hinted he 'd like to sponsor me at the cockfight , down at Semple 's . They keep a cock there , you know , match it once in a while , just for show . " I know . Shall I ever tell you  --  what I know ? " The Lord is my witness I 've never been friend to them . " No one is my witness . And the listener is never the friend . " What 's Dobbin after ? " said Pierre . At these words , his uncle leaned back in his chair , his eyelids rising and falling  --  and Pierre saw that he had been speaking in that communicative trance which comes with exhaustion ; not counting other interrupted nights and days , he had been up since six the previous morning . " Jury trial . " He spoke thickly . " Get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get the names down on legal record , sooner or later they 're done for . " He rested his head back . " Done . " He closed his eyes , his lips still moving . " ' Write that kind of cock with two k 's , do n't you , ' I said , Mount ? ' " " What 's in it for Dobbin ? Why would he ? " The district attorney 's : name was faintly familiar , surely local . " Judgeship . Say he wants . . . federal ju'ship . " His head movedp293from side to side . " Do a job , maybe  --  know whose blood he is . " His jaw fell , closed again . " Forty winks . You spell me . " His chin sank to his breast ; the stubbled cheeks moving tranquilly out and in . It had barely rested so , when the whole head snapped back , eyes wide . " Somebody outside . At the door . " Pierre went to answer it ; had his hand on the knob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear ; he had been crept up upon from behind . Silently he was motioned aside , his uncle 's hand , arm outstretched , replacing his on the knob , turning it fraction by fraction . Suddenly he whipped the door back against him . Nothing entered except a little dark , of the same temperature as the room , yet different , the infinitesimal gap between outdoors and in , appreciable in the roots of the hair , by the skin on the backs of the hands . His uncle peered around the door , Pierre after him . Nothingwas there . As they stood there , they heard the gathering chipchipof the birds . " Dreaming myself in Ireland  --  must have  --  " said his uncle . He had been a Tommy there from 1916 until the truce , was ashamed of his part in the war , ordinarily never spoke of it . " That 's what they used to tell us . " He spoke close to Pierre 's shoulder , eyes on the distance , as an elder huntsman might speak in low-voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pierre nodded , as if he too could see Ireland . Eastward , the great embankments rode like true cloud , their immense counterside as hidden . At such an hour , or darker , a town enfeoffed here might still dream it kept its own horizon . " Uncle  --  " He spoke without thinking , as men say  --  or from the seat in the depths of thought , ever reserved . " Get me to Dobbin . I know the names . " In the moment he spoke he knew his stumble as an actor does , foresaw the look on his uncle 's face before it turned . " You  --  ? You know ? " The role of the listener is never fully learned . His uncle swept an arm outward . Against that wide sweep , hisp294whisper seemed small . " D' ya think there 's anyone  --  including Dobbin  --  who does n't ? " Still whispering , he pushed Pierre inside . " Including  --  the jury ? " The door closed safely behind them . " Including  --  Bean ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scraping . It came from outside the back door ; an animal , no animal . While they watched , the door opened . A dark hand appeared , set down an old leather satchel roped with clothesline , a corded wood box , a bulging string bag . She came in crabwise , pushing the baggage behind her with one gray , bare heel . Once in , she set down her shoes , rested the small of her back against the door . When she faced round and saw them , she straightened away from the door , hanging her head sideways , arching and lowering it , eyes large on them , cast down and raised again , standing so with her goods beside her  --  Lucine . Her face was a bad color , but whatever had affrighted it lay behind or ahead of her  --  not in them . While they watched , she slid out a foot , watching them , slipped the foot into its shoes , then the other , managingin the same movement to edge the satchel further into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden half-bob , begging permission , in the same instant taking it . Quick as an eel , she stowed the satchel in one corner , the box in another , where they fitted perfectly , in niches the small room never would have been thought to hold , as if all the way here she had been reflecting on her scrub-pail lore of it , saying to herself : the satchel will be out of their way under the sofa , the deal box just fit where the molding ends , behind the chair . When she stood up , her face had returned to its natural ocher , her figure , patted here and there , to its neat calm  --  a world away from that bare , searching heel . Arms folded , she looked down , expressionless , at the broken stuff on the table . Something , her breath perhaps , dislodged them as she hung over them . As they all watched , the large , mended piece gaped slowly at the jointure , the part with the handle rubbling over on its side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame , and went on to the corner where the cot was stacked . Taking it down , she turned , regardingthem.  | " I 'll mek up the cot in t'yere , " she said softly . " You go on , get what res ' you can on it ; t'aint only four . I 'll go ' long in there , sit with her . " This too must have been reflected . She put out her hand , just short of his uncle 's sleeve . " Mek it up good and nice for you , you go on . Less you get your res ' , you be all tuckered out in the morning . " Soft as steel , her voice urged , speaking its ownership  --  they of her , she of them . " You go on , now hear ? Less you be all tuckered , time you got to go to the courthouse . You go on . " And so next day  --  he went on , and all his entourage with him , in that small craft where each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while all thought themselves still , in a great estuary of the same . There come times in men 's lives when any accounts of their inner monologues can not further explain them . Only their acts can record them then , as later they must record themselves . Such a time had come for Pierre . On that day his uncle , rising from his cot , left about an hour and a half late for his duty ; his mother , awakening early to hers , curling up like a griffon on her pillows , silently let herself be tended by Lucine , saying only when time came to move her : " I 'll bide here . " He himself , not returning to bed , marked the day only by showering and changing his clothes . Lack of sleep benumbed them all , letting each harbor his shocks and his speech , promising a day without any heroic other than that needed to get through it . Meanwhilethe weather had " gone in , " as people said here of those gray interims , blamed by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in and took the appearance of heat with it , leaving greens sharper , sounds cooler , people abstracted to shades in a lull like a midweek Sunday or a snow , during which some hastened to sit with their kind over minor husbandries , others sat away from them , paring their nails , hearing time bide . Is there an ecology for all climes perhaps , some balanced pause between a life and the lives around it , when the actionless can act ?  |p296Pierre  sat in his room as usual that morning , rereading one of the few books he had brought with him . Usually he kept his door closed until Lucine 's soft knock apprised him that she was going to shop , when he opened it in order to hear his mother 's bell . Today he did not close it . Around midmorning his mother suddenly asked for something to sew , a request not easy to satisfy now that the linens had been mended , and all the paraphernalia of her trade cleared away . Finally , at her direction , a packet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found for her , where it had been lodged with others in one drawer of the old treadle sewing machine now stored in his room . He had glimpsed enough  --  edges of photographs , letters thin enough to be foreign , envelopes thick enough to be documentary , to know that he had come upon the hoarding-place for which as a boy he had sometimes pried , but now he did not pry . Scattered among the books on the shelf above his desk were certain ones any meddler might have assumed to be his own private mementos : the largest , a German dictionary with an inscription on the flyleaf , the oldest ( faded to curiosa long before it could have been his ) a bookseller 's trinket marked Affection 's Gift for 1845 , the smallest , so insignificant that it must have been saved for a reason , a dime-store address book with one leaf gone . They were ranged above his head as brashly as the silver cups of the oarsman , as plainly as the purloined letter  --  the book he had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of his life , that he had bought  --  but any watcher might have seen as plainly that today he did not look at them . All that day he comported himself with awkward honesty , an especialopenness , for what great eye at the transom ? Watch a secondstoryman on his way to work at dusk , as he drops his quarter in the beggar 's cup , see how far from the cup his fingers are , spread wide at the root as a child 's . Follow tomorrow 's headline bogeyman today , on his way not to keep his black appointment , as he sees the movie twice , yawns at the marquee , trembles into conversation at the coffee counter , cedes his place in the bus queue , and still arriveson time . And Pierre too managed it so that some twenty years later his most inflexible arbiter , eager informer , might say here , " He wasp297honest as the day  --  that day . As far as I know  --  he premediated noth-ing . " That afternoon he had an errand which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a house across town , pick up a wheel chair relinquished by the death of a woman there , and trundle it back home . Actually the chair was one of a scarce few circulated to chronic outpatients by the new hospital in Denoyeville , but since , as it happened , the woman had been a Mrs. Jebb , their former neighbor , politeness had delayed the exchange until after the funeral , which had been yesterday . Better not wait for the hospital delivery , Mr. Jebb had kindly informed them by telephone ; better pick it up by hand , since it was no shape for car transport , and wheel it to its new destination . In the routine of respectable loss , the Jebbs would be " at home " today at four . Other afternoons , setting out for the daily walk without which his stint here would have been intolerable , he always paused below the porch steps for a minute , looking westerly down the few blocks that led to the center of town , then turned east , always on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-and-a-half-mile bypass to Denoyeville , breaking into an easy track-pace on the way there , going at an amble on the way back . Denoyeville had been rebuilt on a single idea ; in the middle distance of its dams , as he approached it , that idea still presided and was noble . Otherwise , once he got to its main street , walking between its seven-year brick antiquity and six-month shoddy , he was in the useful limbo of the quick , ledgerbuiltAmerican city , after-image of others even as one stood in it , lost to the closed eye quicker than one could say Ozymandias . Nothingin Denoyeville was ever likely to be older than its name . He was of the generation not yet repelled by this , but comforted . Usually he sat for a while , sweat-soaked and air-cooled , behind the plate glass of the big new Whelan chain drug , at a counter where , except for the hominy on the club breakfast , he might be anywhere south-ofwinter , north-of-summer . Sitting there , for an hour or so he was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of things filial , he would have nop298time for that . He had an errand not his own . So , in the nature of things , after a pause below the porch steps , in which he seemed only to be looking into the general lull , he turned on his heel and walked west . So , late downbeat after the measure , we follow him . He came near the cafe , where he had never been inside . There would have been time and enough to stop and meditate there . But it had too much past  --  or not enough of one  --  for him to want to enter it now . He went by it . He came to the church where his mother was to marry his uncle . Had . A church is a proper place to meditate . But he remembered it too well with the light out over its door , and went on . There is a ring game that children play , with an " it " in the center , the rest in a ring , hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . " It " has three tries for the gaps in the circle . Here a boy confronts him in a bush . Another bars his way in the bramble . Between those trees is a third . Such a trio confronted him now , unseen by anyone but him , at three doors . One at the courthouse , one at the school , one at the store . Let the school come first , as it does for most . Its yard was null with summer , the door sealed . The boy there was no more distinct for him than for most men . He passed him quite easily . Next came the store , far down the baseline of his triangle , beneathits old scribble of neon blue . No Semple lounged under it now , creasing and recreasing his duck trousers to an ingoing line of creditors , allotting leeway to some with a nod or odd crook of his thumbs , refusing others with a stillness , a stare . Credit was being arranged for him elsewhere . As a stranger in town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , think only , as he approaches the door with the hung sign which like others on the way will say CLOSED NOON WEDNESDAY , that this is the only reason the street is so empty , folk retreated somewhere behind their gray weather and their Wednesday . As a stranger , therefore , he approached the store . Half a yard from it he bent his head , sauntered by without looking . Per/baps he saw that it had a small annex or lumber-room ; things catch on the periphery of sight that the eye does not will . The door to this was on the other side of it , hidden . So , if a boy stood there , he passed him . Now he faced the apex , the courthouse . Its steps lay directly across a square of park , behind two sentinel trees . A paved path circled the park and the courthouse walls . Politely as any outsider , he took the path . Just as he did so , a figure standing at the top of the high steps , boy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went inside . Judgment was always in session ; this had nothing to do with him . He examined the face of the building like any tourist who would not bother to go inside to view its staple of flag and lectern , gloom-light that fluttered in women 's breastpins  --  who had no uncles there . Portcullis 187o , inscriptionabove it too worn to read . " Nomen mutabilia sunt " perhaps  --  names are mutable  --  as would do for any court in the land . " Res autem immobilis . " " Ring " may not move . He drew a finger along the cornerstone , where there was an old watermark , flood mark , three feet or so above the foundation line . A few pariah dogs were alwaysslumped there , for god-knows-what-all , not for warmth surely , perhaps fraternity . One of them , muzzle stretched on its paws , rolled up its eyes at him and measuredly thumped its tail . He shook his head at it , at the door up above . Once entered there  --  judges , Dobbinsof whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock . " Got me wrong , " he said aloud to the dog . " I 'm a stranger here . " At once , not ten yards from him , he saw the gap in the circle  --  the mud alley where the farmers set their stalls on Fridays , that had been here always  --  as if the hypnotist had at last slapped him , stung himselfawake . He ran toward it . Behind him , the dog , its brow wrinkled , again thumped its tail . Once in the alley he went at a brisk pace , just short of the one he kept for Denoyeville , otherwise he would get to the Jebbs before expected . Going along , he hummed . Down here , he opened his mouthp300so seldom that his voice had been rusty when it addressed the dog , but now he was up and about again in the jigtime , daytime world . " Do , act , speak , laugh ! " he chanted to himself , as he sometimes did in that other world , where personality could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had only one  --  perhaps everyone lost courage for alternatives there . This alley was grim now with the general Ash Wednesday , but he meant to visit it on its bright bourseFriday , if only to remind himself , like an Alger hero at the scene of his first dollar , of the great bourse to which he had escaped . He stopped now , to look back at the obstacle race just run . There were no planes in the sky , not one since he had been here , to remind him that to some , Tuscana was invisible , not swinging alone as Arcturus , not holding all that there was to the human condition in its sphere . To the new men at the dam it was already bypassed . Those who revisit the buildings of childhood , it was said , always find them shrunken  --  the chandeliers to rushlight , to wickets all the imperial gates . It was the fault of his " familiar , " then , that cartographer of the condemned and accurate eyes , if the three buildings he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some , seemed to him as large as they had ever been . Unless he was careful to keep chanting , they might yet appear  --  golden architraves floating on shadow  --  as seen once through other eyes , from the height of a hill long fallen , whose scale could never now be known . He was walking slower now , checking the house numbers where there were any . The Jebbs must have gone down the ladder since leaving the high estate of the Higbys ; this street petered out just ahead of him , almost at the railroad line . Yonder , where there had once been fields of weed that moved like wheat in the evening breath of the trains , now only one short one kept the divide . The opposite edge of the backs had crept nearer . A rim of shacks lined it , already harum-scarum with the rows of plants they potted in tins , unmatched curtains flying their savage motley , but the porches and chimneys were straight , not yet tumbledown , and the tar-paper covering , stamped to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep301seedy houses , some derelict , all pale as Methodists gone far in drink , still had the indefinable look of the white dwelling . He found numbersnine and thirteen , no eleven , none marked Jebb . Eagerly he retraced his steps , looking for the special signs of life that marked the house of death on its post-interment day here  --  a concourse of women mostly , walking in with prepared faces , coming out , wry or pleased , with a bit of jet or a cookpot , trophy of agility as well as grief . The chair would be ceded to him in somewhat the same rhythm , in progression from sideline to sideboard , from random elegy to calculatedbottle and cake : he knew how people were here , and not only here . He was half reluctant to miss this diversion , not scorningit , as usual with the young . Already he had begun to understandold people who attended funerals with which they had no earthly connection , patient ghouls hurried by age toward the gossip that might be eternal , old voyeurs after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all bending over the casket to look at the cut gem . And of course he must have the chair . " You come about the chair , h'aint you ? " The question , echo , came from a man hurrying around the corner of number nine , on legs so short that he toddled . " Saw you from the window . Cai n't see this place from the road . " He led the way , the dumpy seat of his sawed-off pants grimaced this way , that , by his gait , toward a shamblesof a cottage not much larger than its outhouse . On the porch , he stamped his boots long and virtuously , looking up at Pierre with soft , brown-bulb eyes . " Doggone if she warnt right ! She held all along nobody 'd come but you ! " He was a compact gargoyle of a man , whose outline came to points at several places , at the high shoulder blades and the ears , between which an oval cranium rose like a darning egg , protected by a cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pierre remembered the deceased , the huge slattern in slippers , neighborhood fence-leaner , who had eased herself into their household the day his mother had been carried home . He had never seen Jebb until now  --  if this was Jebb . The mailbox , clamped to the porch post , showed another name . It said Bean.  | " She says to come on in and have something first . " The man swallowedshyly . ' Wo n't be no snap , lugging that thing all the way back to Rhine Street . " So they surely knew him then ; he was in the right place , or the wrong one . " No thanks , I wo n't trouble you . " He stole another look at the mailbox . " I 'll just get the chair and go on . " " She says to . " The brown eyes shone trustfully up at him . Oracle , whoever " She " is , says to . " Come on ! " a voice boomed from within , deep , but a woman 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get under the door frame , the first thing he saw was the expected : humble table substituted for sideboard , pop bottles for liquor , food in a stiff array not yet broached except by the energetically breeding flies , to one side of all this a large box . " He would do it , " the voice added . " Told him only one to count on was you . " He followed the voice to its origin  --  the chair . " Chair , " as it might have been addressed , was prodigious  --  a high , oaken affair , pedaled , chained and levered , on tandem-size wheels  --  and chair was filled . An immense bulk of a woman sat in it , trunk-legs planted on the footrest , baby-shaped hands at the wheels . In the elephant-hide dimness she filled the chair without jointure , like one of those balloons that rode carnival carts , Buddha head lolling in a fixed , aerated smile . His first wild thought was that this was the waxwork exhibit itself , the deceased Mrs. Jebb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day too early after all . Then " She " rolled forward , saying " Howdy " ; the short man urged a chair under his knees from behind , and there he was , wedged between them , tender focus of their inch-close solicitude , feeling extraordinarily like a dummy himself . " Here you are , now . " A loaded plate was thrust on his lap from the right  --  potato chips , grocer 's ham , cake indefinable , curdled slaw . " Eat hearty now . " Stocking-cap nodded at him pleasedly , over-extendingit , like a child playing house . " She 'd have liked that . " From Pierre 's left , the woman snorted , at the same time pushing into his grasp a pop bottle . " Thank you , thank you ! " Pierre turned his head to each . " Mr.p303Jebb , is n't it ? " The woman would be the dead wife 's mother , that was it . " Mrs. . . . Bean ? " " Jebb ! " both chorused at him , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regarding him , their simpleton , between them . " Marcus Jebb , " the man said . " And this is Mother . " The woman blinked , accepting . Her son clasped his hands primly , sat up straighter . " Bean . . . he took off somewhere couple weeks ago , ai n't been heard of since . Leaving her all swole up and helpless , right there in that chair . " He swallowed again , eyes bulging with the accompanying emotion , whatever it was , virtue perhaps , and its own modest pleasure in same . Pierre , unsure of where to allot his sympathy , looked back and forth between them . " Oh , then you 'll still need it , " he murmured . " I mean , the chair . " Both exploded in laughter , Mr. Jebb slightly behind his mother , like two straight men over the sally of the comedian between them . " Not her , " said Mr. Jebb when he had recovered , nodding toward his mother . " Her , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plate , as if it were there , hovering over this honor done her , that the departed might still be found . " Did n't wait till she passed on . Bean and my old missus , I mean . He just took off . " " She took off first ! " the woman said harshly . " And do n't you ever forget it ! " With sudden violence , she gave the chair a shove , sending herself past Pierre 's knees to the table , where the wheels wedged , bringing her to rest just over the food . Slowly she hoisted herself up , a job for block and tackle , or for what already glutted her eyes , expandedher doll-shaped nostrils . Seeing her upright , it was already improbable to imagine this diva of the flesh as ever sitting , ever moved from where she was except by some fluxion of gas within or ground beneath , then as suddenly she kicked the chair behind her with a foot that came from beneath her skirt like a kitten and disappearedagain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't yet ready for it . " She applied herself to the food , at first without benefit of plate , then turning back to them over a loaded one , her voice coming ventriloquially , as if thought were only a secondary chewing . " Mar/cus ' lawful wife she was . Always taking off with that Bean . Two years back , when Bean got the dam job , she took off for good . Then when he takes off , leaving her sick , she puts the health service on to us . Next of kin , they say , and you know who come running . " She paused , munching in the direction of her son . Mr. Jebb gave Pierre a gentle poke . " Eat hearty now , " he said . " You ai n't hardly had nothing . " Swallowing , he reclasped his hands . " Two weeks he waits on her , hand and foot , night and day . It ai n't decent , Marcus , I said , not after what she told the whole town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't . " " First-class burial , " said Mr. Jebb . " I 'll say . Last carriage empty , you know , for respect . That 's all right too , she was his children 's mamma . I wo n't say otherwise , Bean or no Bean . But surely , I said , you ai n't going on with that seconddaybusiness ! " Mrs. Jebb paused , this time in Pierre 's direction . ' That cake come all the way from the Jew dellycadessen in Denoyeville , " she commented , lowering at his full plate . " Do n't nobody make better funeral cake than the Jews . " Under her frown , he broke into the cake . Fondant cheeks pursed , she watched him work backwards across the plate , free himself as best he could of the sin of nongluttony . Mr. Jchb sat poised alert , on the edge of his chair . Catching Pierre 's eye on him , he swallowed again , not , as now could be seen , from present sentiment only , but from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jebb 's heart constantly rode so near the surface that every now and then he was put to the trouble of gulping it back down . " Delicious . . . " said Pierre into the silence , once , twice , and again when he had finished . More than this was expected of him , he knew ; he was their only hope of audience , of elegy ; how else was Mr. Jebb to divest himself of his feelings , his mother divulge what she yearned to , unless he knew his role ? Once more he repeated himself , this time , with a sudden hiccough of remembrance , in the town 's own idiom . " Very tasty . " " He would do it . " Hope gleamed again in her eel-jelly eye . " Who 'd come after those pickings out there , I said . No more and you 'd getp305from a hen in molt . " The hand resting on her bosom flicked toward the relic box and lay flat again . " Next of kin , that 's all he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  eight of them they had , four living and working  --  and when they come to choose was n't so much as a pinky-ring to go round . You 'll see , I said . Only thing in that place ai n't trash is the chair . " " Sorry to bother you about it . " Pierre stood up and took hold of the chair . " On such a sad day ! " he heard himself add . Why , it was easy ; the extra word , phrase , had popped out of him like a belch , half hypocrisy , half Coke . This then was what " condolences , " empty as the last carriage in a first-class burial , were for . We help each other round the bend , improvisers all . For Mr. Jebb , set off at last , as if by the turning of a proper key in his back , had begun a slight , steady rocking . What with his size and his cap , it gave him an unfortunateresemblance to a child needing to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that formal palsy with which mourners , greeting each other , say nothing , say all . Somberly his mother regarded him . " More'n one way to make a man remember you , ai n't there ? " she said to the air . " I say for shame . " " Give him something of Zella 's from the box , carry it on back to his folks , " said Mr. Jebb , aloof . " Her and them was neighbors . " " Oh , no no . Thanks , I 'll just take along this . " Mrs. Jebb held the screen door for him . The chair , too high for the jamb , had to be laid over on its side . It went out with a grudging noise , a catafalque dragging its chains . Mr. Jebb winced when it passed him . " Oh you there , hush ! " said Mrs. Jebb , from the door . " Bean give you the laugh , he could see how you take on . " Her son closed his eyes to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threshold . Hand knockingher bosom , still great with her story , she leaned over Pierre , her whisper hot in his ear , loud as the Trojan women . " Eight children they had , then she took off , saying he was n't big enough for her . " Legs adangle , the mourner once more gulped down what troubled him , bulging his eyes open , their indefensible smile.  | " I buried her , " said Mr. Jebb . They paid no attention when Pierre closed the door . Outside , he bent double over the laughter that had been mounting in him since he entered . Seeing the outhouse handy , and needing it , he went in . Its slatted window was almost up against the house . From the clinkingof plates , the Jcbbs must have returned to the feast . " Told you , " he heard her say . " Nobody come but him . " There was no answer except the hiss of a pop bottle . " Know your kidneys better'n your own mother ? Take some milk . Know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whether Mr. Jebb did as bade could not be seen , was never heard . After a pause , his mother spoke again . " See how you take on when I go ! " said Mrs. Jebb . On the way back the chair went hardily , broken in as any hired nag whose attendant was nodding , or laughing for all to see , like a fool . In the center of town , Rhine 's was just coming off shift ; the chair walked him through these noisy ranks , oblique glances , affordinghim something of the quick , uneasy rapport extended a cripple ; along quieter streets it freed him to listen , trotting him along behind with the high dignity of a Seeing Eye dog . After a while he bent over it with the trust one gave a talisman . It had its own silent repertoire , offering up such humoresques as Marcus Jebb , morsel , still alive and kicking between those two stern judges of anatomy , his She 's . Why should he always feel that laughter was somehow contrabandin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversion by way of it , was returning . Once more humming , he followed the chair . On the edge of niggertown it faltered , then went on . Quiet those streets seemed , in the low-keyed weather , but surely only in order to rise refreshed for the rich , brown evening , grackled with voices . He himself was sweating . If the demi-company here had folded its tents , in this fishbowl weather so had much of the town . But , nearing Pridden Street , the chair ambled , and he let it . Here were the horse troughs , never wetted in his time except with rainwater , each with its pilastered house behind it  --  a row of abdicated queens , Corinthian-curled . Natural ghosts , in the subaqueous lightp307they looked more alive than the streets through which he had come , the habit of stillness on them not for an afternoon but for years . Three of the latter had not much changed their color , all of them the gloomy off-white of smudged conscience , except one . There at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still white . Affection rose in him as he neared it , seeing it as neatly espaliered on reality here as it had remained in his mind . I-Iere it was , pretty and pallid as a harmless reminiscence should be , bloodless that battlement , absurdly prinked against the sky . The glassed-in card on the door no doubt still gave the same hours , ten to twelve , two to five . He stood back on the path to look at the place . It made him happy , token of what memory could do when it was kind . A smile quirked his cheek . He must have been happy there in spite of himself ; now , with graceful precision , it told him so . It had done as a proper memory should  --  it had kept itself up . And it had shrunk . He parked the chair at the side , in the shrubs where , with one of its quick changes , it fitted in at once , born to rosebay , waiting for a dowager of the same high-backed incarnation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had just done so yesterday , and stood inside . Was that the smell of berme seed cakes , the sound , just ceased , of a voice like Palmer script speaking ? No , the air had a hollow , glassed-in quiet  --  museum air , best in the world for reverie , when one had the museum all to oneself . But there on the ceiling were the molded garlands , just as he recalled them . Ike had not yet opened his eyes . When he did so , they were there . His watch told him that it was past five , but visitors had always been precious here , the rules only for form . A latecomer would still be welcomed by whoever was curator now . Quiet as an epitaph he felt the presentiment that Miss Priddenwas no longer alive , if only because he had not ever been urged to go and see her ; in the daily anthology at home she had not once reappeared . For memory 's sake perhaps this too was as it should be ; people kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thought of Miss P. intruding on her own image , she who had so timidly held it back from greater personages ' mirrors . But it wasp308the library that had been his love , still must be , for at the thought of standing again under that clerestory light , fingering the books there , he was filled with the most foolish emotion . He listened to it a moment , for its quality , then , still wondering , opened the low door under the stairs , and entered . It was the same , three shafts of light shining faintly even on this gray day . Still smiling , he moved to let one of them center on his face , a bit of sun long preserved for his coming . It was so foolish to feel as he did , such a welling of comfort as if he were some prodigal returning , at an age when he was still to do much of anything , good or bad . There was the famous table , and it was not the same , piled now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see were not native here . The new curator perhaps was a scholar , or perhaps some other boy , silent catechumen , came here , as once he . He liked the thought of that , turning to the shelves , a collection shrunken indeed now that he saw it , fingering one or two of those quaint incunabula that at a touch once again were real . Gazing down at The Voyage of Commodore Perry , he felt himselfonce more a stylite on his pillar , knew his emotion for that delicate levitation of the heart when it looks down from the burden of new innocences , on the old . Sweet room in amber , may heaven and Montgomery preserve thee  --  to return to even when one plans never to come back . He put the Commodore in his place again . A light was snapped on behind him . " Oh , sorry ! " said the man there . " Thought Miss Minnie 'd shut up shop for the day and gone home . " Later , Pierre 's eye would never erase its early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lamp , and there was no reason to  --  a head that kept its blunts and shadows firmly aligned in any light , like a good medal , whose outline , a breadth too small for the shoulders , at second glance had the same perfected , equivocal balancewith the body beneath as the old plaster casts of classical statues that were kept in a long gallery to themselves , demoted but not quite shelved , in the basement of the Metropolitan . There was no other resemblance  --  this face had eyes that were anything but blind.  | " I expect she has . I 'm afraid I took the liberty of letting myself in . I used to know this place quite well when  --  when I was a boy . Miss Pridden used to let me come in and read . " The man smiled slightly , from his height of the late thirties , early forties perhaps , at the word " boy . " " Oh , you knew my aunt , then . You knew  --  she died about six months ago ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do go on and have a look at whatever you want to . I sha n't be settling down for some hours yet . " " Thanks , I was just going . " " You 're sure now ? Actually , I just came in for a wash . " He stretched his arms in a jacket , crushed but not slack , that like his speech , his manner , had not been tailored here , yet he had said " Miss Minnie " in the slurred way that had . " Been a rough day . " Thanks , I should do . " He heard his own suddenly Anglicized inflectionwith embarrassment . It was one that rarely came over him even in answer to its like , but sometimes took him without warning , a secret obeisance , telling him that he was in the presence of his betters . " Nice place to work though , is n't it . " The man nodded . " Matter of fact , I 'm backing it here , while they build my place in Denoyeville . Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sauntered to the table , moved some papers , revealing a tantalus back of them , as if in dismissal , then turned , his head cocking , " You 're not  --  British ? Yet  --  you 're not from these parts ? " " I was born there . Brought up here . " Pierre hesitated . " Neither are you , are you ? I mean  --  from here . " " Went to school over there . Born in Boston . " There was the slightest intonation , as if from more reserve than would want to add " of course "  --  yet had . " Spent a good many summers here . Before your time , though . " His smile was friendly , not assumed but economical , quick and purposive toward decent intimacy , no further  --  it too learned in a good school . His hand hovered over the tantalus . " Hold on a minute . . . " He came forward . " You would n't by any chance be  --  you 're George Higby 's boy , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned back . " Wait a minute now . . . you 're the one . . . " Do n't tell me yet , his gesturep310said , this is my forte , my business . These were eyes that indeed took no dismissal , sunk back on the trail of some evasive knowledge that when it came would seem to do so not from them , but from those they were looking into . Summers here . Who ? It almost came to him , in the thin Palmer script of those mild confidences . The nephew from Boston .. . you 're the one who . Who are you ? " Paul . . . is n't it ? . . . Peter . . . Goodman ! That 's it . And you 've been away to college , up North . " He mentioned the name of it , in triumph . " That 's right . " Who ? " You know my uncle ? " " Well , rather ! " He bent over the decanter , pouring . " Like it up there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could see Pierre 's nod , but he had already flexed his brows in answer . " Should n't wonder , " he murmured . He turned . " Join me ? Wo n't you ? " " Thanks , sir . Do n't mind if I do . " Both laughed . Whoever he was , there had already sprung between them the nimbleness between two intelligences who can speak to one another , the easier perhaps in a foreign land . " Here you are . " His manner toward a younger man was perfect , Pierre thought  --  nothing of the pater , no spurious youth . Few of his own professors did as well . And yet there was about him what a few of the very best of these had  --  some superiority that shot its rays from several corners or one center , a nexus of talent not too forceful for manners , of some noblesse of ideas that did not disdain to clothe itself either in good jackets or poor ones , of men who roughed up both admiration and jealousy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , the man himself had told him where . Now  --  who ? " Drink up . " They were types to be wary of  --  just because he so admired them . They had the listener 's subtle frankness , and they were keen . And because , hungry as he was for his own level , this man 's smile , address , came to him like a breath from the North . " Funny old place , is n't it ? "  |p311Pierre  nodded . " Yes it is . Or  --  you mean Tuscana ? " " No . " A frown turned down the corners of the mouth , thinning it . " No . There 's nothing funny about Tuscana . " He was almost on the edge of it . Why could he not remember ! " You know , I have to confess something , " he said . " I do n't know your name . " ' Why . . . I am sorry ! " A light of amusement broke on the man 's face , turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I get to thinking that everybody . . . " Ile thrust a hand forward . " I 'm Neil Dobbin. "  | HE WALKED into the courthouse like a naked emperor . Orderhad not yet been called in the main room ; no one noticedhim standing there in his peculiar clothing . For him , his nakedness lay in what he had told Dobbin ; the jury would see it otherwise . His power lay in what he had not told . This no one would see at all . Yesterday 's lull was over ; outside the window the court attendant fished for a high shutter with his pronged pole and closed them in from the dazzle . It was the afternoon of the next day . He and Dobbin had been up a good part of the night , talking . The color of Dobbin 's eyes by night was gray-green ; he was forever after prepared to attest to that  --  to the special pattern that flecked them  --  in a court anywhere . And he still admired him  --  as one ranks those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a judgeship , then it was not that only he wanted , or rather , he could pursue it only along certain lines , deeper than principles , his " themes " perhaps , that flecked all his tissues in a pattern as specificallymapped as his irises , as similarly inborn . He was clearly incapable of wanting the judgeship above all , and this was admirable . Even as a listener , last night , he had had his subtleties , not to bep313deceived by the frank , transparent cornea , the sunny , reciprocal stare of youth alone . Confidences were his business too , and like the best of lawyers he knew the pace for them , sharing a dinner brought in downstairs by a manservant , risking the half-bottle of wine but not pressing it , shaking out a few metropolitan feathers for this hungry young man but never preening them , careful of this instrument that the gods had sent him , that of itself was so keen . At seven , the chair , glimpsed by accident through the dining-room window , was at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's message by hand , that he would dine late with a friend . By about eight , it would have been , Dobbin had heard of the Jebbs . No audience could have been more appreciative of them . It would have been about ten that he had heard all , had made his proposal . He too knew how to manipulate his brothers , listening with advocacy , like the best . It was not Dobbin 's fault if , lacking the ultimate imagination , he had assumed last night that he was joining truth to complete truth . His limitation was that of those born to the purple of never having felt alien in the world , born too rich to suspect the keenness that comes from poverty of spirit . Dobbin was blind to it . Unless , of course , his eyes changed color , saw better by day . By another nightfall this too might be known . Dobbin was in there now , in the smaller room where the grand jury was sitting . It was to have sat this morning also , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard this afternoon . " We shall present a witness . . . certain events on the night of September 19 , 1932 . You have already heard . . . concerning the alleged abductionof Lucius Asher and Perry Brown . . . . Evidence we shall hear . . . identification of persons allegedly involved in willful destruction of property belonging to the United States Government on that same date . . . . " Or however it would be  --  far less formal , Dobbinhad cautioned , than what he might expect to find . He understood , did he , that they were not trying a case here , only inquiring into the grounds for one . And if necessary , Dobbin had said , circlinga wineglass in its small orbit , " the people " might shift its grounds . Murder , property under federal jurisdiction , misconduct ofp314public officers , even , since they were in a corner of the state here , abduction across a state line . Federal grand jury . Dobbin put his glass down , not bothering to explain further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spokes of this invisible networkwhich surrounded the common man that even Pierre could see it : the small county jury moving across the field of justice like a company of moles with a lantern . And here , there , a face , a mask  --  a company of them  --  suddenly illumined in that swinging , polyhedrallight . He had put down his own glass , his hand trembling , only seeing the full extent of things now . What if  --  small towns beingwhat they were  --  some of both companies , mole and man , were the same ? What then ? Dobbin and he had not mentioned it between them , Dobbin only smiling  --  when he heard the names  --  a smile not learned in school . But out of the quorum of at least sixteensitting inside there now , how many , on learning of the line of testimony to come , had bent their nude cheekbones , looking into their laps for cover ? Now , suddenly , it was beyond his belief that any of them were in there , about to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them , not as he still saw them , all head , bodies no bigger than the unit men on graphs  --  a row of tiny figurants , each holding forward a face as large as a shield . But here he was , Dobbin  --  the same man who last night had stopped him short at a certain point , saying , " That 's enough , I guess . Let the rest of it come out before them "  --  cutting through the throng of idlers , petitioners , would-be licensees , politicos with a power range of one tobacco chew , cracker-barrel well-wishers , his passage across the room starred here , there with hands that reached and fell back , as if the touch of him held the king 's cure . Here he was , saying , " Good . You 're here . Good , " once more thrusting out his own hand . He drew Pierre aside , nodding as the judge passed them , coming out of chambers , a short , bald man with a pug jaw , two cranky dewlapsthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in here a moment , " said Dobbin , and drew Pierre inside the chamber . Later he had no memory of its looks , whether it had stayed itself with its fan and its flies , at the time not even reminding himselfp315that it was , had been , the Fourchettes ' office . All that afternoon things went on as if he had never been here before , or indeed anywhere , had no history up to or beyond each moment as he spellbound himself to it ; later , the act of that afternoon seemed the purest thrust from the void  --  an obelisk emerged from the depths , to no sound of waters dividing  --  as those acts must seem which rise from the total sea bottom of ourselves . " Recess , " said Dobbin . " Ten minutes or so . Then we 're ready for you . " Last night he had said " they . " He was smoking a cigarette whose stub he kept concealed in the hollow of one hand , occasionally peering in on it . " Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " " Last night ? " Asleep until an hour ago , he felt stupid , his own mask not gathered . " The old man who served us . He 's her father . " Was it all to be as simple as this ? Or was this too simple , even for Dobbins ? " Lucine came to me night before last . They 've a sixth sense , you know . " Dobbin was not looking at him . ' Wanted to testify . I shut her up of course . For her own good . And no use to us . " Generally , Dobbin had said last night , looking hard at him , eager  --  one witness to one fact , or one set of facts , is enough for a grand jury . Very often the complainant himself . But this one is no use to us . Who now were " us " ? " But the old man was terrified . Poor old devil , he feels guilty on his own part . And what he told me fits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same anonymous call  --  Stay inside ! ' Louie , the older boy , never came home  --  they would have got him as he came off the job . The old man tried to keep Lucine from going out after him , but she went . And while she was gone , Perry , the young kid , slipped out after his brother . She ran back in when the cars came . Went through without stopping , the old man said . For show . To show they had him . The flood cut niggertown off for two days . And Perry  --  he was only thirteen  --  never came back at all . " Dobbin 's voice was dry . " They would n't have  --  ! "  |p316Dobbin  raised an eyebrow . He felt his own softness , against men out for judgeships , out for other men . " Who knows ? Of course , quite a few were lost in the flood at the time . But we do n't know for sure , do we ? " His head flung back in sudden reflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just remembered . . . " He was awake now , enough to switch names , even marvel at his own sudden resource . " Perry . Did n't he used to carry for Miss Pridden ? " " Mmm , well . . . yes . Matter of fact , he did . " Distance was suddenlyput between them , between Dobbin and his job . This was not the issue . Silence  --  a false note of it . " They 've their own underground dynasties . That 's their real sixth sense , of course , nothing odd about it . My aunt used to say "  --  he said " awnt " now  --  " Just whisper to yourself in the mawnin ' ; bah nee-un-tahm int a dawky in nigguhtay-un do n't say to himself " Do tell ! ' His imitation was just a little bit out , careful not to mock too much . It was not hard to see how he would ingratiate himself here , how much he could imply , with no more selfincriminationthan any man who was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With an exclamation , he dropped the cigarette , down to a mere coal , onto the floor , spat forth a bit of the paper that had clung to his lip . He rubbed his hands together . His whole manner had coarsened , in the way of a man who puts on shabbier clothes to keep himself out of notice in a low neighborhood . " All right now . Rememberwhat I 've told you . You 'll be under oath of course , but there 's nothing else too formal about it , certainly not here . You 'll be able to tell your story . I 'll be examining you . Right ? " Thumbs in armpits , he regarded Pierre with satisfaction , as brought by the passage between them to a certain routine point that Dobbin recognized  --  as both softened and primed , shaken into that state of precipitation where Dobbin might look through him and let others do , to the goal beyond . " Right ? Let 's go . " Hand on Pierre 's shoulder , he guided him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the smaller one , outside which the attendant stood guard.  | " Dobbin , " said Pierre . There , that was better . If he said " sir " he would feel it . " You kept your promise ? " " Mmm ? " They had halted a few yards from the attendant . " My uncle . " " Oh yes . Took him aside early this morning . He knows you 're to be the witness . " Dobbin seemed already abstracted , shoulders hunched , hands in pockets , one softly clanking his change . " Nothing more ? " " No . " The curt tone reminded him that he had been advised last night that it would be preferable if his uncle were to be no more prepared for Pierre 's appearance than the rest . ( " Had n't you better be on your own in this , Goodman ? " ) Pierre 's insistence had been put down to filial delicacy , making it clear that either Dobbin knew less about the town than he himself thought , or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its annals . " What did my uncle say ? " Dobbin shook his head . " Not one for surprises , is he ? Just  --  was it still in order , then , for him to administer the oath ? " Dobbin made a vague , impatient gesture of dismissal . " Anyone may , of course . Juror , that is . Come along now . We must . " Then , in the very act of going , he turned , slipped his hands into his pockets again , leaned back as if he had all the time in the world . This was his mettle , his smiling stance said ; the pace , fast or slow , always remained his . " Tangled webs , these small principalities . Families . . . servants . . . childhoods . " The two of them might have been still at dinner . " But we 'll keep what order we can , shall we ? " His voice had hardened ; they were not at dinner . " The law does n't anticipate , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a district attorney to anticipate any disorder that may occur from such  --  in there , for instance . " He indicated the door of the room ahead of them . " Nor is it for anyone else to . Rememberthat ! " " IBut Dobbin , seizing his arm , gave him no chance , so that his answer , whatever it would have been , true or false , was lost  --  to himself as well.  | " Listen to me  --  " said Dobbin . A phrase not as wise as it is common . " You were born Armistice , 1918 , right ? " Did his lip have a twist of pater to it after all ? " That night you were . . . not quite fourteen then  --  a mere child ; if there were not a chance of that other corroboration I would not even put you on the stand . As the bright young man you are now , full of the customary moral hair-splittings  --  oh , quite honorableones  --  that come with majority , I 've no present use for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child . Now listen to me ! " His voice gentled . " Remember , how it was for us at fourteen ? How simple things were for us then ? How we saw certain things , without understanding them ? Did them , not even knowing there were consequences ? When I was a child , I spoke as a child '  --  " The phrase moved him . It was a measure of his gifts that he remained unashamed of this , not lowering those steady irises by a fraction . " That 's all you have to do , " he said softly , gripping Pierre 's biceps with a consolatory squeeze . " Just remember how it was for that boy back there . Tell his story , just as he might of , then . " No , Dobbin had never been an alien . The attendant nodded as they approached him . His lofty nose and brow , meanly deserted by recessiveness beneath , gave him a tribal resemblance to Mount , the courthouse lounger , in the way an indoorreplica of civic virtue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeon dung and rain . " ' Lo , Mr. Dobbin . " " ' Lo , Felix , " said Dobbin out of the side of his mouth , like a password . Once more his glance traversed Pierre  --  old stager checking novice for unlucky signs of green in the breeches , in the gills  --  then the door shut behind them with a silky t-lick and they were in . At first , following Dobbin , sitting down in the chair indicated , he kept his eyes lowered , engaging with himself in a kind of blindman 's buff that restricted his impressions to peripheral images , to the murmurousconfusion of a room which numerous figures were still crisscrossingon their natural tangents , in which twenty or so individual men were only slowly settling down to their duty as a " body " of the same . The room , perhaps fifteen by thirty feet , its ceiling as high as the main room but not domed , had a backstairs feel to it after the seedy ,  |p319armorial  space of the other . To his right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At his left , the long table almost bisected the length of the room , leaving behind it a waste space through which Dobbin and he had brushed past a small table of Cokes and empties , a couple of choked spittoons , and in a corner the caretaker'sbucket , its stiff , gray mop hanging down to a point , like a substituteflag . Facing him , a curved dais held rows of auditorium chairs , their iron stanchions fixed to the floor . Feet shuffled past these , to the hollow , lecture-hall sound of seats successively snapped down . He might be in a classroom on a campus a thousand miles away ; yet every pair of feet passing knew this place as intimately as he . This was the public room where men collectively tried those ideas of learning , punishment , prayer that they fled from in private , and it was always the same . In it , humanity always stank resentfully , ghostly transactors , reminded that their parts were animal by the toilets that were always somewhere down the line . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , as the day waned , the one window opening on a grosser reality would come to seem like a mirror at the end of a burrow , and each , as he left the place , would draw the same deep intakeof breath , whether what had been done here were good or bad . They would be at close range when he looked up at them . Was each sitting there as he did now , an animal transfixed in the smell of man ? Dobbin touched his arm , sat at attention , stared forward . " Okay now , " he whispered . " Every son of ' em 's there . " The room fell silent . Pierre stood up . They were men . They were both larger and smaller than memory had bred them . Each face made its own crotchet of space , as his own must , fear undomesticated , looking across at fear . In the center of the first row , one head remained bent  --  his uncle 's . Now it raised . The clerk muttered his identificatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name , that device under which a man labored so hard toward identity , meant nothing even to himself  --  a number answered to from a prison band , a patched patch between the shoulderblades . But the space between himself and his uncle , who by now had risen , had compressed ; once again they were in the narrow hall/way , under the light that no one had ever bothered to shade . Nearer and nearer it came , the face that could not be surprised , and it knew him , saying You . " You do swear . . . " it said , " you do swear , in the presence of the ever-living . . . that the evidence you shall give to the grand jury upon this complaint . . . shall be the . . . the whole . . . nothing but . . . " The truth . " So help you God ! " He strove for the great " Om " that must be proper to this question ; heard the voice of the mole that answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , he said , need not stand , either now  --  during those remarks with which , since the jury had sought advice , he , Dobbin , must try their patience on such a hot afternoon  --  nor during witness 's own testimony to follow . Meanwhile Dobbin , lounging with a token hand on the table , hip against it , remained standing . But if it please the jury , he said , he 'd stay as he was  --  by now they all knew anyway that the only way to shut him up was to hope that his feet would sooner or later get the message to his tongue . From down at the far left of the line facing them , an appreciative snicker came , an aged voice assenting . Pierre kept his eyes on the other half of the body of men on the dais , on those who were at the foreman 's left  --  for Dobbin and himself the right-hand side . Except for this switch , the picture was just as he and his mother had been made to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered all those whom he had not yet dared scrutinize singly , for on his right , five in the first row , six in the second , all were new citizens , among them not one face he knew . Several of these were smiling slightly , at Dobbin or the snicker . " Otherwise , " said Dobbin , his eyes crinkling , " the witness will find things a mite more informal than expected . Coats off or on ; we find we can still do our business here . " He was drawling now . In this respect , he said , they were perhaps a little luckier than the folks next door . The smiles broadened  --  then the new judge was a stickler . Again from the left came that slow , cackling " Heh , heh ! " Now at last , under cover of Dobbin 's preamble , he turned his head and looked there . Second from the end , the old man who had made the noise was still nodding with the faint , ebbing tremor of the elderly.  |p321He  recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frazer . He 's the only of them , there on that side , who does not seem to be looking at me ; therefore it is safe , safest to look at him . Or is it ? Here he was , seen through no window frame now . The old man sat there , a senile Saint Bernard , behind gold-rimmed glasses ( one recalls he cannotread ) , wearing the white shirt of the pensioner whose days are all special now , the very clean clothes of the workman who once swung his lantern " Oyez " on a clear night 's zenith and is worth his six dollars per day emeritus still . Here he is , one of the ones from " down there . " " . . . crimes against the elective franchise . . . " Dobbin , at his side , was speaking very rapidly , covering the grounds for indictment in a dull for-the-record tone , coursing through the evidence already heard , using a heavy verbiage that seemed almost designed to obscure it for his hearers . Charlson has brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated at the very end of the line as if for ballast , understood what Dobbin was getting at , had shifted his gaze to him . These cunuchoid men are often very quick of brain ; how better conceal it ? The minister'sbulk had always been useful ; he kept a convivial pulpit . And he was known to be softhearted  --  remember how kind he was to the Denny girl ? Between what we do and we do not  --  in his job he would know about judgment . He and I have not seen each other since my aunt 's funeral . But I remember , on a clear night 's zenith , the minister 's car . And I remember the doctor 's . He 's not here , Rollins , but he has sent a substitute  --  the young man on Frazer 's left , by the look of his brother Lee on him  --  Rollins has sent a son . An honorable custom of war hereabouts , to send a substitute , doubly so if one sends the son . This is Robert then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looks sulky  --  too many brothers ? Oh Bobby , does your mother , brother , know you 're out ? Five or six years older than I am  --  you could have been there that evening . Depend upon it , your father knows  --  a doctor 's car is his hallmark . Perhaps we should ask my uncle , an expert on Rollinses . He 's not one to accept substitutes , even in sons . Or rather , say that , confronted with blame to assign , he can.  |p322You  look frightened . But my uncle has his head bowed again . Until he looks up , until we have to look at him , we are both safe. " . . . that murder has been done . . . has been established sufficientlyfor the charge . . . for a charge , mind you ; that is our purpose here . " Dobbin 's voice dropped again to its monotone . " Secondly . . . we then come to . .. " The Lemons , father and son ( horses and allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though one ca n't tell it from their faces . Of the senior I know nothing . But Lemon was always one to see certain things early  --  even if his reach sometimes exceeded his grasp . A boy to brag as syphilis what was only acne , and come off in the end with no more than the clap . It 's thickened him early too ; except for his pocks and that Indian hair hanging down just the same , I 'd never know him for the string bean I stood up to in the Charlotte gym , doing better than either of us expected . He was n't afraid . I was . He 's looking at Dobbin now , got his answer ready , by the grin on him . ( " What if we did ? No more'n anybody here would do . " ) Men who wo n't accept the nature of man tend to amuse Lemon . He himself suffers proudly all the manly diseases . And is therefore not afraid. " ... rumors of concerted action by a group . . . purported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . . . Of more recent date ... " And Dobbin , still leaning negligently , dropped the name , Bean . Lemon still has traces of a smile , like a trader recalling a good trade . But even he is no longer looking at Dobbin . They are all staring at the back of the room , a class called to attention , pledging its allegiance to the caretaker 's mop . All do so except one . In the pause that Dobbin intended perhaps , but not for him alone , Hannibal Fourchette , Jr. , his bruin gaze swaying  --  did he know me once ?  --  is heard to be humming . He too has a disease which , when well tended , keeps him fearless . How incredibly it preserves them ; he has changed least of all ! The strength of his shirt front still upholds him ; in some shell for his ear only he must be hearing the Gulf . Tactfully , the man next him touches his arm and he subsides at once , feeling down the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . The kind neighbor at once strikes a match for it . Morning 's Junior Fourchette 's time of course ,  |p323but  he is still happy . What a fine place , club you might say , a grand jury room is . Lawyers must wait outside it . Even Dobbin , gentleman though he is , must leave before vote is taken . And a judge  --  no matter who  --  can never come in here at all . He puts a finger to his lips and nods gratefully at his neighbor . Tact . Tact is all that is necessary in this cat 's cradle world . Now . Now I must look at his neighbor . His long chin. " . . . until now , for lack of witnesses , we have been working pretty much in the dark .... " Neighbor Nellis , lamplighter extraordinary , will strike a match for you .

" Of course , until now we have not had the resources of the Federal  --  " Dobbin bowed almost imperceptibly , no more than a shift in accent , to the new faces on his right , then turned again toward the left , where , it might be assumed from this , his own allegiance lay . " Now , however , Washington promises evidence . . . it may come any time . . . depositions of witnesses formerly connected with this office , concerningAsher , who was buried as a flood victim .

But you should know well the urge that comes over us when we are in hidden places  --  toward the enormousjoke to be played . You bend now , but only to confer with your neighbor on your other side . One by one they are all coming out of lodging . One more . Between Nellis and my uncle , a pair of white duck trousers.  |p324And  now Dobbin is at last calling his witness . Witness need not stand during testimony . But witness does rise , to face Semple . For the entire state of Alabama , some say . Or for the world ? Strange , how , seeing you here , I no longer trust in the general klandom of evil . Here in this room , we too have no knowledge of how to ascribe evil except singly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and face . You . So , Dobbin , I obey . Truth bombards us from wherever it can . I speak as that boy . There is a place  --  filled with the moral fragrance of how people really are . Outside its orange lamp we are all Ishmael , until we enter there . There is a town  --  above the town  --  Johnny , Johnny Fortuna , I believe you . I believed you all along . " I kept watch for them in the grove , " I said . " I helped cut the pine and truck it down to the cafe . I rode lookout for them all that day . "  |p325Cha|pter  V. Klanship . OU . You . You , you , you , you , you . I. There was not a face there , no matter its guilts or its sympathies , which was not for that one moment my enemy . And for the same reason  --  beneathall reasons . When the witness speaks , he brings the problem of truth into the room . There was not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curl protectively around whatever secret he thought kept him in swinedom , wishing to be left in his sty with it , only not to have to aspire . And I watched them with joy , thinking I had found the adversary at last . " Will the witness explain whom he means by them ' ? " So my preceptors had been correct  --  there were choices to be made . For the general " they " of the feared , we may choose our surrogates . The lie I told then was greater than any I told later . Much may be done in the name of justice by those avenging their childhoods . " The Klan , " I said . The word was new to the room . Everybody heard the echoes refuse it . Outside , a bird spoke , chelo , chelo , from siesta . I had time to rememberexactly what I was doing . I tallied it : I speak as Johnny would , using what he did , what he knew.  |p326Dobbin  does not know this . As far as he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They , " up on the stand there , will know I am lying . They can not declare it . I even had time to note that the clock over the dais was the same as the one in the main courtroom , even to the gilt " Seminole . " Then Dobbin , rushing in , allowed no further pauses . " Will you tell the jury what you mean by that day ' ? " ' The day the dam went . " " According to record , September 19 , 1932 . If you do n't mind  --  would you tell us how old you are ? " " I 'll be twenty-one in November . " Lemon was the one who made me feel youngest . He had taken out a small , old-fashioned cigar clipper and was elaborately fooling at fitting the end of one into it . " Then , on that date , you were just close on to fourteen . Do you ask us to believe that a kid like that would observe all those details I 'm going to have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can still quote scripture on ' em ? " For one second , his hostility dumbfounded me . Then I almost smiled My dander was up , tongue loosened . " It was n't the kind of day that anybody down here would be likely to forget . " But the very next day , they all had claimed to . Their blank faces remanded me . Not a man could be found . " Excuse me  --  Mr. Dobbin ? " A man on the other side of the room , the new side , had spoken  --  the first voice from them . Would they speak much ? I had not considered . Now I scrutinized them . But scrutinywas not the word for it . White-shirted , dark-tied , most of them , these new men , more stiff-backed than the others and not as colorful , not as easy in the crotch . Not as much at home here , they offered themselves to the eye as a group , like men in an office picture . Timestudyclerks , engineers , office managers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal dossier , which went with the man of business . And their business here was precisely that  --  not to be at home in this place.  | " Yes , Mr. Anderson ? " " Excuse me , but I 'd like to clear something up  --  this witness  --  is n't he some relation to Mr. Higby , our foreman ? " " Stepson . " My uncle 's face , raised to look across at Anderson , shocked me , seen now in public perspective . It had the shielded , masked guise I had expected of the others . " He 's my wife 's son . " So that was how he thought of me . I had sometimes wondered . " Things like that are bound to happen in a small county , Mr. Anderson . Perhaps you 're not yet used to it . " Dobbin showed his teeth very slightly . " We may even bump into  --  other instances  --  as we go along . Not unusual . " " Oh , no reflections on anybody , of course . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court case sometime ago  --  something about his name ? " Now I recognized him , the heavy white check that he was rubbing . He was the second man in court that day , the man who had helped Dabney Mount bring my mother home . " I understand he changed his name legally . No involvement , ' as you called it . I believe  --  a family matter ? " Dobbin , addressing me , deflectedthose probing eyes of his . Probably he too thought me a bastard , if not my uncle 's . For testing opinion , the dock had its use . " Yes , " I said . " A family matter . " " Ah , " said Dobbin . " That satisfactory , Mr. Anderson ? " Polite , excessivelyso , he no longer lounged , suddenly tall defender of those privacies that some of us here would hold to be still paramount . Covertlyhe sent them a glance , these parfit knights on his left , that reassuredthem . Delicately , for Mr. Anderson and other tiresome bumblers , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'd like to establish something first , " I said . " My uncle never knew of my  --  activities . Does n't yet . " " Entirely suitable , " said Dobbin . " Would Mr. I Iigby like to , er  --  ? " In the pause , my uncle seemed not to be answering . Then he coughed . From the store of honesty that hampered him , what would he choose ? Who was that other man who , from a mouth full of pebbles , learned to speak clear ? " No , " he said . " We did not confide . " " Eh . . . yes . . . " Dobbin pursed his lips , for all fathers . And inp328the same instant he turned on me , hard-voiced , all procurator . " Explainwhat you meant by the grove ' ! " And it was in that moment , with his repetition of the word " grove "  --  tossed by me , accepted by him  --  that the full , serious sense of where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owl tapped , showing me the spectacle of what was , the great gamble of what could be , and this time , in this old , professional room , worn and capableas a whore 's bed where the pure and venal chased each other through all the odors and malodors of man , I was not afraid . I apprehendedmy powers , like sportsmen on those charmed days when the shot , not yet sighted along the barrel , already rings true on the limp , glazed target . Like an actor , stretching his limbs to the arena on that sure day for which all the practice of life had prepared him , I understood how a man might elongate himself until he was of a length to hang another , how he might make those long , simian jumps which are made in dream . The word " grove " had done it , magicked by me out of memory not my own , cast like a boomerang and perfectly returned , whang , to my hand again  --  " Catch ! " I understood without mysticism the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on I did not falter . I used Johnny 's words . The use of them was mine . " Maxon 's Grove . If you go through the backs , straight westerly from the whistle stop , you come out to two crossroads on the other side . Take the dirt one , about three quarters of a mile down , and you come to it . I came on it once , exploring , and after that I used to go there the way a kid will when he finds a place that looks secret ; used to read there , try and slingshot rabbits , generally hang around . Built myself a kind of cave in the bracken . " Johnny had done that , found the place on one of the afternoons his mother had had to turn him out of the house because she had a man there . ' The grove was near enough to the backs , but the Negroes never went there . I was still new enough to the town so I did n't know why . Maxon had been one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Place had always been used by them . Still was . But of course I did n't know that . Summer nights , I sometimes took my supper there , leaving by sundown , since I had to be home soon after dark . "  |p329Johnny  used to camp there overnight . " One night , though , I fell asleep there . When I woke up it was dark , and they were not ten yards from me , the whole ring of them . They were holding a tribunal , and of course they were wearing the hoodwink . I was too scared to make a noise . But I 'd not been brought up to believe in ghosts , and these talked like men  --  one with a voice I thought I recognized . Upshot of it was , I spied on them several times running , by getting there early . They had a guard of course , the Klexter , but he always watched the road . Then , one night , they caught me at it . " Johnny had spied on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , when he yearned for it . " I let slip all I 'd seen ; I was even fool enough to address that one of the men by name . " Even now that scene , as it had come to me through Johnny 's lame pauses , still shook me . He 'd let himself be brought out , collared and kicked forward in his fowl-stained overalls and boiled-out T shirt , into the center of their cleanly ring . Then he 'd gone down on his knees to that seated figure , to the slit eyes in the peaked white hood above him . ( " Oh , Exalted Cyclops , " he had said , " please let me belong . I could be the mascot . " And then , out of his simplicity and his longing , " Please , Mr. Semple , please ! " ) I paused for breath . Following my double thread , I no longer saw my audience . " They saw I was harmless  --  and dazzled . Gave me a bloodcurdlingwarning  --  it only thrilled me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me loose . But later on , the man I 'd recognized tapped me on the shoulder one day in town . Started me out on small errands . Kept me on a string , like . " That last was Johnny himself speaking . I must be more careful . " It was supposed to be for him , but I soon knew it was n't . And as I got older , he  --  they  --  let me do more . They  --  just got used to me . " I stopped again , fighting my heartbeatfor breath . I had done the first lap , come round the circle . " And that 's how it was that day . " Dobbin spoke . " You were a kind of apprentice then . Till you were old enough to be eligible . That how they do it ? " " They may do . I only know my own history . And almost from the beginning I knew I could n't belong . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
