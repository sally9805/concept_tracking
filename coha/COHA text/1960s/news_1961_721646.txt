txt President Eisenhower took sharp issue today with Premier Khruslichev 's attempt to represent the Communist bloc as the only friend and supporter of peoples aspiring to national independence . In a speech Jan. 6 to a general meeting of party organizations , Premier Khrushchev said it was " an outright lie " to contend that national liberation movements could develop independently " of the struggle which the ' working class wages for socialism and of support from the Socialist countries . " Mr , Khrushchev also said that , the world Communist movement would continue to support struggles for national liberation . In his final Presidential news conference today , General  --  Eisenhower . said ' that the support that Mr. Khrushchev gives to " wars of liberation " is usually support for " revolts of Commu- ' mist elements " against constituted authorities . Question 17 , page 18 . . The United States , in its own support of liberation movements , has tried to work " within the limits of the United Nations Charter , " the President said . " We believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unless that Charter can be supported by more of our nations , then the outlook for peace becomes dimmer , " he declared . Officials here did not disguise their concern at the tone of Mr. Khrushchev 's speech , which was made public yesterday . On the basis of excerpts in the press , they regarded it as one of the toughest by the Soviet Premier since Nov. 10 , 1958. when he declared . the agreements on four-power control of Berlin outdated and threatened to turn over Soviet functions to East Germany unless the Western Governments agreed to a German peace treaty . Berlin Issue Raised Anew In the Jan. 6 speech , Mr. Khrushchev said : " The position of the , United States of America , Britain and France has proved to be especially vulnerable in West Berlin . These powers still try to cling to the old positions , but they can not fail to realize that the occupation regime in that city will end sooner or later . " It is necessary to continue , step by step , to bring aggressive-minded imperialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon with the real situation . And if they balk , we shall take resolute measures . " We shall sign a peace treaty with the East German Democratic Republic , for we are fully determined to conclude a German peace treaty , at long last , in order to pull out the thorn that the occupation regime in Vest Berlin is . " President Eisenhower 's reference to Premier Khrushchev 's speech gave point to remarks he had made a few moments earlier in reply to a question about what he thought would be the greatest problem confronting his successor . " Well , " the President asserted , " I think that is answered almost by the fact that the thing that causes all our problems is the intransigent , unreasonable attitude of the Communist . bloc . " Therefore , he ' commented , Mr. Kennedy 's basic problem " is what to do to keep ourselves strong and firm and yet conciliatory in trying to meet this  --  this terrible problem that is none of our making . " Question 14j No Official Comment At the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no official comment on Mr. Khrushchev 's speech until the text had been received . President Eisenhower said that the greatest disappointment in his eight years in office was that the nation had not got " to the place where we could say it now looks as if permanent peace with justice is really in sight . " Question 81 In the early days of his Administration , the President continued , the nation was fighting a war in Korea and was faced with the possibility that the hostilities would spread . The Chinese Communists , he said , , were threatening war throughout his first term and at times actually made warlike moves . All the while , he added , " the ' Russians were saying , " We are ' going to support our Red China allies . ' " In the face of these great difficulties , the President said , ' he thought the greatest achieve- ! ment of his Administration " has , been that we actually havel stopped many of these risks from becoming realities . " But , he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting a more constructive and positive indication that real disarmament is around the corner . "
