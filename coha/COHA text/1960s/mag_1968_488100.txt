An Indian journalist not without sympathy for America 's dilemma in Vietnam was among the first to use the phrase , the " War Corps , " to describe the conglomerate American presence , civilian as well as military , in that sad land . The irony of the term stems from the fact that the sizable segment of America 's brawn and brain now present in Vietnam is a sort of perverted Peace Corps . The enthusiasm and courage of the Peace Corps , as well as the condescension and press agentry that sometimes attach themselves to it , have been harnessed in Vietnam to a lost , and in the truest sense , a losing cause . Vietnam has brought thousands of civilians into the business of making war . Just as " pacification " has little to do With peace , civilians in Vietnam are hardly to be distinguished . from soldiers . Not surprisingly , Vietnam has provided new careers for many retired military . Much has been written about what the war is doing to the Vietnamese . " You have made prostitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists of our men " is an oft-quoted description of the impact of the American presence . Less attention has been paid to the psychological fruits on the American side . There has been some mention of the martial skills and heightened social expectations which the black GI is bringing home with him . More important are the inner revulsion ; the cynicism and lack of self-respect  --  in sum , the dehumanization  --  which tens of thousands of Americans of every race are being asked to inflict upon themselves in Vietnam . A national as well as an inestimable personal loss is involved . Apt comparison has been made between these men and the " good Germans " ' of World War 11 ? those who , while part and parcel of the Nazi system , " knew not what they did . " The " good Americans " out in Vietnam bring an evangelical fervor to their disparate tasks . That what they are doing contributes directly or indirectly to destruction appears after a time no longer to concern them . In Vietnam the American concepts of efficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutated wildly . 1390 The job , most people out there will admit , is often its own end , but unfortunately for the Administration soothsayers , the job constantly gets itself undone . According to one official , " The computers are doing a grand job of winning the war . As long as you keep asking them the wrong quesdons , of course they will give you the ' right ' answers . And we 're paid to ask those wrong questions . " Leaving aside the bulk of the military for whom war , just or unjust , is simply there to be fought , the Americans in Vietnam fall roughly into three categories . Those in category one , while numerically the fewest , give the War Corps its tone They are the very young , the naive who really do believe in what they are doing . They are the spiritual descendants of the men who rallied to Saint Bernard 's cry , " God wills it ! " One such whom I know is , like most Americans , three times as big as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddyland in his tropical GI boots , clipboard at the ready , eager to avenge the cheated villager or to root out the unrecognized VC cadre . One would like to believe that he is a good man . Unfortunately , in today 's Vietnam as in Graham Greene 's , he is just another " good boy , " who thinks he is doing the work of a man . The men in category one will risk their lives , often several times a day , knowing that their cause is worth it . There is woe , however , when one of these aged adolescents begins to understand the game . Then he is no longer content to know that if he dies in action his soul will soar to heaven , , like a " Huey " in high gear . The category-two man is also in a minority . For the moral fervor of category one he substitutes a thirst for glory . He is the careerist of the Vietnamese War and , like most of his kind , not very attractive . He is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the easiest to take of all three categories . Chances are he is carving an empire in Saigon . When he goes out inspecting , his eye may be watching for booby traps but his inner eye looks far beyond Vietnam . It sees the executive desk awaiting him in Washington , the AID directorship in another underdeVeloped and potentially " CI " ( counterinsurgency ) country , or even some " class B " ambassadorship . The man in category two is past master at briefings and pep talks . He knows what the omnipresent press wants and what his " team " will take . He will say with the eye-bulging candor of the true believer , " In Vietnam , ' Rev Dev ' ( revoTHE NATION/ October 21 , 1968 lutionary development , the latest term for pacification ) is really where it is . " Or , " The . . . Division is about the greatest thing ever to happen to this province . " The careerist 's Vietnamese " counterpart " is likely to be a major or above ; probably a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furiously . That buddy system has ro changed somewhat recently , as more and more Americans try their hand at direct rule and by-pass or push aside Vietnamese officials . Yet it is still true , as one AID technician put it , " All American advice is welcome here , as long as it takes the form of piasters . " But the American in category two is , with few exceptions , himself clean as a whistle . What he is looking for is not the quick buck ( although he is paid handsomely ) but a lifetime salary in the upper five figures and the prestige that comes from being a super-executive in the American New Order . He is getting in on the ground floor of this nation 's new colonial service . One day we may speak of sons and relatives who " went out to Vietnam . " The War Corps ' would , however , fall flat on its face if it were forced to rely exclusively on these two categories . The main body , the infantry so to speak , is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duck to water . They must adjust , and adjust they do . They convince themselves that they are there for good and sufficient reason . In fact , much of their energy while " in country " is devoted to convincing themselves of just that . These are the tens of thousands who make up category three . They are the men who , perhaps even more than those whose lives are lost to VC booby traps and mortar shells , represent a loss to America . By taking part in the war they suspend both their political and moral beliefs . While neither uneducated nor underfed , they remain essentially as passive as the Vietnamese peasantry . And in that respect they are typical of the bulk of the nation . In category three one finds the " dead ender , " who is using Vietnam to revive a dying career . Here also is the man who has fled " the land of the great PX " to exorcise ( or exercise ) a private devil  --  a hunger or a thirst that could not be fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there for the money . But these are exceptions ; more often than not the man in category three is not seeking " artificial paradises " and is not a pure mercenary . He has come to Vietnam because he feels he has no choice . He has few real , skills , is too long in his career , has too many children , or too demanding a wife to make a clean break of it . For him it is not " whom " but " what can I turn to ? " All these men , the competent as well as the incompetent , the dullards as well as the brilliant , tend to talk about what they are doing with a certain mocking trepidation . From one I got , " Hm , Rev. Dev. ? certainly no revolution there and damn little development . " These men live for their SMA ( visit to a " safe haven " country to see the wife ) , which most of them can get every five weeks , but which they take less frequently now because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they go off to swinging Bangkok , comfortable Taipei or stylish Hong Kong . Others take the , big leap three times a tour , returning to the States to visit the family in the suburbs of San Diego or Poughkeepsie. 1 , The biggest chunk of the War Corps is- made up of men in the middle grades of government service and in middle age . These category-three warriors are often , only too glad to get away for a spell from the wife and kiddies , the suburban grind , bureaucratic infighting or diplomatic socializing . Many of them are not members of any branch of the military services or career employees of any civilian agency . Vietnam is full of contractees , as well as employees of firms dependent on AID or the military . For them , too , Vietnam can be dangerous , but the risks are offset by splendid wages , differentials , free housing , cheap , liquor , good food at below supermarket prices , servants , and the irresistible bonus of a " butterfly " or two between visits to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced persons a Vietnamese " girl friend , " even with the high demand , can be had for a fraction of the price of a housemaid back home . These men , when one of their fellows is about to return to the States , ask him what his PCOD ( Pussy Cut Off Date ) is . And while the boys down their third or fourth drink , they will play the game of " Categories , " defining the number and nature of the kinds of people working in Vietnam . Only rarely will they dare ask themselves , " What category am I ? " Vietnam is producing a race of men who do not respect themselves or their country . They are the real " good Americans " of the Vietnamese War  --  not only a waste in human resources for the United States but the basic manpower source for more Vietnams , both abroad and at home .
