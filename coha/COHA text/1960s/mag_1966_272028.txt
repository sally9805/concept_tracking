From U.S. warships in the South China Sea to the forward combat zones of South Viet Nam 's Central Highlands , the visiting Congressman or news correspondent is asked over and over again : " What 's with the people back home ? " It is a question that Lyndon Johnson would dearly like to answer , and clearly should . For if the war seems necessary and honorable to most U.S. fighting men in Viet Nam-and , by his say-so , to their Commander in Chief-it continues increasingly to baffle , depress or infuriate millions of voters in America . <P> The score card is clear enough . Just a year ago , the victory-flushed Viet Cong stood poised for the final thrust that would cut South Viet Nam in two and assure a Communist takeover . Month by month , the insurgents ' momentum has since been slowed , stemmed and finally reversed by the massive input of U.S. arms and men . Today , with 275,000 Americans fighting in Viet Nam and 400,000 expected by year 's end , the Communists are finding that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vo Nguyen Giap is disastrously out of date ( see THE WORLD ) . <P> Strange Silence . Less dramatically , an intensive and intelligent program to give the Vietnamese peasant a more equitable , hopeful life is also beginning to take effect . This " other war " has been ardently espoused by the President in the past . Yet most Americans have been left surprisingly uninformed of its successes : the dozens of 59-man teams now fanning out into the countryside to rebuild it ; the new schools and clinics that have sprouted in the Delta ; the hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese treated by U.S. military medical teams ; and the Allies ' slow but steady attempts to create a political infrastructure in the villages and provinces . Moreover , for all the gloomy headlines , the political situation is not without hope , and the Sept. 11 elections may well put the country on the long road to genuinely representative government . <P> On all these matters , the President has remained strangely silent . According to his aides , one of the things that restrains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern that if he did , home-front warriors would demand all-out escalation and instant victory . Conversely , Johnson often sounds as much or more concerned with the dovecoterie , apparently fearing that optimistic portents from the White House would redouble the clamor for a negotiated peace . <P> Whatever the President 's aim , there is ample evidence that Americans remain uneasy over Viet Nam . A Michigan poll showed that , while 62% approved Johnson 's overall handling of the presidency , 62% also disapproved of his conduct of the war ; in Virginia , 53% liked the way he was doing his job , while 53% disliked the way he was doing it in Viet Nam . Yet another poll - one the White House does not discuss - indicates that the voters may want a different man for the task . In Iowa , the Des Moines Register reported that while the President led Michigan 's Republican Governor George Romney 45% to 31% in a January poll , he trailed him 46% to 35% in May-and it is safe to assume that Viet Nam was a major factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
