Notes and Comment E have consistently been impressed by the published ac- counts of the rigors that members of the Peace Corps are prepared to face in the course of their work overseas . We have also been impressed by what seems to us an admirable determination on the part of the Peace Corps leaders to conduct their official lives in a modest and unstuffy manner . But we must admit to having had some reservations about the lengths to which unostentadon can go when , the other Sunday , we read in the Times Magazine an article on Robert Sargent Shriver , Jr. , entitled " Peace Corpsman No. 1 ? A Progress Report , " and came across this paragraph : In April , Shriver set out for Africa and Asia to test the market overseas for Peace Corps volunteers . Turning down plans to travel . VAT-style , he took along only three aides and no tuxedo . He flew tourist class , using the flying time to read up on the next country or cat nap on the floor . Now , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few questions about Shriver 's conduct in the air . Being prepared to sleep on the ground during a trip in wild country somewhere abroad is one thing , but sleeping on the floor of a plane  --  presumably a jet  --  seems to us an unnecessarily severe form of self .. denial , even for a No , 1 Peace Corpsman . As a matter of fact , we do n't understand Shriver 's airborne sleeping arrangements at all . Exactly where on the floor of the tourist compartment of the plane did he cat nap ? The article does not inform us . But Shriver surely could n't cat nap under his seat , for , as anybody who has ever travelled tourist by air knows , there is hardly room down there for an attach ( ' case , let alone a man . Shriver could cat nap in the aisle , possibly , but if he did that , lie would he blocking the aisle , probably in contravention of half a dozen Federal Aviation Agency regulations . In any event , he could lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the flying crew , who would thus be according him to the hilt the very V.I.P.-style treatment that he came tourist class to avoid . The whole thing does n't make sense to us , and we think that in the future Shriver would be far hotter off on long plane trips if he just took first-class passage and lay back in a really comfortable reclining seat and got a good night 's sleep . Best-Seller THE American writer currently most popular In Russia , and the only writer of any nationality to have had a novel published simultaneously in Moscow and New York , is Mitchell Wilson , a former atomic scientist , whose novels ? " Live with Lightning , " " My Brother , My Enemy , " and " Meeting at a Far Meridian , " among others  --  have achieved only moderate success in this country but are so widely read and praised in Russia that the Soviet expert Maurice Hindus has spoken of him as a literary Van Cliburn . Mr. Wilson , who writes mostly about the lives of scientists , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he expresses a distaste for the officialdom of all countries , lives alone in a suite at the Spencer Arms , on West Sixty-ninth Street , and we called on him there the other day . A friendly , mild-mannered , chatty man of forty-eight , he seemed amazed at finding his name a household word in a strange land . " Hemingway is definitely my main competition for top sales among contemporary American writers over there , " he told us . " Salinger 's The Catcher in the Rye ' was brought out recently , and I 'm told it 's doing very well , but it 's still too early to predict how far it will go . Hemingway has the edge on me in all-time total sales in Russia , but in rate of sale over the past few years I understand I have a slight edge on him . " Another startling fact about Mr. Wilson is that the Russians pay him royalties , which is more than they do for most foreign authors whose works they publish . We asked him how this happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his royalties are the reward of unvarnished capitalistic acquisitive pertinacity . Back in 1954 , when he was living on Martha 's Vineyard , a friend of his showed him a copy of the Amherst alumni magazine in which it was remarked , in the course of an article by an alumnus just back from Russia , that " Live with Lightning " was the current best-seller there . This was the first Wilson had heard that the book had even been translated into Russian , and hr immediately wrote to our State Department about obtaining his royalties , and then got off a steaming dispatch to the Soviet Embassy in Washington , demanding payment , After a few months had gone by , a letter arrived from the Embassy giving an address in Moscow to which it was suggested that he apply . He did so , and after another long lapse he received a letter from Moscow 's Magazine for Foreign Literature , not mentioning the matter of royalties at all but informing him , a bit blandly , that " Mv Brother , My Enemy " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelude to book publication in Russia , and asking him to write a magazine article about himself to precede the first installment . Wilson wrote back saying that the article was all ready in his head and the blank paper in his typewriter ; he would get to work the very minute he received payment for " Live with Lightning . " Over the next few months , proposals and counter-proposals travelled back and forth between Martha 's Vineyard and Moscow in the best horse-trading tradition , and finally , one day , a vice-president of the National Bank of Tisbury , on the Vineyard , telephoned Wilson and told him , not without a certain unhankerly note of surprise , or perhaps alarm , in his voice , that the Soviet government had just deposited a substantial sum to Wilson 's account . Wilson 's article went off to Moscow within a few days . " When the Russians do pay you , they do it not directly but by putting the money in the hank nearest you , " Mr. Wilson informed us . " Why this is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign author can get rich on Russian sales , because the publishers are forbidden by law to pay royalties to foreigners beyond one edition , of fifty thousand copies , of each novel . " Mr. Wilson was born in New York City , got a B.S. from N.Y.U. and an M.A. in physics from Columbia , where he began writing , and was a physicist for ten years , spending three of them on atomic-physics research . Since becoming famous in Russia , he has made two extended trips there , learned to speak Russian , and met Nikita Khrushchey . His latest novel , " Meeting at a Far Meridian " ? the one that had the precedent-breaking simultaneous publication , last 11/larch  --  is a story about personal and professional competition between a Russian scientist and an American one . It was serialized before book publication in the Magazine for Foreign Literature , whose editors asked Wilson to make certain changes in the text . He refused to make them , whereupon the editors ran the book as it was written , and followed it , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two articles by prominent Russian writers praising Wilson for his concern for Russian-American amity but taking him to task for some of his details and some of his attitudes . " The things they object to are curious and unexpected , " he told us . " They may say nothing about a serious criticism of their government and then object to a passing mention of poverty in the villages . In ' Meeting at a Far Meridian , ' I have a major Russian character whose wife has been arrested and imprisoned . One Russian complained to me , ' Why could n't you have made him a minor character ? ' I think the popularity of my-books in Russia is based on the fact that they are about science , which fascinates Russians , and the fact that my heroes care ; they are deeply concerned and committed people . That suits the current Russian mood . Chekhov is very much alive in Russia today . In Yalta , the boats to the Black Sea beaches are named after his plays . As for Tolstoy , you see people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on buses . Dostoevski is not especially out of official favor , but he is n't read so much . Perhaps he calls for a degree of experience in living that the Russians of the new regime have n't yet attained . " ? GASTRO-INTESTINAL INTELLIGENCE : The Grand Central Oyster Bar includes among its soups " Clear Green Turtle Verte all Sherry . " Lift MEN have been going down to the sea in ships for a good many thousands of years now , and you might think that all the likely ways of designing ships had long since been exhausted , but not a bit of it , for here comes the hydrofoil  --  a ship with wings , or foils , attached to its hull in such a way that it can skim at high speeds on , rather than in , water . Hydrofoils -- the name is used to describe both the wings and the ships to which they 're affixed  --  employ in water the same general principle that planes employ in the air ; that is , as a ship is propelled forward the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Lift . ( A rearward pressure , known as drag , develops at the same rime , and for hydrofoils to function efficiently the lift must , of course , be much greater than the drag . ) The formidable speeds of hydrofoils and the fact that water is eight hundred times as dense as air pose certain ' arcane problems in dynamic stability , but there 's reason to suppose that these problems can be solved ; to that end , an immense amount of experimenting is going on all over the world . In this country , for example , the United States Maritime Administration has a hydrofoil in the works , which will be launched off Oyster Bay sometime this winter . Named the Denison , and made mostly of aluminum , it will be a hundred and four feet long , will weigh eighty tons , and will be powered by a 16,500-horsepower turbojet engine . With a cruising speed of seventy-two miles an hour , it will he the largest and fastest hydrofoil this side of the Iron Curtain , and also the first designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the last word in hydrofoils , one of the first words was a triumph achieved by the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini , who in 1905 managed to launch a hydrofoil that worked . This craft attracted the attention of Alexander Graham Bell , who proceeded to tackle the hydrofoil problem on his own , in experiments conducted on Bras d'Or Lake , in Canada . Bell 's efforts culminated in a small hydrofoil that in 1919 established a world speedboat record of 70.85 miles an hour . Since the Second World War , hydrofoils have been rapidly gaining in popularity throughout Europe , especially as police patrol boats and ferries . A characteristically successful hydrofoil is the twenty-seven-ton , seventy-two-passenger ferry that scoots hack and forth across the Strait of Messina , in about half the time a conventional ferry would take . Most of the present European hydrofoils cruise at thirty-six miles an hour , and they are especially suitable for use on crowded inland waterways , because , despite their speed , they leave scarcely any wake . In anticipation of the Denison 's launching , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl , who is president of Dynamic Developments , the confident-sounding outfit that designed the ship . " I admit that America is lagging behind Western Europe when it comes to hydrofoils , and the reason is money , " Mr. Carl said . " We 've been working with small hydrofoils here at Dynamic for the past six years , but you ca n't build a really big job like the Denison unless somebody 's willing to buy it . Originally , the interest of the Maritime Administration was aroused by its former coordinator of research , Charles Denison , for whom the ship is named . Our design study showed that the project would cost five million dollars , and after Denison died , a couple of years ago , the Maritime people told us they did n't have that much money available . However , by then we were so anxious to get the hydrofoil built that we offered to charge the Maritime Administration only a million and a half , and get the balance front private industry . Grumman Aircraft with which we 're affiliated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of million in her , and General Electric , Alcoa , and at least fifty other companies have invested a million and a half among them . As soon as we 've completed test runs in Oyster Bay , we 'll turn her over to the Maritime Administration . " And then what ? Well , Carl expects the Maritime people to lease his beloved water hug to various shipping companies , in order to test its practicality as a carrier of both passengers and cargo . " We 're so hopeful here at Dynamic about the future of hydrofoils that we make every effort to sound pessimistic , " he said . " I 'm inclined to paint a rosy picture of commuters ' being whisked from Bridgeport to New York in seventy minutes or from Montauk to New York in two hours , or even from Bermuda to New York in ten hours , but there are still a few unknowns to be dealt with . Eventually , large transatlantic hydrofoils should he able to compete Favorably with planes and luxury liners . From New York to London would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very smooth . There 's no seasickness on hydrofoils , you know ; the ship rides on the foils , and when it 's in motion its keel is six or eight feet above the water . The Denison , however , will have very few of the luxuries usually associated with sea trips . Passengers  --  there will be room for eighty  --  will he confined pretty much to their seats , and there will be no romantic strolling about on deck , because at seventy-two miles an hour a fellow falling overboard would he a goner . Also , the Denison may be pretty noisy . The turbojet engine will be situated directly above the passengers , not Linder them , and will be connected by a long drive shaft with the propeller , which is in the stern . Riding in the Denison will be rather like riding in a subway train , only without the bumps . " ? TADY 'S voice overheard at a cocktail 1 party in Purchase : " I take everything she says with a grain of sand . " Chicago Style THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has become the American headquarters of that latest theatrical phenomenon , improvisation . Having charmed Broadway earlier this season with a funny , free-form revue called " From the Second City , " a troupe of the Chicago club 's players has now set up camp in the newest and biggest coffeehouse-cabaret in Greenwich Village , an establishment called Second City at Square East , which occupies the former quarters of a dye-sponging plant on the ground floor of a loft building at 15 West Fourth Street . We dropped around late one evening last week , just before the current show began its run , and found the improvisers rehearsing . Well , sort of rehearsing . The Second City ensemble consists of eight youthful performers  --  six boys , two girls  --  and as we made our way to the stage , past and around rows of freshly painted Grecian pillars and a jumble of unoccupied round tables and JANUARY ( 2 19 ( a 2 Eames chairs , we heard a male member of the assembled company say , " I will not open in the John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for now , " said a ninth conferee , a short , stoutish , restless chap who was later introduced to us as Paul Sills , director of the troupe and , at thirty-four , a veteran of improvisational drama . " I just thought for an opener we needed a fast-like number . What do you think about the Birch thing , Severn ? Do n't like , huh ? " The Second Cityite to whom this query was directed  --  a hulking lad with an anarchic heard and a wrinkled white shirt  --  was pacing broodily about , looking like an unkempt Louis Pasteur . " I did n't say that , " he replied . " I have n't made up my mind . " " Well , anything els , in the way of a group scene ? " Sills asked . " Hey , how about the bus routine ? " someone asked brightly . The suggestion was rewarded with silence . " How about the censorship bit ? Dolce Vita , ' " Sills said . " Old stuff , " an objecting yoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big one getting around censorship now . " " Hey ! " broke in another performer hopefully . " I think the Birch thing can be salvaged . Use a different reference . The Minutemen . " " You 're heating a dead tree , " a colleague said . " Look , " said Sills , cajolingly . " Let 's try Birch . " " I will not do that scene , " said the original objector . " I think we should open pretty , " a blond girl said earnestly . Shrugging , Sills finally gave up on the Birch thing , and the troupe started running through the unwritten lines of eighteen or twenty scenes . Considering that there was only a day or so before the opening of the preview run  --  the Square East show officially starts in mid-January , but customers who drop in before then will not be turned away  --  the revue struck us as being in a state of dishabille that would have driven a conventional director to the river . The lines we heard must frequently were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul . I 'll work the wording out later . " " O.K. , " Sills would say unconcernedly . " Let 's keep it moving ! ' Curious about the origins of all this in-souciance , we joined a bearded improviser who was temporarily off-stage , and asked him to fill us in on the troupe and its technique . He introduced himself as Howard Alk , one of the show 's co-producers , and said he would he happy to . Pointing the people out as he went along , Alk named the cast as Eugene Troob-nick , a former editor of Playboy , who , onstage , somehow manages to look like a Slavic Happy Hooligan ; Andrew Duncan , a brisk chap with short blond hair , who was once a prison psychologist ; Paul Sand , a boyish , friend-less-looking mime , who has toured with Marcel Marceau ; Linda Segal , a feath-ery , wide-mouthed girl , who had been in " Stewed Prunes ; " Barbara Harris , the earnest blonde , who in action is a comically disingenuous babyface , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into rehears-als of a Second City predecessor group in 1955 , at the age of sixteen , and been at it ever since ; Alan Arkin , the guitar-playing angry young man of the troupe , whom we recognized as the opponent of the John Birch routine , and whose chief claim to fame outside " fhe Sec-ond City is his co-authorship of " The Banana Boat Song ; " the beat Pasteur , Severn Darden , a onetime medical stu-dent from New Orleans ; and Alk him-self , who told us he used to he a film editor and had been drafted into the troupe because he had been hanging around it as an admirer and one day Sills decided that the company needed a second beard . As for the Second City technique , AIk , who , like four other members of the cast , is a former University of Chicago scholar , soon had our head spinning with such phrases as " the them. ) of recognizable forms , " " primes inter parrs , " and " propagandizing for the open society and the good life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show for a change ! " we could hear Sills crying to the performers onstage . " According to the theory of recognizable forms , " Alk said , " the audience should have a sense of what the people in the troupe are . Thus , Gene Troobnick is the Schlemiel , Andy Duncan is the All-American boy , and Severn Darden is the Madman . We used to say that we have eight people onstage and the function of seven of them is to protect the audience from Severn . " At that moment , Darden loomed up before us , and we asked him for his thoughts on improvisation . " You 'll hear plenty of theories around here , but they do n't mean much , " he said . " The fact is we just talk things out . Take the ' Piece of String ' routine we just did . Originally , we were sitting around throwing out ideas , and somebody said ' A piece of string . ' Somebody rise said ' Puppet-master . ' So I said Tagin . ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most flash and zest by employing the three-sentence method . " Darden ambled hack to the stage , and we were briefly joined by Sills , who explained that he had learned improvis.ation at his mother 's knee , since she had been a recreation-group worker at Hull House , the pioneering Chicago social settlement , in the thirties and had experimented with the form as a means of expression for children . " Improvising is simply the actor as creator , " Sills said . " I 'm really more of an editor than a director . I take bits and pieces from the group and give them back in some coherent form . " We thanked Sills for this explanation , and he returned to work , whereupon Alk brought us up to date on The Second City 's career back home . Its earliest progenitor , it seems , was an improvisational drama group called Playwrights ' Theatre , of which Sills , Troohnick , and a Chicago theatre buff named David Shepard were co-producers . Its headquarters were closed by the Chicago Fire Department in 1955 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became famous largely as the incubator of such present-day giants of improvisational comedy ' as Mike Nichols , Elaine May , and Shelley Berman . The Compass also spawned Theodore Flicker , the impresario of The Premise , several of whose cast members had just dropped into Square East to appraise the new competition . We gathered from AIk that The Second City , most of whose performers are survivors of the Compass , which perished in 1957 , has become something of a theatrical urban-renewal project in Chicago since its founding , that same year . It is now actually a complex of buildings , housing the original cabaret ( where another improvisational troupe is currently at work ) , an improvisational theatre , a children 's improvisational school , and living quarters for the performers . It gives employment to a staff of eighty , ranging from bartenders to mimes , and it was recently honored by the second city itself when Mayor Richard J. Daley- proclaimed Second City Day . A curtain call interrupted Alk 's discourse , and a few moments later he was onstage , slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skit entitled " Zen . " The Schlemiel quickly stepped nut of his role . " You hit me that hard again and I 'll punch you right in the belly , " he said . Alk threw up his hands in a gesture of surrender . " More art ! More art ! " we heard Sills calling to the cast as we prepared to depart . " Now let 's all shut up . I 'm the director here . "
