txt WASHINGTON , April 10 ? It " will take time " to get unemployed workers back on the job and to get idle factories producing again at satisfactory rates , Congress was told today . " It can not be done overnight , " Dr. Walter W. Heller , chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , said in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee . He and one of his fellow coon . cii members also suggested that the Government might not be doing enough to spur recovery . None of the committee members asked why the Government was not doing more and some cautioned against doing too much . Dr. Heller said European authorities were asking " more and more " whether the prospective budget ' deficits of $2,200,000,000 and $2,800,000,000 were " too small " to provide the needed stimulation  --  that is , that spending should be higher or taxes lower , or both . Colleague in Accord His colleague , James Tobin , suggested that it might be time to reduce short-term interest ' rates as a spur to general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity .. Even as Mr. Heller was testifying , a man who once held his job was calling the Kennedy economic program insufficient to give the economy a real lift or to reduce unemployment , which is now pushing 7 per cent . That was the view of Leon H. Keyserling , chairman of the council in the Truman Administration . Representing Americans for Democratic Action , he told a Senate Housing subcommittee that the Administration 's housing proposals were " low-sighted " and that its general economic program would leave the country with as much unemployment and unused plant capacity at the end of 1962 as now . Dr. Heller said that the country " will still have a tough problem of unemployment " even after there has been a " sub // stantial " increase in total production . He said that the Government 's principal means ' of stimulating growth  --  by spending , tax and credit policies  --  were adequate , but that there were international , political and other restraints on their " full use " at this time . In his reference to " restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration Who would like to see the Government doing more . The principal international restraint has been the balanceof-payments deficit  --  more money flowing out than in  --  and the belief that still more money would flow out if interest rates went too low . The political restraint is the belief that Congress would be not tolerate a bigger budget deficit , or a tax cut , at this time . Senator William Proxmire , Democrat of Wisconsin , contributed to the political restraint by saying that big deficits " wo n't be acceptable to Congress . " Representative Thomas B. Curtis , Republican of Missouri , said that there will be inflation " unless we control some of this deficit spending . " As ' for ' the international restraint , Mr. Tobin said that as the balance-of-payments situation improves , which it has been doing , it may be possible to have lower short-term interest rates in this country without fearing further dollar flight . It is short-term funds  --  bank deposits and short-term investments  --  that move most easily from one country to another . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's discount rate ? the rate it charges for shortterm loans to banks . It is at 3 per cent now , against 1% per cent at the low point of the last recession . It has not been cut that far this time because of the payments ' problem , but Mr. Tobin I said that the 3 per cent rate ) I was " holding back recovery . " Mr. Tobin observed that if short-term rates were to decline , long - term rates ? the rates that affect mortgages , business ? expansion and state and local public works  --  would follow . ? He questioned whether the discount rate needed to be held so high as it is for international reasons any longer . Asked about the Federal Reserve System 's efforts to reduce long-term rates by buying up long-term Ciovernment securities , Mr : Tobin indicated that he expected the efforts to continue and that he hoped that they wuold be undertaken on a larger scale . Today 's hearing was the council 's ' second appearance before the joint committee . Itwas called because some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given the council twenty quesAssociated Presa SCORES PROGRAM : Leon H. Reyserling , a former chairman of Council of Economic Advisors , who said Administration 's economic program would not succeed . itions in writing . It was in response to one of those that Mr. Heller said , " even with the stimulus provided by the Administration 's antirecessionary programs , it will take time to achieve full recovery .
