txt Mayor Wagner proposed yesterday the doubling or trebling of public works in New York City to support President Johnson 's war against poverty and unemployment in the nation . The call for action , couched in general terms , was the highlight of the Mayor 's first annual message to the City Council , a ceremonial event instituted by him after a decade in office to accent the critical problems before the city . He put no price tag on his proposal , but he declared that rigid state controls on city fiscal operations would make it necessary for the city to " seek financing from other sources ? from the Federal and state gov ernments and even from private foundations . " Schools and Housing Cited In Washington , meanwhile , the Administration was seeking to recruit Congressional support for its antipoverty program by stressing local initiative . The Mayor specifically included schools and housing in his " all-out program of construction , " because , he said , " the need for them is so bottomless . " The off-the-cuff judgment of members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 35-member Council to hear Mayor Wagner , was that just doubling public works would call for an expenditure of " well over a billion dollars a year . " Poverty Line ' Noted The Mayor had an attentive , if undemonstrative , audience as he delivered his message , carried live locally by WCBS-TV , WNBC-TV and WABC-TV . He was warmly applauded upon his arrival and at the conclusion of his talk , but there were no spontaneous outbursts as he spoke . He coupled a half dozen other specific proposals , including another effort to raise the minimum wage in New York City , in his program for combating " poverty and hard-core unemployment that exist side by side with affluence and socalled full employment . " Mr. Wagner noted that 20 per cent of the city 's families had incomes of more than $10,000 a year but that 25 per cent // earned less than $4,000 a year . He said the lower figure was " generally considered the poverty line . " The Mayor 's program was generally well received , but Republicans in particular awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , at Albany and in Washington , Some Republicans said the Mayor was condemning himself and his administration in pointing to the extremes in income that existed in the city . " Whether he realized it or not , " said Richard S. Aldrich , a new Republican Councilman , the Mayor , instead of outlining a hopeful blueprint for the future , actually issued a telling indictment of his own administration over the last decade . " Another new Republican Councilman , Joseph Modugno of Queens , made this observation : " The Mayor already driving business out a the city with high taxes . If he takes on a program of this sort without regard to cost , lie may very well worsen the employment picture instead-of helping it . " Minority Leader Angelo J. Arculeo said that one " ca n't quarrel with an all-out attack on poverty and unemployment . " He added : ' I 'll await specifications with interest . " Theodore R. Kupferman , Republican whip , felt that the Mayor had " outlined - deficiencies that should have been overcome long ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric J. Treulich said the Mayor 's speech was " a thrilling and exciting document , showing the breadth of the administration 's social viewpoint . " Council President Paul R. Screvane said the Mayor had " laid down the guidelines for a massive attack on the problem by Federal , state and city governments . " Paul O'Dwyer of Manhattan , a new Democratic Councilman , applauded the Mayor 's call for a higher minmum wage . He note that he already had introduced legislation calling upon the state to institute a $1.50 an hour minimum that would go to $1.75 next year or , if it chose not to act , to authorize the city to so legislate . A key figure within the city administration in developing the Mayor 's position on poverty and joblessness was Julius C. C. Edelstein , the Mayor 's executive Assistant . ' Social Dynamite Scored ' The Mayor warned of the " social dynamite inherent in chronic poverty and unemployment , even in a city like New York , which , Mr. Wagner said , fares " rather better than most cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This urban association of poverty next door to luxury is both corrosive and explosive , " he declared , " especially when mixed with the experience of racial discrimination and the current eruption of revolution against it . " Mr. Wagner put the number of jobless in the city at 300,000 conservatively , with more than a quarter of them youths between 16 and 21 years of age . Aid is needed , Mr. Wagner asserted , for those who presently lack work skills or who have been displaced by automation and " can not be taught anything but the roughest skills . " Again without specification , he said he planned a " pilot city program in this area . " He urged that the city take " full advantage of Federal measures for vocational and special youth training . " In advancing his public works proposal he said it would " end the growing threat of unemployment in the construction industry .. , create a great need for workers in the skilled construction fields and open opportunities for recruits from the ranks of the disadvantaged .
