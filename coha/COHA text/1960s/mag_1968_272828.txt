What happens when you fling together a dozen wild young comedy writers , throw in a bunch of nuts right off the funny farm , and toss a friendly little riot ? You get a wild , nutty riot of laughs . <P> It 's called Laugh-In , and the hosts are a pair of 40-year-old manics in monkey suits named Dan Rowan and Dick Martin . They devised the idea for the show last year , but its viability was n't certain until it was given the sure kiss of success : all the Hollywood hotshots said it could n't be done . A full hour of nothing but comedy ? No dancers ? No guest crooners ? No lavish production numbers ? Impossible . So , when the show debuted six weeks ago during the deep doldrums of TV 's midseason , it came on like a fanfare at a funeral . Ever since , like a giggle building to a guffaw , it has gained momentum until it now threatens to knock off its top-rated competition , Gunsmoke and The Lucy Show , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughable is not so much the material as the freewheeling , pell-mell pace at which it is dished out . One-liners fly like ack-ack , and if there are more than a few duds it is hard to tell in the thick of the barrage . Everybody wings it , and in that spirit the show 's resident cast of bright young kooks often make the lines seem funnier than they really are . " If one gag goes completely over your head , " says Martin , " there 'll be another along in a few seconds that 'll crack you up . " Sprinkled throughout are quick flashes of famous faces ( Peter Lawford , winking broadly : " You do n't have to be happy to be gay " ) , and a variety of sight gags , such as Teletype streamers that chug across the bottom of the screen ( " Eartha Kitt-call your draft board " ) . <P> Much of what goes on between is vintage burlesque-blackouts , slapstick , even knock-knock jokes . Yet , by exploiting the full range of such technical possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned a fresh new form of rapid-fire TV comedy . <P> Good News . The show 's producers like to say that the format follows an old trusted formula-something old and new , borrowed and blue . But Laugh-In has something far better than formula jokes : topical satire that is biting without being bitter . <P> " The President may not always be right , " says one girl , " but you have to admit one thing : he 's consistent ! " Adds another : " Boris says he wo n't believe it till he hears L.B.J. deny it . " In one skit , Rowan interviews Moses as he demonstrates against the pharaoh , who is " discriminating against us just because we 've got long hair , beards and wear sandals . " Rowan : " Gee , I ca n't imagine anyone feeling that way . How is it going ? " Moses : " Badly ! The pharaoh says it 's O.K. to dissent so long as you do n't disagree with him . It 's hard to argue with a man who thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have somewhat the same problem where I come from . Do the police bother you ? " Moses : " Yes . We are harassed all the time by the fez . " <P> The show is put together in a party atmosphere in which everyone is invited to contribute . Almost anything goes . Among the few bits scissored from last week 's show by the NBC censor was Comedienne Ruth Buzzi wailing : " Harry said I ought to be a cover girl . Then he covered me ! "
