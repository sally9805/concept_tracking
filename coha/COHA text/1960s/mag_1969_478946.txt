America 's most successful evangelist , who saves souls by the millions and now influences national politics , has mastered the art of moving his listeners without embarrassing or greatly disturbing them . Billy Graham is speaking . He jabs with the right hand , while the left disappears into the pocket of his jacket . Then both hands come straight out , hanging there only a moment before they disappear behind his back . They stay that way long enough for someone to count to five , and suddenly they are in front of him again , clenched this time , knuckles white against the even tan . The right fist moves up and down ; the left fist opens , and the fingers spread out in supplication . When Billy Graham is good , he is very good , and no one else in the room says a word . " We 're moving through dangerous waters , " he says , and it is much the same thing he has been saying since that time twenty years ago when he knocked them dead in Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hearst papers , not yet a confidant of Presidents , or the world 's best-known Protestant preacher , but mostly a curiosity , soon to be called by people who did not like him " The Barrymore of the Bible " or " Gabriel in Gabardine , " his draped suits like as not being white orMaybe even a bright green . Now , however , he is in Memphis , in a fine , dark-blue suit , speaking at a prayer breakfast to the people who run Holiday Inns all over America . There are radio and TV , of course , and behind Billy Graham are three plainclothesmen , one of whom has hard , slit eyes that he never for a moment takes off the audience . Minutes before Graham arrived in Memphis the Reverend Ralph David Abernathy left , the city gratefully surrendered its spiritual care from a black to a white Baptist , and the cops are worried that a militant , remembering this is where Martin Luther King was killed , will take a shot at Billy . No one does , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preaching both the Gospel and those sensible virtues that appeal to both Holiday Innkeepers and Presidents of the ' nited States . Moreover , he is nice . Warmth and good fellowship are very deep in the room , and even old Slit Eyes is smiling . Anita Bryant has appeared , courtesy of Coca-Cola . for which she travels to and fro , and has sung and given a testimony . Miss Bryant was fetching in a Pucci crea34 GOD , COUNTRY , AND BILLY GRAHAM Hon about three inches above the knee , and when she sang she held a red Bible . When she was at her best she was singing in the lower register , her Bible clutched to her bosom , her eyes closed , and this had led a lady in the audience who wore a mink jacket and a big bouffant to dab at her eyes . When Billy Graham comes on he tells jokes ? one about Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw , one about Churchill and a moustache he once decided to grow , and one about politics , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many jokes because he speaks to a great many people , and when he finds one he can use he gets it down just right . He had told the stories the week before in New York , and then passed them on to his brother-in-law , who is also a fine preacher , and the brother-in-Iaw had used them when he spoke before a large group of ministers the next day . No matter , the stories work very well , and when Billy Graham gets down to the serious business he is about in Memphis his audience is with him . " There are singers of siren songs in our times , " he says , and then he talks about the siren songs . The first is that the United Nations can bring peace . Jesus said there will be wars and rumors of wars , and it is no good to think that anyone or anything other than Jesus can bring peace . Then , he says , there is the siren song saying that the politics of confrontation will soon end . But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ' Let 's go out and fight . ' So guerrilla warfare is now being planned by the anarchists . " He mentions Berkeley and Columbia , and he says that Grayson Kirk , who was the president of Columbia during its late unpleasantness , was " one of the leading liberals on American campuses . " Clearly , he is implying , liberalism is not enough . " The only thing that can save our country , " he says , " is an awakening . " " The third siren song , " he says , " is that democracy can survive without morality . " He speaks of this for a while , and for the first time he is angry . It is startling . Garbo speaks , Graham rages . Sin has become a personal affront . He says that when his son visited him in New York he sought out the movie pages of the newspaper to find suitable entertainment for him , but found none , which was probably true , advertisements now being nearly unspeakable , and he asks why no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An answer not forthcoming , he talks of the fourth siren song , this one the promise of an " economic Utopia . " He says that the country has had the New Deal , the Fair Deal , the New Frontier , and now , referring to Hubert Humphrey 's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention , the New Day . He says he is just back from Sweden , where they have sex grottoes , but there are unhappy faces on the street and a high suicide rate , The other night he was in Paris , where Sargent Shriver asked him to talk to some students . They were unhappy too . He says he has a friend , a movie star , whose son dropped out to become a hippie . He says he was invited to an island in the Caribbean by one of the world 's richest men ( " You all know his name " ) and the rich man said that a poor Baptist preacher on the island had everything , while he had nothing . He says he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the friend , although he was young and handsome and had a Ph.D . from Harvard , had nothing until he had Jesus . Then Billy Graham crouches ; his voice drops ever so slightly from jubilation to sadness , and he says very slowly and very quietly , " Is Jesus yours ? " The innkeepers and their ladies suck in their breaths . So do I. Billy is so good and so certain and he knows so many famous people that we are all a little ashamed . " For I want to tell you something , " he says , and now his eyes are flashing , " we 're in trouble . " Then it is over , and Billy is saying . " God bless you and thank you . and God bless the Holiday Inns . " How He Took Off 44Too much work done in the name of Christ is rundown , baggy-trousers stuff , " says T. W. Wilson , Billy Graham 's old friend and current traveling companion . " Billy believes in going first-class . " Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization that class tells and that one reason for their success . aside from God , is their flair . When Billy Graham was ordained in Florida in 1939 evangelism had fallen on hard times , its practitioners being mostly itinerant Southerners who worked the sawdust trail out of canvas cathedrals or , at best , timber tabernacles . Billy ? Billy Francis to his family ? has had very little of this since his early days as a barnstormer with Youth for Christ , when he traveled to a different city every night aboard an old DC-3. and spread the Word with considerably more John Corry , a contributing editor of " Harper 's , " wrote the book about . " The Manchester Affair . " Born an Episcopalian in Brooklyn , he went to a small Dutch Reformed college , Hope , in Michigan and , after Army service , worked on the national desk at The New York Times , 1957-68. hints of fire and brimstone than he does now . His apprenticeship , however , had begun in the late 1930s when , as a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullfrogs and squirrels , or so the legend goes , and later tried them while standing in the doorways of gin mills in Tampa . Once he so annoyed a bartender the man rushed out and dumped him . That was only the briefest of setbacks , however , and in 1940 , at the age of twenty-one , Billy Graham enrolled at Wheaton College in Illinois , where he won both a degree and a wife by 1943 . Then he became the pastor of a small church in Western Springs , Illinois , appeared on a radio program in Chicago called " Songs in the Night , " preached around the country , with a quick trip to Britain , and in 1947 became the president of Northwestern Schools in Minneapolis , this being the former Northwestern Bible Training Institute , a responsibility he relinquished in 1951 . However , the move into the really big time did not come until Los Angeles in 1949 , when he preached before 350,000 persons in eight weeks and 3,000 of them made inquiries , or decisions , for Christ . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hearst , was that three of the inquirers were celebrities of a sort ? a wiretapper for The Mob , an old Olympics miler , who had gone downhill ever since , and a cowboy radio star , who was also a boozer and a gambling man , They stepped forward when Billy gave the altar call and said that henceforth they were Jesus 's men and not their own . Making a decision for Christ means that you say you have made one , and while the appurtenances that surround decision-making in a Graham Crusade have changed over the years , the essentials have not . When Graham finished a sermon at a stadium in Pittsburgh not long ago , he looked at his audience and said , You can meet Jesus tonight . Jesus is passing by in Pittsburgh . The busses will wait . It will take you only three or four minutes to walk here . " Then , as his 2,000 , or whatever , voice choir sang " Just as I am , " thin lines of people drifted onto the stadium infield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone of the same sex and approximately the same age , color , and general station in life as their own , Then they all gathered around Graham 's raised pulpit while he prayed over them , arid then the counselors led their charges away , talked briefly with them , got their names , addresses , and phone numbers and promised to get in touch with them again . They had , in fact , just decided for Christ . No one really knows how many will stay deby cided , or why the folks decided in the first place , or if Los Angeles is a better place in 1969 because Billy Graham preached there in 1949 . Nonetheless , it was after that Crusade that he took off , becoming the most successful evangelist of all time and one of the most widely admired Americans too . This is fitting because he is the most American of men , the grandson of two Confederate soldiers , both of whom were well shot up , and the son of a lady who is related to both President James K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Declaration of Independence . Moreover , Billy Graham is tall and fair and blue-eyed , and he looks as if he could he the basketball coach of a small Midwestern college , or a movie actor who never made it big because someone like Ronald Reagan or maybe Sonny Tufts got the role instead . The general impression is that you have seen him before , and you have if you recall those snapshots of themselves that soldiers sent home in World War II , the ones in which they wore khaki , put their arms at parade rest , and looked smilingly and invincibly into the sun . Still , Graham 's is a good face , handsome without being pretty , and superbly suited to the business of evangelism , which , as his people will tell you instantly , has to do with selling a product . Graham himself lives in Montreat , North Carolina , and although there are Billy Graham offices in , among other places , Paris , London , Frankfurt , Sydney , Buenos Aires , Atlanta , and Burbank , California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of the Billy Graham Evangelical Association . This is the corporate part of the organization , where the money is kept , and where the actual , as opposed to the symbolic , selling is done . It is found in an old red-brick building , next to a faded hotel and across the street from a car dealer , and it is run by a man called George Wilson . Mr. Wilson is short , cheerful , and mildly plump , and if he were not associated with Billy Graham he would almost certainly be a captain of industry . " We believe the greatest message in the world should be spread by the most effective means and with the greatest haste , " he says , and to these ends he has mustered about 450 people , a bank of computers , and a mailroom that works in three shifts . When it all began , just after the Los Angeles triumph , Mr , Wilson operated with one girl and 600 square feet of office space . Now there are perhaps 160,000 square feet of space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis airport for more . ( Statistics virtually leap out at you in the headquarters . ) Furthermore , the computers use ten miles of eighteen-inch paper 36 GOD , COUNTRY , AND BILLY GRAHAM every month , Billy Graham is heard on 900 radio stations each week , and the mailroom sends out eighty million pieces of mail a year ( this being significant enough to have led pros from both the Republican and Democratic National Committees to Minneapolis to find out how God 's mailing techniques can serve their Caesars ) . Billy Graham , or at least . the Billy Graham Evangelical Association , will also get nearly 50,000 letters a week , a gond many of which will be sent by people who say they have problems and a good many of which will contain contributions . There are about forty kinds of problems , mostly dealing with matters of faith and morals , and they are assorted and answered accordingly . The average contribution is $6 , and talk about how much this might mean in round , annual figures tends to make the Graham people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money tree too hard , and this could discourage further contributions . For years , in fact , snoopy reporters have tried to find evidence that someone in the Graham organization was stealing money , or at least making too much of it . No one found the evidence , and it is just as well to let the thought die . There is a great deal of money around , but there are a great many expenses , too . In a year the Billy Graham Evangelical Association will spend , say , $1.5 million on radio time and more than $3 million on television time . ( When Graham appears on TV he is seen on more stations than anyone except the President , and even then only when the President is making a major address . ) There is also Decision , Billy Graham 's monthly magazine , which is tabloid size , about sixteen pages , and has a circulation of four million , including the editions in French , German , Spanish , and Japanese . The annual subscription price is $2 . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at cost , and the movies that come out of the studios in Burbank . The first , done in 1930 for only $25,000 , was called Mr. Texas , and it was about a wiseacre cowpoke who made his decision while listening to Graham on the radio . ( " All my life , " he says at the denouement , " I 've been riding on the wrong trail . I 'm turning back . I 'm going God 's way . I think it 's going to be a wonderful ride . " ) Since then there have been many other movies , and their worth is measured not by what the critics say , since they generally say nothing about them at ail , but by numbers . For example , it was recently noted on a sign in the Minneapolis office that For Pete 's Sake had now been seen in 940 places by 1,284,025 persons , who made 52,478 decisions , while The Restless Ones , one of theirgreatest hits , had been seen in 1,701 places by 4,022,035 persons , who made 305,022 decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the greatest , or anything else , " Mr. Wilson says , but it is the biggest and greatest evangelical outfit ever , and it got this way mostly because the rallies and Crusades that Mr. Graham has been conducting have been bigger and greater than anyone else 's . From 1947 , when they first began counting , through the end of last year , and with no figures included for the times the turnstiles and pocket counters did n't work , the Graham organization says its man has faced 39,525,522 persons and that 1,188,638 of them have come forth to make decisions for Christ . What He Believes The man who has stirred so many others is himself the most engaging of men . It is probable that there are those who have met Billy Graham and disliked him , but there is little record of it , and the people around him sometimes speak of him the way others speak of Him , only more affectionately . " There 's one particular thing we feel , " says George Wilson , " that God has given us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , Dwight Moody , the Wesley brothers , and now Billy Graham . " " I really believe that deep down in his heart he loves his enemies , " says T. W. Wilson . " And in airplane terminals he carries old ladies ' suitcases and never tells who he is , and he never passes up the needy when he sees them on the street . " " The thrilling thing is that he 's still as humble as he was at Wheaton , " says Walter Smyth , who has known and worked with Billy since about then . " I ca n't explain the humility . I 've never known him to be jealous of any other human being . Such a sincere individual . He believes with every fiber of his being , and when he speaks he speaks with authority ? of God . " Billy Graham , in fact , is a happy man , who knows what he knows , and for that matter knows who he knows . " I 've never felt a moment of despair , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his species . He was in New York , where he had taken Richard Nixon to church , visited Archbishop Terence Cooke , conferred with the editors of Reader 's Digest , and had been put to bed with a virus . ( " Billy said to me , " T. W. recalled the next day , " T , can you think of anything that I 've done in my life , anything at all , to deserve these sicknesses ? " ) A visit by Billy Graham is a carefully orchestrated affair in which there is no room for a virus , and this one , just before the November election , had begun with a press conference . He was asked about politics , as he always is , and he had spoken about the Crusade he will hold in New York in June . He also said that he considered New York a second home , although he was appalled by it , and he guessed that it " has had more social experimentation than any other city in the world . " ( Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he got to Memphis a few days later he said that he had just left a city that " has had more social experimentation than any other city in the world . " ) Despite this , he said , there are " all kinds of muggings , robbery taking place , even in the churches . " There is " culture against culture . " There is " confusion and frustration . " Mayor Lindsay had said that " nobody can instil affection in the hearts of others . " meaning that legislation can go just so far , and Billy said he certainly agreed with him . He said New York was ripe for a Crusade , and that this one would use thousands and thousands of volunteers , ' 25,000 of whom would do follow-up work , checking on those who made inquiries during the Crusade and seeing to it that they found a home in a New York church . As always , he said , he would accept no money for the Crusade , The money for it , $924,000 , would be raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be audited and the results released to the churches and the press . In all this he was smooth without being oily , and he hardly ever stopped smiling , the smile having once been helped by cosmetic dental surgery , and although he saw ruination all about him , he found reasons to rejoice , too . For one thing , there were hippie boots , which hippies , he said , call " Jesus boots . " " Many psychologists , " he insisted , " say this reflects a longing for Jesus . " For another thing , there were the young people who were concerned , involved , longing to get the country right again . " I do n't have much sympathy for the tactics of civil disobedience and confrontation , " he said , " but the people I 'm talking about are that wonderful group of idealists . " The reporters , however , wanted to talk about Mr. Nixon . Would he endorse him ? He would not , really , although he allowed they had been friends twenty years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Nixon 's mother . The reporters , who had pretty much abandoned the Crusade by then , wanted to know where Billy Graham really stood on the issues . " My message is so intensely personal , " he said , " that people miss the overwhelming social content . " Did he think the people had lost confidence in their elected leaders ? Well , maybe , he said . Vietnam ? He just did n't know enough about it , but he was certain the United States was n't over there murdering people the way the Nazis did . " People concerned about the Vietnam war do n't seem as concerned ahoit Biafra and the Arab-Israel war , " he said , and soon he was noting that his Pittsburgh Crusade had attracted a larger percentage of Negroes than any other Crusade . A little after that he thanked the reporters for coming , stayed around long enough for a camera crew to make a special tape , and then shook hands with old friends all the way to the door . On the road , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham arises at precisely 6:45 ( he is the most punctual of men ) , prays , eats breakfast , and reads newspapers . As he reads he clips out articles , most often ones that tell of national peril or moral decline , and later he stuffs them 38 GOD , COUNTRY , AND BILLY GRAHAM into the pocket of his suit jacket , which is a 43 Long , along with an old wallet full of credit cards and an honorary police badge . Since he is called on for written or spoken words nearly every day of his life , he must find many topics , or at least the semblance of them , and he finds them in the clippings and in the Bible , the verse quite often being John 3 : 16 . Billy Graham spends a great deal of his time in hotel rooms , dining in his room most of the time , and all the rooms are checked out beforehand by an advance man . The underside of a celebrated evangelist 's life is that he does not live like you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must worry about fanatics , assassins , hysterics , drunks , Christian bores , pagan boors , and the great legion of enterprising women who would claim him as their own if they could and thereby win headlines , fleeting fame , and a part in a dirty French movie . It is a life like no one else 's , other than a Presidential candidate 's , and the evangelist does more of it than the candidate , his consolation being that while neither one is truly his own man , he at least has God , while the other has only Mammon . Among His Ten Best Friends Oust the loss of privacy is difficult , " Graham was saying in one of the hotels . " People may not know who you are , but they 're always whispering . " He had just won over an audience of businessmen , and now he was sitting , absolutely at ease . in a big leather armchair . His friends say that Billy Graham has found his natural home in a pulpit , but it is possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . Artlessness envelops him , sincerity is palpable , and good humor is nearly a weapon . " When fame first came , " he said , " Time and Henry Luce began to promote me . That frightened me . I just wish I could pull back some of the things I said . I 'm worried that I brought disrepute to the name of Christ . " Those were the days when Billy Graham spoke more explicitly than he does now about things like the United Nations and the Supreme Court , wore hand-painted ties , and sometimes appeared with Roy Rogers ' horse at children 's services . " I had read about the big evangelists , and I knew they were famous only two years , and I thought I 'd be famous only two years . But the Lord sent my key men to me . I 've never had a disagreement with them , and if nothing else happened the fellowship would still make it worthwhile . " Oddly , for an old country boy , much of the fellowship has been conducted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in Miami Beach where Richard Nixon settled on Spiro T. Agnew . The question is why , and the answer may be that Billy Graham confirms for our kings and rulers what they believe to be the contours of their lives and the nation 's . He does this , I think , without raising his voice , which is the voice of old country boys and Middle Americans everywhere , and without forcing our kings and rulers to any commitment other than to goodness , and goodness , of course , he passes on by osmosis . This makes them feel nice . " I 've tried to limit my contact with Presidents to moral and spiritual questions , " he said . " One President asked my advice on a political question ? we were seated around a dinner table ? and my wife kicked me under the table and said aloud , ' You keep your counsel . ' I think the next President will face the greatest crisis of any President in history , greater than Lincoln 's . This , remember , was just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this growing polarization with the New Left and the New Right . I foresee by 1D72 four major political parties . The President will have to unify the country , and this will be at a time of rising crime , of the politics of confrontation , at a time of rising affluence . We 're seeing the failure of many or our social experiments . We 're seeing a major revolution . We may come out of it a stronger nation or a dictatorship . No , I do n't know if the dictatorship would be from the right or the left . " The threat , however , would seem to be from the left . There is much in Billy Graham 's preaching of the specter of Antichrist , the great antagonist who will conquer and be conquered , which will lead to the risen Christ . " Antichrist may be a person or a system , " Billy Graham said . " If it is a person then it will be someone out of a Godless society . The coming of Christ is relatively near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I was recently given a briefing in Washington , and it was frightening . " I did not stop to ask him why he had been given a briefing , and he went on to talk of other things . " Some people in our society , " he said , " have been promised more than the politicians can deliver and they 're frustrated . " It is a terrible time , he was saying , and our next President will need all the support we can give him . Would he stand for public office ? No . " People have always wanted me to lead a crusade against Communism , " he said , " and there are pressures from the right and the left . I 've been approached by both major parties , too . When ? Oh , I forget when , but the first time was when Willis Smith died and the North Carolina Democrats wanted to have me agree to have the Governor appoint me to the Senate . At least two Presidents have asked me about major jobs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NBC wanted me to appear opposite Arthur Godfrey at one time , at one million dollars a year , and I turned that down , too . " Through all this Billy Graham is smiling , not piercingly , like Mandrake the Magician , the way Bishop Sheehan did on television , and not a smarmy smirk , either . It is pleasant and manly . Billy Graham once wrote to a friend that " I have seen so many pictures of Jesus as a weakling that I am sick of it . He was no sissie and He was no weakling . " He must have been , Graham concluded , " straight , strong , big , handsome , tender , gracious , courteous . " It is a description of an athletic Eagle Scout , or of Graham himself , certainly not of a short , swarthy Semite , and it is absolutely no good knocking it . Billy knows what he knows . Jesus looked the way he did because " no sin and mar had come near His body , " and Graham frets over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visitation . " I try to think of myself as an Ambassador for Christ , " he was saying now , and this time he was walking through midtown Manhattan behind a pair of great dark glasses and under a deerstalker hat . " Some of the extreme fundamentalists are among my most vocal critics and extreme liberals think I 'm ton fundamentalist . But I think the vast majority of church people support me . " He stopped at a crowded street corner , waiting for a light to change , and was jostled by some ladies with lumpy shopping bags . He smiled from behind his glasses at none of them in particular and looked pleased with himself . Midway across the intersection he said that he first met Hubert Humphrey in 1949 when they were skinny-dipping in the pool at the YMCA in Minneapolis , but that they have never had much to say to each other . " But Nixon , I guess , is one of my ten best friends , " he said . " I first met him in the Senate cafeteria when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from North Carolina . He was an old-fashioned man with long flowing hair , and he called Nixon over and said to me , ' I want you to meet him . He 's an outstanding young man and he 's going places . ' Actually , I had met Nixon 's parents before that because they had attended some evangelical conferences that I had , too . " A blind Negro stood motionless in the middle of the street , rattling a tin cup . Graham stepped over , dropped some coins in , and slipped his arm around the man 's shoulders . He whispered something , and as he drew away he said , " God bless you . " Then he began talking about all the " confusion and frustration " in the city , which was what he had been talking about for the last few days , and he said that New Yorkers seemed to think they lived in the center of the universe . " But when I was in the Fijis , " he said , " everyone there believed that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but it got lost on the crowded street . Billy Graham is walking through bright , shining Kennedy Airport , carrying three newsmagazines and the New York Post , and resuming a conversation left over from the day before . " Niebuhr is an economic theologian , " he says , " Tillich is more of a philosopher , and Barth , we need more men like him . The trend now is toward an evangelical theology . Too many ministers think they 're social engineers . They even want to get into the business of deciding where highways should go . You must remember that the worst part of history was in the Dark Ages , when the Church ran everything . " For himself , he says , he wants no part of it , and sometimes he thinks his wife has something when she says he should take it easy and just write . Still , he says , there are things to do . Last year he sent George Wilson over to the Cunard Line to buy the Queen Mary . Imagine ! The Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also talk that he may found a university . He allows that he may . When he gets on the plane , carefully taking a window seat , while posting T. W. Wilson on the aisle , no one recognizes him . Then he slips off the dark glasses and another passenger says , " Fur Christ 's sake , Doc , that 's Billy Graham . " Graham never blinks . When we are aloft , the stewardesses , both of whom have champagne hair , approach him . One says her mother adores him . The other asks for his autograph . All during the flight he is in and out of the dark glasses , chewing gum , skimming through his magazines , and looking gracious every time someone stops by . When I order a bloody mary I hope he will think it is tomato juice . When it comes I say to hell with it and start toying with the swizzle stick . A moment later I stop and move the whole thing to a corner of the tray where he ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine in the seat pocket in front of Billy Graham is called The American Way . I stare at him . A lady with a beaded hat and a gold lorgnette stares at him . He stares out the window . There is nothing out there but clouds . I wonder if he knows something we don't.
