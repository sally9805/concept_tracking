Some suicides are not sinful , and even those that are should receive a Christian burial , says a report approved last week by the Anglican House of Bishops . <P> The bishops still deplored suicide as " the easy way out " in the face of impending exposure for some disgraceful act . But they ruled that persons suffering incurable diseases , or faced by rape or torture , can not be condemned if they kill themselves . Moreover , " we see no reason why the body of a suicide should not be brought into the church for a service , nor do we see any reason why it should not be buried in consecrated ground . " <P> The report-expected to be approved by the church assembly and Parliament within a year-recommends that an alternative burial service be read over all suicides , to avoid subjective judgment on whether or not they were sinful . Two key phrases would be left out of the suicide burial service . One is , " forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The other is , " in sure and certain hope of resurrection " - on grounds that a suicide is by definition incapable of earthly repentance for his act .
