Currently the bluntest instrument of them all is a Los Angeles broadcaster named Joe Pyne , who has become simultaneously the industry 's hottest property and , as New York Times Critic Jack Gould recently said , its " ranking nuisance . " On his interview shows , Pyne often addresses callers and guests as " stupid , " " jerk " or " meathead . " An epileptic was once asked : " Just why do you think people should feel sorry for you ?
