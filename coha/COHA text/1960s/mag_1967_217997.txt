Restrained in tone , candid in content , almost Trumanesque in verbiage , Lyndon Johnson 's fourth State of the Union address was a marked departure from the sagebrush grandiloquence that has infused most of his major pronouncements as President . <P> <P> Only once last week , in an impromptu departure from his 13-page single-spaced text , did Johnson mention the Great Society . He invoked God just once and evoked youthful memories of poverty and the Pedernales not at all . What he did present to the 90th Congress-and a prime-hour TV audience estimated at 65 million-was a pragmatic , sometimes prosaic outline of legislative aims tempered both to the conservative climate of Capitol Hill and the economic realities of a society that is inextricably involved in a costly war abroad while deeply committed to social reform at home . <P> <P> Whether describing his Administration 's domestic programs or its foreign commitments , the President offered no reason for retrenchment or retreat . On the contrary , his proposals for the coming year envision a continuing if judicious expansion of past and present canons : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strengthening of the Head Start program , new teeth in consumer protection , more national beautification , improved partnership between federal and local governments . <P> " Whither Tending . " His major surprise-and it was a mild one-was his request for a surcharge of 6% on both corporate and individual income taxes to go into effect July 1 and last for two years , or less if the Viet Nam war ends . Beyond that , the speech was cautious and uncontroversial . <P> <P> The President took his keynote theme from Lincoln : " We must ask ' where we are and whither we are tending . ' " Indeed , until Johnson actually began to speak , almost no one had any notion whither he would tend . Newsmen got no hint of the President 's plans during his long , sequestered sojourn at the L.B.J. ranch . At the White House , security precautions were so rigid that reporters were barricaded out of hearing range of the typing pool so that they could not eavesdrop on secretaries proofreading the speech aloud . Johnson held his options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by outgoing Press Secretary Bill Moyers , chief writer of the speech . Not until 5 hours before he was to speak did he iron out the final dimensions of the tax hike . Even as he dressed in his White House bedroom , an hour before leaving for Capitol Hill , Johnson was scribbling new lines on his copy . <P> Lessons of Failure . When he entered the chamber of the House of Representatives , the assembly rose and gave him an unusually warm round of applause that lasted for nearly two minutes . As the President stood on the podium , he looked healthier than he had in many a month . His hair was a bit thinner and greyer , but an expensively tailored suit and a specially cut shirt collar helped give him a trim look . His manner was that of a man who had made up his mind to ignore outrageous slings and arrows and concentrate on the duties before him . <P>
