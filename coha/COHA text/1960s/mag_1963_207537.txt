To the Euromart , the Eurodollar and the Eurochick ( the rising class of smart young working girls ) , a French firm with the un-Gallic name of Machines Bull has just added another contribution : the Eu-rocheck . Ready to switch to the magnetic-ink system of automatic checking now spreading throughout the U.S. , European nations have been looking around for the best system . To many , it seemed that the firm likeliest to walk away with the biggest fistful of orders was IBM , whose sales in France alone were up 41% last year . But scrappy Machines Bull has soundly tweaked the giant 's nose . Virtually every country in Western Europe has now picked the Bull system over the method used by U.S. banks and championed by IBM in Europe . <P> Chauvinism undoubtedly played its part in the choice , particularly on the part of French bankers , but the Machines Bull method has definite advantages over the U.S. system . The U.S. method , which uses machines that are built by General Electric , National Cash Register and Burroughs Corp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers formed by magnetic ink on the check . To conform to the machines ' peculiar reading habits , numbers must be printed in distorted characters that the human eye finds hard to read , and a smudged printing job can occasionally trick the machines . <P> Machines Bull 's method is to form the numbers with a series of thin vertical lines , which the human eye finds easier to read . Bull 's machine then interprets the number through a Morse code-like system that notes the number of lines and the varying widths of spaces between them but makes no attempt to determine the actual shape of the numeral . It immediately rejects any check that shows a flaw in the " dot-dash " code . Machines Bull 's system is simpler and cheaper to buy ( $12,000 for basic equipment for a small bank ) than the system that IBM was pushing . <P> Ever since the 19303 , Machines Bull has been aggressively trading punch cards and crossing calculators in a hotjduel with IBM , has so thrived on the struggle that its sales have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took its name from Norwegian Inventor Fredrik Bull , whose patents it acquired to make its first punch-card machine ; it is now controlled by the Callies family ( paper mills ) . It turned out a tabulator that was for years the fastest on the market , brought out the first computer to use compact germanium diodes as well as tubes and developed a Gamma 60 computer so electronically marvelous that it can handle scores of totally unrelated problems at once . <P> Winning the Eurocheck gives the company a head start over all other computer makers , but the company agreed to make the patents on its system available to all comers to induce Europe 's banks to accept its system . Already IBM , National Cash Register and Burroughs plan to copy Machines Bull 's system .
