Sleek , high-speed aircraft may be the hallmark of 20th century transportation . <P> But in Western Europe these days , planes are getting increasing competition from the oldfashioned , earthbound railroad train . Across the Continent , a spreading network known as the Trans Europe Express is holding its own in the jet age - and teaching its passengers to expect luxury while they travel . <P> New trains are being added regularly . <P> This week , to celebrate its tenth birth day , TEE puts its plush new Rembrandt onto the daily run between Amsterdam and Munich . Passengers relax in form-hugging , foam-rubber seats while a blurred landscape speeds past the vast picture windows . <P> TEE trains rush along through the six Common Market countries , Austria and Switzerland , at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. , saving travelers much of the airlines ' baggage-handling hangup and the time-consuming trip to and from out-of-city airports . TEE passengers sometimes find themselves beating jet time - especially on trips of 250 miles or less . Like Ja pan 's New Tokaido Line , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 130 m.p.h. , Trans Europe trains are built for comfort as well as speed . While he travels from <P> Paris ' Gare du Nord to the center of Brussels aboard the He de France or the Etoile du Nord , the busy businessman can unwind in uncrowded 40-passenger cars ; he gets first-class meals served at his seat , can dictate to a TEE-provided stenographer and make telephone calls . <P> Brainchild of Frans Q. den Hollander , former president of Netherlands Railway , Trans Europe was born of a desire to make travel truly pleasant . " I am fed up with the bureaucrats at the borders , " said Den Hollander . His original plan called for a single type of train that would link a united Europe-with a spur under the Channel to Britain . Although that grand scheme has yet to be realized , Den Hollander has succeeded in eliminating visa-checking delays at borders . Nowadays customs officials do their work aboard the moving trains . <P> So effective is the network that passengers traveling its popular routes must make reservations well in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule lapses ; TEE passengers can only find fault with luxuries . Complained a Frenchman who rode the Parsifal recently from Paris to Hamburg : " These German waitresses look so stern one does n't dare pinch their bottoms . " <P> <P> U.S. railroads , which lost about $400 million hauling passengers last year , are also counting on a boost from new equipment . Last week a high-speed train , manufactured by the Budd Co. , hit 156 m.p.h. on a 21-mile strip of New Jersey test track . Financed by the Federal Government , the speedster promises three-hour service in October between Washington and New York , cutting present track time by 45 minutes . For long-haul service , however , the future remains gloomy on U.S. railroads . Only last month , B. F. Biaggini , president of the Southern Pacific Co. , told a West Coast audience that " the long-distance passenger train in this country has lost its purpose in the light of very evident public preference for other modes of travel .
