EIGHT years ago , Jane S. listened numbly to voices from what she called the " optimological world . " They told her to wear heavy clothing in summer , to avoid bathing or speaking to people and never to leave Illinois ' Anna State Hospital . For 27 years , she had been considered an incurable schizophrenic . Today , Jane lives in a small town working as a companion to an elderly woman . She shows no sign of ever having been a mental patient . <P> Jane 's rescue from the subhuman existence of a mental-hospital ward is one of several hundred dramatic improvements that have been achieved by a relatively new-and hotly debated - technique known as reinforcement therapy . Unlike psychiatric techniques which seek to deal with deep-seated causes of a patient 's psychosis , reinforcement therapy concentrates on controlling and guiding everyday behavior . Its basic principle is that the residual signs of normality in an insane person should be encouraged by praise and applause-in effect , reinforced and taught with the help of tangible rewards . <P> Sugar-Coated . The principles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose classic experiments with salivating dogs first proved that human and animal reflexes could be conditioned . His theories were expanded by the greatest living exponent of behaviorism , Harvard Psychologist B. F. Skinner , who demonstrated that rats , pigeons and even men are influenced by the consequences that their actions have . This principle , the reinforcement therapists insist , applies also to mental patients previously thought to be beyond psychiatric help . <P> In one early experiment , Psychologist Ivar Lovaas of U.C.L.A. tried out reinforcement on a small group of vegetable-like psychotic children who were capable of no other utterances than guttural noises in their throats . Lovaas waited until they were hungry , then gave them a taste of sugar-coated cornflakes . Next , he held up a few flakes before the children and waited for them to make a sound . When they did , he immediately gave each of them another flake and said " Good ! " After a few more attempts , he pressed their lips together , demonstrated the sound of " mmmm " and rewarded the children with praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of painstaking work , the children learned to make several sounds , then combinations of sounds and finally words before getting their rewards . Although their illness has not disappeared , most of these once " hopeless " children are now functioning at the level of five-year-olds . <P> Neatly Dressed . An even more challenging experiment in reinforcement therapy was begun eight years ago by Psychologists Teodoro Ayllon and Nathan Azrin at Anna State Hospital . In a ward of 46 chronic female schizophrenics and mental defectives , they exposed patients to the pleasures of cigarettes , television , a choice of roommates , social events and even walks around the hospital grounds . Then they announced that , henceforth , patients would have to " buy " everything except regular meals , a bed in the least desirable room and their prescribed medicines . They could earn metal " tokens " to make purchases simply by demonstrating normal behavior . Attendants then began handing out tokens for the largest amount of useful behavior that each patient could manage at the time .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
