<P> President Hoover 's library sits in West Branch , Iowa , Eisenhower 's in Abilene , Kans. , Truman 's in Independence , Mo. , and Kennedy 's will be located in Cambridge , Mass . Naturally , Lyndon B. Johnson has hankered to have the library housing his presidential papers built down by the Pedernales . But rather than make scholars beat a track to his door , Johnson will see his library go up on Austin 's University of Texas campus . In fact he has already called him self " a son-in-law of the university , " where his wife and daughters have been students . <P> The L.B.J. library , which will house papers recording Johnson 's career in public service since the early 1930s and serve as L.B.J. 's study after his presidency , had its first showing , in model form , last week in a presentation presided over by W. W. Heath , chairman of the board of regents . It turned out to be a ten-gallon colossus . The complex was designed by Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Situated on a 19-acre extension of the university , the $10,750,000 project ( to be paid for by Texas ' oil-rich land-grant endowment fund ) is actually two buildings : the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library-a 200-ft. - long , 85-ft. - high box on a podium-and a low-lying 935-ft. - long campus library and research center . <P> The L.B.J. library is monumental , with gently curved slabs bracing set-back faades that look a little like a drive-in movie 's screen . The interior will be a vast , uncolumned hall enclosing a freestanding glass-enclosed bookstack faced with red-leather-bound presidential papers . The podium beneath it houses a 250-seat lecture hall and a 1,000-seat auditorium equipped with permanent TV installations , the necessity for which Johnson observed when he held a crushed press conference at the Truman library a year ago . <P> Atop the Johnson library is a projecting lid with a loggia that looks out from a suite reserved for the President himself . Indeed , part of the bait that the University of Texas offered L.B.J. , who says that after he leaves the presidency " there is no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the deanship of a new school of public service to be located in the ancillary building . The lid also contains studies that ring a sunken patio ; scholars will descend into the bookstack from above while the public climbs up from below to see the showcases chronicling the Johnsonian era.
