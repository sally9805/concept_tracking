GAUGUIN IN THE SOUTH SEAS by Bengt Danielsson. 336 pages . Doubleday . $7.95 . <P> Posterity appreciates Paul Gauguin more than his contemporaries did . While he lived , the museums of his native France coldly refused him wall space . Until his death in 1903 , his canvases found mostly a rude or indifferent market ; later the bidding began to spiral out of sight : a single Gauguin was knocked down for $364,000 at Sotheby 's in 1959 . Posterity , in short , has caught up with Gauguin 's notion of his own indisputable greatness . The matter of the Gauguin legend , however , is disputable , and this book ably succeeds in separating the facts from the romance . <P> Indecent Exposure . Bengt Danielsson is no art critic but an anthropologist who accompanied Thor Heyerdahl 's 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition to Polynesia , succumbed to the charm of the South Seas and moved his family to Tahiti in 1956 . There he bumped into the legend of Gauguin , who spent his last years in Tahiti and in the nearby Marquesas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danielsson soon discovered what was for him an astonishing fact : none of Gauguin 's many biographers had ever bothered to measure the legend in the place where so much of it was made . <P> The figure of Gauguin that takes shape here is that of a man whose posthumous reputation stands in heavy debt to his dramatic self-exile to the South Seas . By the time Gauguin arrived in 1891 , his style had already been formed , his competence proved ; nothing he did thereafter materially changed or improved either . Seeking in a Rousseauean state of nature the simple truths he wanted to paint , Gauguin found instead a culture already changed by a century of Western influences . Papeete , the capital , was any ugly French town . Gauguin 's models dressed more decorously than he : when he bathed in the raw , a gendarme fined him for indecent exposure . <P> Gauguin did not always rely on available models . The studio of Charles Spitz , then Tahiti 's only professional photographer , supplied him with inspiration for his art . His Pape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tahitian boy drinking from a mountain spring , was painted from a Spitz photo . In la Orana Maria , one of his best-known canvases , the Tahitian figures strike poses deriving entirely from a photograph of a Javanese-temple frieze that Gauguin had brought from Paris . <P> Instead of absorbing his elected milieu , Gauguin largely rebuffed it . In an area where food could be plucked from trees and the sea , he exhausted funds on potatoes , canned asparagus and claret imported from France . Nearly all of the native-language titles affixed to his paintings betray his ignorance of the tongue . He learned little of the native myths , committing to canvas misconstructions so gross that Tahitians would have laughed if they had understood them . To the end of his days , he painted human figures on the guideline checkerboards , like graph paper , that steady the novice 's uncertain hand . <P> Uncoached , Undazzled . Gauguin in the South Seas should surprise readers who have been accustomed to the legend of the man inspired by Maugham 's The Moon and Sixpence and propagated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no perceptible awe of his subject 's artistic stature .
