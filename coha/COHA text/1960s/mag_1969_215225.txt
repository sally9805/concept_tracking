For a few frantic years in the ' 60s , London-swinging and otherwise-became the center of the world of fads and styles . Now the inevitable outburst of reviews of the passing decade has begun , and among the first is a book , Goodbye Baby &; Amen ( Coward-McCann ; $15 ) , by British Entertainment Writer Peter Evans and Photographer David Bailey . Obviously , Goodbye is no serious history book . But neither is it just a picture book with filler text . <P> Bailey 's highly subjective shutter shows Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski in a bare-chested embrace , looking like an older , less innocent reincarnation of Romeo and Juliet . Candice Bergen poses as though she belongs on the prow of a ship-and says that she " ca n't think of anything grimmer than being an ageing actress ; god , it 's worse than being an ageing homosexual . " Rudolf Nureyev romps with Cecil Beaton ; Jeanne Moreau presses her fingers nervously to her mouth ; Malcolm Muggeridge scowls in fearsome closeup . And Fashion Designer Douglas Hayward remarks : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Rolling Stone do at forty ? " <P> Bailey did not merely photograph swinging London ; he was part of it . As Evans puts it , Bailey was " the prototype of the dashing Cockney photographer " - and the prototype for the hero of Blow-Up . Other photographers , of course , collected a lot of money and a lot of girls . But few did it with Bailey 's flair . A tailor 's apprentice at 15 , he was in his mid-20s when he bought his first two-tone Rolls-Royce ( light blue on dark blue ) . At about the same time , he was traveling the world with his favorite model , Jean Shrimpton . Since then , there have been other cars , other trips , other girls . Now 31 , Bailey has an annual income of about $100,000 , an E-type Jaguar as well as a Rolls and two other cars , a beautiful and as yet undivorced wife in Catherine Deneuve , and a waifly , warm-hearted companion in 20-year-old Penelope Tree . <P> Not everybody , of course , likes Bailey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a lugubrious epitaph for our waning decade . " Muggeridge called the whole effort commercial bananas . Even Bailey does n't exactly promote it when he says : " I 've done a superficial book about a superficial period . " Maybe . But perhaps a more apt summing-up of Goodbye is its last-line appraisal of the decade itself- " It was great fun . Sure . "
