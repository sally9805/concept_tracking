We are not final because we are infallible , but we are infallible only because we are final . <P> - Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson ( 1941-54 ) . <P> The third branch of the U.S. Government is intimate , unhurried and arcane , almost totally devoid of pomp or visible drama . Yet the Supreme Court 's decisions affect every American , living and unborn . And it is the final , irrevocable judge of every President and Congress . Thus last week , when Lyndon Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be the 15th Chief Justice of the United States , his selection was almost as significant as the election of a new President in November . A President can not be elected more than twice . A Chief Justice can remain at the head of the world 's most powerful court virtually as long as he lives or desires . <P> In view of President Johnson 's fondness for unexpected appointments , the nomination of Fortas to succeed Earl Warren was surprising only in its predictability . A close friend and adviser , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1965 , Fortas has distinguished himself in three Sessions on the Supreme Court , closely following-and to an increasing degree leading-the activist bloc that has dominated the Warren court for the past 15 years . If he was not a surprise , he was , at least in one way , unique . The fifth Jew to sit on the bench-the others were Louis Brandeis , Benjamin Cardozo , Felix Frankfurter and Goldberg-he would be the first of his religion to hold the third highest office in the nation . <P> Expectable in almost every other way , the nomination nonetheless provoked an unexpected reaction , arousing more opposition in the Senate than any other court appointment since 1930-when Herbert Hoover 's choice of John J. Parker was rejected by a margin of two votes . But Parker was denied the post because of labor and Negro antipathy . Fortas is opposed not for what he has done but for what he is : the choice of a man who will be in office for less than seven more months , and the President 's close friend and confidant to boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Michigan 's Robert Griffin , " and everybody knows it . " The charge of cronyism was reinforced by the fact that , to fill the vacancy left by Earl Warren 's retirement and Fortas ' move up , Lyndon Johnson appointed his old friend and fellow Texan , Homer Thornberry ( see box , page 15 ) .
