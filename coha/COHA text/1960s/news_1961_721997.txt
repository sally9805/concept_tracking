txt The world , which watched with bated breath the storm breaking over Berlin , appears to have reached the relative calm of the center of the hurricane ; but the hurricane is not over and the real trial is still ahead of us . As President Kennedy warned , we face difficult weeks and months , and what develops might decide the fateful question of peace or war . The hope of avoiding the worst now rests on the possibility of peaceful negotiations . This hope is all the stronger because , despite Premier Khrushchev 's threats of nuclear annihilation for all who stand in his way , both sides recognize that in the awful arithmetic of an atomic war there can be no victors , but only global devastation . Certainly our own armaments are designed , not to wage war , but to deter war , and to maintain an adequate balance of power that will permit negotiations on an equitable basis . Just how and when , and on what basis , negotiations are to start , however , must still be determined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But France holds back on the ground that since the Soviet ruler started the Berlin crisis it is up to him to make the first move , lest the West appear as a supplicant. eager to negotiate from weakness and under coercion . And Premier Khrushchev , though offering to negotiate , appears in no hurry to make a first move . This problem of procedure might be solved during the coming session of the United Nations General Assembly , which promises to bring the foreign ministers to New York . It was at such a session that the end of the Berlin blockade was prepared . But the basis on which negotiations could take place is not yet in sight . Overhanging everything is still Premier Khrushchev 's ultimatum that unless the Western powers sign his " peace treaty " for the partition of Germany and a " free city " of West Berlin ? " freed " from protecting Western troops ? he will sign such a " treaty " with his East German agents by the end of the year , and that in either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German control . That is not a negotiable basis for the West , which is'committed to the defense of West Berlin 's freedom and self-determination for the German people , on which also rest the solidity of the North Atlantic alliance and the hope of all subjugated East European peoples for ultimate liberation . Therefore , unless Premier Khrushchev accepts a different basis than his own , the chances for negotiations on Germany and all Central Europe , for which Secretary Rusk hopes , would seem slim . But this would still leave room for negotiations on a modus vivendi regarding Berlin under which both sides can live . A separate Soviet " peace treaty " with East Germany is not a casus belli for us , nor is the " wall of shame " the Communists have built to demonstrate East Berlin 's completed annexation . But any interference with West Berlin 's freedom or our access to it is a cause for action , and Prffnier Khrushchev 's final attitude on this issue will show whether he only wants to bolster his shaky puppet regimes or whether he proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further conquests . This is also the issue , and not Berlin as such , that will demonstrate whether he wants peace or war .
