When Yugoslavia decided to embark on its own road to socialism , it also decided to chuck doctrinaire economic rules and let its economy operate more or less according to the principles of free enterprise . Yugoslav businessmen , though still subject to more controls than in the West , are therefore unique in the Communist world in their respect for the profit motive , the laws of supply and demand and the necessity of competition . One of the most remarkable of the capitalistic comrades who are putting the dynamics of the free market to work under Communism is a former partisan fighter and devoted Communist named Velimir Marton . With a spirit and shrewdness that any businessman could envy , Marton took over a small meat-packing plant in the early 1950s , and has turned it into Yugoslavia 's largest food company . <P> Slavonic Bill Holden . Marton , 42 , is managing director of Zagreb-based Sljeme Agricultural Industrial Corp. , whose sales last year topped $37 million -a fourteenfold increase in eight years . Sljeme ( pronounced Slay-me ) now owns four farms stocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry , and ponds full of trout and carp . It employs 3,500 workers and has four large factories that produce everything from semiprepared " TV dinners " to pickled pigs ' feet for sale in its 60 food stores , eight restaurants and one hotel . And it makes its deliveries in its own fleet of 150 trucks , manufactures its own cans and labels . <P> Businessman Marton , who looks like a Slavonic William Holden , learned many of his economic lessons in seven trips to the U.S. , and is fond of repeating such familiar free enterprise lines as " The customer is always right " and " We have to grow or die . " He particularly believes the latter , and has just embarked on an ambitious plan that aims at nothing less than converting Sljeme into , as he puts it , " a Yugoslav combination of Howard Johnson 's , Safeway and Swift , with a little Conrad Hilton thrown in . " Marton intends to spend $50 million by 1970 to build restaurants , motels , supermarkets and processing plants . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restaurants along the Adriatic coast were nearly completed , and a big advertising campaign was under way in Europe to attract the summer tourists whom Marton counts on to fill them . <P> A Practical Limit . After filling a series of postwar industrial posts , Marton took over Sljeme in 1951 when he was 29 . He got the job because of his credentials as a trusted Communist , had no formal business training . But he made Sljeme prosper because of his skill as a manager , his ability to outwit competitors and his readiness to adopt the modern techniques and philosophy of capitalism . This was possible because , though all major Yugoslav industry is owned by the state , the state itself does not run businesses . Workers ' councils that operate somewhat like boards of directors are elected by the workers , hire a managing director and hold him responsible for the firm 's profitability . Marton had to overcome his cautious board 's objection to his ambitious expansion program .               @ @ @ @ @ @
