Write Me a Murder ( by Frederick Knott ) gives away its murderer ( James Donald ) in Act I without defrosting any of its suspense as a superior spine-chiller . British Playwright Knott , of Dial " M " for Murder fame , has worked a twist on the conventional whodunit by fashioning a will-he-do-it . <P> Donald is the disaffected younger son of the land-rich , tax-poor Rodingham clan . His elder brother ( Denholm Elliott ) , an elegant spendthrift who likes to know where his next cobwebby bottle of wine is coming from , plans to sell the 500-year-old family mansion . The buyer ( Torin Thatcher ) is an upstart real estate operator who likes to tromp on the middle of other people 's sentences . But he has a couth and cultured wife ( Kim Hunter ) who likes to write . Donald writes too and , with a short story contest in view , he helps her work out the mechanics of a seemingly perfect crime . The question is how and when nature will follow art . <P> An expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimes in gruff comic command as the family doctor , and James Donald convincingly torn between love , money , and the family crest . Murder will out , of course , and it does with an explosively surprising last-curtain bang-of laughter .
