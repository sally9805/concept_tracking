On the eve of the couple 's 30th wedding anniversary , a much delayed invitation arrived from Buckingham Palace . Queen Elizabeth II would be pleased if the Duke and Duchess of Windsor could come to England from the U.S. to attend the dedication next month in Marlborough House of a memorial plaque to the Duke 's mother , the late Queen Mary . It was , said the palace , strictly a family affair . Nevertheless , it marked the first time since his abdication and marriage that the British crown has taken formal recognition of the former King 's twice-divorced American wife-though the Duchess and the Queen did chat two years ago when they met at London Clinic , where the Duke was undergoing eye surgery . <P> <P> The neat signature at the bottom of the weekly intramural sports schedule in Amherst College 's Pratt dorm spells Eisenhower . Ike 's only grandson , David , 18 , signs it as sports chairman of the dorm , and his classmates have been having their own kind of sport with it . They send the signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have even mailed a couple of mint specimens to Smith College Freshman Julie Nixon , 17 . Except for the holograph hounds , though , the little Lord Jeffreys make no fuss over David . " We have a Cabot at Amherst , " explains an insouciant classmate , " and that 's as high as you can go . " <P> <P> He had been denied top honors twice before by the inscrutable Cannes Film Festival jury , and she had been passed over only last month for an Oscar . So now , with each other for moral support , Italian Director Michelangelo Antonioni , 54 , and British Actress Vanessa Redgrave , 30 , she in sequined tunic and tights , braved a screening at Cannes of Blow-Up , in which Vanessa had taken a relatively small part simply because " I wanted to be directed by Antonioni . " After the showing , Vanessa went home to London , but Antonioni stayed on for the happy ending : a Golden Palm applauding Blow-Up as the best film of the 25 shown at the festival . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christie 's comedy-thriller , The Mousetrap , passed its 6,000th London performance last week ( v. a measly 2,238 for former British record holder Chu Chin Chow ) . Since opening night in 1952 , more than 2,000,000 people have bought tickets to the tiny ( 435 seats ) Ambassadors ' Theatre , and 97 actors have peopled the play 's eight roles . " Just about everybody in England has seen it except the Queen , " says Producer Peter Saunders , " and she thinks she 's seen it . " Author Christie , 76 , has given no interview on the subject since 1961 , claiming that she has run out of things to say . Small wonder . Believing The Mousetrap good for about a six-month run , she had made a thoughtful little gift of the royalties to her grandson , Michael Pritchard , who keeps up a 900-acre estate , an 18th century manor house and an Alfa-Romeo on the proceeds . <P>
