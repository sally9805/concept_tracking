What memories the name brought back ? tales of wreckers and gales , of 500 ships and 5,000 people lost . " Graveyard of the Atlantic , " my Grandfather Bell called it . " One of the world 's most terrible traps for sailors . " As I refilled his pipe , he 'd tell me stories of his own trip in 1898 to Sable , that lonely island 100 miles southeast of Nova Scotia . He saw wrecks of ships littering the beaches and " wild ponies dashing down upon the shore into the midst of hundreds of seals . " With Grandmother , PHANTOM ISLAND , Sable drifts in the Atlantic 100 miles southeast of Nora Scotia . Wild ponies wander the wind-cut dunes , hummocks , and brackish ponds of the isle , whose name is French for sand .  | Grampy Bell had visited Sable to search ? in vain , it proved ? for the bodies of two shipwrecked friends . Years later , they still recalled vivid details ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the valleys , " gales that make exposed skin bleed " from the impact of fine particles of sand . " Mostly they talked of the danger to ships , and the heroic work of the lifesaving crews . Grampy brought back several ponies to our summer place in Nova Scotia . One foal , a wild , kicking thing , I tamed before I was 10 . Dolley carried me on fishing expeditions . Sometimes she threw me , but I found her worth the bruises , for she came from a place where the only industry was danger . My curiosity about Sable was nourished too , on transatlantic crossings long age , Steaming by at night , I spotted its flashing lighthouse . Once my ship passed at daybreak , Sable lay so close aboard we could see its p dunes lying low and ominous . On other shi we passed cautiously in fog . Every time , the captain had sighed in relief , " Sable astern " Indeed , those captains had cause to worry I read in our much-battered 1947 volume  | British Sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sable Island and be in danger ... crews are urged to remain by the ship until assistance can be rendered by the life-saving staff on shore . Former experience shows that all attempts to leave in the ship 's own boats have resulted in loss of life .... " Shipwrecked sailors would wait long for a surfboat today ? there are none . Now in the dark of a foggy night , in my own little ship , with Sable somewhere off our starboard bow , I knew the worries of the old skippers . I was eager to set foot on that little-known island , but determined that White Mist should not leave her lovely hull in this boneyard . " What are the chances in this fog of landing on Sable ? " I asked Gil , our navigator , next morning . " Can we duck the shoals ? " " If I can pick up that radio beacon on our direction finder , and if our fathometer holds up , " he answered , " I 'm sure we can feel our way in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're too far off now . " We studied the charts of Sable . Shifting shoals of West Bar stuck like a scimitar 20  | miles out from the island 's tip . For days we had been plotting a course well clear . Still Gil wondered what the currents were doing to us in this pea soup . No sounds yet from Sable 's radio beacon . Vainly Gil tried for a shot of an elusive sun with his marine sextant . " If only the fog would lift for a moment , " he complained . Without a true horizon , he could n't observe the surf 's altitude and find our true position . But the fog grew thicker . Moving at 5 knots , we listened for foghorns of fishing trawlers ? halibut , cod , mackerel , and broadbill swordfish abound in these waters . Gil fumed and waited for any slight break in the fog . When it came , he raised his sextant , made a quick sun shot , then dashed below to compute his position . A moment later he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? heading dead on the western shoals ! I ca n't believe it . The horizon must be false . " To be safe , he quickly figured a new course , then ordered the helmsman , my son Alec , to turn 35 ? westward . Sable 's strange currents had apparently set us miles to the east . " Let 's skip those plans for landing on Sable , " Alec urged . " It 'll cost us an extra day ? even we 're lucky . "  | Alec , a United States Navy test pilot and bite Mist 's sailing master , understood the ards . He remembered what the Canadian officials had told us . " There 's a constant surf on the beaches ? and no harbor whatever : ' they admonished . " No small boat should aproach or land on Sable . Only in mid-July for a three-week period is the weather calm and surf low enough to permit small boats to land on beaches . Even then it 's a 50-50 chance ? and there 's almost constant fog . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break ? If we did , I was determined to try . By midday we were close enough to Sable 's radio beacon to receive accurate bearings . which proved we had sailed 30 miles farther west than necessary . Gil 's suspicion about the sun sight was confirmed : Mist had made the horizon false . " It 's easy to see how early navigators wrecked their ships here . Suppose our error had been the other way , and we had changed course eastward toward Sable 's shoals , " Gil commented . " Electronics makes my job easier and safer . " Shifting Shoals Make Charts Treacherous During the night we steered a long course around the western shoals to the north of Sable , watching our fathometer all the while . In well-charted waters we could have followed our track by the peaks and valleys of the ocean floor . But Sable 's shoals shift constantly and charts are unreliable . Our Sailing Directions told us the sandy traps form in waves ? unpredictable and undulating . White Mist altered course at 1:15 a.m. to run down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered how well our fathometer was working , for it registered " no bottom . " Time and again , we hove to and checked with the old-fashioned hand line . No bottom . Riding the beacon at 41/4 knots , we picked 4  | up a sounding of 145 feet . Then 120 , then 90 , and 82 . Shoaling up fast . As pale daylight brightened the fog , we began to hear breakers on the starboard bow . This was the notorious surf pounding West Bar . Chill water and fog carried the sound for miles . Surf with this calm sea ? what would be like in a storm , I mused . At 5:30 , we found bottom at 65 feet ; lead line confirmed the fathometer reading within two feet . Now I knew we were getting close . " Douse the genoa ! " I ordered . " I want to - low her . " The crew tactfully reminded me that White Mist drew only 41/2 feet with her centerboard up . " Aw , we 're miles out yet , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Slowly we drifted on , the surf getting louder and the water shallower . Now the depth varied markedly , shallow one minute , deeper the next . But all the while , the bottom came closer . Quite suddenly , it was 10 feet . Glancing over the side , I saw sand . " Round up into the wind ! " I shouted . " Douse the main ! Let go the anchor ! " Still no sign of the dunes of Sable . Snugly anchored in the gentle surge of the swells , we went below for a hearty breakfast . As we lingered over coffee , Alec poked his head up the hatch for a look . " Land ho ! " he shouted . " And on the nose ! " The fog had lifted ; small waves frothed the beach 400 yards away . We could see the radio beacon antenna , its top jabbed into a mass of cloud . Triumphantly , we blew our horn three times as recommended in our Sailing Directions . We waited . No response . We tooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swells . The beach remained deserted , and we were a bit provoked at this lack of welcome .  | " Maybe we should feel our way down toward the lighthouse , " suggested Alec . Following the misty shore , we motored slowly westward along the beach , sounding constantly . Strangely , the water closer to shore was deeper than where we first anchored . Through a cleft in the great sand wall , I saw rooftops and a lighthouse . " We 'll try a landing here , " I said . After eight days at sea , the crew was eager for a day ashore . Incredibly the seas were calm . But the weather changes swiftly ; so I insisted that our crew take turns standing watch aboard White Mist . From old eyewitness accounts , we knew what could happen . " The sun often rises clear , giving indications of continued good weather , " warned one Sable historian . " Suddenly a dull , leaden haze obscures the sun ... the sky assumes a wild , unusual appearance . The wind begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful fury , whipping off the summits of the hummocks , carrying before it a cloud of blinding sand-drift .... " Astonished Islanders Greet " Ghosts " Calm as the water seemed , the swells were more than enough for our 81/2-foot pram . But the little cockleshell made it to shore , though a wave swamped her on the first trip ? in water ankle deep . " Let 's try Pitcairn Island technique , " I suggested to Kim Frinell from Seattle , Washington , as we rowed in . When Pacific islanders bring their longboats through surf , they wait patiently , count five  | big swells , then row like Old Harry for shore . We tried the same tactic , and I stepped ashore almost dry shod ( page 403 ) . I saw no life , heard no sound except the roar of Atlantic swells breaking on West Bar . Wisps of fog still clung to the dunes like carded cotton . The panorama was as chill as the ghost stories that haunt this place . Curiously I felt eyes upon us ; looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A big black stallion , ears up and mane stiffened by the wind , challenged us like a sentry . A flash of his tail and he was gone . Yes , horses still roamed Sable . Loose sand pulling at our feet , we labored up the dune . Below us lay a green valley with clustered houses , a village rising from the sea . " People , " Gil said , pointing . A man and a woman knelt in a patch of green . The woman lifted her poke bonnet peered at us . I waved . The bonnet bob down , and she resumed her work . " I 'm sure she saw us , " Gil said , his voice not at all sure . Again she looked up , then quickly down Without wanting to , I thought of pirates and shipwreckers who once had lived her I walked toward the woman , holding my hand . She and the man scrambled to their feet , scattering strawberries . " But ? how did you get here ? " he asked incredulously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a government boat ! " " You came out of the sea and fog , " she said . " I thought you were ghosts ! " They were the Norman Bells , who had immigrated to Canada from Dumfries , Scotland ( page 402 ) For a year they had lived in Sable  | Norman Bells , who had imrla from Dumfries , Scotland they had lived on Sable , where he tended the diesel station that generates all the island 's electric power . " My middle name is Bell , too , " I said . " Well , we must all be telephone Bells ! " laughed my host . " Righter than you think , " I said . Then I explained that Grandfather ? the inventor Alexander Graham Bell ? was responsible for my lifelong interest in the island and the reason for my being here . " Forgive me , " said Mrs. Bell . " I have almost forgotten how to behave with visitors ? we have only four government boats a year . You must come to our house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we made our way to a neatly painted frame house . As we passed through the vestibule , she reached into a big freezer and pulled out a can of lemonade . A moment later we were sipping a refreshing drink over strawberry shortcake and discussing their life here . Some of the Bells ' furniture was damaged when it was brought ashore ( " the boat broached and water ruined our record player " ) ; still the house was cozy and attractive . Pots of begonias and fuchsias dotted the living room ( page 405 ) , and I recalled Grampy Bell 's journal : " Flowers of various kinds are grown successfully indoors , but the dwarfed appearance of all vegetation out of doors shows that the weather is not always mild . " " Yes , " said Mr. Bell . " Wind and sand cut everything down . We have n't a single tree . " " You 're interested in geography , " said Mrs. Bell , handing me a map . " Sable is a floating sand island , constantly shifting , anchored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodily eastward and gotten smaller since its discovery about 1500 . " Portuguese cartographer Pedro Reinel called it Sanda Crus , and on early English , Italian , and French maps it varied in size . In 1633 a Dutchman , Johannes de Laet , reported " Sable ... is about forty miles in circuit .. the sea . . . being shallow and without harbors , and having a bad repute for shipwrecks . " Others , perhaps out of pure dread , calculated the island as 200 miles long with dunes towering 800 feet ! The west end retreated before the storms : 6 miles between 1766 and 1899 ; 3 between 1899 and 1959 . Meantime , the eastern tip actually grew ( opposite ) . Voracious seas and winds have gnawed at the island 's dunes until today it- measures scarcely a mile wide and about 23 miles long . Broad sand beaches and far-reaching shoals are remnants of the old island .  | " You can trace the erosion by our lighthouses , " Mrs. Bell noted . Since the first light was built here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Surf beats today over the ruins of the West Light that Grandfather saw well inland . " Dunes change overnight in storms , and landmarks disappear , " said Mrs. Bell . " So it is hard to reconstruct island history . " She told us that after a severe storm in 1963 , an island resident found the exposed skeleton of a young man who may have starved to death . " And with the body , " she added , " he found some old British coins dated 1760 ? and these . " She handed me half a dozen lead musket balls and a shoe buckle . - Near Old Main Station lie the " French graves , " never opened . Were these casualties of the long campaigns between the British and French in the New World ? We know that in 1746 the Duc d'Anville , on his expedition against the British colonies , lost a transport and a fire ship in a storm here . Perhaps these were wounded men going home from the wars . Or was this ship lured upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo ? No one could be sure . We do know that in the autumn of 17 the British sailing ship Francis perished here with every soul . She was bringing from England the equipage of the Duke of Kent ? treasures of furniture , plate , books , and maps . For years ugly rumor surrounded the sink ing of the Francis . Stories were told of jeweland rare artifacts seen in the homes of certain Nova Scotia fishermen ? " things from Sable Island , " men cryptically explained Some said that survivors of the Francis reached Sable Island safely , only to be murdered for their treasures . A proclamation was issued in 1801 , investigations made , and certain residents of the island ? wreckers presumably ? were expelled to the mainland . Yet from this dark incident came a new role for Sable Island . The legislature of Nova Scotia established a lifesaving station . In succeeding decades , thousands of shipwreck victims owed their lives to thest lifesavers @#  | " We find only a few relics of the shipwrecks now , " said Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark Raffaele D. , wrecked in 1896 , one of the scant souvenirs from 500 disasters . " The sand swallows most wreckage like quicksand , " she said . " And the winds and currents carry floating objects around the island and out to sea . " Or as Grampy noted , " The wind is in the wrong direction to assist drift of bodies to shore . " Island Census Lists 200 Ponies " You are extremely lucky with the weather , " Norman Bell told us . " This is the calmest sea we 've had in months . Most days you could n't dream of coming ashore in that pram . Too bad the island no longer has longboats to give visitors a hand . " Mrs. Bell made a telephone call to Douglas Harrington , the officer in charge of the weather station . He sent word that he would be right over . " How many live on the island ? " I asked . " Just 13 , " Mr. Bell said , " and about 200 ponies . " Outside the window grazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnuts , blacks , and several shaggy colts of a pinkish fawn color . Mrs. Bell handed me some oatmeal cakes . " Maybe they 'll eat these from your hand . " she said . We walked slowly toward them . Tentatively , a colt approached to nibble , then turned into a little beggar . He even nibbled at my elbow and camera . The origin of these ponies is lost in dim history . They may have descended from stock shipped to the island from New  | England in 1738 , or from an even earlier herd that survived the wreck of a Spanish vessel off Sable . Whatever the family tree , ponies have flourished here since the 18th century , living for more than 40 generations in herds of six and eight on local grasses . And many shipwrecked sailors were thankful for " horse venison , " as they called their survival diet . Grampy 's journal of 1898 had this to say : " These ponies are not small like Shetland ponies , but pretty nearly of ordinary size for horses . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to haul the life-boats over the beach . Stud-horses , however , were @#  | introduced from the mainland .. . after the capture of the native stallions . The halfbreeds since produced are so much larger and stronger than the original ponies that they can be used for the work of the stations . " Wild Rides , Soft Landings Mr. Harrington and his assistants arrived a few minutes later on the island 's only " bus " ? a lumbering tractor and trailer . " Welcome to Sable Island , " Mr. Harrington said , smiling through his luxuriant sablecolored beard . His assistants hopped aboard ponies bareback for a rollicking romp . Wild ones lurched , bolted , and tossed the riders onto the sand . " Only three ponies on the island are tame enough to ride , " a young man told me , " and only one is cart-broke . " But nature strikes a balance between the ponies ' high spirits and sugar-soft sand . I saw not one rock on the whole island . " I 'd like to show you more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Manhasset , " Mr. Harrington suggested . As the bus skidded in the loose sand and climbed the dunes , our host commented , " We call this a road . " Warm sun bored through the  | overcast , melting the fog and brightening the lush grass in the gullies among the dunes . Small clans of ponies grazed here and there . But all the while , we were thinking about the weather . If a fresh wind and surf came up , White Mist would have to put to sea instantly ; it might be weeks before she could return . Mr. Harrington reassured us , however : " The forecast ? fog and light winds . As we came over a ridge , we saw the radar dome and buildings of the weather station , all huddled together starkly . Here we sent radiograms to the mainland that we had made safe landing on Sable . Doug Harrington showed us a pile of bright glass-and-aluminum fishing floats . " We walk the beaches a lot and find them cast up ? man nationalities , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The biggest ones are Russian . " In fact , on Whitt Mist 's radio , we 'd heard guttural Russian sea talk ; and once , we 'd sailed through a squadron of four white Soviet trawlers ? floating fish factories . An operator in Sable 's radio shack was talking to Alec on White Mist . Alec had picked a frequency that Sable could read ; so we had a short chat , reassured that all was well aboard " Next time you come , " said Harrington . " put a 2,800 crystal in your radio set . We monitor 2,800 kilocycles every hour on the hour It 's also a good idea to send word ahead to the  | forecaster in Halifax , so we 'll expect you . " The walls of the shack were decorated with pin-up girls . " The only two women on the island , " Harrington explained , " are married ! " Two men watched a television screen . " Not a bad picture today , " commented one . But hard as I looked , I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 miles north . " Do n't think it 's always this quiet here , " said Harrington . " Storms are very dramatic . " He told us about 60-foot waves exploding on the shoals and rolling up the beaches , then showed us window glass frosted opaque by sandstorms in a single season . Huts Save Castaways ' Lives During such storms , refuge huts often saved lives . Doug Harrington showed me a log for 1855 : " The Nisibis ... struck on the N. E. bar ... during a most violent gale .... The crew clung to the wreck till ... miraculously thrown on shore .... It was next to impossible for our men to go the rounds ; and if those poor fellows had not had ... the house of refuge " with a fire to warm them and bread to eat , wrote the superintendent , they would have died before reaching " the eastern station , the distance ... being seven miles . " Doug broke out charts that located known shipwrecks by name and year . The dots ? each one a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 413 ) . Navigator Gil was fascinated by the chart . " White Mist is anchored near here , " he said , pointing to a dot . " What wreck is this ? " " That would be the schooner Arno , " Doug replied , " sunk in 1846 . I 'll show you the official report by Superintendent Joseph Darby . " An eyewitness , this colorful old sea captain commanded Sable Island station from 1830 to 1848 . During a violent winter storm , he reported , giant waves piled up on the bars off the north shore . Across these very shallows White Mist had glided only this morning . " All of a sudden , " Darby wrote , " we saw an object to the north side dead to windward , which we at first thought was a large bird , but shortly after discovered that it was a sail , distant five or six miles , and that she was running down right before this tremendous gale dead on a lee shore ... incredible that any vessel could live to come so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through his glass , Darby watched the schooner approach over waves that " appeared like certain destruction . " Miraculously , the sea before the ship seemed to turn " smooth as glass .... When she approached a little near-421 er we could see . . . two men were making great exertions with their arms .... Another half mile brought her to the beach , and her bow struck the sand . " Safely ashore , Arno 's skipper explained how he had saved all hands . " He lashed himself to the helm , " Darby 's report continued , " sent all his men below but two , and nailed up the cabin doors . He had two large casks placed near the foreshrouds .... He then directed his two best men to ... lash themselves firmly to the casks , which were partly filled with blubber and oil from the fish . They had each a wooden ladle about two feet long , and . . . they dipped up the blubber and oil and threw it up in the air as high as they could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leeward ahead , and , spreading over the water , made the surface smooth before her , and left a shining path behind ... . It was raging ... but not a barrel of water fell upon her deck the whole distance . " Thus wrote Captain Darby in 1846 ? officially , colorfully , perhaps even truthfully. .  | To see the breakers , our bus took us a quarter of a mile across the flat south beach . Terns followed us , calling uneasily lest we invade their nesting grounds . Most of all , we enjoyed the seals . But their numbers have flagged since Grandfather recorded " hundreds " and even " thousands " on these beaches . At least their manners endured . As he reported : " . . . every seal had his head lifted watching our approach .... They seemed to display no fear , only curiosity to have a look at us . An uncanny feeling to see a human-looking head with great rings round the eyes suddenly pop out of the water to stare at you . " Fog still hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stallions charging in from far-distant storms crashed at our feet . What if a gale should blow up now ? The sea would rise and these waves would suddenly grow monstrous , overwhelming us . Returning to the dunes , we were lucky to have tracks to follow and Doug to lead us . Pity the poor sailor cast up here by the waves in a roaring maelstrom . He could stumble for miles across these flats in the wrong direction , perhaps to drown off East Point . Yet on the loneliest patch of hard , wet sand , we could still see tracks of ponies . Inland , between the dunes , we passed skeletons of ponies caught unprotected by winter storms . " Life still is n't easy for them , " said Doug . " Each autumn we bring in hay to feed the tame horses through the winter . Some of the others will accept handouts , but the really wild ones prefer to forage . " As we rolled along the south beach , we saw ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE PHOTOGRAPHS , COURTESY H. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DATION , HALII A%  | Sable Island 's latest wreck : The butt of a mast with crossed yardarm stands like a gravemarker for the Manhasset , a Panamanian freighter that struck here in 1947 ( page 422 ) . " That was the year the radio beacon was installed , " Doug Harrington explained , " and ships began to carry radar and sonar . Since then we 've had no shipwrecks . None . " But if a storm should silence the beacon ? if that victorious V signal ( three-shorts-anda-long ) should fail ? or if the island itself should erode and disappear , as some geologists predict , then Sable 's unmarked banks would trap sailors again . Meandering back , we sighted a number of sprightly " gray birds , " as islanders used to call the Ipswich sparrow , Sable 's only nesting land bird ( page 419 ) . Named for Ipswich , Massachusetts , where it was first found , this little dune dweller ranges in winter from New England to Georgia beaches . But its breeding place remained a mystery until 1894 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that this little stretch of sand is its only nesting site in the world , and its declining numbers on the mainland may be due to erosion of these storm-tortured dunes . At last our trail led us to the one place on Sable that still evokes a spirit of the past : the abandoned main lifesaving station . Since the need for surfboats and lifesavers has vanished , these snug homes have become a bleak ghost town . The superintendent 's house , the old barracks for marooned mariners , and the lifeboat sheds ? all are in collapse and partly smothered by grassy dunes . Walls once neatly painted have taken on the luminous gray of driftwood . The place was utterly strange ? yet familiar . Then I recalled Grandfather 's faded photographs taken on his visit . Houses stood freshly painted behind neat picket fences . Men with elegant mustaches posed with ladies in flowing skirts and bonnets . On clear days , the lookout could survey most of the island from a tower that stood here . But in fog or storm , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as one old chronicler reported , " sometimes in the face of a fierce blast . . . snow , hail , or rain , or driving sand so as to make his face smart , so that he was sometimes glad to take shelter behind a sand dune .. . . At length he met the roundsman from the next station . They exchanged notes , retraced their steps , and reported the results at headquarters . They thus made the whole circuit of the island . "  | Grandmother saw these patrols and wrote that they examined " every inch of the shore so not even a bottle could escape discovery . " When ships in distress were sighted , the lifesavers launched their surfboats . I could imagine the craft striking out through crashing breakers . How the sailors on sinking ships must have prayed for those-heroic oarsmen ! My thoughts moved back to 1853 when that remarkable humanitarian and philanthropist Dorothea Lynde Dix visited Sable Island on a mission similar to Grandfather 's . While here for only three days , she witnessed a shipwreck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under full sail on the south side of the island . Longboats rescued the crew through high surf , but the captain " had become a raving maniac , and would not leave , " wrote one witness . " Miss Dix rode to the beach on horseback. as the last boat landed from the ill-fated vessel , and learned the sad fate of the commander .. She pled with the sailors to return to the wreck and bring him on shore , and to bind him if it was necessary .... They obeyed her summons , and soon were again on the beach , with their captain bound hand and foot . She loosened the cords ... and persuaded him to thank the sailors for saving his life . " The experience convinced Miss Dix that the station needed more modern surfboats . When she returned to the United States , she raised @#  | funds , and the station received two new boats . We climbed sand-clogged stairs of the staff house at Old Main Station , which recalled the house for shipwrecked sailors " that Grandfather had described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staterooms of a vessel . " But instead of bunks there were iron cots , rusty as the tools in the blacksmith shop . Stepping over a sandy doorsill , we entered the superintendent 's home and explored its deserted rooms . The bathroom was a period piece . Beneath an arbor of pipes stood an old tin bathtub ? elegant , uncomfortable . In other rooms heavy Victorian wallpaper peeled from he walls ; one room with an ornate floral pattern must have belonged to a woman . As we prowled , I thought of Robert Boutilier , the superintendent when my grandparents came here . Years later Mrs. Boutilier still corresponded with Grandmother . " Letters are visits of friends to us here , " she wrote . " We have had such a stormy , cold winter ... almost continuous gales from January  | until the wreck of Moravia a German liner carrying coconuts and wine .... I stand at the window to watch the foaming white mountains of surf . " When time was measured by shipwrecks , which of the sand-covered windows framed that view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family news : " I have only one daughter home with me this winter .... Bertha has always wished to take up the study of nursing ... I feel it is better for her as she needs more social life . " Her husband wrote to Grampy : " I am dreading having to attack 6 or 7 months back news . Of course , we are like those marooned , constantly watching for a steamer smoke and within the last fortnight all are out of tobacco , which to many of them is more serious than if out of beef .... All of my household are thankful for good health . " Yet he was tragically mistaken . Soon the Boutiliers would learn that their daughter Bertha , the student nurse , had died suddenly of typhoid fever on the mainland . " The hardest part to us , " wrote Mrs. Boutilier , " was that the steamer that brought to us the news of her death also brought her Christmas remembrances to the household and she had then been laid to rest nearly two months .

The tractor took us past the Bells ' house and then to the beach . We counted five large waves , and in our little pram returned to White Mist . Alec called Radio Sable to say thanks and goodbye . We hoisted sail , weighed anchor , and motored slowly to sea . Doug Harrington waved from the beach near the spot where the schooner Arno had died . A herd of ponies moved in single file across the dunes . Suddenly the green water paled , and I saw sand . . " Ten feet , " shouted Gil . " Cut the engine ? we 're running on a shoal ! " Was White Mist to be caught after all in the sucking sands of Sable ? Gently we coasted into deeper water ? and then I remembered that sand bar where we had first anchored coming in . Heading away from our dangerous landfall , we steered clear of the shoals anjl breakers off West Bar . Our fathometer recorded again the undulating ridges : deeper , shallower , deeper . And still Doug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a reminder that the only permanence on Sable Island is its loneliness . .
