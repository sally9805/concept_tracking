No epic has so thoroughly captured the imagination of men through the ages as blind Homer 's tale of the siege and sack of Troy . Yet many classical scholars and archaeologists have long suspected that the Iliad and the Odyssey are far more laudable as poetry than as history . The latest skepticism about the poet 's recounting of the Trojan War comes from a distinguished German classicist , Dr. Helmut Berve , who has spent most of his life studying ancient Greece . Disturbed by what he calls a " readiness to believe in the historical core behind all myths , especially in the Anglo-Saxon world , " Berve argues in a current series of lectures that this great war of antiquity never took place at all . <P> A Dozen Troys . Berve , of course , does not deny that a city named Troy once existed . Yet he maintains that none of the archaeological findings to date even remotely supports anything like the Homeric account of Helen 's abduction and the Greeks ' revenge . To begin with , says Berve , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann began digging into an 85-ft. - high mound called Hissarlik ( Turkish for palace ) in the northwestern corner of Turkey in 1870 , he decided that he had unearthed the remnants of Priam 's palace and the Trojan King 's treasure . <P> Schliemann 's hill was situated near two springs and a river , and he knew that Homer had written in the Iliad that , when the Greek warriors reached <P> Troy , they " came to the two fair-flowing springs , where two fountains rise that feed deep-eddying Skamandros . " As it happens , Berve notes , Schliemann 's excavations revealed not one Troy but a city that had been repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt over a period of more than a thousand years . <P> By now archaeologists have identified at least a dozen different layers within Schliemann 's hillside . None of these historic Troys , Berve savs , would in any way be familiar to the Iliad 's readers , except that they overlooked a plain near the Aegean Sea . In fact , the layer that most closely coincides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War ( circa 1200 B.C. ) , and that is known as Trov VI to archaeologists , seems entirely improbable as the battle site . Berve gives two reasons : 1 ) the fortifications enclose an area where no more than a few hundred people could have lived , whereas Homer said Trov had 50,000 inhabitants , and 2 ) Troy VI apparently was destroyed not by attackers but by an earthquake . <P> Berve exposes even more serious Achilles heels in Homer 's account . At the time of the war , Troy was a neighbor of the Hittite empire . Yet the Hittite royal archives , consisting of thousands of clay tablets discovered in central Turkey in 1907 , make no mention of a major campaign against the city . More damning perhaps is the absence of any reference to the war in ancient tablets found within Greece and written in the recently deciphered Linear B script . Berve points out , moreover , that only a few hundred years after Homer , the Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides were already Questioning his accuracy : their writings about Troy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be believed " and " there have been some exaggerations.
