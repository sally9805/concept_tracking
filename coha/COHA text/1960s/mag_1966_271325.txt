<P> Hatred of Jews and Judaism was something that medieval man learned not merely from sermons and books condemning deicide but from art as well . In a new book called The Medieval Jew in the Mirror of Christian Art , published in France by the Roman Catholic Augustinian friars , Bernhard Blumenkranz presents the first scholarly study of the way that Jews were portrayed and caricatured in the paintings , sculpture , frescoes and illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages . <P> Until the 12th century , pictorial references to Jews were generally neutral and even approving . But from roughly A.D. 1100 to 1500 , argues Blumenkranz , an Austrian Jew , Judaism was an object of hatred and scorn in Christian art . Mocking the Jews ' refusal to eat pork , a sculptured capital from a church in Uppsala , Sweden , depicts Jews drinking at the udders of a sow . Although the Gospels explicitly accuse Roman soldiers of bringing about Jesus ' death , some artists went out of their way to show Jews scourging him . <P> Blumenkranz attributes the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Jews , as unbelievers , were forbidden to serve . They were clearly set aside from the rest of Christendom , forced to live in ghettos , made to wear special clothing , confined to such shunned occupations as money-lending . What brought the era of anti-Semitic art to an end in the 16th century , Blumenkranz says , was the artistic sophistication of the Renaissance , with its emphasis on realism , and the Reformation . Once Catholics and Protestants began to fight one another , they had less interest in baiting Judaism .
