How the modern Minuteman guards the peace T he duty day begins innocently enough . Dennis Turk , a 24-year-old first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force , kisses his wife Peg good-bye , roughhouses briefly with 2 , , - year- old Dennis Jr , chucks the chin of six-week-old Kathleen Sue and leaves his small house in Great Falls , Montana , for M al mstrom Air Force Base , just outside town . In his hand the lieutenant carries a tan attache case that is the precise replica of those toted aboard commuter trains every morning by thousands of similarly bright , earnest young men . At squadron headquarters , Turk is briefed on his tour of duty . He tucks red-bound operational notes into his attache case , climbs aboard a truck and headsdeep into the Montana hinterlands . Eventually he is deposited in front of an isolated one-story building hunkered down forlornly on a windswept patch of ground surrounded by brown hills that roll on and on and on to the horizon . Inside the structure everything is serene  --  a pair of cooks whipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge complete with magazines and a TV set . Lieutenant Turk greets a sergeant , enters an elevator and begins to descend . But when he steps off the platform 50 feet below , Turk is in a new world just as strange as the wonderland Alice found at the bottom of the rabbit hole . An eight-ton steel-and-concrete door inches open . There , through a short tunnel , is a room 20 feet long and 10 feet wide . The walls are jammed with electronic equipment . Lights flash on two consoles . Telephones buzz . Occasionally , a bell clangs imperiously . Loudspeakers crackle fitfully , and tape recorders studiously take down every word . Missile of the future Lieutenant Turk has arrived at his combat post  --  the command capsule of a flight of 10 Minutemen , the nation 's newest intercontinental missile . In the months to come . Minuteman will go on the firing line at a steadily increasing rate until the Boeing Airplane Company , the assembling and installing contractor , will be readying more than one a day . Right now the Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Montana , North and South Dakota , Wyoming and Missouri . Minuteman 's range is more than 6,300 miles ; it is 4,432 miles from Lieutenant Turk 's capsule to the Kremlin . Cheap and sturdy , Minuteman will he the nation 's prime nuclear deterrent in a mixed force that includes the aging B-47 and B-52 bombers , the Atlas and Titan missiles , and the Navy 's Polaris submarine . All this is responsibility enough for Lieutenant Turk and his fellow officers in the 341st Strategic Missile Wing . But when the two men of a Minuteman team go into a capsule , they become comb .. t commanders unlike any in history . The officers sit in a room that is magnificently designed to ride out a nuclear attack  --  or induce claustrophobia . The capsule is encased in a cocoon of cement 42 inches thick . Not only is the room air-conditioned but it regenerates its own air . It has its own toilet , its own food supply and one bunk . To absorb the force of a nuclear blast , the floor is cushioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilts slightly when two men stand at one end . I f the electricity fails during an attack , the capsule has enough emergency power to stay in operation . Lieutenant Turk and his colleagues can not see , let alone touch , the missiles they arc prepared to lire . As a guarantee that some missiles will survive an attack , the Minutemen arc dispersed four or more miles from the command post in " silos " dug deep into the earth and protected by concrete and steel . The 341st Wing sprawls over 18,000 square miles of Montana . Some of the capsules are 140 miles from Malstrom ; their officers commute by helicopter . The Air Force calculates that the Russians would need to fire several missiles at any one Minuteman silo to assure the probability that one would score the near , near miss necessary to knock it out . The silos are marvels of automation . No human stands guard ; the job is done by four electronic sentries . A maze of locks and cunning devices further protect the silo . During the design stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types from the big safe-making companies to have a fling at cracking the silos . Every time someone pulled off the caper , the design was improved , To get in now , a saboteur would have to haul up enough explosive to blast off a four foot thick , 80-ton door , and this would probably destroy the missile itself , The Minuteman 's computer , which figures flight corrections , also periodically checks over the system , like a prudent motorist remembering his oil changes . If something goes amiss in the M inuteman 's innards , the system informs the duty officers by playing back a prerecorded tape that announces the general location of the trouble in the slow , slightly haughty tones of a teacher saddled with a dull pupil  --  for example , " Channel 23 , equipment cooling air . " Maintenance men then hustle out to correct the malfunction . Temperamental I iquid- f uc 1 missiles like the Air Force 's familiar Atlas and Titan require crews of five to fifteen men and lots of loving care . But the solid-fuel Minuteman sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a state of readiness which has minor psychological drawbacks for the crews . Says Lt. Col. George V. Leffler , commander of the 10th Strategic Missile Squadron , " The Minuteman is like getting a new car and not getting the keys . You ca n't drive it , You have no real sense of ownership . With a liquid missile , you can run it up out of the silo on the elevator , fuel it , go into the countdown . We ca n't touch a thing . " Right now the control officers are busy getting the inevitable bugs out of the first Minuteman . But before long the job will shake down into dull routine . What is more , the present 12-hour shifts will soon be extended to 24 and even 48 hours . For over half of their underground tours the officers would have nothing to do but brood and feet the tension build . If there is one spot the Air Force can not afford a bored and unstable officer , it is in front of a Minuteman console . " We needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler of SAC 's personnel branch . " But a hermit would not have the main characteristics we needed . " The job required a reliable , stable , intelligent officer who could be counted on to fire the Minuteman in the chaos of nuclear cornbat  --  and not before . But the more intelligent the man , the quicker he would be bored by capsule routine . As a start toward breaking the routine , the Air Force adopted a trick used by the French Foreign Legion to snap the monotony of garrison duty in the desert : formal military ceremonies to mark the changing of the guard . The Minuteman officers coming off duty turn over command of the capsule to the new crew in a drill that is carried out as smartly as if it were taking place on the parade ground instead of far underground . But there still remained the problem of those long and empty hours m front of the consoles . Gen. Thomas S. Power , SAC 's commander in chief , came up with the answer : Exploit the time by having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Minuteman officers , all with bachelor degrees in engineering , are working for their masters ' in aerospace engineering . They attend regular classes taught on the base by the Air Force 's Institute of Technology . Down in the capsule , they eventually will take turns poring over a calculus book and minding the missiles . To enter the Malmstrom program an officer 's college-grade average must be at least 2.5 , or between a C and B  --  a fact that ruled out even some candidates from the service academies . A man must be ranked in the top quarter of all officers of his grade by the Air Force 's complex evaluating system . He must be a regular or a career reservist . Theoretically every man is also a volunteer , but the Air Force is not above leaning heavily on someone it wants in the Minuteman program . As part of his physical exam , each officer talks to a psychiatrist . " There is no place in the nuclear-weapons program for the easily bored , impulsive , neurotic or psychotic individual , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almStrom must be approved by Col. Burton C. Andrus , commander of the 341st and a man who knows something about the standards of military duty . Andrus 's grandfather was a West Pointer who won the Silver Star in the Spanish-American War . His father was a colonel . Andrus got out of West Point in 1941 and piloted 34 combat missions in Italy . Andrus himself has attended the Air Force 's top schools , served a tour at West Point as a tactical officer and , most recently , turned the 96th Bomb Wing into one of SAC 's finest B-47 outfits . Andrus has had to rule out only four of the 179 or so officers assigned to the 341st . Once passed by Andrus , a Minuteman officer is kept under informal surveillance by his squadron commander for any sign of emotional instability . Each of the wing 's three squadrons has its own flight surgeon , who occasionally pulls tours in the capsule to look for hints of stress and special irritants in the routine . Besides having college degrees , about halt ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one third of the wing 's officers are graduates of the three service academies . Minuteman officers have backgrounds with no common denominator . Second Lt. Boyan N. Mishev , 25 , fled front Bulgaria with his family when he was 1I years old . Capt . Garrald Howland , 36 , served 10 years as an enlisted man and finally got his degree after a lot of night work at Oklahoma State . Capt . Philip ( " Pappy " .1 Papaccio , 27 , was determined to become an Annapolis football player until in practice one afternoon he made the mistake of relaxing on a play and was blocked from the side by Navy 's All-American end Ron Beagle . He landed in a wheelchair for three months . But Papaccio struggled back to his feel , graduated , joined the Air Force and found himself one of the pioneer operators or early ground-toground missiles . Now squadrons compete The Minuteman officers are a clannish group with a fighter squadron 's strong pride and spirit . In time , SAC 's merciless system of ranking corresponding units by pitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Minuteman squadrons . But right now the rivalry is still in the form of quips that are pretty far out from the usual brand of service humor . The standard taunt is " Our squadron leader can beat your squadron leader in calculus . " For the most part the men who control the nation 's deadliest missile system live as quietly as the junior executives in , say , Des Moines . If the bar at the Officers ' Club had to subsist on Minuteman officers , it would likely go broke . Nol only are the men conservative in their conviviality , but their job encourages sobriety . Says Lieutenant Turk , " God help the guy who is caught drinking in the 24 hours before going on duty . " The formal training of a Minuteman officer is brief  --  one month at Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois for basic theory , one month at Vandenberg in California for practical application . I Papaccio got a perfect score in each course . ) The technical routine may be no sweat , but the officers sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do during the first swift minutes at the start of a nuclear war . At MalmStrom the men constantly get surprise tests on what is known as the " Emergency War Order . " There is just one passing grade : 100 . If any man fails any question , Colonel Andrus must fly down to Offutt Air Force base outside Omaha and have a little talk with General Power . " 1 have n't made a trip yet , " says Andrus . " I do n't intend to make any . " The Minuteman officers operate an ingenious system of safety devices and measures designed to make certain that nothing and no one could ever fire a missile by mistake . The system was contrived by some of the best minds in the Air Force and Boeing , working under the direction of Brig . Gen , Samuel C. Phillips , 4 I , Minuteman 's project officer , who became the youngest officer of star rank in any service for his performance . No little black box can go pfffi and launch a nuclear attack on Moscow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-selling novel Foil-Sala by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler serialized last fall by The Post . The decision to launch a nuclear attack can be made only by the President of the United States . If that time ever comes , he will pick up a gold telephone that is always close at hand  --  a man with a radiophone accompanies him when he is traveling  --  and consult with the Joint Chiefs of Staff about which targets should be hit , which spared . A variety of attack plans were drawn up long ago to cover every contingency . Then another call on the gold telephone goes directly to the famed command post deep beneath the headquarters building at Offutt . There it is received by the senior duty controller , a full colonel who has been picked for the job and personally approved by General Power . The colonel quickly connects General Power into the system , and then the controller and one of his assistants monitor the call . It is automatically tape-recorded to provide a backup check . General Power is always within six rings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , airplane or golfcart . While General Power gets his instructions the controllers confirm that the call is valid , that it has come from an authorized source , that the correct but ever-changing authentication procedures were employed and that the order coincides with those previously approved . When these rapid checks are made and General Power is so advised , he will then order instructions to be relayed to SAC command posts worldwide . Power knows that his red telephone , " primary alerting system " puts him in instant contact with his far-flung command . The system is checked many times every 24 hours . " Without communications , " says General Power , " all I command is my desk , and that 's not a very lethal weapon . " The controllers prepare the proper coded message to order the attack . One controller picks up the red telephone . The other stands by his side . The controllers are mature professionals with years of Air Force experience . They have been carefully screened and handpicked for this job . Each is armed with a snub-nosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other is prepared to take whatever action is necessary to stop him , including pulling the trigger . In B-52 's and B-47 's circling over the Arctic and the Mediterranean , in the U.S. command posts of the Atlas and Titan , and in the capsules of the Minuteman , SAC officers hear the same message radioed from Offutt . First comes the warning warble  --  deede , deetle , deede . Then the voice of the colonel . " Skybolt , " he begins , " this is Dropkick . " In the Minuteman capsules , the message comes in over a loudspeaker . Al separate consoles the two officers copy down the battle plan , which is transcribed in a code that is changed in part every four hours . The message is spelled out in the Air Force 's phonetic alphabet  --  e.g. , alpha for a , bravo for b , charlie for r . To trained missile combat crews it tells exactly which of the wing 's missiles should be fired against its preplanned target . In each of the five capsules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . They check with one another to make sure that each arrived at precisely the same conclusion . After a moment , the senior officer in the squadron 's command capsule presses a button on his console marked AL ' - . Irnmediately , he is in touch with the four other capsules by phone . He checks to make sure that each capsule has arrived at the same message . If there is any conflict , the officers in the dissenting capsule request retransmission of the message from Omaha and go through the decoding again . SAC claims the code is so foolproof that the only chance for error is in copying it down . When agreement is reached , the capsule officers flip switches to " arm " the first stage of the Minuteman . Only then do the missiles come under capsule control . The rest of the time they are electrically isolated . No black-box failure or crossed wires could fire them . Then , in each capsule , the two men stand . Each reaches behind the blue or red scarf at the neck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain around his neck . The keys are slightly larger and have a few more knobs ti-an those which open their front doors . The key to holocaust Each man inserts his key into a lock . At the designated second , all the officers in the squadron turn their keys . A barrage of explosions rolls across the barren plains as the huge lids are blown off the silos . In just 32 seconds the Minutemen roar upward so swiftly that they escape the fiery vortex in the silo . Each Minuteman leaves hovering behind a single , giant smoke ring . This is what will happen if all five capsules are undamaged . But the hard assumption behind Minuteman is that some capsules will be knocked out by surprise attack . In that case , the four men in any two surviving capsules can fire the Minutemen . Finally there are classified procedures and equipment for launching surviving missiles with part or most of the squadron launch control centers destroyed . These operate with electronic interlocks and time delays to insure that they can be used only if normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the system . Each capsule officer has certain classified code material that the other does not . Each officer carries a .38 , which he will use if necessary to protect his secret documents from his teammate , or if the other officer suddenly goes amuck . But even if one man were to subdue the other , he still could not send a launch signal from the capsule . The keys have to be turned practically simultaneously , and the locks are about 13 feet apart . During training at Vandenberg , Minuteman officers regularly take up the challenge of trying to turn the two keys within that flicker of time . " It simply can not be done , " says Capt . Norman Frith . " You end up sprawled on the floor . " But even if , by some miracle , an acrobatic officer could make the distance in time he still would be helpless . Each lock contains a spring ; the key must be turned  --  and held . Nor is there any way that an officer could circumvent the keys and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads only a coded electronic impulse sent out by the keys turning in the locks . No one man knows what that signal is . It is calculated by a computer and installed in hits and pieces by several men . It is impossible for anyone to find out what the message is . Opening the case of the signal box automatically erases the code . As Minuteman gets more and more headlines , the control officers at MaImStrom detect signs that some people are worried about the safety of such a lethal weapons system controlled by so few men and so much automatic equipment . The implied criticism riles Capt . Gerald Putnam , 26 , a stocky pilot . " 1 resent people wondering , ' How can we keep those guys from launching those missiles accidentally ? ' Look , the Government paid for my entire education  --  Annapolis , then flying school , then advanced training . 1 started in the Academy in 1953 . Before I got my first alert as a copilot on a B-47 , before I was capable of going to war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If people ca n't trust us after all that work and expense , there 's something wrong somewhere . " Says Lieutenant Turk , " No one hates the idea of firing those missiles more than a SAC man , I can guarantee you that . " The Minuteman officers shrug off worries about the special pressures of their job . " It takes a lot more skill and experience and guts to get a B-47 over a target than a Minuteman , " says Captain Putnam . Nor are they worried about how their performance would be affected by the stark fact that an attack on the base might find them safely bunkered underground while their wives and children were dying on the surface . " There 's no question about the men 's reactions , " says Leffler , the father of seven . " We 'd have to stay below and tough it out . " The young Air Force engineers on sentry duty in the ground in Montana are acutely aware of the power at their fingertips . A single flight of 10 Minutemen has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during World War II  --  including the atomic weapons dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima . The Minuteman officers do not even have any nicknames for their system . Slang would cheapen their respect for the weapon . Most of the officers will quietly admit that they have spent sonic time thinking about just exactly what the power of Minuteman would do to millions of people in the homeland of an aggressor against the United Stales . But they do not stand in awe of the force , nor does it give them pause . They are professional military men with the job of delivering firepower in defense of the United States , whether the weapons are carried by a horse , dropped from a bomber , or thunder out of a hole in Montana . " I was a bombardier in Italy during the war , " says Lieutenant Colonel Leffler , " and every time I went down the bomb run in a lead flight of B-24 's and the indices began to close on the sight , the thought would flash through my mind , I hope Me cil.fflans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and children are out in the forest . But the job had to be done . The thought did n't affect my operation . And it 's the same way with Minuteman . If the President says , ' The nation is in danger , turn the key ' ? well , there goes the key . "
