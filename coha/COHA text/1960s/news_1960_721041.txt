The study group , known formally as the State Commission on Governmental Operations of the City of New York , is headed by Otto L. Nelson Jr . " Apart from expenses which can not be equated since many other communities provide secretarial and research services for their councilmen , " Mr. Stark said , " thirty cities in the United States pay salaries to their lawmakers that are as high or , in most instances , higher than New York City . " City Councilmen here have a basic salary of $7,000 , plus $3,000 each for contingent expenses . Cites Other Salaries Mr. Stark said Councilmen get $13,000 in Washington , D. C. , and $12,000 in Detroit , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Jersey City and Memphis .

It first went into a closed session of its committee of the whole , acrd then  --  with Mr. Isaacs absenting himself  --  delegated five members who drew up a 500-word statement issued as a press release .

He contraste their $525,000 appropriation fa their first year with an annul expense of $460,000 for the Cit Council , its staff and all it services . Noting that Mr. Nelson re sides in New Jersey , Mr. Ros observed : " I wonder If he 's the kind o fellow who pays sales tax b New York or has stuff mallet home ? " Report Is Praised The Nelson report got its firs kind words from any of tin city 's top officials yesterdal when Borough President Join T.

However , he asserted that other commission statements appeared to favor ultra-centralization of the city 's government . " " In the light of the shortchanging Queens has received over the years in terms of mu nicipal services even with direct representation on the Board of Estimate , can we depend on an ultra-centralized government to do better ? " Mr. Clancy asked . Another Borough President , James J. Lyons Of the Bronx , brushed off Nelson criticisms of borough political machines . " I do n't agree , " he said . " It 's a political document . " Councilman Isaacs said he agreed with the Nelson Commission that the present city administration " exhibits neither the willingness nor the capacity to initiate or carry out essential changes . " Mr. Isaacs hailed some of the fiscal proposals as " literally elementary .

Replying to the various criticisms , Mr. Nelson said yesterday lie saw " no useful purpose to be served in further disputes that seek to emphasize quibbling , disagreement and controversy . " He urged city officials to study the report , and renewed an offer of assistance from the commission and its staff .
