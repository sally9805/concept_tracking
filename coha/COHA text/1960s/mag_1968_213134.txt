By classic Hollywood thinking , the formula should be absolutely infallible : if one kid is cute , it follows that 18 kids have to be 18 times cuter . The new math of Yours , Mine and Ours proves nearly the opposite . <P> A Navy officer ( Henry Fonda ) , who has recently lost his wife , returns to shore duty to take care of his ten momless moppets . Trying to run a family like a taut ship , he first finds the kids mutinous-just like Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music . But then , shopping at a supermarket , he runs into an attractive widow ( Lucille Ball ) . She too is a casualty of-and contributor to-the population explosion , with eight unmanageable offspring of her own . <P> After a short courtship , the bereaved merge forces , causing the predictable problems : lineups for the bathroom , family jealousies , identity crises when her kids have to change their last names to match their new stepfather 's . Just as predictably , in the final footage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . <P> Overweight and festooned with stale situations and weary wisecracks , Yours , Mine and Ours relies for its levity on two unassailable assets : Fonda and Ball . At 62 , Fonda can still leave a line wry and dry . At 56 , Ball commands a solid slapstick style that none of her younger rivals can match . Her squint-eyed search for a false eyelash that has managed to wander to her forehead , for example , is converted into the kind of classic comedy chase that has been absent from films for too long . And they are ably backed by a surprisingly supple comedian named Van Johnson , who seems to be searching for-and finding -a new turn to his long career . Together , the old pros take the surplus corn and , like the manufacturers of all that breakfast food they buy , turn it into something with snap , crackle and popularity .
