When the National Hockey League created a new division made up of six expansion teams last season , cynical fans talked of the " dogmeat wing " or the " humpty loop . " The derisive epithets disappeared when the upstart St. Louis Blues won the West Division playoffs , then forced the vaunted Montreal Canadiens into two overtime games before losing the Stanley Cup . St. Louis rooters can document to the day the start of their team 's surge . It was the moment the Blues first saw Red . <P> Seven weeks into their first season , the Blues were last in their division and badly in need of some offensive punch . Coach Scotty Bowman made some quick trades and acquired Gordon ( " Red " ) Berenson , a bench warmer for the New York Rangers . Berenson , 29 , the son of a Regina , Sask. , fireman , had all the makings of a top scorer . He learned his swift and violent trade as a boy , skating on the frozen ponds of his home town , but like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a dent in the talent-heavy NHL . As a teenager , he turned down several pro offers in order to earn a degree in business at the University of Michigan , where he was an All-America hockey player . Belatedly he joined the pros in 1962 and spent the next seven years on the fringes of the big time-never quite making the first team of the Canadiens or the Rangers , " I 've known many fellows who had great potential , " he says , " but they were just never given the chance to develop . " <P> Every Move . The trade to the Blues was the chance Berenson needed . He came out of cold storage and turned into a fireball , scoring 24 goals and 30 assists to become the division 's most valuable player . This season " the Red Baron , " as the St. Louis followers have dubbed the 6 ft. , 190 lb. center , is still going strong and , as a result , so are the Blues . They are a runaway leader in the West Division ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable 5 wins , 9 losses and 6 ties against the veterans of the East . They lead both divisions in defense , having allowed opponents a miserly average of only 2.07 goals a game . That distinction is largely due to Old Pro Goalies Glenn Hall , 37 , and Jacques Plante , 39 . <P> As for offense the Blues have Berenson . Both Hall and Plante agree that he is well on his way to becoming the league 's newest and most exciting superstar . Says Hall : " Red 's got every move in the book and then some . He 's big . He skates like an express train , and he shoots as hard as anyone in the league , including Bobby Hull . " <P> Premature Gesture . Last week Berenson received the largest number of votes in his division for the N.H.L. 's first East-West All-Star Game on Jan. 21 . Though he is leading the division in scoring , he rated the honor simply on the basis of one remarkable performance against the Philadelphia Flyers earlier this season . After scoring one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second period to turn a hat trick for the first time in his N.H.L. career . " I dove into the net for that puck to save it as a memento , " he recalls . As it happened , it was a slightly premature gesture . In the remaining minutes , Red slammed home three more goals to become the first N.H.L. player in 24 years to score six times in a single game .
