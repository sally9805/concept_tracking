The Irregular Verb to Love , by Hugh and Margaret Williams , raises the curtain on a new Broadway season , but the play is haunted by the tired ghosts of seasons past . To Love is still another family comedy , the sempiternal soap opera of the theater . This time , the family is British , part tea cozy and part zany . Mama ( Claudette Colbert ) , a one-woman S.P.C.A. who identifies with small fur-bearing animals , has just done an eight-month stretch in jail for blowing up two fur shops with homemade bombs . Daughter is going to have an illegitimate child by an accountant who apparently lacks the caution proper to his vocation . Son is a bearded off-beatnik novelist who has brought home to London a monolingual Greek gamine first encountered in a Sardinian hay stack . Like son , like father . During Mama 's absence , Papa ( Cyril Ritchard ) has had his own affair with a divorcee . " The moment my back is turned , " says Mama reproachfully . " Your back was n't turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken away . " <P> Unfortunately , the Williamses flourish the needle of humor without jabbing it into any rich vein of comedy . An artificial drawing-room comedy can nurture an earthy home truth . But To Love spouts more poppycock about the parent-child relationship and child rearing than has been heard since Bertrand Russell ran a school where boys and girls played together in the nude . Elegantly gowned by Parisian couturiers , Claudette Colbert , who seems to have a dimple in her voice , whips herself into an understandable motherly and wifely froth . As the son , Robert Drivas is a personable rebel . The evening belongs to Cyril Ritchard , who could get laughs by reading an income tax form . If To Love had his high style , it would be to the comedy-of-manners born .
