txt Administration forces in the Senate won an opening skirmish with opponents of a $3.3 billion foreign aid appropriation today . The victory followed a new warning by President Johnson that cutting the bill would be " false economy , " The minor Administration success came on a 60-23 vote rejecting an amendment by Senator Wayne Morse , Democrat of Oregon . His proposal would have stricken a $50 million contribution to the Inter-American Development Bank from which " soft currency " loans would be made . A " soft " currency is one whose value fluctuates sharply in relation to the dollar or other stable currencies and whose par value therefore does not reflect its real worth as foreign exchange . Aid to Panama Attacked Meanwhile , a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee made public a scathing attack on the United States aid program in the Republic of Panama . It was sharply critical of all aspects of the program  --  housing , roads and school construction . The President 's warning , dated yesterday , was addressed to Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid money bill . It was read to the Senate by Senator John 0 . Pastore , Democrat of Rhode Island , who is floor manager of the measure . Although used by Senator Pastore as an argument for the committee 's $3.3 billion recommendation , the President 's letter asked for " the maximum appropriation authorized , " or $3.6 billion , He said the need for a major foreign aid effort " remains and can not be escaped . " He added : " It would be false economy to cut funds which are needed for our own security and future well-being . " $500 Million Repitored The committee 's response to the President 's appeal was to restore $500 million of the $800 million cut by the House below the authorizing legislation , Senator Morse , who led the liberals ' revolt against the authorization bill brought out by the Foreign Relations Committee , promptly rejected the President 's appeal , " He advocates for the time being a continuation of the shocking waste of the foreign aid program , " Senator Morse declared . Earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 of Senate consideration of a separate authorizing bill for the Inter- American Development Bank item . The item was placed in the foreign aid money bill subject to enactment of the authorizing measure later on . Called ' Sloppy ' Legislating But Senator Morse said this was " a sloppy way to legislate . " He offered his proposal to strike the item and was told in a sharp exchange with Senator Pastore that his scheme would " disrupt " the leadership 's effort to pass a money bill before the scheduled Congressional adjournment on Friday . Senator Morse 's proposal was not listed among a series of amendments he planned in an effort to cut the Senate 's foreign aid appropriation back to the House-passed level of $2.8 billion . The Senator said that , if successful in this attempt , he would try to hammer down the amount , by more amendments , to $2.5 billion . Before the debate got under way today the Senate minority leader , Everett Dirksen , raised the possibility of a more serious threat than Senator Morse to passage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from highly reliable House sources , Senator Dirksen said , that if the Senate deleted the House ban on Federal underwriting of credit for sales of grain to Communist countries , " there will not be any appropriation bill at this session . " The House adopted the rerestriction , 218-169 . Senator Dirksen said he had been informed that a more recent " nose count " showed a majority of members were prepared to insist on the ban if negotiators came back from a Senate-House conference without it . The Republican leader said he thought the Senate would cut the $3.3 billion money bill by about $100 million and end with a compromise appropriation of $3 billion after a conference with the House . As for the threatened House rebellion over the Communist credit ban , he said the House might well change its mind " when we come within the shadow of the Christmas tree . " At an impromptu White House news conference today , Mr. Johnson sought to put the best possible face on whatever compromise aid figure was reached by the House and Senate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate committee had been " very con-1 structive and very helpful . " To a question whether the Administration could " live with " the Senate figure Question 16 , Page 161 , the President replied : This was in marked contrast to his statement Saturday condemning the 2.8 billion bill recommended by the House Appropriations Committee . He said then that the figure would " require the United States to follow policies of weakness and retreat " and would constitute " a severe setback to American leadership . " In his letter to Senator Hayden , the President spoke of the " necessity for improving the efficiency of , our aid program ? of requiring more selfhelp from aid recipients , trimming excess staff and of taking other measures needed to accomplish the results we seek at mimimum cost . " The President said he was " fully in accord " with the Congressional view that other advanced nations should be urged to provide more aid for underdeveloped countries and pledged " to continue and strengthen our efforts in this direction . " Whether accidentally or by design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in his news conference remarks about the House ban on Federal underwriting for credit sales to Communist countries . The Senate committee struck it from its money bill but was also silent on that point in its report on the bill today . Whatever happens to the money bill , however , it was entirely clear that the nature and scope of the foreign-aid program next year has already been shaped by political necessity . This has been clear to foreignaid officials for months . This does not mean that Mr. Johnson or anyone else has ordered air overhaul of the program . In fact , the only orders received by the foreign aid director , David E. Bell , were the same as the President sent to all agency and department heads urging a tighter budget in the next fiscal year . It does mean a smaller program of foreign aid in the future and appropriation requests next year of probably no more than $3.5 billion .
