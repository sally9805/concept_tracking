Gay Purree , an 86-minute UPAnimated cattoon , is all about Mademoiselle Mewsette , a pretty little kitty who has never seen the city . In her catnaps she dreams of the Felines Bergre , the Place Catalle and the Mewlin Rouge , so one day she departs for Purree in pussuit of happiness . Her boy friend , a hair-trigger mouser called Jaune Tom , hurries off to Paris as soon as he gets the bad mews , but he arrives too late to avert catastrophe : Mewsette has al ready fallen in with Meowrice Percy Beaucoup , a sinister alle cat who has designs on her chatstet . As for Jaune Tom , what happens to him in the big city should n't happen to a dog , but in the end the hero hangs a mouse on the villain , and everything comes up catnip . <P> UPA 's art work often suggests stale Disney sprinkled with Kitty Litter , but at one point the picture wittily displays Mewsette as she might have been painted by Monet , Van Gogh , Seurat et al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchantingly . And even those who think that the plot is a very old sardine may admit that it is often amewsing , in a clever script by Dorothy and Chuck Jones , to read between the felines.
