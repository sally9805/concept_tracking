( See Cover ) <P> Slowly , with dignity , dapper little Mongi Slim of Tunisia walked up the seven steps to the green marble rostrum and took his seat as president of the United Nations ' 16th General Assembly . Before him were the diplomats who had elected him , a motley crowd of delegates from every corner of the world . " It is hard for me to express the great grief I experience , " said President Slim , speaking in French . " The Secretary-General of the United Nations fell a victim to his duty . He died , one might say , on the battlefield of peace . " <P> At these words , , the eyes of the listening delegates flickered to the place on Mongi Slim 's right-Dag Hammarskjold 's empty chair . <P> Once again the delegates had come to the U.N . with a dizzying assortment of problems and causes , ranging from nuclear tests and Red China 's demand for recognition , to apartheid , Algerian freedom , South Tyrol terrorism and the future of Ruanda-Urundi . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N . ' s desks , whether there was any real prospect of solution or not . But all the possible agenda items seemed to fade beside the loss of Dag Hammarskjold . Every delegate knew that the whole future of the U.N . as a meaningful force for peace was in jeopardy . The U.N . now might well again become what it was all too often before the Hammarskjold era-a glass-and-steel soapbox . <P> Big &; Little Hope . The U.N . was founded 16 years ago amid great expectations that were based on large hope but little reality . There was among the earnest founders at the San Francisco conference no common law , no common principle , no common view of man or the world-only a ritualistic insistence that mankind must have some sort of security from war. * After years of worldwide incantations about support for the U.N . and worldwide disillusionment with its performance , Dag Hammarskjold did one thing-he reduced the great but impossible hope of U.N . as the molder of world peace to the small but possible hope of U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively minor trouble areas where the interests of the great nations were not directly involved . <P> Hammarskjold pushed that hope to its limits , and perhaps beyond , in the Congo . It is likely that , had he lived , his effectiveness as Secretary-General might have been near its end , anyway . The fact remains that as the exponent of the limited hope he had performed great service , the best measure of which was that the Russians had vowed to destroy him and his office ever since last year when he moved U.N . troops into the chaotic Congo , thus preventing a Moscow-run regime . A favorite motto of his was a quotation from Shelley 's Prometheus Unbound ; one should , he said , <P> ... hope till Hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates . <P> Last week even the limited U.N . hope was close to being wrecked ; and the U.S. , which lately has relied heavily , perhaps too heavily , on the U.N. , stood committed to save what it could of the wreckage . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N .
