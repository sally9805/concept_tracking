Along the most traveled international tourist and business routes the local scenery these days almost always includes the glass-and-steel presence of an American-type and American-run luxury hotel . The popping of champagne corks in celebration of another gala opening almost drowns out the noise of cranes putting up another hotel on the choice site next door . <P> Hilton Hotels International , which already operates 13 hotels in 11 foreign countries , will open up a new 30-story , $22 million London Hilton in a fortnight .

Some of the biggest cities of Europe-London , Paris , Rome-were underbuilt , and though the hotel service is often better than in the U.S. , the furnishings are often shabby and the bills padded by extra service charges and taxes . Opening in June , the 400-room Cavalieri Hilton , stretching across Rome 's highest hill , Monte Mrio , will be the city 's first new de luxe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel site at Orly airport outside Paris , and another near the Eiffel Tower . <P> As the advancing tourist flood spills over into Greece , the Middle East and across Asia , the first postwar hotel boom is being followed by another .

Intercontinental is building near Jerusalem 's Mount of Olives on the Arab side , overlooking the old city . The Egyptian government last year launched a five-year plan to build 40 hotels .

New hotels are under way or planned in such once remote spots as Kuala Lumpur , Karachi , Sardinia , Bangkok , Manila , Alexandria and Aswan . <P> In most of these ventures . U.S. hotel chains invest little money themselves . Except for recent deals in The Netherlands and Rome , Hilton owns no share at all .
