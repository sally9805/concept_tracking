txt WASHINGTON , Aug. ** impending contest between Senator Kenneth B. Keating of New York and Robert ? F. Kennedy , soon to be ' of New York , seems certain to pre ... , sent an interesting study in contrasts . Senator ' Keating is 64 years old , white-haired , ruddy of ? complexion and inclined to be a ' little stocky . Mr. Kennedy - is 38 , boyish and slender , with a shock of sandy hair reminiscent of his late brother 's unruly forelock . Over the last 18 years , Senator Keating has won seven elections , six for the House and one for the Senate , and has ? never been defeated . In his 13 years in public life , Mr. Ken nedy has never run for office himself although he has ex. - tensive experience as a cam-. paign manager . ' Senator Keating has lived in New York State all his life and has been campaigning for re . election through its cities and . : . villages for ? nearly six years now , ever since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too close far comfort . Mr. Kennedy , although he has lived in New York City at various times , has his legal residence in Massachusetts and his home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington . And yet , despite all these sharp contrasts between the two men , many observers now believe that their competition for the Senate will reveal few : - basic differences in principle between the candidates . Senator Keating has firmly ensconced himself in the liberal wing of the Republican party , , a position that is sometimes difficult for the politically un ? initiated to distinguish from the liberal wing of the Demo ? cratic party . Mr , Kennedy can safely be ? expected to ' run , implicitly if not explicitly , on the philosophy and programs of the New Frontier advanced by his late brother . This Is not likely to place him in serious conflict with his Republican opponent ove. many issues . For example , it appears re-. mote indeed that any civil rights issue will be involved directly in the New York Senate campaign . Frnm their past statements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ; : the question of , equal opportunity and the Government 's re  --  sponsibility . to insure There is at least some pos  --  sibility , however , that Senator  - -  Keating might fall heir to sup  --  port from white voters who fear the advent of Negroes in - their schools , their neighbor- , hoods and their society ; such voting would probably be more of a protest against Mr. Kennedy 's role in the civil rights , , . struggle as Attorney General than an endorsement of Mr. ' ' ' ' Keating . ' ' . ' White Backlash ' Mr. Keating said when he announced his candidacy this ? - week that he wanted no part of any such " white backlash " votes , but this may not sway those who are anxious to regis ? ter a protest at the falls . - With the campaign not even officically under Way ? nominations win be made on Aug. and Sept. 1 ? the major issue other than the personalities of the two contenders seems likely to be the Republican argument that Mr. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York purely to advance his own political - interests . Although it is not the easiest  - -  issue in politics to explain , Mr. KeMiedy may be able to ' get some mileage out of reapportionment . As Attorney General , he threw the weight of the Justice Department behind the " one man , one vote " concept adopted by the Supreme Court that will require considerable redrafting of legislative district lines . Senator Keating may be caught in the middle on the issue . Most New York Republicans have opposed legislative reapportionment in the state ; it would almost certainly weaken their party 's hold on the Legislature . But the Democrats and independents to whom Mr. Keating must look , for support are inclined to favor reapportionment . Public Sympathy ? Purely as a matter of figures , Mr. Kennedy would seem to enjoy a distinct advantage . The registration of the Democratic and Liberal parties combined exceeds t4 number of ' enrolled Republicans by about 500,000 . A ' Conservative party candidate could drain off 150,000 votes that would otherwise be Republican . But such figures are deceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1960 by 385,000 votes , Nelson Rockefeller swept in by more than 500,000 votes in both 1958 and 1962 and his Republican running mate the latter year , Senator Jacob K. Javits , ran up a margin of nearly a ? mitten votes . As a liberal Republican , Senator Keating can reasonably expect to attract a'good share of these Rockefeller -- Javits supporters . But the key question is how much the presence of a conservative , Senator Barry , Goldwater , at the top of the ticket is likely to discourage such a voting trend . . . Mr. Kennedy faces two related questions : Can he profit from the strength that most observers . now : expect Lyndon Johnson , to , , show , in j  --  lew . YorkState , ' and . ' Will 1. / , 1 : be able to recapture the large . nihn. tem of otherwise Republican voters of the Roman CathOlie-fatth who supported his brother four years ago ? Mr. Kennedy 's chief asset as he goes into the campaign is the close public association between himself and his brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assassination for all the Kennedy family , which is clearly not yet spent . Senator Keating 's strongest points are his familiarity with the state , his liberal record and , perhaps critically , the fact that he will offer an acceptable alternative to almost any voter except a rabid conservative who is dismayed or disturbed by Mr. Kennedy 's candidacy . One question still unresolved is whether the two Senate candidates will present a marked contrast as campaigners . Mr. Keating is a skilled professional of the hand-shaking , sidewalktour school . He reads speech texts well and has earned a reputation as a political wit . Mr. Kennedy , on the other hand , tends to be painfully shy , with almost a plaintive quality , in public . He is , not inclined . to be comfortable reading a printed speech ' text , but he can project a sympathetic intensity extemporaneously when he speaks for a cause in which he believes .
