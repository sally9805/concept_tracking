THE LOOKING GLASS WAR by John le Carr . 320 pages . Coward-McCann. $4.95 . <P> On a hillside overlooking East Germany , the men who have molded the spy , a Pole named Leiser , silently shake his hand . They have come thus far together . Now he must go on alone . " There were no fine words , " writes Author Le Carr , his eye fixed on the solitary figure going down the hill into the obliterating night shadows . " It was as if they had all taken leave of Leiser long ago . " <P> This is Le Carr 's dark point , struck like a funeral bell on nearly every page of this book . Leiser is doomed . He descends the hill to foreordained failure in his mission , sensing that those whom he wants to trust will , if it comes to that , abandon him . He has all the significance of a pawn , played and sacrificed in a game that itself has no meaning . <P> Out of the Cold . After The Spy Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank of writers liberated from considerations of market , Le Carr admitted that his real name was David Cornwell , his real profession the British Foreign Service , and came out of the cold himself by quitting his job to set up as a full-time writer . He also announced that he had one more espionage story in him and that that one would be his last . This is apparently it , and its thesis must be accepted as Le Carr 's terminal conviction , at least on the art of spying . <P> Spy was successful in part because it was almost the exact antithesis of James Bond . Alec Leamas is more than a spy . He is aging and tired , skilled but fallible . Le Carr took infinite literary pains to limn him as an ordinary mortal , susceptible to mundane pressures , capable of cynicism about his craft , who in the end elects to rejoin the society that he never quite left . <P> Rusty Skills . In contrast , The Looking Glass War is totally dehumanized . Leamas is believable ; Leiser is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Leiser 's spying mission to East Germany as on the efforts of a scorned and inferior arm of British intelligence ( " the Department " ) to haul itself back into the Establishmentarian swim on Leiser 's shoulders . With a typically British mixture of ineptness and guile , the seven men who still operate the Department in the drab house on Blackfriars ' Road , jostle for position , portentously con " the Minister " for a bigger budget , extra limousines , higher status . And on Cambridge Circus , another and superior division of British intelligence cynically sees the whole exercise as a chance to get rid of an inferior nuisance . " The Circus " provides only obsolete equipment and minimum cooperation . The Department men compound this by blunder after blunder . Leiser himself , who at 40 is really too old for the business , is only too pathetically eager to savor again the exhilaration he felt as a British agent during the war . There is something almost perverse about his zeal for the mission . And his skills are so rusty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are mystified by what they think , at first , must be the handiwork of an amateur .
