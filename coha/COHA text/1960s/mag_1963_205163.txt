The night was cold , the sidewalks icy , but the unconcerned couple and their German shepherd pet strolled on . Other pedestrians , their faces buried in their coats , paid them little heed . How could they have known that Jack . Jackie and Clipper would be out walking the streets near 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ? <P> President Kennedy last week gave a relaxed impression . His Cuba policies were still under fire , and what to do about accommodating or getting around the bulky presence of Charles de Gaulle affected everything from the Common Market to NATO and nukes . But Kennedy moved cautiously and patiently , as if he had decided that there was nothing to be gained by haste . <P> Just Some Meetings . The President 's top security advisers slipped into side gates at the White House , veered away from reporters and convened behind closed doors . On three successive days they discussed Europe 's problems and their relation to the U.S. Emphasizing the prevailing informality . Presidential Press Secretary Pierre Salinger bridled at any suggestion that the meetings could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Security Council . " Just a series of meetings . " insisted Pierre . <P> The list of conferees was impressive : U.S. Ambassadors David Bruce ( to Britain ) , Walter Dowling ( West Germany ) , Foy Kohler ( U.S.S.R. ) . Secretary of State Dean Rusk , Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson , Special Trade Envoy Christian Herter . Vice President Lyndon Johnson . Whatever the tenor of their conversations . Kennedy indicated at a press conference that he was not planning any drastic new U.S. action to patch up the alliance . <P> Life &; Death . " I think that we have to realize that we are going to have disagreements , " he said , as if trying to calm an unruly classroom full of impatient newsmen . " They go to the heart of the alliance and the purposes of the alliance . They all involve the security of the U.S. , and those questions which involve disagreements on the atom are very important questions and there are bound to be differences of opinion . And there should be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense , he argued , such arguments among allies indicate that things are getting better . " There is n't as much of an overt Soviet military threat to Berlin now as there was some months ago . Whatever success we may have had in reducing the threat , of course , we pay for by increased problems within the alliance . But if the threat comes again , the alliance will join together . For the period now , we are enjoying the luxury of internal dissension . " <P> As to whose finger , or how many hands will control the multinational nuclear force that the U.S. is now advocating for Europe , that too just needs working out . " It is a very difficult area because the weapons have to be fired in five minutes , and who is going to be delegated on behalf of Europe to make this judgment ? If it is n't the President of the U.S. , it will have to be the President of France or the Prime Minister of Britain or someone else . There is no answer which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We feel that , however , with what we now have and what we are ready to propose , carrying out the Nassau proposal , that additional assurances can be given which we believe-which we hope-will satisfy the Europeans .
