PUBLIC DECENCY <P> Man may insist on being what Carlyle called the only " clothed animal , " but defining " public decency " is among the law 's most hopeless chores . Thus in Caracas last summer , a clever cop arrested a topless-bathing-suit wearer simply for not carrying identification papers . But in Cannes , another cop could think of no such evasive tactic when he spotted Claudine Durand , 21 , on the beach . Barebreasted , the pretty Parisian gym teacher was playing pingpong before fascinated spectators . <P> Claudine was charged with " an outrage to public decency , " which carries a rap of up to two years in jail . The publicity-seeking beach concessionaire , who had paid Claudine $7 to bisect her bikini , was also haled into court . Their lawyer argued that the law defines the " outrage to decency " crime as " exhibiting one 's sexual parts or making obscene or lascivious gestures . " He called Claudine innocent on both counts .

Not satisfied , France 's top law journals tore the decision apart . Calling the law " most imprecise , " Strasbourg University Law Professor Alfred Rieg said that it fails to require crucial proof that " an act has been capable of causing a scandal . " At this stage of changing mores , he added , " one can not seriously claim that the nudity of a feminine bosom on a beach is of a nature to offend the decency of those who see it . " <P> <P> All this so impressed the Appellate Court in Aix-en-Provence that it re versed the convictions . " Inasmuch as the spectacle of the nudity of the human body has nothing intrinsic in it that would outrage normal , even delicate decency , and since Claudine Durand concealed her sexual parts with a sufficiently opaque monokini , we acquit her .
