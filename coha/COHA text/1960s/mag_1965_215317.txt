" Pursued by " vague shadows of insanity , " he returns to Italy seeking " a sense of reality " and " authentic relationships with people . " <P> Poor Bernardo . Neither he nor the reader will find reality in this novel , and there are no authentic people at all . The absences are startling . In Venetian Red ( 1960 ) , an intricate and fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Author Pier-Maria Pasinetti proved himself a formidable 1 fabricator of character and incident , mood and meaning . In this novel , a sequel that brings the Venetian families up to date , Pasinetti gets bored with his story and starts setting off technical fireworks . When the smoke clears , Bernardo has experienced a verbal rerun of La Dolce Vita , while the reader has gained only a stiff neck and some spots before his eyes . <P> While it lasts , it 's a spectacular show of style .
