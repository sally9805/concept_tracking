President Eisenhower has steadfastly preferred to call the current economic situation a " readjustment , " but John Kennedy has already declared it to be a " recession . " If recession it is , Kennedy will suffer from no lack of advice on how to cure it , for he is surrounding himself with a luminous little galaxy of economists from the " activist " school that believes in blunt talk , Government-inspired growth rates , and far-out federal measures to prime the pump . Last week the advice was raining down to the steady beat of one theme : more Government spending , conspicuously including deficit spending . <P> National Warning . At Kennedy 's request , a task force of economists headed by M.I.T. Professor Paul Samuelson , one of Kennedy 's most trusted counselors , delivered a thick report which warned that 1 ) the slump is bad , and 2 ) it could very easily grow worse , with unemployment topping the post-World War II peak of 7% Among other things , it urged fat federal unemployment subsidies to guarantee every jobless worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big Government spending programs for health , welfare , urban renewal , school buildings and teachers ' salaries ; more construction of highways , post offices , military bases , etc . Cost : " $3 billion to $5 billion . " <P> Yet on top of this cake was some frosting that would appeal to many a businessman . Samuelson recommended that if business worsens and it becomes necessary to open a " second line of defense , " Congress should rev up consumer spending by cutting personal income tax rates by three or four percentage points for one and all through the end of 1961 , and by giving power to the President to extend the reduction through the end of 1962 . Bucking the liberals ' demands for easier money , Samuelson held firm against broadly lower interest rates ( but urged a 4% maximum on mortgages to stimulate housing ) , lest even more gold flow out to countries where rates are attractively high . With that said , he did a reverse on Eisenhower Administration monetary policy , which is disciplined by the realities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinkable that a responsible Administration can give up its militant efforts toward domestic recovery because of the limitations imposed on it by the inter national situation . " <P> Kennedy was deeply impressed by the report , viewed it as a fundamental document on broad economic policy for the early stages of his Administration . One line in particular caught his eye : " He misreads the role of confidence in economic life who thinks that denying the obvious will cure the ailments of a modern economy . " Kennedy studied it , looked up from the report and told Samuelson , <P> " That 's well put . "
