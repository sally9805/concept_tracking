NEWSPAPERS Many a metropolitan newspaper has tried to cope weith surburban sprawl rom downtown by slipping surburban supplements into regular editions and shipping them to outlying communitties . The Los Angeles Times was one newspaper following the practice , usuing many " zoned " editions to serve some 76 towns in the surrounding suburbs . Times Publisher Otis Chandler watched the process with growing dissatisfaction , then decided that the only solution is for a newspaper to grow the way a modern city-community grows . <P> In Los Angeles ' case , as in many others , the growth is producing an ever-expanding circle of satellite towns , with citizens showing an increased interest in local affairs . To give them the local news they want , Chandler decided there was no substitute for being on the spot . The result appeared last week : the Orange County edition , edited , printed and partly written by a 32-man Times satellite staff operating entirely* in Orange County . <P> Deserved Prominence . Orange County provides a fertile testing ground for the new , independent edition . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons a week in 1967 and its population now stands at 1,290,000 , more than that of Buffalo , Denver , Atlanta or Kansas City . Within its borders are two self-contained industrial cities , Anaheim and Santa Ana , with a combined population of 304,000 . The University of California has opened an Orange County campus at Irvine . The Aeronutronic Division of Philco-Ford and Hunt Foods &; Industries are located within the county , and North American Rockwell has principal plants there as well . <P> In daily operation , the Times 's four downtown-news sections are trucked in mat form or transmitted by computer-typesetter to the suburban edition 's new $7 000,000 plant in Costa Mesa . There , Managing Editor Ted Weegar , former assistant managing editor of the metropolitan edition , tears the pages apart and remakes them as he sees fit . Orange County stories are scattered throughout the entire newspaper . National and world news can be replaced on page 1 and in the rest of the first section , but only if an Orange County story deserves the prominence . No attempt will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of the newspaper for mere appearance 's sake . On page 2 , a one-column daily summary of " Metropolitan " news contains " Or ange County " items instead . <P> The second section of the paper-containing editorials , features and local news stories in the downtown edition-gets even more attention from the Orange County staff . In the first issue last week , an editorial about Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty 's budget was replaced by a we're-glad-to-be-here editorial in the Orange County edition . Two pages of less important local news stories were added , along with two more pages of Orange County classified advertising . The sports section carried stories on a scandal involving athlete-recruiting in Orange County high schools and Amigos ' ( of speculation the about American the Basketball Anaheim Association ) moving their playing head quarters to a new arena .
