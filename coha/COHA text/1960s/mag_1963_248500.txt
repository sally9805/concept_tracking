" A great party , " cried Viscount Hailsham on TV last week , " is not to be brought down by a woman of easy virtue ! " But the possibility was real enough . <P> In the House of Commons this week , Prime Minister Harold Macmillan would have to confront criticism from the Laborites , plus some barely suppressed dissent in his own party , of the way in which he handled , or mishandled , the Profumo scandal . In the long run , the Tories faced an even more elusive and insidious threat than parliamentary attacks-the facts in police dossiers and in the private lives of people who personify Conservative rule . <P> A Lie in the Nude . The week leading up to the debate in the Commons consisted mostly of talk-but what talk . Christine Keeler , the cause of it all , was strangely irrepressible and outwardly serene amid the tumbling of facades and the crash of reputations . Blossoming forth in ever more dazzling photographs , she became Britain 's fastest-rising fallen woman . She was besieged by film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ltd . She even landed , uncaptioned , on the cover of the austere Economist . <P> As for her mentor , Osteopath Stephen Ward , he was in jail , bound for trial on charges of living on prostitutes ' earnings . The evidence , it was widely suspected , would prove damaging to a great many people . <P> Although the Labor Party concentrated on the security question , in public debate the Profumo case inevitably turned into a moral issue . Significantly , the unpardonable crime of ex-Secretary of State for War John Profumo was not that he was indiscreet and a potential security risk , but that he lied to the House of Commons in initially denying any relationship with Christine . Moreover , he lied stupidly , since he might have saved his dignity and his seat as an M.P . by admitting his misstep . As a limerick that made the rounds of West minster last week had it : <P> " What on earth have you done ? " said Christine , <P> " You have wrecked the whole party machine . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all rude , <P> " But to lie in the House is obscene . " <P> Serialized Sex . The Labor Party rallied for battle with enthusiasm . Returning from a week 's visit to Moscow and pleasant if futile chats with Khrushchev about disarmament , Labor Party Leader Harold Wilson hinted he would produce new evidence this week to show that Britain 's security system was breached . He had good reason for confidence : the Daily Mail 's National Opinion Poll gave Labor its biggest lead ever : 69.2% to 19.8% over the Tories . <P> On his return from a golfing vacation , Macmillan 's first objective was to command a united Cabinet . Calling his ministers into emergency session , he asked each man to outline privately his own view of the situation . Without exception , the 21 top Tories expressed deep dismay at the public 's loss of confidence in the government . Macmillan was caught between two almost equally unpleasant possibilities . Had he known about Profumo 's doings , and in that case had he not connived to some extent in his false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long reputation as a womanizer , had Macmillan really not known anything ? In that case , had he not been naive and negligent when he accepted Profumo 's defense ?
