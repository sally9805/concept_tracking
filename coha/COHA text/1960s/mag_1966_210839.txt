The names that baseball teams give themselves are apt to be anything but apt . Consider the Atlanta Braves , who fled from Boston and Milwaukee , and the Detroit Tigers , whose claws have been clipped since 1945 . Not to mention the California Angels , those swinging young men about Hollywood , or the Kansas City Athletics , who have n't made the first division in 14 years . <P> But the Baltimore Orioles - now there 's a proper name . As every ornithologist knows , the Baltimore oriole is a bird that makes a lot of noise in the spring , then lays an egg and departs . <P> The way they croon in June and croak in August , the best that the Orioles usually can hope for is to be remembered in September . They have not won a big-league pennant since 1896 ; they are the team that Mighty Casey struck out for ; and they peddled Babe Ruth away for $2,900 . Still , all those past transgressions will be forgiven this year , unless the Orioles find some curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the halfway point of the 1966 season , they were leading the American League by a full seven games . <P> Clams &; Claws . Maybe the Orioles wo n't win . But at the very least , they are the kookiest cast of characters who ever called themselves a ball club . First Baseman Boog Powell is ( at 6 ft. 4 in. and 246 lbs. ) one of the biggest men in baseball , and he spent seven years perfecting the fine art of tobacco chewing- " the trick , " says Powell , " is not to swallow . " Leftfielder Curt Blefary keeps a pet cocker spaniel that has scrambled eggs and Coke for breakfast . " Ugh , " says Blefary , who has been known to start his own day with clam chowder and hamburger . <P> Relief Pitcher Dick Hall is an amateur mathematician who on drizzly afternoons amuses himself trying to predict whether a game will be called off - by calculating the number of raindrops falling per second on one square foot of the field . Rightfielder Frank Robinson used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " before he was traded to the Orioles by the Cincinnati Reds last winter . Now he is the meanest man in both leagues - with the possible exception of Baltimore Manager Hank Bauer ( TIME cover , Sept. 11 , 1964 ) . <P> A shrapnel-pocked ex-Marine with a face " like a clenched fist , " Bauer looks even meaner than he is-and there are signs that he may be mellowing . Nobody on the squad has been fined all year . Curfews are lenient , and bed checks are rare . The Orioles obviously are enjoying their new freedom . Outfielder Powell , who batted only .248 last year , was up to .299 last week . Curt Blefary has twelve homers , and Centerfielder Russ Snyder is batting .337 . Rightfielder Robinson ranks No. 1 in the American League in homers ( 22 ) and runs scored ( 68 ) , fourth in batting ( .312 ) . Third Baseman Brooks Robinson , no relation , is the league leader in RBIs with 72 . <P> Biggest Bulls . Baltimore 's only apparent weakness is its front-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have managed to complete a mere 15 games . That does not alarm Manager Bauer . " All I want is six or seven good innings-and then I 'll bring in the relievers , " he says . " What the hell , I 've got the best bullpen in the business . "
