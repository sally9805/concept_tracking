OUR NEW FIRST LADY vndon could neser hose made It this far is ithout the help of that is Oman . She is maendicent. - James Reston of The New York 1-Ones made this appraisal of Lads Bird Johnson while he puffed a cigar and watched the roaring mob that surged around the rostrum at the 1960 Democratic consention , Lyndon Johnson . his arms encircling his Wile and younger daughter . his face charged w oh conflicting emotions , had just accepted second place on the Democratic ticket . Abandoning his presidential hopes , the proud Tesan had agreed to calk behind the younger senator he had led by the hand through lie intricacies of Capitol Hill politics . It was astonishing . And it would prose to be the most important decision of his life . for it would catapult him , throuel , an act of horror , into the presidency Mrs Johnson , who shared his crisis than and shares his eminence today . has spent more than a quarter of a century in preparation for her role . Her husband was 12 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the vice presideneyiShe thus brings to the While House more experience in national political life than any other First Lady in history . But her position is not primarily . political . First , she must be a wife , and being wife to Lyndon Baines Johnson is not an easy task . He is a difficult and demanding man And despite all the hack-slapping , shoulder hugging and two-hand grip that are part of the Johnson treatment , his temper is short . He wants esery one of his dozens of suits always pressed . the freezers full of food , his personal articles in place . Once , with a big party three weeks off , Johnson told Lady Bird he es-Noted a whole new leen planted and growing thick in time for the affair . This was almost impossible , for the seasonwas autumn . But the lawn  --  a little thin , perhaps  --  was ready . Mrs. Johnson manages all the details of the Johnson households and can not remember a time e hen she has not . " This is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is. - she says . " He wants me to handle anything I am Capable of handling . He 's a little incensed if I want help on trivial things . I think sometimes he thinks I am more capable than I am  --  ss hie+ in a way makes me grow to be a little more capable . I-k 's great hand at saying what he wants  --  then he scants it implemented by me. - In the eight years since his heart attack she has worried about Johnson 's health " simply because he works too hard and too lung . But after everything short of nagging I stop , because 1 ca n't really control him . He was extraordinarily good and strong about his diet for the first two years alter his heart attack Then as the danger receded. the discipline relaxed . Now he 's not as careful about what he eats . He 's wonderful about not smoking , even though it 's what he likes best . " The Johnsons ' need of each other is obvious to anyone who has known them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more dependent on his %sire , described by all close to her as a " strong , firm woman , " than she is on him , However . " She is very much a part and an extension of the man she is married to , " - aCCUIli I fig to Mrs. Frank Church , the Idaho senator 's wife , " They lit together somehow. - she says . " I have never seen her in her house when she could not detach herself from whatever she was doing at the moment to find something he was looking for , or perhaps to say an affectionate good-bye as he left for work . " Mrs. Johnson is possibly the only person who can severely criticize her husband and manage to provoke an admiring reaction . " I never saw her slice a corner on anything , " he says . " She is the first to tell me about any mistakes , whether they arc financial extravagances or a political boner , and to me that is the test of real character . " Although an unfailingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things she says . This is startling in a political wile . Describing her husband 's announcement that he was a presidential candidate in 1960 , she said , " I thought it was line , strong and thrilling , " but then she added , " There area Caw minor things I 'd tike to discuss with him though . " And at the 1960 Democratic convention , while Johnson was still fiercely running the race against Kennedy , Lady Bird said she felt " no roaring confidence " that her man would win , She also keeps an eye on her husband 's personality . Ltes . Johnson is addicted to talking , both on the platform and off . His wife may not stop the monologue at parties , but she does not hesitate to slip him a note at political rallies with two words on it : " That 's enough . " Mrs , Johnson will be the most political First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt . She is more than an elected-official 's wife  --  she has become herself a consummate politician . " Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , " says Mrs. Hale Boggs . She and her husband , a representative from Louisiana , have known tlicJohnsons for 22 years . But Mrs. F.D R. and Mrs. L.B.J. differ in one important point . Mrs. Roosevelt led a political life of her own . Mrs. Johnson has worked politically only for her husband . If Johnson runs again , Lady Bird will hit the campaign trail with relish , as she did in 1960 . On her husband 's campaign train Trip through the South in 1960 , for example , she was able to discover and know by name no fewer than 75 cousins , kissin ' or otherwise , outside of Texas . Inside Texas , she says , " There 's hardly ever a receiving line where I fail to run across someone f went to school with , or some mother or grandmother whose child went to camp with one of mine. - Not everyone is enchanted by Lady Bird Johnson . Some people describe her with adjectives like " corny , " calculating " and " cold-eyed . " They damn " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " right down to Little Beagle Johnson , who sired the present White House pups that are Lucy 's pets . One public-relations man in Washington , who has long worked for an important pressure group , recalls an hour with Mrs. Johnson during the 1960 campaign " 1 felt she cared more about her husband 's career than her husband . She 's got very darting eyes , you know . I had a feeling of somebody who seas making all kinds of long mental notes , almost a human tape recorder going , " This kind of comment rarely conies from anyone who has had personal contact with Mrs. Johnson . Those who dislike her , or who remain indifferent to her , usually know Lady Bird only through television or the printed word and picture . The camera is not kind to the First Lady , as it was to her predecessor . It is almost impossible to take a bad photograph of Jacqueline Kennedy . It is equally difficult to find a good close-up of Lady Bird Johnson , who actually is a lovely and far less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in photographs , look black and often hard . The charming smile occasionally seems forced , her animation sometimes appears exaggerated . It is a pity . . Physically .. the package is small and attractive . She is five feet , four inches tall . hovers around 110 pounds and wears a size 10 dress . She used to weigh 132 pounds , but after her husband 's severe heart attack in 1955. she went on his diet , too . and dropped to her present weight . The First Lady was asked recent lv ts hat qualities she thought a woman needed most . Her reply was " elasticity and compassion . " She has both in large measure . Her husband is a notoriously unpredictable person who often moves on impulse . A typical such act set many people giggling the day after Christmas . While 23 of Mr. Johnson 's relatives sat before a cooling Christmas turkey , the President suddenly invited a horde of reporters into the L.B.J. ranch house and conducted an hour-long tour of the premises . Mrs. Johnson 's " Whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , found an echo in the heart of es cry housewife across the country . But ihe tour came to a halt when Mr. Johnson tried to open their bedroom door and found it locked . " Mrs. Johnson has locked the bedroom on me , " he said jokingly He knocked harder , Mrs. Johnson , a good sport to the end , opened the door a minute later and the tour went on . She is thoughtful to the smallest detail . So that others could relax at the ranch during the Christmas holidays , she never let up a minute She rose at seven every morning , to supervise the baking of 50 loaves of bread , pecan pies and German-style chocolate cakes in the kitchen of the main house . Fresh fruit , flowers and pecan pralines were at eaeh guest 's bedside . Every time it plane arrived on the L.B.J. airstrip or a bus at the ranch gate , Mrs. Johnson was out there to welcome the visitors . Another aspect of Mrs. Johnson 's character is that she has " one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close friend who has worked with her He describes her " uncanny knack " of allocating time efficiently. , divesting herself of one role to concentrate on another There have been four big roles for Mrs Johnson to play . The first , as wife , began when a powerful persuader named Lyndon Johnson got her to say " yes " in 1934 . The second , as political wife and politician , began in 1937 when Texas , titers first sent her husband to the House of Represenoitives in Washington . The third , as business executive , began in 1943. when she bought ailing radio station KT BC in Austin . The last , as mother , began in 1944 with the birth of Lynda . She had despaired of ever playing that important role . " She waited ten years to have a baby and has lost four children with miscarriages . She is never a person who admits her own pain , " says Lyndon Johnson . Mrs , Johnson learned self-reliance early in her life . Lady Bird was born Claudia Alta Taylor in Karnack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1912 . She was delivered in a big brick house that had been built by slaves in 11140 , The only living member of her immediate family , her brother Antonio J. Taylor , describes the scene ; " Seven fires blazing in seven hearths only dented the December chill . Rutted roads led fifteen lonesome miles to Marshall and thirty-five to Shreveport , La . Genial old Doctor Baldwin arrived in good time and set about his work sans plumbing . electricity or trained nurses . These things were still unknown in the land , even to the parents of the Christmas baby in their big house : - The little girl was destined to have few playmates . Both her brothers  --  one eight years older than she , the other 11 years older  --  were away getting " proper " schooling for young gentlemen in New Mexico and New York . The younger brother , Tony , later stayed on in Santa Fe to Found a gift store called the Old Mexico Shop , which he still runs . The area around Karnack is remote and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , " Tony Taylor says . " Families lived far gram and the cock crowed only once . for he heard no answering call . " Claudia 's father , Thomas Jefferson Taylor , was the prosperous owner of a general store . Her mother , Minnie Lce Pattillo Taylor . died before her daughter 's sixth birthday , but her legacy of sensitivity , cultural yearning and the sense of social justice runs deep in the grown woman today Syllabub and seminars The mother is unforgettahle  --  a true original who believed in integration long before its time and who fought for women 's suffrage but died without the right to vote , Mrs. Johnson only remembers her mother had " highly individualistic ideas . " Shc vaguely recalls " riding with her in it buggy down to Karnack to ask some people to vole. - Minnie Lee , born and raised in Alabama , was tall and blond , on eccentric person who dressed in turbans and Neils . She married Toni Taylor against her father 's wishes and the two moved to Texas . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. John Harvey Kellogg 's dicta from Battle Creek , Mich. , on substitute food and the evils of meat . " And yet my mother did not live on creams and spinach . She lived in a gracious manner . At her parties , the bowls of syllabub were flavored with fine brandies , " Tony Taylor says . Every year during the opera season in Chicago Minnie Lee would leave the big brick house in Karnack , journey up to the midwestern metropolis and stay for weeks until the season ended . She was bookish , Lou , a trait few people in Karnack could understand . They understood her interest in Negroes even less . The woman brought down the scorn of her neighbors  --  by her frequent soirees and seminars for Negroes . She was fascinated by their religious beliefs , their spirituals , their revivalist fren/ies . Constantly she probed into their submerged hopes and thoughts and tragedies . " She was very interested always in people in need , " says Mrs. Johnson . " It was part of her character and daily needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonic of that . " When her mother , Minnie Lee . was , laid in the earth , they placed this on her tombstone : FORGETFUL OF SELF , SHE LIVED ENTIRFLY FOR OrHEiss . Then Aunt Effie from Alabama came to Texas to take care of the little girl . Long before , the family cook and maid-of-all-work had said of two-year-old Claudia , " She 's as purty as a lady bird The absurd but compelling name stuck no matter how desperately the girl tried to shake it . " Long ago I nude my peace with the nickname , " Mrs. Johnson says . With her mother gone . the child 's focus shifted to her father . From him she unmistakably acquired her superb business acumen and her taste for dominating men . T. J. Taylor , now dead three years , was much like Lyndon Johnson . " My father was called ' Mr. Boss ' and sometimes ' Cap'n Taylor , ' although he had no naval background , " Mrs. Johnson says . " He was the head man in his tiny world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet two . Lyndon is six feel three . " The little girl read many of the hooks OW filled the house . " As a child , I devoured James Oliver Curwood and Lane Grey , all the Teutonic and Greek myths and , I do n't mind saying , Uncle Remus . " She walked in the woods by herself . She had many " special places , " like a spring or a pine thicket . She rode her horse often to a family cemetery nearby . " I used to love going fishing on Caddo Lake too . It is very much the bayou country with giant cypress trees  --  their knees rising above the water . " IC her father was ginning cotton until late at night , she slept on a cot between two boxes in the attic of his store . *'What 's in those boxes , Daddy ? " she asked . " Merchandise , honey , " he always replied . They were coffins . The sign outside his store read T. J. TAYLOR  --  DEALER EVERYTHING , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Claudia is remembered by her classmates at SI . Mary 's Episcopal School for Girls in Dallas and at the University of Texas in Austin as a warm , but somewhat retiring person . In 1934. iust a few months out of the university with degrees in liberal arts and journalism , she met Lyndon Johnson in the office of a friend in Austin . Their courtship was lempestuous  --  the meeting Lilian explosive personality with a woman who was shy then , modest still and cautious on any important decision to this day . " He was the most outspoken , straightforward , determined person I 'd ever encountered , " she recalls . " I knew I 'd met something remarkable  --  but I did n't know quite what . " Lady Bird was then 21 ; Lyndon , 26 . Mr. Johnson asked her to breakfast with him the next day . Right alter breakfast he proposed . She refused to commit herself . " I could n't understand how he could be so daring with his future without putting more thought on the matter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry hint the first day we were together , I didn'tknow what manner of man this was to he so decisive , I am a prudent person . " The pursuit continued for two months between Austin and Washington where Johnson was then executive secretary to Rep. Richard M. Kleberg of Texas . He phoned her daily . She consulted Aunt Effie , who did not approve . He met her father , who did . The President continues the tale : " We drove to San Antonio , and she still had n't said yes until we got there , I sent a friend over to buy a ring as fast as tie could , and we were married at the Episcopal church on the square , She is still the most enjoyable woman I 've ever known , As a sweetheart , swimmer , boat rider and conversationalist , she is the most interesting woman I know . ' A love of the land Few people are aware of one of the deepest , most relaxing experiences the Johnsons share  --  their daily drises just before twilight from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when the animals graze , leap and run . At about live p to . Mr. Johnson , who has keen hearing and can detect the rustle of a deer through woods hundreds of yards away , will call his wife . " Come on , Bird , " he says , " Let 's go see the deer and the antelope play . " " We share a deep sense of with the land , a reliance on the land and the love of it , " Lady Bird Johnson says . " Wecan ride for hours over that rolling , eroded hillside country of Texas and be at utter peace . " The only role that Lady Bird has played by herself without submerging it in her husband or children . is a part she has just relinquished . Until her husband is no longer President , she may not discuss her business holdings with her trustees . not esen by telephone . Minnie Lee Taylor left her only daughter a S67,0 ( 10 inheritance and farmland in Alabama that Mrs. Johnson still owns . By investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bought kTBC in 1943 , now the only commercial TV station in Austin . It had nine employees , was on the air only during the day and looked like a dreadful ins estment . Lady Bird made it pay . When asked how , an associate said . " She worked like a dog , day and evening , and she was the finest purchasing agent we ever had . " By 1946 the station was turning a small profit . Her business gift is part of her private life too . From the time of her marriage she has handled all the Johnson family 's money matters . She will continue to do so at the White House and at the L.B.J. ranch house near Stonewall , Tex . As can be guessed from her balance sheets , Mrs. Johnson is a formidable , hard-bargaining businesswoman . Her husband is the first to acknowledge this . " She is the kind of person everyone in the world would like to be his trustee . I could n't get live cents out of her that I did n't deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I earned . " Her press secretary and intimate friend . Mrs. Leslie Carpenter , points out that " from the beginning Lady Bird has had a financial pad that allowed her husband to practice the profession he always St a n ted  --  politics . " Mrs. Johnson carries a pad and pencil with her wherever she goes and takes notes almost compulsively . Her shorthand , learned during college , is expert . At least one Austin merchant fears that pad and tells why . " NA hen Miz Johnson comes in my store , she knows just what she wants , how much she wants to pay for it and what the object 's worth . She 's got it all down there on that little pad . If you 've made a commitment to her On the phone , you 've got to be purty careful . She 'll whip out that pad and show it to you . ' ' Today , M rs . Johnson and her daughters own S3 percent of the stock in the L.B.J. Company . ( recently changed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with interests in station KTBC in Austin and three other Texas radio stations . Shortly after Mr. Johnson 's accession to the presidency , virtually all the family 's holdings were turned over to lea 0 trustees . A year after she acquired KTBC , her first child was born and Lady Bird look on the part she had waited so long to play . Lynda Bird was born in Washington on March 19 , 1944 The first name is a girl 's equivalent of Lyndon ; he was not betting that a a favorite aunt and Rebekah Baines Johnson , the President 's late mother . The two daughters are strikingly different in physique and temperament . Lynda . a brunette , is almost live feel , 10 inches tall , with a Figure as voluptuous as a grown woman 's by the time she was lb . She has dimples , large , velvety brown eyes and creamy skin . Lucy is five feet , three-and-a-half inches tall , sturdy but slender . She was a dark hlond , but recently dyed her hair black . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynda a " joyous , outgoing person- who combines her father 's drive and her mother 's sentiment . She said once of her mother , frequently absent with the Vice President , - Sometimes when mother is away , l go into her room and smell her perfume and feel her presence . " The odds arc that Lynda , engaged since last summer to Navy Li . ITO Bernard Rosenbach , will marry him in the White House this year . Her parents wish her to wait until she has been graduated from college in 1966 . But Lynda is almost as impatient as her fiance , who is a 23-year-old Texan . Lucy is much more contained and introspective than her older sister , with v. hat friends call " a high sense of the dramatic , " Here is how her mother describes her younger child . " Lucy is fiercely loyal to her friends . She has a deep intuitive streak and often knows what you 're thinking about at a most uncomfortable time . Shc has a fey quality , loves poetry and loves to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's happy , nobody is happier , and if she 's sad , nobody is sadder . She 's crazy about animals and always has been , and she 'll fight anyone who isn't. - Neither girl is disciplined strictly . The mother controls them on trust . " Mother never tells us to he in from a party or a date at a certain time , " Lynda told a friend . " She just leaves it to our good judgment . How can you break faith with a woman like that ' ? " When Lynda and Lucy were first invited to the White House by Mrs , Kennedy , to attend a state dinner for the President of the Sudan , their parents were away in Austin . Both girls were then attending school in Washington . The flustered daughters immediately telephoned their mother in Testis to discuss White House deportment . Her advice was absolutely characteristic : " Read all you can find in the encyclopedia about the Sudan , and do n't drink any of the wine at dinner . " Lady Bird Johnson not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's role in political society , she expects even more of herself and is prepared to give it , Female press conlerences When the office of the presidency closes about a man , it also closes about his wife and family . But Lady Bird intends to be accessible . Bess Truman was a shy and reserved First Lady . Mamie Eisenhower , all her life sheltered by the caste system of the Army world , held but one press conference during her husband 's two terms  --  at the beginning of his Administration . Jacqueline Kennedy , although the most photographed , written about and talked about woman of this era , shrank to the end from any invasion of her private life and thoughts . She gave no press conferences in the White House . She was , and remains , mysterious . Mrs. Johnson bears her small person with dignity , but she is somehow free , as the three First Ladies who preceded her were not . It is something more than the issuance of favorite recipes from Zephyr Wright , the cook who has been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Bird des ours the works of Katherine Anne Porter , Antoine de Saint-Exupery , Scott Fitzgerald , and presses copies of Harper Lee 's novels on her friends : or that the White House may soon have piped-in music , a presidential preference that horrifies those who admired the Kennedys ' taste . Perhaps it is her open heart , her willingness to share a deeper part of herself with the people without suspicion or fear . Mrs. Roosevelt , a towering personality , was like that . Claudia Alia Taylor Johnson may never achieve her eminence , but , as a friend said , - The American people are in for a marvelous treat  --  and they do n't even know it , "
