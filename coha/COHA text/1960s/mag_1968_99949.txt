All over the U.S. this summer a lot of former hackers may suddenly emerge as first-class racing sailors and a lot of good sailors may be better ones thanks to a new school that is just completing its first semester . The school is popularly known as Bahamas Race Week because its principal classroom is the waters off West End , Grand Bahama Island . Officially known as Sailing Symposiums , Inc. , it was the invention of Steve Colgate , 32-year-old president of New York 's Offshore Sailing School , and Knowles Pittman , editor of One-Design &amp; Offshore Yachtsman , sailboat racing 's best magazine . From October to April , these two reasoned , many a frustrated sailor is simply sitting , oiling his turnbuckles and waiting for the spring thaw . Why not give him a chance to combine a winter vacation with a chance to really learn the techniques of his favorite sport in a balmy climate with some of the best racing sailors around to serve as instructors ? // " People can talk all they like about sailing for esthetic pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Island when he is not winning races elsewhere , " but sooner or later most every sailor will want to take up racing . " Ulmer was quick to accept an invitation to join the symposium as a guest instructor , as was another sailmaker , Owen Torrey , a bronze medalist in the 1948 Olympics . // Torrey and Ulmer were on duty in the school 's late sessions three weeks ago , along with Don Loweree , one of the permanent instructors and a highly competent sailorman with a master 's degree in , of all things , music . During earlier weeks the roster of instructors in the Bahamas had sparkled with the names of the great and near great : George O'Day , who more than anyone else may deserve the title Mr. Yacht Racing ; Wally Ross , president of Hard Sails Inc. ; Canadian Olympian Bruce Kirby ; former World Star Class Champion Dick Stearns ; Dr. Stuart Walker , who has done as much to encourage small-boat racing as any man in the nation ; Harry Sindle , six times national champion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al. , et al . In pairs they had faced each new group of students as it arrived , about 25 sailors per session , lecturing them long and hard at the blackboards and giving them solid tactical training in the school 's fleet of Norwegian-built Solings. // Now it was the turn of Ulmer and Torrey  --  Ulmer the pragmatist , Torrey the intellectual . " If it works , do it , " says Chuck . " If it works , why does it work ? " wonders Owen . " Most people lose races because they ignore the obvious , " says Chuck . " If you have three alternatives , " says Owen , " you ought to be able to determine scientifically which of the three is best . " // The student sailors facing Professors Ulmer and Torrey ranged in age from the mid-20s to the mid-50s and in skill from hopeless to promising . The youngest , 28-year-old Bob Benkert , owns a man 's apparel store in Birmingham , Mich. ; the oldest , Dr. John Thomas , 57 , practices pediatrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a pathologist and an orthopedic surgeon , a florist , four attorneys , a cookie manufacturer , a real-estate man , a printer , a paper manufacturer , a pile-driving contractor , a safety-equipment manufacturer , a painting contractor , a lieutenant colonel stationed with the U.S. Continental Army Command in Virginia , and Charles Owens , founder of the Owens Yacht Co . Most of the men had brought their wives along . Three of the wives , having crewed at home for their husbands , signed up for the course . // In assigning crews , bachelor Colgate promptly separated husbands and wives . " Women tend to defer too much to their husbands , " he explained . " Or else some husbands are too concerned about what their wives are doing , which distracts them from what they 're supposed to be doing . When men sail with their wives , they frequently get too bossy . In this symposium , everyone has to take his turn skippering and crewing . I remember one couple I separated and found , at the end of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband had the worst . " // The students were divided into two groups , A and B , depending on skill and experience , " If the air is n't too heavy , " Colgate announced to B group , " we 'll have a spinnaker drill . " " Oh , Lord , " moaned Harriet Golden , a housewife from New Rochelle , N.Y. , " I can never get that damn spinnaker up . " " Or down for that matter , " muttered Harriet 's husband . // Getting safely out of the harbor was B group 's first challenge . A bootlegger 's haven during Prohibition days , the harbor is narrow and sheltered by a line of cays that run roughly north and south . When a boat emerges into the sea , it must fight its way through a channel bucking a strong current . A tremendous turbulence may send three-to-five-foot waves across the bow before a boat breaks through into quiet water . // Loweree and Ulmer followed the Solings in a Boston Whaler . Colgate and Torrey manned the committee boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humorous anecdote in the classroom , was all business once sailing instruction got under way , stern of demeanor and loud of voice . // " Where is the first mark ? " shouted a crew member of No. 10. // Ulmer looked incredulous , then raised a horn to his lips . " Figure it out ! In a race no one is going to tell you where the mark is. " // A red flag was hoisted on the committee boat , and one short blast of a horn signaled the start of the race . The boats tacked toward the start , all but Soling No. 11 , which was blithely sailing off in the opposite direction , carrying confused Skipper Peter Starrett , Fore-deck Man Allan Bridge and Jibman Harriet Golden . Reported Dr. Starrett later to his intrigued classmates : " In no time at all , not only could we not see any of the marks , we could n't even see the other boats . " // " There are lots of holes in the air , " Ulmer shouted to No. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see , and if you do n't get some wind , you 're not going to make it . " // Now he was after No. 14 : " Trim your main ! Bring her upwind. " // " Tighten your luff , No. 11 . Your jib 's got some scallops in it . " // " Hey , No. 10 ! Your mainsail is out too far . So is your jib . Do you see what 's on the water ahead of you ? Look at the telltales . See those cat's-paws coming toward you ? That 's wind . You should be able to react to it . " // At last it was spinnaker time , and Ulmer had his work cut out for him . // " Keep your eye on the competition , " he shouted at the colonel . " Are you ready to set the chute ? That sheet is leading from the wrong place . When you trim a sail , look at it ! Your headboard is jammed on the backstay . " ( One suspected that Ulmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army hell. ) // " Get the spinnaker out from under the jib , No. 13 . Now it 's wrapped around the bow . Free it . Your pole is too high . Why is your crew looking around ? They should be trimming the spinnaker. " // " Do n't roll the jib until you set the chute , No. 14 . Your spinnaker sheet is running through the reaching block . Now trip your guy . Now ease the sheet some more . Now go up and roll the jib , get it out of the way .... " // Spinnakers , brilliantly colored , rose and billowed. // " My God ! " said Ulmer feebly , and he sat down in the Whaler , watching apathetically as the incorrigible No. 11 , now being skippered by Bridge on a port tack , headed straight for Soling No. 14 , on starboard , which is about as illegal as crossing a highway against a red light . // " Starboard tack ! Starboard tack ! " screamed the crew of No. 14 . Soling No. 11 sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible moment , bore off . Sailors Finder , Kahnweiler and Levy raised their protest flag with a cheer . After lunch they met in the Set ' n ' Be Damned bar lounge of the hotel ( while A group was out on the water ) to wash down their indignation with martinis , and pen their protest . This document eventually filled six pages of the small , gaily decorated stationery provided by the hotel . // At the afternoon meeting , which took place daily in the Eleuthera Room , it was read aloud , all six pages . // " It was a clear case of port-starboard violation , " Colgate ruled , adding with a sigh , " I suppose that before the week is over we ought to take up the matter of how to present a proper protest . " // By the middle of the week a few members of the B group had been promoted to A , and two or three of the latter group had been demoted to B. There had been no serious damage to any of the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident prone . She had gone up on the rocks in a practice run on the first day , scraped her keel , lost her masthead fly , fouled the same mast in the rigging of another boat and suffered a 10-inch tear in her mainsail at the clew . Owen Torrey spent an afternoon with needle and thread , rocking in the Soling , like an old lady darning a sock . // The lectures , both practical and erudite , ranged from How to Prepare for a Major Regatta to Scientific Research in Sailing . Torrey , who had given up an established practice in maritime law to make sails , discussed ways and means of testing the porosity of the spinnaker . To illustrate , he drew a series of complicated diagrams on the blackboard , until it was filled with a maze of cross-sections , arrows and triangles . // " There 's another way , " drawled the practical Ulmer , twinkling . " Clamp the spinnaker over your nose and mouth . If you survive , it 's porous . " // Questions came fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other than by shifting your weight aft ? How do you stop ? How can you tell where the maximum current is ? How can you shake weed off your keel ? ( Answer to the last : if you do n't have a weed pole , head right up into the wind until you come to a stop and start drifting backwards . The weed will fall off. ) // Owen Torrey had a few thoughts on weed . " When heeling , " he said , " you can see the keel . If you do n't have weed , you know you 're doing something wrong . " " What is the single most important aspect of racing ? " one sailor asked . " Your mental attitude , " said Steve Colgate quickly . " You have to want to win . The race is n't over until you cross the finish line . Even if you 're 10 boats behind , keep in mind that God is going to strike down some of those boats ahead of you . " " Knowing the rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactical advantage but a psychological one as well . I remember a race when someone on a port tack yelled ' Larboard ! ' the old-fashioned word for port at a starboard tack boat  --  and the fellow came about . " // " I would suggest , " said Steve Colgate , as the meeting broke up , " that Group B , particularly , read the section in the racing manual headed Common Mistakes We 've Observed . " // Colgate is not sure he will offer a basic sailing course next year , though he enjoyed his hackers  --  particularly the one who wrote , after his session in the Bahamas was over , " Thank you for letting us play Russian roulette with your beautiful Solings.
