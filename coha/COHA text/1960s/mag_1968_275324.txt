First there was the mysterious death of Rear Admiral Hermann Ldke , suspected of photographing NATO documents for a foreign power . Then came the suicides of four other West Germans involved in government or defense work . West German counterintelligence agents had only begun to sort all that out when Bonn admitted yet another serious-and bizarre-security gaffe . Attorney General Ludwig Martin announced that three men had been arrested for providing the Soviet Union with secret equipment , including a U.S.-designed missile , stolen from a supposedly tightly guarded NATO base . <P> The trio 's exploits began in April 1967 . Master Sergeant Wolf-Diethard Knope , a Luftwaffe Starfighter pilot , Josef Linowski , a Polish-born civilian , and Manfred Ramminger , another civilian , worked together to steal a navigational device from the Zell airbase in southern Germany . Ramminger then casually packed it in his suitcase and flew off to Moscow to deliver his prize . That , however , was a mere warm-up for their big operation . <P> Returning to Zell six months later , they clipped their way through a barbed-wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sidewinder missile . An air-to-air heat-seeking weapon used by American planes in Viet Nam , the Sidewinder is about 9 ft. long and weighs 165 Ibs . Undaunted , the trio trundled the missile to their car in a wheelbarrow , broke the car 's rear window to fit the rocket in , wrapped a rug around its protruding end , and drove more than 100 miles across West Germany to an undisclosed city . <P> From there it was a matter of getting the purloined rocket to Moscow . To the profound embarrassment of the Bonn government , that proved to be the simplest part of the whole caper . The spies took the Sidewinder apart , wrapped it in packages and sent the pieces on the next commercial airliner going to the Soviet Union-via ordinary postal air freight . The cost : $79.25.
