The voice sounded paper thin , raising every head in India 's Parliament . " May I speak sitting , sir ? " asked Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of Mr. Speaker . Still feeble as a result of last January 's stroke , Nehru slumped in his seat , delivered a 40-minute address , his first major talk since the illness . With refreshing candor , he took his countrymen to task for consistently blaming India 's problems on others . " Our publicity abroad suffers very much from self-righteousness , " he said . " We are not free from wrongdoing . The result is that even many of the truthful things we say are sometimes not believed . " <P> The Only Cure . Nehru was particularly incensed at Hindu wrongdoing in the bloody religious strife that has grown out of the dispute between India and Pakistan over possession of Kashmir . When an M.P . complained that " our unilateral goodness is interpreted as cowardice by Pakistan , " Nehru replied emotionally : " I know the people of Pakistan . When you excite them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal , whether it is the Hindu or the Moslem . " <P> In hopes of easing the religious tensions , Nehru early this month released Sheik Mohammed Abdullah , the Lion of Kashmir , who was jailed nearly eleven years ago for " conspiracy " to bring about Kashmirian independence . Nehru had hoped that Sheik Abdullah , a Moslem who believes in Hindu-Moslem cooperation , might find a solution to the Kashmir problem . Since his release , the former Kashmirian Prime Minister has been campaigning by Jeep through the towns and villages of Kashmir 's Himalayan foothills , talking with old friends and supporters . His plan for settling Kashmir 's future remains the same as always . Failing a plebiscite-which India opposes because Kashmir 's Moslem majority would probably turn the province over to Pakistan-there could only be a " clash of arms " or a " negotiated settlement . " Either way , he feels that the only cure for " this cancer in the body politic of India and Pakistan " is to make Kashmir an independent state . <P> Angry Agreement . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail the first time . Members of Nehru 's Congress Party and the opposition found themselves for once in angry agreement , many of them demanding that the sheik be rearrested . Said Nehru 's heir apparent , Minister Without Portfolio Lai Bahadur Shastri , with perhaps just a touch of that self-righteousness his boss had criticized : " There is , of course , complete freedom of expression in India . But there can be no freedom for preaching some kind of independence or secession from the Indian union . "
