" Between Us and Tyranny " Called to the telephone while dressing for dinner , Harvard Law Professor Felix Frankfurter was still in his B.V.D.s . <P> At the other end of the line was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . F.D.R. <P> chatted for a moment , then said , " You know , I told you I do n't want to appoint you to the Supreme Court . " Frankfurter said yes , he remembered that ; Roosevelt went on talking , repeating at least twice more that he did not want to appoint Frankfurter to the court . Finally , F.D.R. got to the point . " But wherever I turn , " he said , " and to whomever I talk that matters to me , I am made to realize that you 're the only person fit to succeed Holmes and Cardozo . " And so , Roosevelt said , he was going to appoint Frankfurter to the Supreme Court anyway . <P> That was in 1939 . Recalling the phone conversation in later years , Frankfurter said : " You know , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an innocently sadistic streak in him . He just had to have an outlet for fun . " Behind his teasing , Roosevelt had reasons for hesitations about Frankfurter . For geographical balance , Roosevelt had wanted to name a man from the West or Midwest . Roosevelt well knew that he would stir up a storm by naming a foreign-born Jew with a well-deserved reputation as a radical advocate of liberal causes . But Frankfurter 's prestige among U.S. men of law was great , and most of them could agree with the Nation 's comment that the appointment had a " satisfying inevitability . " <P> In arriving at that pinnacle of inevitability . Frankfurter climbed a long way . Born in Austria , he came to the U.S. with his family at twelve , grew up on New York 's seamy Lower East Side . <P> His path led through the College of the City of New York and on to Harvard Law School . How could a young man from the Lower East Side go to Harvard ? The tuition was only $150 a year then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on very little . " Frankfurter reached the top of his class , got into a leading New York City law firm after graduation . But he soon gave that up to serve under Henry L. <P> Stimson , whom President Theodore Roosevelt had just appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York . <P> Frankfurter followed his boss to Washington in 1911 , when President Taft named Stimson Secretary of War , remained in Government service for three years , then went back to Harvard to teach . He remained at Harvard for nearly a quarter of a century , becoming one of the nation 's most eminent teachers of law . <P> <P> During the late 19205 and the 19303 , Frankfurter sent to Washington many a bright young Harvard Law graduate . <P> Collectively , they were nicknamed " happy hot dogs , " and their numbers included Dean Acheson , Thomas ( " Tommy the Cork " ) Corcoran , James M.
