The temperature at Melbourne 's Koo-yong stadium boiled to 112 last week , but nobody minded except the spectators ( too of whom fainted in their seats ) and a listless pair of players from sunny Italy . In a mismatch worthy of the Roman Colosseum , Australia 's Davis Cup defenders , Rod Laver , Neale Fraser and Roy Emerson , beat back the Italian challengers 5-0 , took home the 62-year-old cup for a record tenth time in twelve years. * <P> The lopsided score merely hinted at the humiliation of Italy 's defeat . Not until the deciding first three matches were over did bumbling Nicola Pietrangeli and Orlando Sirola cadge a single set from their relentless Aussie tormentors . The crucial doubles match lasted only an hour ; Pietrangeli and Sirola won only nine games-the worst Challenge Round showing since 1919 , when Britain 's doubles players dropped all but two games to Norman Brookes and Gerald Patterson of a combined Australia-New Zealand team . " A pathetic display , " snapped the Sydney Morning Herald , and Milan 's II Giorno agreed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach , Czech Jaroslav Drobny , was so disgusted by his team 's showing ( " They treated the Davis Cup like a garden party " ) that he planned to resign . <P> Brutal Efficiency . The coolheaded squad that shellacked Italy last week operated with precision and brutal efficiency . Redheaded Rod ( " Rocket " ) Laver , 23 , raised puffs of chalk along the base line with his accurate overspin backhands . Neale Fraser , 28 , hampered all year by a bad knee , forced the Italians into error after error with neatly placed volleys . Star of the team was wiry Roy Emerson . 25 , a tireless technician who plays like a blackjack shark : he does not hit hard , but he thinks fast and rarely makes an error of judgment . Last week Emerson got Australia off to a 1-0 lead by trouncing Pietrangeli 8-6. 6-4 , 6-3 . Then he teamed with Fraser to win the doubles , and rounded out his week 's work with a crushing 6-2 , 6-3 , 4-6 , 6-2 victory over Sirola . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Emerson &; Co. probably will not be around to defend the Davis Cup next year : at week 's end Fraser was already talking about retiring : Emerson and Laver insisted they had no immediate plans to turn pro . But these days , the top amateurs , both in the U.S. and Australia , almost always defect to the pros . But Australia plans for such losses . Ever since 1950 , the ever-changing Aussie roster has almost always been good enough to lick the rest of the world . The teams : <P> 1950-52 . For three straight years , the big silver punch bowl belonged to Frank Sedgman and Ken McGregor . Perhaps the best all-round shotmaker Australia has ever produced . Sedgman still plays part-time pro tennis , owns a gymnasium and squash courts in Melbourne . McGregor now runs an Adelaide sporting goods store . <P> 1953-56 . During the four years that they took over from Sedgman and McGregor , Australia 's brilliant Whiz Kids . Lew Hoad and Ken Rosewall , lost only once-to the U.S. in 1954 . In 1957 both players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hoad is the logical successor to No. 1 Pro Pancho Gonzales . A master scrambler , possessor of the game 's best backhand . Rosewall is a frequent winner on the rich pro circuit .
