It could be , in the grace of God , that I shall live to be 89 , as did Hokusai , and speaking my farewell to earthly scenes , I might paraphrase : " If God had let me live five years longer , I should have been a writer . " <P> Carl Sandburg did not need the ex tra five years . When he died last week at 89 - the same age as the early 19th century Japanese painter - on his goat farm near Flat Rock , N.C. , he was solidly established as a poet and historian . <P> Above all , he was a minstrel whose prose had the same resonating , twanging rhythms as his folk songs or his verse . Essentially , Carl Sandburg was an American troubadour . <P> " Family of Man . " The nation he sang was the bustling , brawling Amer ica of his Midwestern youth , a land of laborers , slaughterhouses and prairies . <P> Along with its music and anecdotal flow , his verse had the Whitmanesque " barbaric yawp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world " ) . Sandburg could also lilt a form of American haiku : <P> The fog comes On little cat feet . <P> He loved yarns , slang and " the people of the earth , the family of man .

" A kind of pseudo-folksy affectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never troubled the poet . He was an old-fashioned storyteller , and when an interviewer once mentioned modern poetry , Sandburg snorted : " I say to hell with the new poetry . Sometimes I think it 's a series of ear wigglings . " <P> Sandburg grew up in Galesburg , Ill. , where his Swedish father was a railroad worker . He quit school at 13 , hopped a westbound freight at 17 to see the land he was to celebrate . Later Galesburg 's Lombard College accepted him on the basis of a special qualifying examination . After studying there for nearly four years , he hoboed in the East , then became a newspaper reporter , a vocation he pursued on and off as a correspondent and columnist for Chicago dailies until 1945 . <P> In 1914 , Harriet Monroe 's Poetry magazine published " Chicago , " and Sandburg was recognized as a raw new
