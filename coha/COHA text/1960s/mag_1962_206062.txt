Last week President John Kennedy prepared to submit to Congress a record budget of more than $92 billion for fiscal 1963-and vowed that it would be in balance . But many economists and Congressmen had deep doubts . There have been only six budget surpluses since F.D.R. 's first inaugural-and 24 deficit years . The budget for fiscal 1962 , an Eisenhower-Kennedy hybrid , so far shows a deficit of $6.9 billion . In " balancing " the first pure-Kennedy budget , the Administration counts heavily on a higher tax take from rising corporate and personal income , and on congressional approval of a controversial rise in postal rates ( which could be gobbled up by postal wage rises ) . The Administration also assumes that there will be no extraordinary and unexpected defense spending-the very factor that caused the 1962 deficit . Most members of Congress feel that budget expenditures in 1963 will fetch up closer to $95 billion , with revenues running a few billion behind . <P> The steady rise of the U.S. budget points to a milestone that can not be far distant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-awaited half-trillion dollar mark in 1960. so the U.S. budget is headed for a less eagerly awaited pinnacle : $100 billion . If Kennedy 's next three budgets increase at the same rate as Eisenhower 's last three , the big day will arrive in 1964.
