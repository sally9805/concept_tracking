FOR THE UNION DEAD by Robert Lowell. 71 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $3.95 . <P> " The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows , " Robert Frost once wrote in a poem ; and another New Englander , Robert Lowell , has created a whole body of durable poetry on that notion . <P> Lowell is the poet par excellence of the particular . Too prosy for some tastes , he insists that poems must incorporate the prosiness of life ; poetry must be as important as prose . He ignores the usual poetical devices that are calculated to woo a reader , makes no concession to sound for its own sake . As he describes Hawthorne in one poem , his head is often bent down , " Brooding , brooding , eyes fixed on some chip , /some stone , some common plant , /the commonest thing , /as if it were the clue . " <P> The early Lowell was more flamboyant . His verse was intricately allegorical and grandly rhetorical , as in the killing of the great white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graveyard in Nantucket : <P> The death lance churns into the sanctuary , tears The gun-blue swingle , heaving like a flail , And hacks the coiling life out : it works and drags And rips the sperm-whale 's midriff into rags , Gobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather . <P> Eventually the seas subsided , the storm abated , and the majestic , tormented whale dropped out of Lowell 's poetry . In Life Studies , in fact , Lowell discarded the whole allegorical-religious baggage and became directly , fiercely , even embarrassingly , personal . The poems dealt with his immediate family : his father , whom he despised ; his mother , whom he tolerated ; his grandfather , whom he loved . His verse was often unfashionably raw and impassioned : <P> The nineteenth century , tired of children , is gone They 've all gone into a world of light ; the farm 's my own . . . Grandpa ! Have me , hold me , cherish me ! Tears smut my fingers . <P> Lowell 's latest book of verse , For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies , but Lowell is making his way back into the world again . The best of these poems have a compactness of phrase that evokes a time and a place with a vividness that comes from " meditation on the true and insignificant , " as in the poem , The Mouth of the Hudson : <P> A single man stands like a birdwatcher , and scuffles the pepper and salt snow from a discarded , gray Westinghouse Electric cable drum . He can not discover America by counting the chains of condemned freight-trains from thirty states . . . Across the river , ledges of suburban factories tan in the sulphur-yellow sun of the unforgivable landscape . <P> Yet Lowell 's grim landscape is relieved by people , people hallowed by compassion . Lowell 's compassion has been tested . Great chunks of his life have been spent in misery and in mental asylums ( an experience he has duly and dispassionately recorded in a poem ) . Now , for the first time , he has kind words for his father ; for Jonathan Edwards , symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " . . . yours the lawlessness/ Of something simple that has lost its law . " <P> There are poems of lost loves and broken marriages : <P> Everything 's changed for the best- How quiyering and fierce we were , There snowbound together , simmering like wasps in our tent of books !
