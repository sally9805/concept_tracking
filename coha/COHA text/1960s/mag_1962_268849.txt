For two years Lockheed Aircraft Corp . had known nothing but trouble . Its ill-starred Electra turboprop airliner tarnished the company 's name and lost it millions . Its eight-seat JetStar executive plane landed on the market with a thud , and in 1960 Lockheed rode into the red by $43 million . Then last September cancer killed Chairman Robert Ellsworth Gross , 64. who had gambled $40,000 to take over the failing company in 1932. and subsequently gave it not only a place in the sun but also a Constellation . Left to mop up the problems was his shy and schoolmasterly brother . Courtlandt Sherrington Gross , 57 . As Lockheed 's longtime president . Court Gross had always stood in the long shadow of Brother Bob , and more than a few airmen wondered whether he was up to the bigger job . <P> Last week new Chairman Court Gross won his wings . He reported that Lockheed snapped back in 1961 to ring up record profits of $26 million on record sales of $1,440,000,000 . Courage had a lot to do with the comeback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and JetStar losses in a single year ; that clobbered the company in 1960 but put it on solid financial footing thereafter . <P> More important , Lockheed made the decision to retreat from the up-and-down commercial-plane market , concentrate on defense production . That seemed like heresy in a day when most defense contractors are struggling to build more of their sales in civilian markets . <P> Money in the Payload . Much of the credit for the fact that Lockheed has become the nation 's No. 3 defense contractor ( behind General Dynamics and North American Aviation ) belongs to the late Bob Gross . In 1946-long before Sputnik - he swung Lockheed into the missile-and-space work that now brings half of its sales . Three-quarters of the payload orbited by the U.S.-including the Discoverer , Midas . Samos-has been lifted by Lockheed 's Agena space booster . Lockheed 's Polaris missile is the Sunday punch of the nation 's fastest-growing defense system , last year brought $372 million in sales for the company . <P> At the same time . Lockheed 's manned birds were flying high . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport and the F-104 all-weather jet interceptor brought 1961 sales of another $459 million . And Lockheed , the biggest beneficiary of the Pentagon 's new emphasis on brush-fire mobility and military airlift , last March won a contract to build the big military transport plane of the future , the 158-ton. 550-m.p.h . <P> C-141 . The award will be worth $1 billion during the 1960s.
