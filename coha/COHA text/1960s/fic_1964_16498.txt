FADE IN TO THE ROLLING OF DRUMS . HENDON AIRPORT . NIGHT LONG WIDE ANGLE ESTABLISHING SHOT of the airport . A highlevel military mission is about to arrive . Three black official cars wait on the grass by a landing strip . Their drivers , three young uniformed ENGLISHWOMEN , lounge in a group by one of the cars , smoking , chatting among themselves . A Captain of the U.S. Navy , SPAULDING , hurries down to the three women drivers , calls something to them . They quickly step on their cigarettes , and each hurries to stand at attention by her car . Now a DC-4 taxies slowly out of the darkness . The following legend appears briefly over this : Hendon Airport , England May 4 , 1944 Midnight ANOTHER ANGLE across the three drivers FAVORING EMILY BARHAM , a handsome Englishwoman of 24 . In background , the DC-4 has come to a halt . REAR ADMIRAL WILLIAM JESSUP and his team  --  CAPTAIN MARVIN ELLENDER , LIEUTENANT COMMANDER STANLEY " BUS " CUMMINGS , LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES MADISON , and CHIEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each carrying an attach case . Spaulding moves quickly forward to greet them . There is a brisk exchange of salutes and handshakes . The Admiral , Ellender and Cummings follow Spaulding to the cars . ANOTHER ANGLE , ACROSS Emily . A jeep and a 3/4-ton truck roll up to the plane out of the darkness . Four sailors begin unloading cases and cartons of everyone 's luggage from the plane . In particular , there is an enormous crate that requires the strength of all four sailors and two of the DC-4 crew to carry . Lt. Commander Madison , supervising the distribution of the baggage to the separate cars , busily signs bills of lading and other official documents . He shouts out greetings and dispenses last minute instructions to the staff .  --  3  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHi , Harry . Is everything set at the hotel ? ( to Admiral Jessup ) I 'll only be a few moments , sir . ( to crew ) Put that hand luggage in the automobile . ( to Adams ) Paul , put the footlockers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unloading should n't take long , so you 'll only be a few minutes behind us . I 'll see you back at the hotel . As Chief Petty Officer Adams approaches Emily 's car , lugging valises , sea bags and other duffle , she hurries to open the trunk of her car for him . Madison exchanges a few words with Admiral Jessup , already seated in the first of the cars , and then comes strolling down to Emily 's car . We see now that Madison is an agreeable young Navy officer in his late thirties . There is , however , something raffish about him which is not at all in key with the somber weightiness of this midnight mission . Indeed , as he passes the DRIVER of the second car , he gives her a good-natured pat . &nbsp; SECOND DRIVER ( smiles , whispers ) Hiya , Charlie . Emily 's eyebrows shoot up at this . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( across Emily to Adams ) All right , let 's go . Adams SLAMS the trunk shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive off .

MPs and soldiers hurry out from the hotel to help with the luggage .  --  4  --  ACROSS Emily , Madison dismisses the drivers of the other two cars . As he passes the DRIVER of the first car , he amiably pats her , too . &nbsp; FIRST DRIVER ( smiles at Madison ) Glad you 're back , Charlie . Emily 's eyebrows shoot up again . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( calling to Adams in car ) Let 's go around the back and wait for the truck . ( Adams nods . ) HOTEL SERVICE ENTRANCE . NIGHT Truck being unloaded . HOTEL BASEMENT Crates and cartons are carried by sweating sailors , with Madison directing the traffic to the service lifts . HOTEL , SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY Madison comes out of the service lift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain , TOM , an Englishman in hotel livery , stands in the open doorway watching . A large refrigerator has just been uncreated and stands in lofty isolation in the middle of the kitchen floor . Madison pokes his head in . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( to Floor Service Captain ) Hello , Tom . &nbsp; TOMNice to have you back in London , sir . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThank you .

Madison hurries down the hallway as more sailors and crates pour out of the service lift . HOTEL . NIGHT Emily stands by her car after the jeep and truck have been unloaded . Madison comes out of the hotel in the best of spirits . He signs the papers submitted to him by the drivers of the truck and jeep . As Emily watches him out of the corner of her eye , he stands on the sidewalk amiably drinking in the night air . After a moment , he ambles good-naturedly down to Emily , takes the trip-ticket she offers him and signs it , using a window of the car for a desk . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( smiles affably ) Well , get some sleep . As she bends to get into the car , Madison pats her bottom , more out of habit than anything else . However , this driver straightens and slaps his face a splendid , crisp slap . Emily gets back into her car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , Commander . Madison shrugs . Emily 's car roars off into the night . Suddenly , the ululation of air raid SIRENS fills the night . The lights of the hotel quickly black out . Madison darts a nervous look at the sky and hurries back into the hotel . To the ROLLING of drums and the EXPLOSION of bombs , a solemn legend rolls across the BLACK SCREEN :  --  6  --  In World War II , few men served their countries more ably than a small group of unheralded heroes known as " The Dog-Robbers . " A " Dog-Robber " is the personal attendant of a general or admiral , and his job is to keep his general or admiral well-clothed , well-fed , and well-loved during the battle . Every army and navy in the world has its " Dog-Robbers , " but , need- less to say , ours were the best . To these resolute procurers and luftsmenschen , this film is gratefully dedicated .

MADISONWell , let 's just make sure we read each other clear , Wade . I 'll  --  11  --  take care of you . But , Lieutenant , my Admiral sets a better table than anybody in the European Theater of Operations , including the Supreme Commander . I want the prime of everything you 've got in here . When I ask for steak , I mean aged , two inches thick , corn-fed , that you can cut with a sharp look . I 'm setting up house now .

There 's hardly space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petty Officer Adams is still unpacking . The closets are jammed with frocks , the bed piled high with dress packages , and the bureau obscured by boxes of hosiery , lingerie , soap and soap flakes .

Madison is perched on his bed , talking on the phone and sipping coffee  --  his lunch . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( on phone ) Avocado , avocado ! . . .

MADISONI need a girl , Sheila , a bridge-playing girl , very crusty , elegant , with British diction calculated to bring out the upstart in any American , who can handle herself at a dinner table and play bridge like an assassin . Whatever happened to Alice Luddens ? &nbsp; SHEILA ( holds the sheath against herself ) She married off , love . To a lieutenant in the paratroops . Ca n't be choosy , I suppose , if you 're a widow with two kids . May I try it on , Charlie ? Madison nods as he riffles through another of his countless notebooks . Sheila dashes off into the bathroom , unbuttoning her uniform , as Captain Harry Spaulding enters from the hall . He affects a cane . He pockets a bottle of perfume he finds on the dresser . &nbsp; SPAULDINGWell , the balloon 's going up any day now . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( looking down at Emily again ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cane ) D-Day , old man . The invasion of Europe .

Madison comes down to the car . Emily steps quickly on her cigarette and hurries to open the rear door . Madison makes a great show of pain . &nbsp; EMILYAn old wound , Commander ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( grimaces ) Yes . I caught a bit of flak flying for the RAF in 1940 .

I 'm grotesquely sentimental . I fall in love at the drop of a hat . That 's why I gave up hospital driving . All those men moaning in the back of the ambulance , especially the lot from Africa . I used to read to them in my off-hours . When they were healed and being sent back to the front , they 'd come looking for me in the ambulance garage to spend their last nights of leave with them .

We overtip , we talk too loud , we think we can buy anything with a Hershey bar . I 've had Germans and Italians tell me how politically ingenuous we are . Perhaps so , but we have n't managed a Hitler or a Mussolini yet . I 've had Frenchmen call me a savage , because I only took half an hour for lunch . Hell , Miss Barham , the only reason the French take two hours for lunch is because the service in their restaurants is lousy . And the most tedious of the lot are you British .

Really , I have n't seen an avocado in London for years ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWhen the Admiral entertains , he likes to have a surprise or two for his guests . &nbsp; NAMELESS BROADBut avocados. . . and out of season at that ! CUT TO : Madison , continuing to translate for Russian . &nbsp; BRITISH NAVAL OFFICERYou ca n't leave decent musicians wandering around homeless . There are so few really good ones as it is . An American MAJOR enters in background and goes to the bar . Madison spots him . On the way , Madison first gives instructions to Tom , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's keep the food moving , Tom . The Admiral wants the room cleared for bridge in two hours . &nbsp; TOMAs you wish , sir .  --  23  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( at bar ) Hello , Ted . I 've been looking for you . I dropped in to see your wife at the hospital in Washington . She 's really much stronger and says not to worry about her . &nbsp; MAJOR ( as they move away ) Thank you Charlie . That was very thoughtful of you and I appreciate it . ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S LIVING ROOM . TWO HOURS LATER ACROSS the bridge foursome . The Admiral and Madison are paired against Hallerton and Emily . In the background , the party is getting sexier . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPDoubled . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONRedoubled . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONPass . &nbsp; EMILYPass . General Hallerton as dummy lays out his hand on the table . Emily winces . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONDid I overbid ? &nbsp; EMILYWell , let us just say you have unbridled courage . Admiral Jessup leads a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play goes quickly and expertly . Without losing a second 's concentration , Jessup engages General Hallerton , now standing behind him , in conference . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPWillie , I do n't like the way the Navy 's been left out of the publicity in Overlord . I want extreme measures taken to publicize the Navy 's role in the Invasion . The President supports me in this . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONYes , we got your cables , Jessie , but I do n't know what you mean by extreme measures .  --  24  --  &nbsp; EMILY ( studying the cards ) Oh , dear , this is going to be a bloodbath . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI want a Marine division to be the first assault wave . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONGood Lord , you 're not dragging that old chestnut in . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPThe Marines are the traditional shock troops , and you know it . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONNot in the European Theater of Operations , they 're not . You Navy guys had all the headlines in the South Pacific , but Europe 's an Army show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI 've written the Supreme Commander about this . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONYes , that 's one of the reasons he 's out of town . You must be off your nut , Jessie , if you think the assault plans are going to be changed at this stage of preparation . You know when the balloon 's going up . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( pondering his hand ) What balloon ? &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONI 've been instructed to say we 'll put on a few more Navy staff officers at Supreme Headquarters , and we 're going to push the PRO people to send out more Navy releases . But the Supreme Commander wants it clear , Jessie , that he considers this inter-service competitiveness in very bad taste . He 's having enough trouble keeping the English and French in line . Admiral Jessup gathers in a trick and then lays the rest of his hand down . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPYou 're down four , Willie , doubled , redoubled and vulnerable . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTON ( sitting down , scowling ) A Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who deals ?  --  25  --  ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S LIVING ROOM . STILL LATER Admiral Jessup stands at the window looking out . The party is breaking up . The Admiral mumbles to himself , or at least it seems that way . Madison comes out of the room . He starts to cross to the bridge table where General Hallerton sits , meticulously rechecking the scores of the games . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTON ( standing unhappily ) Thirty-four bucks , all right . Two waiters have entered from the hall . With a gesture , Madison indicates he wants the room cleared and begins his farewells to the last few guests . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONGeneral Waterson , your car 's ready . Cummings intercepts him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( whispers ) The champagne , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONIt 's being chilled . I 'll leave it outside your door in half an hour . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( looking around the room ) Where 'd she go ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI sent her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( to General Hallerton ) At Admiral Jessup 's request , I 've had the Scotch House send you three yards of tweed , General . It 's for Mrs. Hallerton . &nbsp; GENERAL HALLERTONIt wo n't get him his Marine division , Charlie , but it 's generous of him anyway . Thank him for me. ( exits ) By now , the last guests , General Waterson with Sheila and Emily , are congregating by the door , putting on the coats .  --  26  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONGood night , sir , Sheila . They exit , with Emily the last straggler . Madison crosses to her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThere 's a car downstairs for you , Miss Barham . If you 'd like me to take you down ? &nbsp; EMILYNo thank you . I 'll manage . I had a lovely evening , Commander . Please ask me again . She follows General Waterson and Sheila out . The waiters finish clearing away . Madison closes the door on them all . Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no doubt of it now . He is mumbling to himself . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONSir ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( turns ) What ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI thought you said something to me , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPYou 're losing your mind , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYes , sir . I 'll lay out your night clothes , sir . He crosses to the Admiral 's room . The Admiral turns back to the window . ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S BEDROOM Madison enters . He turns on the bed lamp , turns off the overhead light and turns down the bed with deft , familiar movements . He glides into the bathroom , draws the Admiral 's tub . He comes out , extracts an old-fashioned nightshirt and sleeping cap from the bureau drawer , and lays them neatly across the bed . The Admiral enters , unbuttoning his jacket . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPWas I very rude , leaving all the goodbyes to you , Charlie ?  --  27  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONIt was n't noticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it onto a hanger , slips it into the closet . He bends and retrieves the Admiral 's slippers , whisks a bathrobe off a closet hook , and crosses back into the bathroom where he turns off the tub and leaves the robe and slippers . When he comes out , the Admiral has stripped off his shirt which Madison takes . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI 've got the damnedest headache . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'll fix you a drink before your bath , Admiral . The Admiral strips off his undershirt . Madison takes it and neatly folds it and the shirt onto a chair . The Admiral straddles a hard-back chair , rests his chin on his forearms . Madison begins massaging the Admiral 's shoulders . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPCharlie , in seven weeks I 've got to go back to Washington and testify before the Joint Committee on Military Affairs . On the agenda is a review of the Army 's new Long-Range Bomber program and there 'll be speculation as to whether that does n't make carrier-based aircraft obsolete . In short , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Corps 's coming out of this war as the darling of the services  --  the Army and its Air Corps . The Navy will be the runt of the litter . They 'll scrap us like they do after every war . They 'll limit our capital ships , reduce our crews to cadres , strip us back to Pearl Harbor level . And then they 'll scream how ill-prepared we are when somebody hits us with another Pearl Harbor . All Washington is bug-eyed over this invasion of Europe , and this invasion of Europe is an all-Army show . That 's why we 're here , Charlie , to remind the Congress of the United States and the American public that this invasion is also a Navy show . ( chuckles ) I just threw in that Marine division for openers . They turned me down and now they owe me something . But what ? I do n't know what to shoot for , but I 've got to come up with something . It 's driving me crazy . Charlie , fix me something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONSure , Admiral .  --  28  --  Madison turns from his massaging and exits into the living room . ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S LIVING ROOM Madison enters , moving to the improvised bar . He quickly mixes a drink and returns to . . . ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S BEDROOM Madison enters with a drink . The Admiral moves about the darkish room , muttering to himself . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( barely audible ) Sure , George , sure , sure  --  support that damned peanut  --  damn Chinese  --  Communist five years , George  --  five years the most . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( extending the glass ) Here 's your drink , sir . The Admiral crosses past Madison and goes into the bathroom , muttering , seeming not to notice him . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP --  moderates , boy , moderates  --  you 're on the nose there , George  --  land reform , take the steam out of it  --  only damn Army in China anyway  --  He disappears into the bathroom , closing the door . Madison is left standing with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and calls out . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'll leave your drink on the bedroom table , sir . There is no answer . Madison shrugs and crosses back into the living room . ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S SUITE , LIVING ROOM Madison pauses to dump a loaded ashtray , overlooked by the waiters , into a trash can , then goes into his own room .  --  29  --  MADISON 'S BEDROOM Madison enters the dark room , stops in the doorway , framed in the rectangle of light , his face registering mild surprise . ACROSS Madison to his bed . Emily is perched on it , legs crossed and hands folded patiently in her lap . She smiles up at Madison in the doorway . REVERSE ANGLE across Emily to Madison in the doorway . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONCome to think of it , I do n't have a girl . CLOSE-UP of Emily . &nbsp; EMILYI do n't have a man . ( stands , smiles ) Do you think we can keep it on that level ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those things , you and I. I can see that . &nbsp; EMILYI like your spirit , Commander . She slips happily into his arms . They kiss many times . Madison kicks the door behind him shut . The room is now lit only by moonlight . Between kisses , they murmur . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm not your type , you know . &nbsp; EMILYLike hell you 're not . They kiss , clutch at each other . It 's a hungry scene . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'd have thought you 'd fancy heroes , and I 'm yellow , honey , clear through . &nbsp; EMILY ( whispering ) That 's your most attractive quality . They sink into bed .  --  30  --  &nbsp; EMILYI 've had it with heroes , Charlie . Every man I 've loved has died in this war , but you 'll never get caught in the shooting . That 's one thing I 'm sure of . You ca n't imagine how attractive that makes you to me . She tears at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONEasy , tiger , that 's a tailored shirt . &nbsp; EMILY ( affably ) Oh , shut up , and let me kiss you . They wrap themselves ravenously around each other . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( delighted ) What a savage . For a moment , the screen is filled with the bobbing and weaving of the two heads and the four shoulders of the lovers as they assail each other with embraces . Suddenly , the door to the hallway in background is thrust open , and a SHAFT of LIGHT shoots into the room , bathing Madison and Emily with light . The two lovers slowly extricate themselves from their sinuous embrace and turn to see what this interruption is . Framed in the doorway against the light of the hall is the Admiral . He makes an odd figure , dressed as he is in an old-fashioned nightshirt , with sleeping cap askew on his brow , especially here as he shouts at the two startled lovers . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPThe first dead man on Omaha Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor ! Put your mind on that , sir ! He abruptly exits into the hallway , slamming the door behind him . REVERSE ANGLE to Madison and Emily on the bed . They are both staring blankly at the CAMERA , where the Admiral had been standing . &nbsp; EMILYDear me , what was that about ?  --  31  --  Madison sits up slowly . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( befuddled ) What did he say ? &nbsp; EMILYI think he said the first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor . That 's a very piquant thing to say , do n't you think ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( stands ) Yes , I think I 'd call that piquant . He crosses to the doorway , opens it , peeks out into the hallway . &nbsp; EMILY ( on the bed ) Does he do that often ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( looking up and down the empty hallway ) No , I ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a minute , will you please . HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE ADMIRAL 'S SUITE Madison closes his bedroom door . He moves thoughtfully past the living room entry to the Admiral 's door and knocks gently . There is no answer . After a moment , he opens the door tentatively . The Admiral , in his nightshirt , sits on his bed . He looks up . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPHello , Charlie . The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor . Think about that for a minute . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( closing the door ) In what reference , sir ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPYes , the unknown sailor . Let me kick that around in my own mind a bit . I want the whole team in my office at o-nine-hundred hours tomorrow morning to discuss just that . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONTo discuss just what , sir ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPArrange that , Charlie . O-nine-hundred hours , the whole team . Goodnight , Charlie .  --  32  --  The Admiral switches off his bed lamp , plunging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly to sleep . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYes , sir . HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S SUITE Madison comes out , closing the door . He stands a moment , perplexed to say the least . Then , he moves still another door down , stops in front of Cummings ' room , and KNOCKS sharply . LT . COMMANDER CUMMINGS ' ROOM The room is very dark , lit only by moonlight . Two bodies leap from the bed . They are Cummings with his clothes in disarray and a NAMELESS BROAD with no clothes on at all . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( stuffing his shirttails in ) Who is it ? &nbsp; NAMELESS BROAD ( muttering imprecations ) Ruddy Americans , always barging in in this ruddy hotel . The door opens , and Madison takes a step into the room . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONBus , the screwiest thing just happened . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSFor Pete 's sakes , Charlie , close the door , will you ? The Nameless Broad , frantically trying to hide behind Cummings and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; NAMELESS BROADRuddy Americans , have n't got the ruddiest clue to what privacy means . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( closing the door ) The Admiral just barged into my room in his nightshirt , Bus , and yelled at the top of his lungs : " The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor ! "  --  33  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSAll right , Charlie , what 's up ? I mean , you see the obvious state of affairs here , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm telling you . I think the Admiral 's flipped a braid . He just came charging into my room , yelling : " The first dead man on  --  " &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie , for Pete 's sakes , I mean . . . ( He indicates the naked girl muttering behind him . ) &nbsp; NAMELESS BROADRuddy circus , the whole ruddy place . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSTomorrow morning , what do you say , Charlie ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONTomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team in his office to discuss " The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor . " &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYeah , swell , great . Tomorrow morning , Charlie . &nbsp; NAMELESS BROADWhere 's my ruddy shoes ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONAll right , I 'll see you tomorrow . He turns and exits . Cummings glowers . The Nameless Broad continues with her indistinguishable imprecations . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( to the Nameless Broad ) I think Charlie 's flipped a screw . &nbsp; NAMELESS BROADThis hotel 's a ruddy circus , if you do n't mind me saying . . . FADE OUT . Section Details FADE IN : GROSVENOR SQUARE . DAY WIDE ANGLE SHOT showing an endless convoy of Army trucks and Jeeps inching along South Audley Street .  --  34  --  NAVY BUILDING , ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S OFFICE Admiral Jessup , spruce , shining and apparently sane , stands at the window looking down on the convoy . After a moment , he turns from the window . REVERSE ANGLE ACROSS Admiral Jessup to his team : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Petty Officer Adams sitting about the office , a sparse room decorated with a picture of President Roosevelt and one of Admiral King on one wall . A second wall is entirely covered by a large map of Great Britain and Western Europe . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPWe 've got about a month . ( He moves to the wall map . ) I want a movie made showing the Navy 's contributions to D-Day , from the procurement of vessels to the actual landings . Gentlemen , four thousand ships and boats  --  battleships , destroyers , landing crafts , spitkits , excursion steamers , channel boats , private yachts , tugs , tubs and Chinese junks  --  four thousand vessels !  --  the greatest armada ever assembled by man !  --  is going to cross that channel . And what 's more , they 're going to have to do it at night , across one of the nastiest pieces of water in the world , the English Channel . And every inch of that channel is mined in the bargain . It 'll be the most incredible Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd have had the world in his pocket . It 's the Navy that is the essence of victory in this invasion . I want a movie that makes that clear . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWell , sir . . . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI especially want a movie to show the Navy Demolition Units who are going to be the first men in on those beaches . Casualties are estimated at fifty percent in the first waves . A lot of brave men are going to die on D-Day , gentlemen . I want a movie made that shows the first brave man to die on those beaches was a sailor . The phone RINGS . Cummings picks it up . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( on phone ) This is Admiral Jessup 's office .  --  35  --  &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPIf that 's Sir Roger Charlton 's office , I 'll be there directly . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( on phone ) Yes , sir , he 'll be there directly . He 's leaving now , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want done . I want a photography team assigned to the demolition engineers to record their activities on film right up to the beaches . I 'm leaving this in your hands , Bus . I consider it urgent . Any questions ? He crosses to the door to Cummings ' outer office , pauses . The members of his team purse their lips and avoid each other 's eyes . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWell , sir , there are already six Navy photography teams assigned to the first assault wave . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI do n't care about any other photography teams . I want one of my own to record the heroism of those Navy engineers . I want this film made , Commander . Now , you get some Photographer 's Mates and start making it . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPAny questions ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSNo , sir . Nobody else says anything , so the Admiral exits . A moment of silence fills the room until the CLICK of the outer door is heard . Cummings stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cockamamie assignment ? &nbsp; ELLENDERHe 's been getting these eccentric flashes ever since his wife died last year . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( reaches for the phone ) Yeah . Well he 's got something in the back of his mind . I better check around and see if there are any unattached  --  36  --  Photographer 's Mates around . ( to Madison , now leaving ) Where are you going ? Madison waves an airy goodby and exits . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( calling after him ) Call in around noon , Charlie . LONDON STREET IN ST . JOHN 'S WOODS . DAY It is an uncharacteristically sunny morning for London . Madison , carrying two candy boxes , comes down the street of pleasant middle-class houses , each embedded in charming gardens and isolated by neatly-chopped hedges . Half the peaceful street , however , has been shattered by bombing , and parts of walls are all that remain of some of the houses . At the near end of the street , Madison finds one that is still intact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMILY 'S HOUSE . DAY Madison raps the clapper on the front door . The door behind Madison opens . He turns from looking at the neighborhood to face his hostess . CLOSE-UP of Emily in the open doorway , smiling like a well-fed cat . She 's clearly a woman in love . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHello , Emily . &nbsp; EMILYHello , Charlie . You 're just in time for tea . CLOSE-UP of Madison . He 's in love , too . Obviously , last night went off very well . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( entering the house ) Thank you . EMILY 'S HOUSE , FOYER Madison comes into the darkish anteroom , and Emily closes the door .  --  37  --  &nbsp; EMILY ( notes the box he 's carrying ) You 've brought me some chocolates . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( proffering the parcels ) Two boxes of Hershey bars . &nbsp; EMILY ( annoyed ) Well , that 's very American of you , Charlie . You just simply had to bring along some small token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turns , annoyed , starts for the living room , then turns on the threshold . &nbsp; EMILYYou Yanks ca n't even show affection without buying something . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( following her ) Well , do n't get into a state over it . I just thought you liked chocolates . &nbsp; EMILYI do . But my country 's at war , and we 're doing without chocolates for the while . And I do n't want oranges or eggs or soap flakes either . Do n't show me how profitable it will be to fall in love with you , Charlie . Do n't Americanize me . Madison stares into the living room . MADISON 'S P.O.V. : The living room is flooded with family photographs and portraits . On the piano alone are some ten framed photographs of various sizes , showing men in uniform for the most part . On the wall hangs a portrait of a stern , gray-haired man in his sixties , wearing sashes of honor across his chest and a variety of medals . &nbsp; EMILYThat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Got the Victoria Cross for that . He died in an air raid a week after that portrait was painted . That 's my brother there . ( She indicates a photograph on the piano . ) His name was Charlie , too , by the way . He was shot down during the Blitz . Sacrificed himself to save his squadron . The one you 're looking at now is my husband . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( holding a photograph ) He looks like a rake . &nbsp; EMILYYes . He was very bawdy . I was insane about him . He died at  --  38  --  Tobruk . The rest of the lot there are cousins . There 's two of them still living . I must say the family 's been thinned out nicely one way or another . She takes Madison 's arm and speaks confidentially . &nbsp; EMILYCharlie , before we go out to my mum , I must tell you she 's just a bit mad . You 'll like her very much , she 's very funny . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they were still alive . Just go along with her . You do understand . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONOh , I get the point . You do n't want my Hershey bars . &nbsp; EMILYYes . I think it profane to enjoy this war . She starts for the French doors to the garden . As she reaches for the knob , Madison stops her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYou know , I never realized what a sensual satisfaction grieving is for women . &nbsp; EMILY ( stiffens ) I 'm not sure that was a very tasteful thing for you to say . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm not sentimental about war . I see nothing noble in widows . &nbsp; EMILY ( smiles ) You 're jealous of my husband . I like that . She opens the French doors , and they go out . EMILY 'S HOUSE , GARDEN Emily and Madison come into the garden . Emily 's mother is seated at a small garden table , pouring tea . MRS . BARHAM is a tweedy lady in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . BARHAMYou 've brought chocolates ! Two whole boxfuls . What a treasure trove !  --  39  --  &nbsp; EMILYI 've already refused them , Mother . ( Everyone sits and gets comfortable . ) &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONOn ascetic grounds . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMYou 're an absolute flagellant , Emily . &nbsp; EMILY ( sipping tea ) Oh , take the things if you want them . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMWell , I shall have one later . I 'll save the rest for your father . ( She whispers conspiratorially to Madison . ) I take it you 're Emily 's new lover , since she has n't bothered to introduce us . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( whispers ) You must be her mother . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMAh , you 've found the chink in my armor , have you ? What are your religious beliefs , sir ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm a practicing coward . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMThat is very fervent of you . &nbsp; EMILYI should 've known you two would get on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( sipping tea ) Actually , before the war , I was an assistant night manager of a diplomatic hotel in Washington , D.C. &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMWhatever made you say that ? &nbsp; EMILYOh , Lord , I 'm beginning to feel like Alice at the tea party . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMShh . The Commander is about to tell us of a religious experience , I think . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYes . Before the war , I was an assistant night manager of a diplomatic hotel in Washington , D.C. It was my job to arrange things  --  40  --  for many of the great historical figures who came to Washington on great historical missions . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMWhat exactly did you arrange ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONUsually , I arranged girls , but individual tastes varied , of course . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMOf course . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWell , it 's useful work , anyway , especially in a war . I was offered all sorts of commissions in the Army and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Admiral Jessup phoned me to join his staff . But , I had always been a little embarrassed by my job at the hotel and wanted to do something redeeming . Have you noticed that war is the only chance a man gets to do something redeeming ? That 's why war 's so attractive . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMYes , war is very handsome , I quite agree . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONAt any rate , I turned down Admiral Jessup 's offer and enlisted in the Marines as a private . I even applied for combat service . My wife , to all appearance a perfectly sensible woman , encouraged me in this idiotic decision . Seven months later , I found myself invading the Solomon Islands . There I was , splashing away in the shoals of Guadalcanal . It suddenly occurred to me a man could get killed doing this kind of thing . The fact is , most of the men splashing along with me were screaming in agony and dying like flies . I do n't think any of them wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the odds on getting killed are pretty good in the Marines . To make it more grotesque , their wives , sweethearts and mothers had all applauded their acts of suicide , and their children were proud of them for it . It was then I realized how admirable war was , the most admirable act of man . Those were brave men dying there . In peacetime , they had all been normal , decent cowards , frightened of their wives , trembling before their bosses , terrified at the passing of the years . But war had made them gallant . They had been greedy men ; now they were self-sacrificing . They had been selfish ; now they were generous . Hell , war  --  41  --  is n't hell at all . It 's man at his best , the highest morality he is capable of . He sits back , crosses his legs , sips his tea , pleased with his long statement . The women wait expectantly for him to go on , and after a moment , Mrs. Barham speaks up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just leave us there , splashing at Guadalcanal ? &nbsp; EMILYNever mind all that . What 's all this about a wife ? Madison sets his teacup down , leans back , folds his hands across his chest , and studies the clear sky . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThat night , I sat in the jungles of Guadalcanal , sopping wet and waiting to be killed , and all because there 's a madman in Berlin , a homicidal paranoid in Moscow , a manic buffoon in Rome and a group of obsessed generals in Tokyo . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMBy George , he 's right . They 're all batty . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI said to myself , " Charlie , you 're as nutty as they are . Worse . At least , they 're not sitting here in a jungle , waiting to be killed . " It was then I had my blinding revelation . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMAh ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI discovered I was a coward . That 's my new religion . I 'm a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , cowards do n't fight wars . They run like rabbits at the first shot . If everybody obeyed their natural impulse and ran like rabbits at the first shot , I do n't see how we could possibly get to the second shot . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMThat seems perfectly sensible to me . &nbsp; EMILYMother , he 's just being facile .  --  42  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONIt 's not war that 's insane , you see ; it 's the morality of it . It 's not greed and ambition that makes wars ; it 's goodness . Wars are always fought for the best of reasons , for liberation or manifest destiny , always against tyranny and always in the interests of humanity . So far this war , we 've managed to butcher some ten million humans in the interest of humanity . The next war , it seems , we 'll have to destroy all of man in order to preserve his damn dignity . It 's not war that is unnatural to us ; it 's virtue . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . So , I preach cowardice . Through cowardice , we shall all be saved . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAM ( stirred almost to tears ) That was exalting , Commander ! Absolutely occult ! &nbsp; EMILYNever mind the metaphysics , Commander . Let 's get back to your wife . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( sipping his tea ) Well , needless to say , that first night in the jungle , I wrote to Admiral Jessup , saying in essence , " For heaven 's sakes , get me out of this ! " Two weeks later , I was transferred back to Washington . I raced home to my wife . . . &nbsp; EMILYAnd found her with another man . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONOh , Lord , no . My wife , who had deceived me before the war more times than I care to think about , was now having the time of her life being faithful . She was furious with me for coming back . There was no reason for her being virtuous anymore . She promptly sued me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Self-Preservationist , you see , and she was a High Anglican Sentimentalist . &nbsp; EMILY ( satisfied ) Well , you 're fair game then . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMAfter every war , you know , we always find out how unnecessary it was . After this one , I 'm sure all the generals will dash off to write books about the blunders made by other generals , and statesmen will publish their secret diaries , and it will show beyond a  --  43  --  shadow of a doubt that the war could easily have been avoided in the first place . The CAMERA EDGES IN on Mrs. Barham as her face suddenly clouds with pain . She is no longer the outlandish British dowager . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAM ( murmurs ) And the rest of us are , of course , left with the job of bandaging the wounds and burying the dead . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI do n't trust people who make bitter reflections about war , Mrs. Barham . It 's always the generals with the bloodiest records who are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's always the war widows who lead the Memorial Day parades . &nbsp; EMILYThat was unkind , Charlie , and very rude . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( quite serious ) We shall never end wars , Mrs. Barham , by blaming it on ministers and generals or warmongering imperialists or all the other banal bogies . It 's the rest of us who build statues to those generals and name boulevards after those ministers . It 's the rest of us who make heroes of our dead and shrines of our battlefields . We wear our widow 's weeds like nuns , Mrs. Barham , and perpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices . My brother died at Anzio . . . &nbsp; EMILYI did n't know that , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( not taking his eyes from Mrs. Barham ) Yes . An everyday soldier 's death , no special heroism involved . They buried what pieces they found of him . But my mother insists he died a brave death and pretends to be very proud . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMPerhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHe 's dead , Mrs. Barham . He was killed at Anzio , an occasion for grief , even anger . But why pride ?  --  44  --  &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMYou 're very hard on your mother , Charlie . It seems a harmless enough pretense to me . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONNo , Mrs. Barham . You see , now my other brother ca n't wait to reach enlistment age . That will be in September . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMOh , Lord . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONIt may be ministers and generals who blunder us into wars , Mrs. Barham , but the least the rest of us can do is to resist honoring the institution . What has my mother got for pretending bravery was admirable ? She is under constant sedation and terrified she might wake up one morning and find her last son has run off to be brave . I do n't think I was rude or unkind before ; do you , Mrs. Barham ? &nbsp; MRS . BARHAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better push off , Emily , if you 've got to get to work . &nbsp; EMILY ( starting off with Madison ) Give my best to father , then . &nbsp; MRS .

Emily takes a solicitous step to her mother . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMNo , do go , Emily . I 'd much rather be alone . I mean it . She looks full face at Madison , her eyes filled with tears . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMYou 're a very kind man , Commander . I hope you 'll come again .  --  45  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

Admiral Hoyle is bent over , clutching his sides , stamping about . Admiral Healy is sitting on a hard-backed chair , a helpless heap of laughter . Admiral Jessup is weaving about the room , barely able to gasp out a story he is telling . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP " Hey ! " says this master-at-arms , " Hey , you cadets there in the bushes . . .

Oh ! . . . GROUP SHOT of the Admirals : Jessup and Healy slumped on the bed , Hoyle straddling a hard-backed chair . Three old bull walruses .

The Joint Committee on Military Affairs is holding hearings at the end of June .

Every Senator in Washington is infatuated with  --  48  --  strategic bombing . You do n't win wars with strategic bombers !

It 's a vision of blissful domesticity . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYou know something strange is happening to me . I 'm beginning to like tea . Cummings enters from the living room . In the background , we hear a muffled shouting . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie , you 'd better come in here .

MADISONOkay , Bus , I 'll take care of him . You see to Admirals Healy and Hoyle . The Admiral opens his eyes . At the door , Cummings watches , concerned . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( murmurs ) Charlie , I want you to make this movie for me . I want you to take charge , Charlie . I want you to make this movie for me . Madison looks up slowly as he removes the Admiral 's shoes .

DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT of movie house . The marquee is blank except for the words : FOR MILITARY USE ONLY . CURZON STREET THEATRE , AUDITORIUM Madison enters . Cummings and Ellender are slumped in their seats in an otherwise empty auditorium . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWe might as well see some of this film before the Admiral comes . The houselights go down . A shaft of light shoots out of the projection booth , and on the screen , we see the leader running through . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThis is the combat engineers in training .  --  52  --  He takes a seat near the others . On screen , a roughly-printed credit suddenly appears : COMBAT DEMOLITION ENGINEERS  --  RESTRICTED . &nbsp; NARRATION ( off-screen ) This is a beach somewhere on the west coast of Wales . It has been prepared to be an exact duplicate of the beaches of France where the invasion of Europe will take place . Every foot has been mined .

Here , on this secret beach in Wales , the Navy Engineers train for their hazardous duty . An explosion on the screen blasts through the theatre . Madison looks back to the screen . On the screen we see a squad of demolition engineers splashing through shoulder-high water . &nbsp; NARRATION ( off-screen ) This is only a dry run . On D-Day , these engineers will be under heavy mortar and artillery fire . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThanks a lot . &nbsp; ELLENDERShut up , Charlie , I 'm trying to watch the picture . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYou wo n't like it , Marv . It got lousy reviews .

The Admiral leans forward in the seat behind Madison . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPThat fact , Charlie , is exactly what I want clearly recorded on film . I want you and your photographers to get into the water with those engineers and film their activities right up to the beaches . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWould you like us to start the movie again from the beginning , sir ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( standing ) No , I 've got to run . You 're on the right track , Charlie .

MADISONI would like to be relieved of this assignment , sir . It seems like a lot of risk to take for no particular reason , sir . The temperature in the empty theater drops about forty degrees as the Admiral examines Madison with an icy look . Ellender , who has been dozing , wakes up . Cummings , who has been sitting , now stands . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI 'm ordering you to make this film , Commander . That 's reason enough . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

It 's devious . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWell , you tried the forthright frontal assault , and you pretty near got yourself court-martialled , stripped of your commission , and sent to the Arctic Circle to do polar research . Man , you do n't tell Two-star Admirals you do n't approve of their orders . Now you 're on the Admiral 's brig list , so I 'll assign you to Exeter and Portland or one of those other channel ports for the purpose of making preliminary investigations , and just stay out of the Admiral 's sight . I 'll assign Emily as your driver . And you just have yourself a vacation . Now do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then at Ellender , dozing off in his chair . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

Sussex should be lovely this time of year . Section Details THE ROLLING DOWNS OF SUSSEX . DAY The LANDSCAPE of the rolling downs on a lovely June afternoon is a particularly idyllic scene , with a small herd of sheep grazing on a high ground , and a stream overhung with shady trees . A punt , poled by an indistinguishable male , drifts lazily into view . The man turns out to be Madison in his Navy trousers with the cuffs rolled and his shirt open at the collar . Emily , in a skirt and sweater and flourishing a parasol , reclines against pillows in the bow . A picnic hamper sits in the middle of the punt . An Edwardian pastoral . Emily , eyes closed , is utterly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's too bloody love-ly , really it is . " &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( having his troubles steering the punt ) Well , she 's not doing the bloody poling . &nbsp; EMILYIt 's defiant , is it ? Just give it a big push . Madison thrusts the pole into the bank with the intention of pushing strenuously off , but the soft earth of the bank yields and the pole slips . Madison almost pitches into the river . The punt lunges out into midstream and slides softly across to a heavily-shaded little island in the river . Emily laughs . ISLAND IN THE RIVER . DAY Emily , holding her parasol and followed by Madison carrying the picnic hamper , climbs a small grassy knoll , obviously for the use of picnicking lovers . Little eruptions of laughter escape her , and she has to wipe the tears from her eyes . She sinks down onto the grass , her shoulders shaking silently . Madison sets the hamper down and stands looking down at her . She bursts helplessly into an unleashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie staring helplessly up at the sun glinting in fragments through the overhanging foliage , laughing as if she had finally remembered the mechanics of it . Madison looks down at her , very much in love . CLOSE-UP of Emily lying on the grass , eyes closed , as the spasm slowly subsides . Finally , a long last sigh shudders through her . Her eyes open slowly , and she stares up at Madison , as he sits beside her . &nbsp; EMILY ( murmurs ) Oh , Charlie , Charlie , Charlie . . . TIGHT TWO SHOT as they embrace on the grass . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI love you , Emily . &nbsp; EMILYHow many more weeks do we have , Charlie ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThree , maybe four . I know the Admiral has to be back in Washington by the end of June .  --  57  --  &nbsp; EMILYOh , Lord , I hope I do n't get pregnant .

Madison reaches over for his jacket on the ground a few feet away . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHave you ever given any thought to getting married ? Emily abruptly stops crying . &nbsp; EMILYYou really do cut to the core of things , do n't you . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( extracting some papers from his jacket ) I 've got some Navy marriage applications here . &nbsp; EMILYCharlie , let 's be sensible about this . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONEmily , we 're both nuts about each other ; let 's get married . &nbsp; EMILYBut we 're essentially incompatible , Charlie . Do n't leer ; it 's got nothing to do with that . It 's our fundamental approaches to life . We 're poles apart . I have this ingrained British morality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're a shameless coward , selfish as a child , interested only in what 's in it for you , and pretty ruthless about getting it . For all your charm , you 're a scoundrel , Charlie .

MADISONThere 's a lot of things I 'd die for , Emily  --  my family , my home , my country . But that 's love , not principle . Now , if I were to bring a  --  58  --  raging lion into the house and wrestle it just to prove I 'd die for you , that would be highly principled of me . But what 's a lion doing in a man 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , shut up . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

I do n't know why , but I feel I need a few hours alone with this . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONSure . They are both embarrassed by her reluctance . They avoid each other 's eyes .

He closes the rear door , and now the driver 's door , leans on the open window , and he and  --  59  --  Emily regard each other with the bemused smiles of intoxicated lovers . Madison leans on the car window toward Emily behind the steering wheel . &nbsp; EMILYCharlie , I 've been so silly . Of course I 'll marry you . I 'll give you the signed documents in the morning . I love you so much . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONLord , I hope you do get pregnant . He withdraws from the window , turns and drifts up the steps into the hotel .

MADISON 'S ROOM Madison enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft chair by the bed , an incorrigibly self-satisfied smile on his face . There is a white 8 12 paper on his bed .

He reads the sheet disinterestedly for a moment , but , bit by bit , his attention is involved . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWho ? What ? What ? What is this ? He stands , moving a step into better light and finishes reading the mimeographed paper . Then , turning on his heels , he strides past the crates and cartons to the door leading to the . . .

I 'm looking for something to put on . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSThis is my best friend , you dotty witch , not the house detective . Now , just stand at attention while Commander Madison and I confer . The Nameless Broad , naked as a jaybird , stands to attention in the background . Cummings sits wearily down on the edge of the bed . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you 're away all the time , I have to dig up my own girls , and I sure get some beauts . Now , Charlie , the Admiral came into my office yesterday and said , " I want Madison immediately assigned to a demolition unit . " So I cut your orders . You and your camera crew will report to the Port Commander at Portland at twenty-two hundred hours on the fourth of June . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONTomorrow is the fourth of June . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSI know the fourth of June is tomorrow . Just fill in the names . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

What 's the matter with you , Bus ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSI know you do n't have any camera crew , but by ten-hundred hours tomorrow morning , I 'll have cut flight orders for this camera crew you do n't have on the nineteen-hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMINCH , SHAEF , COMNAVEU , COMLANCRABEU and for the Port Commander Portland PORLANCRABEU . It 'll take me at least two hours just to rescind those  --  62  --  orders , let alone draft you new flight orders , new requisition orders , new pay orders , new . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONAll right , do n't get so swept up by the sheer artistry of it all . Look , these orders specifically state I 'm assigned to the Sixth Naval Engineer Unit . It makes this whole silly movie official Navy business , with a copy each for COMINCH , SHAEF and PORLANCRABEU . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie , the balloon 's going up any day now . The Admiral 's been down in Southampton at Supreme Command more often than he 's in town this last week . Charlie , trust me . Within a week , this whole movie thing will slowly disappear into the swamps of Navy red tape . Madison appears reasonably mollified . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONAll right . Listen , can you assign Emily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSThe Lake District ? &nbsp; NAMELESS BROAD NO. 2Oh , it 's lovely up there . Cummings looks wearily to the Nameless Broad , still standing at attention in the background . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( grumbling to Madison ) This one really takes the cake , Charlie . Look , we do n't have anything in the Lake District . How about Cornwall ? Land 's End . Rocky cliffs overlooking the sea . It 's very romantic . We 've got an amphibious training base in Falmouth . I could assign you there . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONSounds very nice . We 'll take it . He starts for the door , then pauses , with his hand on the knob . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( matter-of-factly ) Oh , Bus , I 'm going to marry her .  --  63  --  Cummings , sitting on the bed , looks slowly up .

The whole works , formal Annapolis wedding , arch of sabers and everything .

MADISON ( deeply fond of Cummings , despite the latter 's impulse to intense sincerity ) Thank you , mate . I 'll see you tomorrow morning in the office . He opens the door . Cummings administers one more comradely poke in the shoulder . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSSee you tomorrow morning , buddy . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONOkay , buddy .

We received a second cable yesterday afternoon from Norris . Jessie , the North Pole project is going to go right down the drain unless you raise a little hell again . Jessie . . . Ellender pauses in his pitch and just stares at the Admiral . An odd humming SOUND begins to suggest itself into the background . &nbsp; ELLENDER ( showing concern ) Jessie . . . CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLIES from behind the Admiral to BEHIND Captain Ellender until we see what the Captain is seeing .

Madison and Cummings are busily at work , when the Admiral 's door opens : Ellender appears in the doorway , visibly upset . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

Madison and Cummings look up . &nbsp; ELLENDER ( barking ) I said , come here a minute ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( on phone ) I 'll call you back . He hangs up .

The three aides step back into Cumming 's office . Cummings quickly closes the Admiral 's door . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSHe 's supposed to be in Southampton in an hour at a meeting of the Joint Supreme Command . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONAre you out of your mind ? That poor man 's in a schizophrenic state . We 've got to get him to a hospital . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYeah , I suppose you 're right .

Cummings opens the door of the office and goes in . CAPT . SPAULDING 'S OFFICE Cummings enters , nervously closing the door after himself . Spaulding , who is Admiral Healy 's administrative aide , has an office identical to Cummings ' .  --  67  --  &nbsp; SPAULDING ( at his desk ) Hiya , Bus . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSListen , Harry . Something serious just happened . I think Admiral Jessup has just gone mad . He 's really flipped . Now would you tell Admiral Healy about this right away . &nbsp; SPAULDING ( looking up from his work ) Admiral Healy 's on his way to Southampton with Admiral Jessup in about five minutes . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSNo , no no ! Admiral Jessup is n't going to Southampton . Harry , now this is urgent . Admiral Jessup has cracked up . &nbsp; SPAULDINGWhat do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUS CUMMINGSI mean he 's cracked up . He 's sitting on the floor of his office right now in a trance . Spaulding regards Cummings quizzically . &nbsp; SPAULDINGDo I read you right , Commander ? Are you saying that Two-star Admiral William Jessup has cracked up ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYou know , Harry , you 're a pompous ass . &nbsp; SPAULDING ( stands ) This better not be a gag . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSDo you think I 'd joke about a thing like this ? &nbsp; SPAULDING ( coming around the desk ) The Service takes a dim view of Lieutenant Commanders who go around calling the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy a nut . Cummings wrenches the door open and hurries out into the hallway , followed by Captain Spaulding , who has paused to collect the cane he affects . HALLWAY OUTSIDE SPAULDING 'S OFFICE Cummings and Spaulding come out and stride down to Cummings ' office .  --  68  --  The Admiral comes out of that office and up to Spaulding 's office . He is carrying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( as they pass each other ) Hello , Harry , Admiral Healy ready ? &nbsp; SPAULDING ( continuing on to Cummings ' office ) He 's waiting for you , sir . Admirals Hoyle and Magnuson are in his office . Spaulding and Cummings realize Admiral Jessup has just gone by , and Spaulding does a complete turn and starts back after the Admiral . Then , he does another turn to find Madison and Ellender coming out of Cummings ' office . &nbsp; SPAULDINGNow , what the hell is this all about ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHarry , Admiral Jessup 's a very sick man , and . . . &nbsp; SPAULDINGYou know , this sort of joke is tasteless enough from you two . . . ( He turns to Cummings who is confused. ) . . . but from an Academy man , it 's obscene . He follows an unhappy Cummings into . . . CUMMINGS ' OFFICE Cummings enters , followed by Spaulding , Madison and Ellender . &nbsp; SPAULDINGYou shore sailors ought to be sent out on a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUS CUMMINGS ( erupting ) All right , Spaulding , I 've had just about enough of your bilge ! This blowhard here did four months as a mess officer in the South Pacific , and he 's been spouting old sea-salt ever since . Well , I did n't ask for a desk job . I 've applied for line duty seven times , and you know it ! And do n't start pulling Academy on me . I was a cadet four-striper ; you never made more than midshipman adjutant of a lousy battalion .  --  69  --  &nbsp; SPAULDINGThis outburst is bad joss , Commander , bad joss . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWell , do n't start jacking me up like you were my senior cadet officer . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONListen , while you two schoolboys . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( wheeling on Madison ) And I do n't want to hear any more cracks about us schoolboys ! You civilian sailors seem to think there 's something funny about a man taking pride in his service ! Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am damn proud of being an Annapolis man , sir ! He wheels back to Spaulding , throws a whacking sharp salute . Spaulding returns a whacking sharp salute , turns crisply on his heels and strides out of the office . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONLook , fellows , right now the Admiral is on his way to South . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( still fuming ) I did n't ask for this lousy desk job ! I 've got bad eyes ! Now what can I do ? Do you think I want to tell my kids that on D-Day , their father was shacked up at the Westchester Hotel ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONFor Pete 's sakes , Bus ! The door suddenly opens , and Spaulding reappears . He is quite somber now . The others turn to him , sensing something has happened . &nbsp; SPAULDINGAdmiral Healy wants to see you , Bus . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWhat happened ? &nbsp; SPAULDINGI do n't know . They took Admiral Jessup back to his hotel . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLENDERWe better get over to the hotel , Charlie .  --  70  --  &nbsp; SPAULDINGNo , stay here . Healy may want to see you both too . They 're getting a doctor for him . He follows Cummings who is hurrying out of the office . A moment of silence . Madison sits on a chair . Ellender strolls to the window and stares out . &nbsp; ELLENDERWell , that 's the end of your silly movie anyway , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( depressed ) Yeah . Poor old guy . ADMIRAL HEALY 'S OFFICE Admiral Healy sits behind his desk , and Cummings stands at formal ease in front of it . Admiral Hoyle sits to the side of the desk , and a third admiral , ADMIRAL MAGNUSON , leans against a wall . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALY ( squinting at Cummings ) A movie ? A movie designed to show the first dead man on Omaha Beach was a sailor ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , sir . Captain Spaulding enters from his own office with a letter for Admiral Healy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd letter from the Under Chief of Naval Operations in today 's pouch . That 's what I was asking Jessup about when he went wild . Captain Spaulding returns with a file folder which he places before Admiral Healy . The Admiral extracts a paper . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HOYLEIt 's nearly twenty of ten , Tom . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALYYeah . He reads from the letter .  --  71  --  &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALYEt cetera. . . et cetera. . . et cetera . . . The President expressed interest in some moving picture Jessup is making . Apparently , Jessup has written directly to the President about this . I wish Jessup would keep me informed , even on these little private projects of his . ( scowls and reads on ) Also , at the end of the meeting , Harry Begley , the President 's assistant , made reference to a Tomb for the Unknown Sailor . Healy puts the paper down and looks across to Cummings . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALYWhat Tomb for the Unknown Sailor , Commander ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSI do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in communication with the President or Harry Begley . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALY ( to the other Admirals ) Do you know anything about a Tomb for an Unknown Sailor ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL MAGNUSONI assume Jessup meant the first dead sailor on Omaha Beach to be the sailor in the tomb . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALYWhat tomb ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSThe Tomb for the Unknown Sailor , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALYThere is no Tomb for . . . Oh , I see . I take it this is another one of Jessie 's projects . ( hands the file back to Spaulding ) This movie about the demolition engineers , Commander , is such a movie being made ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSNot really , sir . We 've . . . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALYWell , get it made . ( Healy stands . ) I want this incident closed , and I want it closed fast . I do n't want anything that 's happened to get outside of this office . We all know what some members of Congress and the newspapers could make out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't want the name of one of  --  72  --  the finest men in our country stained by one unfortunate incident . I do n't want even the President of the United States to know about this . Put together some kind of a movie , Commander , that I can give to Mr. Begley and that he can show to the President , who will then write Admiral Jessup a polite note , and this whole unhappy matter will be closed . ( Healy puts on his hat and goes to the door . ) Harry , I want to be informed every hour about Admiral Jessup 's condition . &nbsp; SPAULDINGYes , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL HEALY ( followed out by the other Admirals ) A hell of a day for this to happen . Cummings and Spaulding salute the departing Admirals crisply . The Admirals return the salutes laconically and exit out through Spaulding 's outer office and into the hallway . &nbsp; SPAULDING ( as he crosses into his own office ) Now what is so crazy about a Tomb for the Unknown Sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( pensive ) Yeah , it does have a kind of a ring to it , does n't it ? CUMMINGS ' OFFICE Madison and Ellender rise as Cummings enters . &nbsp; ELLENDERHow 's the old man , Bus ? Cummings nods but says nothing . Rapt in thought , he moves slowly around to sit behind his desk . At last , he looks up at Madison . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYou know , Charlie , the President has expressed an interest in Admiral Jessup 's movie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONNaturally.  --  73  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSThe Navy has committed itself to this movie , and it 'll be pretty damned embarrassing if it is n't made . So , Charlie . . . ( stands and regards Madison earnestly ) . . . we 're going to make that movie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThat 's very spunky of you , Bus . Cummings comes around his desk , beams at Madison , and gives him a comradely poke on the shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You and I are going to get on that twenty-one-hundred flight to Portland this evening , and we 're going to make that movie . I 'm going in on this with you , buddy . I 'm cutting orders for the both of us right now . Madison exchanges a look with Ellender but says nothing . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( poking Madison again on the shoulder ) Damn it , Charlie , it 's exciting , is n't it ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWill you quit giving me those comradely pokes ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSThis is it , kid ! This is the big show , and we 're going to be in there for the first shot ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( regards Cummings warily ) Just how did you and I suddenly become the Charge of the Light Brigade , Bus ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie. . . ( moves to the window , stares out , seeing a vision ) . . . there 's a lot more to this movie than we knew about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently , the Admiral 's idea is to build a Tomb for the Unknown Sailor , and to put the first dead man on Omaha Beach into it . The idea is almost too much for Cummings . His eyes blink with tears , and his spectacles cloud with moisture . Madison and Ellender , on the other hand , find this new thought a little too much to take in one gulp . Madison looks blankly at Cummings , then turns and moves slowly to a chair .  --  74  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONA tomb for the what ? &nbsp; ELLENDERWell , that 's a new one on me too . Cummings turns stiffly on the other two . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSAll right , sailors , that 'll be all . ( yanks open a drawer , pulls out a stencil sheet , angrily rolls it into his typewriter , and types away ) The Navy wants this movie made , so it 's going to be made . So you just get back to the hotel , Charlie , and pack your gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-one-hundred flight to Portland . That 's an order , Commander . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONA Tomb for the Unknown Sailor ! Holy Cow , Bus ! Cummings pauses in his typing to regard Madison . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie , you and I have had it too easy . I think we 've forgotten we 're officers in the United States Navy . It 's not up to us to approve of our orders , even if those orders mean risking our lives . ( rips the stencil from the typewriter ) These are your orders , Charlie . You 'll have a mimeographed copy in half an hour . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'll risk my life for my country , Bus . But this movie 's just an unnecessary piece of Naval public relations , and I wo n't risk my life for that . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( quietly ) You have your orders , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( just as quietly ) Well , I 'm not going to do it . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , or I 'll put you on charges , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThen you just put me on charges , Bus . The phone RINGS . Cummings picks it up .  --  75  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( on phone ) Admiral Jessup 's office . . . Oh yes , sir . . . We 'll be there directly , sir . ( He hangs up and stands . ) They want us at the hotel . He puts on his hat and goes into the hallway , carrying the stencil with him . Madison and Ellender are still seated . We look through the open doorway to Cummings in the hallway . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( calling out ) Sailor ! Take this down to mimeograph ! He exits the frame . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONTomb of the Unknown Sailor . Holy Cow ! &nbsp; ELLENDER ( standing , reaching for his hat ) He 's in one of his Annapolis moods , so for heaven 's sakes , Charlie , hold your temper . Madison shouts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADISONWell , I 'm not going to do it , Bus ! I 'm not going to do it ! HOTEL , MADISON 'S ROOM CLOSE-UP of Madison , hissing in a violent whisper . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm not going to do it , Bus ! WIDE ANGLE SHOT shows Madison bent over to Cummings who is perched on the window sill , staring out over Park Lane , his face frozen in fury . Ellender is slouched in the soft chair , nursing a scotch . The scene is played in whispers so as not to be overheard , but this does not diminish the intensity of the moment . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONBus , I 'm in love . I 'm in love like I never thought possible . Life is especially dear to me right now , and I 'm not going to leave mine on some beach in France just to satisfy your grotesque sense of service loyalty . ( He storms away , then storms back to Cummings , hisses . ) You do n't really think I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this ? I ca n't believe you 're serious , Bus . If it 's the Navy 's public image that concerns you , just think what this will look like in the newspapers . The first dead man on Omaha Beach . The Tomb of the Unknown Sailor . What a hurricane Drew Pearson could make out of that ! You must remember that small off-shore squall he kicked up the time General Patton slapped that soldier . Cummings turns slowly from looking out the window and stares at Madison , at first shocked , and then in utter contempt . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( stands ) Madison , you 're despicable . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( throws up his hands ) This is insane ! How did we ever get into this ? ( He turns back to Cummings . ) Now , Bus . . . He is interrupted by a ringing slap across the face administered to him by Cummings , who now trembles with emotion . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( his voice quivering ) You 're not fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches out and rips one of Madison 's shoulder epaulettes from its mooring . Madison stares at him dumbfounded , then at Ellender . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWell , that was pretty baroque , would n't you say , Marv ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYou 're a coward and a scoundrel . If you want to make anything of that , I 'll be in my room . He turns and goes to the door with as much dignity as he can manage , considering he gets his sleeve caught on a crate and he stumbles over a low carton on his way out . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( calling after him ) I 'll send my second with a choice of weapons . Cummings exits , slamming the door . Madison sits wearily on the bed . He is actually quite hurt by Cumming 's outburst .  --  77  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( after a moment ) Well , Marv , it 's your turn . Would you like to break my saber over your knee and snip off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Drew Pearson , and you know it , Charlie . You 're much too fond of the Admiral , and you 're much too decent to expose that old man to public ridicule . Caught off-guard , Madison stares down at the floor . &nbsp; ELLENDERYou 're going to have to find a better angle out of this than that . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm supposed to be on a plane to Portland at nine o'clock this evening . Bus and I are supposed to report to the Port Commander at Portland at eleven o'clock tonight . That 's not much time to think up angles . &nbsp; ELLENDERYou 'll think of something . The door to the living room opens , and a NAVY DOCTOR stands in the doorway . &nbsp; THE DOCTORThe Admiral would like to see you in his room , Commander . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( stands ) Is he all right ? &nbsp; THE DOCTORHe 's fine . Madison follows the Doctor into the living room . ADMIRAL JESSUP 'S SUITE , LIVING ROOM The Doctor and Madison cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADISON , pausing in the doorway , sees the Admiral sitting on a chair in  --  78  --  his nightshirt . In the dimly lit curtained room , the Admiral seems suddenly a fragile old man with watery old eyes . Madison , behind him , massages the old man 's neck and shoulders . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( smiles weakly ) Well , it seems I cracked up , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThat 's the price a sane man pays in this world , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPThey say a few days in the hospital . I would n't mind , except that I 'll have to miss the big show . Admiral Kirk asked me to observe from his flagship . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYes , I know , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPIt 's tonight , you know . The balloon goes up tonight . I except you 've already heard that by now . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWell , we all knew it was imminent , sir , but we did n't know it was tonight . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . Madison is about to shift his hands to the other shoulder when something in him snaps . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThe first boats push off at twenty-one-thirty hours , sir ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPWell , the Irish-based transports will start earlier , of course . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 've never licked military time , sir . Twenty-one-thirty hours  --  that 's half-past nine in the evening , right ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPRight . Madison begins massaging the Admiral again , his mind clicking away . After a moment , a slow smile settles on his face .  --  79  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONNow , that 's what I call an angle . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPDid you say something , Charlie ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONNo , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPWatch yourself , Charlie . You 'll be cracking up yourself soon . Madison nods , continues massaging . CUMMINGS ' ROOM Madison enters . The room is fairly dark , the curtains drawn . Two bodies leap from the bed . Needless to say , they are Cummings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirttails . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSClose the door ! Before Madison can make a move , Cummings strides to the door . Shirttails flapping , he slams it shut . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSAnd do n't turn on the lights ! And what do you want ? Madison looks down at the floor , scuffs his feet . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONBus , I. . . I do n't know how to tell you , but . . . ( looks up slowly ) I 'd like to apologize for my contemptible behavior before . . . I 'd like another chance and . . . well , I 've packed my gear . . . well , we 've got a job to do , and I 'm ready to do it . The Nameless Broad , in the background , sits casually on the bed , legs crossed and studying her fingernails . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( with a proud smile ) Underneath it all , you 're a pretty gutsy guy , are n't you , Charlie .  --  80  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over me before . I showed the white feather , I suppose . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( gripping Madison 's shoulders ) Oh , forget about it , Charlie . &nbsp; NAMELESS BROAD NO. 3 ( lighting a cigarette ) Could you ring up for some food , love ? I have n't had my lunch yet . The two men do n't hear her . They are swept up in an emotion greater than that between a man and a woman  --  the comradeship of brave men . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI know we do n't have much time , Bus , but could I have leave to say goodby to my girl ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSOh , for Pete 's sake , Charlie , of course . You 're making a big dramatic deal out of this . You do have a tendency to be overly sincere , you know . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYes , I guess I do . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYou 've got seven hours yet . Take Emily to lunch . Pick me up around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the airport . Would you like that ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( simply ) Thanks , Bus . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSAll right , man . Do n't be so dramatic about it . What is it , raining ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYes , just started . Now , it is Madison 's turn to poke Cummings a comradely poke on the shoulder , after which he slips out into the hallway . pp. 46-64 &nbsp; pp. 81-94 LONDON COUNTRYSIDE . RAINY NIGHT A Navy Chevrolet buckets through the sloshing rain of a June night .  --  81  --  GATES AT HENDON AIRPORT . RAINY NIGHT The car pulls up to the MP at the gates of the airport . Cummings shows the beslickered MP his credentials through the rear window of the car . The gates open , and the car drives into the area . HENDON AIRPORT , A LANDING STRIP A DC-4 waits in the foreground , standing on the strip in the rain , as the Navy Chevrolet pulls up in background . ACROSS Emily in the driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie , you still have a couple of minutes to say goodby . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

Emily suddenly turns in her seat to Madison . &nbsp; EMILY ( cries out ) Charlie ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( pulling his overnight bag out of the car ) What ? Emily opens her door and flings herself into his arms . &nbsp; EMILYWrite to me . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWhat do you mean , write to you ? With any luck I 'll be back in London for lunch tomorrow . He looks across to the DC-4 where Cummings is standing in the open door of the plane , watching the lovers ' farewell . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHoney , let me make it clear again . I could n't make this invasion if I wanted to . The demolition engineers will have shipped out a good two hours before Bus and I even report in . The Port Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts . I 'll see you tomorrow .  --  82  --  Emily is for some reason put out . &nbsp; EMILYIt 's like you were taking an overnight business trip . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWell , that 's what it amounts to . If I ca n't book a flight , I 'll catch an afternoon train . &nbsp; EMILYWell , it 's a hell of a D-Day , that 's all I can say . To be honest with you , Charlie , there 's something very unpleasant about this little deceit you 're pulling on the Navy . You 've been cackling away all afternoon , as if the Invasion , in which the fate of nations and the lives of millions of men are at stake , is nothing more to you than a private joke . I just keep thinking of all those men trooping onto all those ships tonight , wondering if they 'll end up bodies on a beach . Madison , who had taken a step to the plane , now takes a step back . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHoney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bodies on a beach tomorrow . I 'm cackling because I 'm not going to be one of them . &nbsp; EMILYAnd you 've been pulling poor Bus Cummings 's leg all the way out here in the car . The poor fellow really thinks he 's going off on a gallant mission , and you led him on , and I think cruelly . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI did n't lead him on . I just did n't stop him . &nbsp; EMILYYou could have told him before there was n't a chance of getting there on time . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONIf I told him before , he 'd have arranged an earlier flight , and , if I tell him now , he 'll never forgive me for not having told him before . Honey , we 're both getting drenched . He strides off , gets halfway to the plane when she calls him again . &nbsp; EMILYCharlie , I ca n't marry you .  --  83  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( sighs ) I 've been waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . &nbsp; EMILYI do n't want to see you when you get back . I do n't want to see you again . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONLook , Emily , I will not be brushed off in a driving drizzle and with my plane about to take off . &nbsp; EMILYOh Charlie , for pity 's sake . We both know it 's finished . Let 's break it off now , in one snap , before we say things we 'll regret . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONNo , let 's say them . There should be something we regret . &nbsp; EMILYVery well ! I despise cowardice . I detest selfish people , and I loathe ruthlessness . Since you are cowardly , selfish and ruthless , I can not help but despise , detest and loathe you . That 's not the way a woman should feel about the man she 's going to marry . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONDo n't be facile , Emily . &nbsp; EMILYI am not being facile . I 've been up all bloody night , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed them . They 're in my purse . I was going to give them to you this afternoon when you came prancing in with this very funny joke you 're playing on Bus and the Navy and your country and the whole bloody world . Well , I suppose I 'm an incorrigible romantic , but I feel the joke 's on me too , for I believe in honor and service and courage , in fair play and cricket , and all those other symbols of the British character which have civilized half the world . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYou British plundered half the world for your own profit . Let 's not pass it off as the Age of Enlightenment . &nbsp; EMILYYes ! That 's the American way of looking at it , is n't it ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONEmily , let 's not get into one of these " the trouble with you Yanks " things . It 's got nothing to do with it .  --  84  --  &nbsp; EMILYIt 's got everything to do with it ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't want to see you again ! She flounces into the car behind the wheel and slams the door shut . Madison stands dripping in the rain , regarding her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONGeneral Kitchener aside , Emily , all that 's going on here is a woman trying to shake off her lover . If you do n't love me , just say so . Emily bursts into tears , hiding her face in her hands . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONNobody gets moral unless they 're trying to get something or get out of something . Well , you 're trying to get out of marrying me . If you do n't love me , say so . ( he waits ; she turns away ) Otherwise , I figure you 're just frightened . &nbsp; EMILY ( wheeling on him ) Frightened of what ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONFrightened of getting married . &nbsp; EMILYDo n't be an ass . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONThe weekend passion is over , and now it 's down to signing applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit yourself to life now , Emily , with its disease and desolation and its startling satisfactions . I do n't want to know what 's good or bad or true . I let God worry about truth . I just want to know the momentary fact of things . Life is n't good or bad or true ; it 's merely factual ; it 's sensual ; it 's alive . And my idea of living , sensual facts is you , a home , a country , a world , a universe in that order . I want to know what I am , not what I should be . Well , the fact is I 'm a coward ; I never met anyone who was n't . &nbsp; EMILYI 'm not . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONYou 're the most terrified woman I 've ever met . You 're even scared to get married .  --  85  --  &nbsp; EMILYI 've already been married . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONSure , you married him three days before he went to Africa . Thank God he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last nights on furlough . That 's about the limit of your commitments , one night , a day , a month . You prefer lovers to husbands , hotels to homes . You 'd rather grieve than live . &nbsp; EMILYYou 're not only cowardly and selfish ; you 're remarkably cruel as well . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONCome off it , Emily . The only immoral thing you 've got against me is I 'm alive . Emily opens the car door , steps up to Madison , and regards him with actual hatred . &nbsp; EMILYI 'm going to slap your face , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONGo ahead . I wo n't hit you back . I 'm a coward . She slaps his face smartly . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONOn the other hand , I 'm selfish and I do n't easily give up what 's mine . You 're mine , Emily , and I 'm not going to let you go . She slaps him a second time . Madison rubs his sore cheek , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADISONAll you have to say is " I do n't love you . " Emily 's face is streaked with tears . &nbsp; EMILYI do n't love you , Charlie . At the open doorway of the waiting DC-4 , Cummings looms into view . He has to smile at the sight of the two lovers in the rain . By George , it does look like farewell on Waterloo Bridge from here .  --  86  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( calling out from the plane ) Hey Charlie , it 's time to go . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWell , you 're a good woman . You 've done the morally right thing . God save us all from people who do the morally right thing . It 's always the rest of us who get broken in half . You 're a bitch . He turns and strides off , fumbling in his pockets for something . Halfway to the plane , he turns . He seems to be chewing on something . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI want you to remember that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating a Hershey bar . Emily stands stiffly by her car , as Madison strides to the airplane where Cummings and the crew help him clamber up into it . Section Details PORT OF PORTLAND , THE HARBOR . RAINY NIGHT The harbor is a madhouse of activity in the dark , rainy night . Out on the water , an ominous shadowy fleet .

A BOATSWAIN 'S MATE enters and leaves the door ajar so that the gray morning light diffuses into the room . Madison is waking now . He gets up on one elbow , regards the Boatswain 's Mate , now checking off a list . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHow 's the Invasion going , Bosun ? &nbsp; THE BOATSWAIN 'S MATE ( looking up briefly ) They called it off , sir , did n't you know ? The Boatswain 's Mate goes back to his list . Madison sits up , stretches , yawns .  --  88  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

But the Boatswain 's Mate has picked up a pile of blankets and is out the door . Madison remains sitting on the cot in his shorts , slowly adjusting to the new day . Suddenly it hits him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( shouting after the Boatswain 's Mate ) What do you mean , they called it off ? What are you talking about ? He stands , aching in every bone from the uncomfortable sleep . Barefooted and in his shorts , he strays across the room to the open doorway . Madison 's eyes blink against the daylight . Then a look of utter , mute astonishment spreads over his face .

( fully dressed , groomed and carrying an Eyemo camera , hurries up the rise in ground from the docks ) I 've dug up one camera , anyway , Charlie .  --  89  --  He comes up to the doorway , where Madison is still trying to gather his wits . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSLet me in , Charlie . Madison , not believing his eyes , steps back to let Cummings hurry into the supply room . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWhat happened ?

The two sailors unsteadily enter . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILOR ( grumbles ) Commander Madison ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( takes another belt at the bottle ) Yeah . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILORWe were told to report to you . Madison regards the two other drunks blearily . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

Hey , maybe you men better have a drink of this . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILORSure . The two sailors unbutton their slickers , shamble over to the desk , pull up chairs and join Madison . For a moment , nothing is said . The bottle is passed from one to the other , and each takes a swig . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILOR ( studying the nearly empty bottle ) We 're running a little low here . Madison silently produces another bottle from behind his desk , uncorks it with enormous concentration . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E.

We get into the water with them . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILORWhat for ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWe 're going to make movies . We 're going to shoot movies of those engineers clearing the mine fields and barricades all the way to the beach . Mostly , we want to shoot movies of engineers getting killed , especially the first body that washes up on Omaha Beach . That 's the deal . What do you think of that , mates ? The Old Sailor , who has been listening to all this without expression , reaches for the bottle and takes another belt . Madison takes another belt . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILORCommander , I think you 're out of your ever-loving mind .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that again . &nbsp; THE YOUNG SAILOR ( suddenly stands ) Well , men , I 'm cutting out .

MADISONThat 's a camera . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILORHow do you work it ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONHow the hell do I know ? &nbsp; THE OLD SAILOR ( opening the camera ) Well , this is a pretty intricate camera . Back home I got a little old eight millimeter Bell and Howell . I never saw anything like this before . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( suddenly standing ) Well , that 's what they gave me . He weaves aimlessly around the room , not quite sure why he stood up in the first place . &nbsp; THE YOUNG SAILOR ( not even bothering to stand ) Well , men , I 'm cutting out . The Old Sailor squints at the open camera in his hand and the Young Sailor belts away at the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE OLD SAILORI 'll tell you one thing . You got to put film in this camera .

The L.S.T. rolls and washes in the waves . Madison is pulled to the top of the gunwale and is helped over into the lower deck by infantrymen and sailors .

In the foreground are the Old Sailor and the Young Sailor , apparently already derricked aboard , and sitting slumped against the gunwale amid a pack of similarly seasick and miserable INFANTRYMEN .

He exits . Cummings leans across Madison to fetch a revolver belt and holster from the bunk . He takes out the .45 , checks its movement , puts it back in the holster , and buckles the belt around his waist . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSMen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read you a message from our Supreme Commander . He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket . Madison stretches out on the bunk with an anguished sigh . The Old Sailor stands , staring bleakly down at his feet . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( reading ) " Soldiers , sailors , armies of the Allied Expeditionary  --  99  --  Forces . You are about to embark on a Great Crusade toward which we have striven these many months . The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere go with you . . . " MID-CHANNEL , L.S.T. RAIN . DAWN HIGH WIDE-ANGLE SHOT looking down on the deck of the L.S.T. , now the scene of considerable excitement and activity . The men are all on their feet , checking their equipment . Officers and non-coms move around the deck , shouting : " Sergeant , line those men up ! "  --  " All right , get in those trucks ! "  --  " Navy Engineers to the bow ! "  --  " Get over there ! "  --  A high Tennessee twang rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you men to check your goddam equipment one more time !

ANGLE SHOT looking up from the water to the L.S.T. as an L.C.V.P. is being lowered over the side . Another L.C.V.P. is already in the water , along-side , bucking and tossing . All around , other L.C.V.P. 's are being lowered , and men are climbing down the nets on other L.S.T. 's . The air is filled with shouts and curses . It is still quite dark out , and the scene is grotesque . A scream rips out of the night , and then a shout . " He fell ! He fell ! " A patrol boat streaks through the melange of assault boats . A loudhailer suddenly bursts out in the night air : " Keep in line ! Keep in line ! " On the lower deck of the L.S.T , Cummings , Madison and the Old Sailor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( to Madison ) All you have to do is pull this trigger , and that starts the camera . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( too miserable to do anything but complain ) Miserable rain .  --  100  --  In the background , Infantrymen are loading into the ducks . A public address system suddenly blares out . &nbsp; P.A. SYSTEMNow hear this ! Okay , First Division ! Get in there , and give ' em hell ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( looking widely about ) Where 's the kid ? &nbsp; THE OLD SAILORHe 's too sick , sir . &nbsp; LT . J.G. OF DEMOLITION UNIT ( calling to his men ) All right , men , first demolition team over the side and into the boats ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( to Madison ) All right , Charlie , this is it ! Two L.C.V.P. 's swash and pitch alongside , smashing up against the side of the L.S.T. The climbing nets and ladders are filled with Demolition Engineers , the bottom men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of the boat on the waves . Madison clambers over the rail . Suddenly , a scream , almost in his ear . He turns , terrified . An L.C.V.P. has suddenly washed high up against the L.S.T. and has crushed against the descending engineers . Shouts : " Move ! Keep moving you stupid nut ! " etc . SHOOTING UP from the L.C.V.P. pitching wildly alongside , as Madison , clutching his camera , jumps . TIGHT SHOT looking down on Madison lying on the deck of the L.C.V.P. , eyes closed and clutching his camera . A wave splashes over the boat , drenching him . Over all this , we hear the constant BOOMING of the naval artillery . 7,000 FEET FROM THE BEACHES . DAWN LONG WIDE ANGLE SHOT shooting out from the beaches to the Channel . The sky is still dark gray , but dawn is breaking slowly . We can see more clearly now the vast conglomeration of L.C.V.P. 's and other beaching craft chugging slowly in towards us from across the choppy sea . Behind them , the hulking L.S.T. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats scoot between the mess of slowly oncoming craft . Loudhailers BLEAT out : " Keep in line ! Keep ' em moving ! Keep ' em moving ! " etc . Far behind  --  101  --  it all we can see the flashes of the big naval guns as they continue their relentless barrage . 5,000 FEET OUT , ABOARD THE L.C.V.P. DAWN Photographer 's Mate Enright stands in the bow of the L.C.V.P. , his camera braced on his shoulder , shooting back to the stern of the boat , his CARRIER behind him . Dawn is breaking more quickly . Enright is standing , braced against the pitch and toss of the boat , his camera pressed against his face . His Carrier , Cummings and the Ensign are also in the bow . In the foreground are Madison , the Old Sailor , and six Demolition Engineers , seated wet and shivering . Madison is absolutely numb with cold and wet and just plain terror . Cummings and the Ensign stare straight ahead to the beaches . The rain drizzles down , and nothing but white mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward on a sudden swell of water . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( shouting ) About how far out are we ? &nbsp; ENSIGN ( shouting back ) Maybe five , maybe six thousand feet . We should see the low-water mark any time . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( shouting to Madison ) We 're about five , six thousand feet out , Charlie ! A BOATSWAIN 'S MATE of the engineers stands up midship . &nbsp; BOATSWAIN 'S MATE ( yelling to the engineers ) All right , let 's get up front . &nbsp; ENSIGN ( shouting ) There 's the low-water barrier ! Now , in the gray-white mist , washed by waves of dark water , there can just be seen , some five hundred feet ahead , thick ends of iron and steel rails poking out over the sea-line.  --  102  --  &nbsp; ENSIGN ( shouts ) Stand by to lower the ramp ! Engineers crowd into the frame to look over the bow . &nbsp; FIRST ENGINEERHow 're we going to get at the damn things ? &nbsp; SECOND ENGINEERWe 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mortar and 88s firing from ahead . &nbsp; ENSIGNThey 're shooting at us ! A German flare explodes high over them and bleaches the last remnants of night . Cummings cups his mouth and shouts something . &nbsp; THE OLD SAILOR ( lurching up to the bow ) I ca n't hear you ! &nbsp; ENSIGNLet down the ramp ! The engineers splash out into the water which comes up to their necks . Splashing , struggling , they edge forward toward the low water barricade which now looms up in front of the L.C.V.P. It consists of a six-foot barricade of jagged iron and steel rails , wired and mined . The engineers shout instructions at each other : " Get on my back ! "  --  " Frank , shinny up that damn pole ! " etc . In the L.C.V.P. , Cummings is pushing a numb , half-frozen Madison to the bow-ramp . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm freezing ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSLet 's go ! Let 's go ! &nbsp; ENSIGN ( shouting at the Engineers ) Blow something up ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard although everyone is shouting . The air is one continual thrum of EXPLODING shells and naval artillery . The sky flares with red , yellow , incandescent bursts . Engineers splash through the water . A  --  103  --  barricade is blown up . Rifle and machine gun FIRE adds to the ineffable din . Suddenly , the L.C.V.P. is nearly struck by an 88 shell , and the whole boat , with its ramp open , is swept right into the air and through the newly-breached barricade towards the beach . Madison , Cummings and the Old Sailor are pitched into the air and come swirling down , gasping for breath , thrashing about on the beach side of the barricade . TIGHT SHOT of Madison thrashing about in the water , gasping for air , still clutching his camera . He looks desperate . MADISON 'S P.O.V. : Not more than a thousand feet directly ahead of him stretches the naked , white , unoccupied stretch of sand called Omaha Beach . Its clean white expanse is covered with steel jackstraws , wooden stakes and long fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all obviously sinister . Madison stands knee-deep in water , staring at the beach , clutching his camera . He promptly wheels about-face and begins splashing away from the beach and back to the L.C.V.P. about five hundred feet to his seaward side . 2,000 FEET OUT , ABOARD THE L.C.V.P. DAWN WIDE ANGLE SHOT looking seaward through the open ramp of the L.C.V.P. , singles out Enright , braced against the jamb of the ramp , filming furiously . ENRIGHT 'S P.O.V. : We see what he is filming . Madison is splashing his way seaward to the L.C.V.P. , and Cummings is splashing his way beachward to Madison . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYou 're going the wrong way . The beach is that way ! Madison splashes toward us , shouting . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI know where the beach is ! They 're shooting at us ! What 's the matter with you ?  --  104  --  Cummings and Madison splash toward each other in belt-high water . Disaster , death and the havoc of WAR in the background . Cummings yanks his revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting ) You yellow rat ! Head into that beach ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWhat 's the matter with you ? They are barely ten yards apart . Cummings points the revolver at Madison . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( screaming ) Take pictures ! Take pictures ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( screaming ) What ? Cummings FIRES . The SHOT hits Madison in the thigh , spins him partly around and almost knocks him into the water . Madison flails about in hip-deep water , staring aghast at Cummings . Then , in total terror , he wheels and starts splashing to the beach as fast as he can . Enright is taking movies of Cummings splashing after Madison , who is now splashing headlong into the shallows of Omaha Beach . Dead bodies float in the water , pitched about by the surge and swell . The air is deafened by BOMBS , MINES , MORTARS , ARTILLERY , MACHINE GUNS . REVERSE LONG SHOT from the beach seaward . Madison comes dashing up on the beach , the first man on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards . He is bug-eyed with terror . The CAMERA PANS him across the four hundred feet of beach as he dashes heedlessly past the steel jackstraws and wooden stakes on the beach , ripping his trousers on the barbed wire , stumbling against the steel obstacles . He vaults the four-foot wall about three hundred feet up the beach like Jesse Owens , flinging his camera into the air as he does so , and sprints the last hundred feet to the steep escarpment at the end of the beach , clutching his right thigh . Just as he reaches the base of the escarpment , he apparently trips  --  105  --  the detonator of a land mine , for there is an EXPLOSION just behind him , and he is thrown , arms outflung , onto the sand . LONG WIDE ANGLE PANORAMA SHOT showing Madison 's body sprawled on the beach . For the length of this shot , Madison 's body is the only body on the long white stretch of Omaha Beach . CLOSE SHOT of Enright , hiding behind a logpile obstacle , loading his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the beach towards the escarpment . Behind him , the beach is beginning to fill with the black forms of soldiers , tanks , trucks . The overwhelming THUNDER of artillery , mortar and machine-gun fire continues . A mine EXPLODES in the foreground . Enright dashes up to where Cummings is standing beside Madison , staring down at his best friend 's body , numb with shock . &nbsp; ENRIGHTWell , he 's the first dead man on Omaha Beach , if that means anything , Commander . Cummings stares at Enright , then bursts into tears . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( sobbing ) Now , that 's funny , that 's funny , oh , my God , that 's funny . A mine EXPLODES about twenty feet away , showering the screen with sand . Enright and Cummings dash off along the escarpment . We hear the WHINE of ricocheting bullets as a MEDIC , identified by his red-cross arm-band , crawls across the frame to Madison 's body . FADE OUT . Section Details FADE IN : EMILY 'S HOME , HER BEDROOM A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair by her window , unaware of the sun streaming in through the white curtains , bleaching her face . She seems unaware of anything , really . She is in her bedclothes and a wrapper , her face sallow , her lips pale , almost imperceptible , her eyes swollen  --  106  --  and dry , long past tears . She sits numbly , her external self as dead as Charlie , content apparently with the interior world she can create for herself out of fragments of memory , and supported by the rigid premise that Madison is not dead . There is a gentle knock on the door which she does n't seem to hear . Then the door opens to admit her mother . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMEmily , Commander Cummings is here to condole again . Emily is annoyed by the interruption of exterior life . &nbsp; EMILYI ca n't very well be condoled with since I 'm still pretending Charlie 's alive . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMWell , as long as you still know it 's pretending . I do think , Emily , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eight days since you went off into this medieval retreat . You know , you 're doing just what I did , and you 'll end up just as dotty . There 's very little satisfaction in it . Emily says nothing , already oblivious of her mother . Mrs. Barham exhibits polite disapproval , backs out of the room , and closes the door softly . LANDING OUTSIDE HER BEDROOM Mrs. Barham comes out , closing the door . For a moment , in the half-darkness of the upstairs landing , she allows her face to reveal her own grief and genuine concern for her daughter , but she quickly reassumes her old potty self and goes sailing down the stairs to the living room . EMILY 'S HOME , LIVING ROOM Bus Cummings rises from an overstuffed chair at her entrance . He is holding a folded newspaper . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAM ( cheerfully ) Absolutely wooden with grief . Sends her best , but asks to be excused . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSOh , yes . Of course . I understand . I just stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending the newspaper ) Thought it might make her feel a little better . INSERT CLOSE-UP of the newspaper , opened for our inspection . It is a copy of the New York Globe , June 14 , 1944 , the headline being whatever it was for that date and presumably , dealing with the advances made by the Allied Armies . However , what is most eye-catching is a four-column photograph of Madison as he leaped over the sea-wall on Omaha Beach , his head thrown back , his arms outflung ; all-in-all , a photographic masterpiece in the study of gallantry . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( off-screen ) That 's yesterday 's New York Globe . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAM ( off-screen ) Yes , I 'm on to that . What is it you want me to see ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( off-screen ) The photograph , ma'am . Charlie Madison , the first American on Omaha Beach . It 's on the front page of the New York Globe . Mrs. Barham looks at the newspaper , politely interested . &nbsp; MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good likeness . It 's mostly his back , is n't it ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSMa'am , this photograph is on the front page of almost two hundred newspapers in the United States alone . We honestly did n't think it would catch on that big . Our Press Office people just sent it out as a standard release , and first thing we knew  --  well , Mrs. Barham , this picture was in practically every London newspaper yesterday . I was sure you 'd seen it . Charlie 's a hero , ma'am ! Our Public Relations office is talking now of holding some sort of ceremony over his grave , building some sort of monument . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAM ( appalled ) A monument ?  --  108  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSProbably nothing more than a simple bronze plaque , but the Free French have indicated they 'd be willing to declare Charlie 's grave a French national shrine . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMThat 's depraved ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWe think the President of the United States will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about these things yet because we have n't got firm commitments , but Admiral Jessup is very close to the President . I do n't know if we can get Charlie the Congressional Medal of Honor , but he 's a cinch for the Navy Cross . As soon as I get an extra copy of Life magazine , I 'll bring it to you . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMWhat on earth for ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( beaming ) This picture of Charlie 's on the cover of Life magazine ! &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMOh , this is shoddy ! A French national shrine , indeed ! One must expect , I suppose , this sort of scandal-mongering from the French . But you 're supposed to be his friend . Could n't you have done something more to keep this whole sordid business out of the press ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSMa'am ? &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMOf course , we 're very disappointed in Charlie , but he has paid his price and there 's no need to rake it up . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Barham . Charlie 's a hero . &nbsp; EMILY ( off-screen ) Mother ? &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMOh , dear , there she is . Now do n't say a word to her about any of this . I 'll tell her when I think she 's well enough . She moves out to the foot of the stairs in the foyer , leaving behind Cummings , who is beginning to feel like a hero in Kafka .  --  109  --  EMILY 'S HOME , FOYER Mrs. Barham is at the foot of the stairs . Emily walks down , hair tidied , dressed in her uniform now , and buttoning her jacket . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMGoing into work . That 's very sensible of you . &nbsp; EMILYI do n't know how you put up with me this long , mother . At the foot of the stairs , Mrs. Barham takes her daughter 's arm and whispers quickly . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMDo n't forget that man is still here , come to commiserate . This is his third visit , and he 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be polite , wo n't you ? &nbsp; EMILYOh , he 's just a bit sincere . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMI must say , I find him grotesque . She adjusts a smile onto her face , and the pair move into the living room . EMILY 'S HOME , LIVING ROOM ACROSS Emily and her mother to Cummings , standing with head bowed , hat in hand . He slowly looks up to reveal an extravagantly grave face . He comes forward to Emily and merely takes her hand and looks mutely into her face . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes . Emily , you 're doing the right thing . Bury yourself in work . We 've all got to keep going . Emily 's eye is caught by the New York Globe lying on the sofa , and she crosses over to it . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMEmily , well , I must warn you . Charlie 's picture is in all the papers , and they 're going to build a monument on his grave .  --  110  --  &nbsp; EMILY ( studying the Globe ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear me , we shall be celebrating cancer and automobile smash-ups next . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( erupting ) He did n't just die , Emily ! He sacrificed his life ! &nbsp; MRS . BARHAMWell , that was very pagan of him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSHe was the first American to die on Omaha Beach . &nbsp; EMILYWas there a contest ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSEmily , I do n't understand you . I thought you 'd be proud . &nbsp; EMILY ( handing the paper to her mother ) You might as well burn this , mother  --  along with yesterday 's Daily Mail which I fished out of the garden fire . ( to Cummings ) We no longer take pride in death in this house , Bus . What was admirable about Charlie was his sensation of life . His cowardly , selfish , greedy appreciation of life , unadorned and uncertain as it is . I loved him very much . I do n't think I shall ever love anyone as much again . But I shall try . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Navy Building , Bus ? Cummings turns to Mrs. Barham , hoping for sanity from that quarter . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSNo , I have to stop by the hospital to pick the Admiral up . &nbsp; EMILY ( disappearing into the foyer ) Drop me at Edgeware Road . I 'll take the bus there . &nbsp; MRS . BARHAM ( nudging an unhappy Cummings ) You know , I thought I saw her peering at me through the window when I was burning those newspapers . pp. 81-94 &nbsp; pp. 111-127 LONDON SUBURB , NAVY HOSPITAL , PRIVATE ROOM Admiral Jessup , dressed in his shirt and pants , puffs a cigar , his old , brisk , groomed self again . He is putting toilet articles into a small valise on the bed , which is otherwise already packed . Cummings is standing on the other side  --  111  --  of the bed , holding the Admiral 's jacket on its hanger , even more unhappy than he was in the last scene . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI was damned fond of Charlie . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever known aside from being the best dog-robber in the world . What the hell was Charlie ever doing on Omaha Beach in the first place ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWhat , sir ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPExactly what was this movie Charlie was making on Omaha Beach ? What was Charlie doing making a movie in the first place ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSHe was making your movie , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPYes , you keep saying my movie . What do you mean , my movie ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSThe movie you wanted made about the Demolition Engineers , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI do n't remember any . . . ( He turns , puzzled , back to knotting his tie before the mirror . Suddenly , he understands , and he turns back in utter horror to Cummings . ) Oh my God , Bus , was this some idea I conceived when I was cracking up ? I do n't remember any movie . I. . . And you went ahead and did it ? But I was unbalanced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , Charlie Madison . . . Oh , my God ! ( He sinks , aghast , onto the bed . ) &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWell , sir , we wanted a hero . Now we 've got one . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPYou do n't send a man to his death because you want a hero ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWell , sir , the whole purpose of our coming over here , was to find something to catch the eye of the Committee on Military  --  112  --  Affairs , to remind them that the Navy is still an essential service . We 're trying to keep from being scrapped , sir . The Admiral stands , still shaken . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPMay God forgive me ; I 'll never forgive myself . ( He turns back to the mirror and his tie , still pained , but he has his work to do . ) If you want to catch the eye of the Joint Committee on Military Affairs , Bus , you 'll have to bury Charlie in Washington , not on Omaha Beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly no further away than Pennsylvania Avenue . I will not authorize funds for any monument on Omaha Beach . We need something more immediate than that . Give me my jacket . ( slips into his jacket ) Have you got my flight orders ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , sir . You leave for Washington tonight with Marv Ellender on the twenty-two-hundred flight . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( buttoning his jacket ) The only solace any of us has is that if Charlie were here , he 'd be laughing himself silly . PORT OF SOUTHAMPTON . DAY Lt. Commander Charles E. Madison slowly descends the ramp of a hospital ship . We know it 's a hospital ship because we can see the huge red cross painted on the hull of the ship behind him . Out of the hold , an endless file of wounded men are being carried on stretchers down to the docks . Madison is one of the ambulatory cases . He wears a red regulation hospital robe and blue hospital pajamas . An oaktag label dangles from his lapel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid mask of bitterness . The other ambulatory patients , hobbling and lurching along down the ramp with him , on crutches or with bandaged arms and heads , are all in the best of spirits . &nbsp; VOICES AND SHOUTSOh , man , I thought I 'd never see this side of the Channel again !  --  Hey , Nurse ! Hey , Lieutenant ! Where are we supposed  --  113  --  to go ?  --  Hey ! They 're serving food !  --  Oh , man , look at that nurse ! How 'd you like to have her stick a thermometer in your mouth ?  --  Louise ! If we get separated , remember I 'm in the 8th Infantry , 112th Regiment , I Company ! The good spirits of all the others contrast with the somber , coldly belligerent set of Madison 's face . ANOTHER ANGLE as Madison and the other ambulatory patients reach the docks at the bottom of the ramp . A MEDIC gently herds them to the dock railing . &nbsp; MEDICAmbulatory patients over here . You 're now at the Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly taken care of in just a few minutes . Is there anyone who needs immediate attention ? We 're here to help you . Madison and the other ambulatories hobble along to join other ambulatory patients in their tagged robes . We see now the docks are filled with rows of stretchers and bandaged men . Uniformed NURSES and MEDICS move up and down between the stretchers , checking the identification labels , marking their clipboards and ministering to the wounded . Volunteer English RED CROSS LADIES add to the crush by wheeling tea carts of coffee and magazines . Indeed , one Red Cross Lady suddenly wheels her cart into the foreground , piled high with newspapers and Life magazines . We see Madison 's picture is on the cover . &nbsp; RED CROSS LADY ( to Madison 's group ) Newspapers ? Magazines ? Any of you chaps want a copy of Newsweek ? Life magazine ? ( to Madison in particular ) Want a copy of Life ? TIGHT SHOT across the Red Cross Lady to Madison staring somberly out over the harbor . He turns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( coldly ) No , thank you , I 've seen it already . He turns back to staring fixedly out over the harbor , while VOICES fly around him .  --  114  --  &nbsp; VOICESAll I want is three days in London . I hear you have to beat them off with clubs . . . You know what 's a great town for broads ? Liverpool ! You have to beat them off with clubs . HENDON AIRPORT . NIGHT LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT almost duplicating the shot that began the film  --  a DC-4 looming vaguely on the black landing strip , three official cars lined up some yards away , a clump of uniformed people by the cars , some loading activity at the plane . In short , a high-level military mission is about to depart . ACROSS Emily at the door of the car to the Admiral and Cummings , with Ellender and Captain Spaulding supervising the transfer of the luggage to the plane . &nbsp; ELLENDER ( to one of the plane 's crew ) Leave the attach case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We get the feeling a car is approaching us in the dark night , its headlights dimmed for blackout purposes . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( to Cummings ) You and Adams lock up the shop . I want you both in Washington by Wednesday night . And forget about that tomb . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , sir . Cummings ' attention , however , is to the car , which screeches to a halt fifteen yards away . The Admiral gives it a brief glance and turns to Ellender . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPAdmirals Koenig and Ridgeway are supposed to testify on Thursday . I do n't think they 'll get to us before Monday . &nbsp; ELLENDERMore likely Tuesday , the way Congressional hearings usually run .  --  115  --  Chief Petty Officer Adams , who is driving the newly-arrived car , opens the door and gets out . He is obviously in distress . &nbsp; ADAMSHey , Bus , can I see you a minute ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSSomething the matter ? &nbsp; ADAMS ( as Cummings moves to him ) Yeah , I 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cummings . In the background , the Admiral and Ellender are fishing their attach cases out of the first of the cars . Captain Spaulding waits in attendance on them . &nbsp; ADAMS ( lowers his voice to a conspiratorial mutter ) I just got a call from the Sixth Relocation Center in Southampton . That 's where they bring the casualties from France . They 've got a Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Madison there ready to be released . Would we arrange transportation for him and bring him a uniform ? I do n't know whether to laugh or cry . During this speech , Cummings nods , purses his lips and cleans his glasses , as if he were listening to the most perfunctory of problems . &nbsp; ADAMSI do n't know if you heard me , Bus . I said  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , I heard you Paul . What 's the gag ? In the background , the Admiral , Ellender and Spaulding , carrying their attach cases and hand luggage , are crossing the landing strip to the plane . &nbsp; ADAMSI spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWhat do you mean , he 's alive ? He was practically a French national shrine . How the hell can he be alive ? As Adams and Cummings speak , Emily stands in the background by her car . &nbsp; ADAMSHe got on the phone , he said , " Hi , Paul , " I said , " Hi , Charlie . "  --  116  --  He said , " Do me a favor , Paul . Call Miss Barham in the Motor Pool and tell her I 'm all right . " &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSI saw him with my own eyes , Paul ! &nbsp; ADAMSHe also said , " Tell Bus , if I ever lay my hands on him again , I 'm going to belt him right in his big , fat stern-sheets . " CLOSE-UP of Cummings : he 's convinced but miserable about it . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSHe 's alive . The first dead man on Omaha Beach is alive . Oh boy , that 's great ! Two hundred newspapers in the United States alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world  --  and he 's alive ! &nbsp; ADAMSWhat 's he mad at you for , Bus ?

We had a nice dead hero ; now , we have a lousy live coward . &nbsp; ADAMSWhat 's the matter with you , Bus ? Cummings suddenly seizes the startled Adams by his jacket collar , almost throttling the poor fellow . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( screaming ) Is this a gag , Paul ? ! &nbsp; ADAMS ( screaming ) It 's no gag ! Cummings thrusts his Chief Petty Officer from him , breaks for the DC-4 , shouting to Admiral Jessup , who is about to be helped into the plane . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( shouting ) Admiral , sir ! He 's alive , damn it ! The Admiral , Ellender and Spaulding turn to see what all the agitation is about . In the background , Emily takes a few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted . The Admiral stares at Cummings , who now comes to a halt in front of him . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPAlive ? Madison ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , sir . The relocation center in Southampton , waiting to be released right now , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPThank God ! &nbsp; ELLENDEROh , that 's wonderful , Bus . Wonderful . Now Emily emerges more clearly out of the darkish background , approaching the group on the plane , utterly unconscious of what she 's doing , too terrified to believe what she suspects she has heard . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( beaming at Cummings ) Now , Bus ! Now , we can bring your first man on Omaha Beach right into Room Number 610 of the Senate Office Building ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSSir ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPI want Madison flown to Washington on the first plane out of Southampton . We 're going to give Charlie a parade right down Pennsylvania Avenue and right up to the front lawn of the White House where the President himself will decorate Charlie with the Navy Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not so sure if we should involve the President in this , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPThe President 's an old Navy man . He 's sympathetic to our position throughout . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , sir , but I just do n't think we should go that big . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( positively elated ) We 're going to make a big , brass-band hero out of Charlie , using every coarse theatricality the Public  --  118  --  Relations Office is overpaid to think up . And when I walk into that hearing on Monday or Tuesday , I 'll smile my crisp military smile at all those Senators ; and then , in a perfunctory way , I 'll introduce my two aides , " Captain Ellender here , my technical adviser , and Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Madison , gentlemen , the first American on Omaha Beach . A sailor . " Bus , that 's what 's known as letting them have it in spades , doubled , redoubled and vulnerable . ( He positively guffaws . ) Charlie will then modestly answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( beginning to feel genuinely ill ) Oh , he 'll be modest all right . Sir , I better tell you what really happened on D-Day , sir . The Admiral , however , has turned his attention to Emily , who has been advancing on the group , one dazed step after another . &nbsp; EMILY ( almost too terrified to ask ) Is he alive ? Is he alive ? Is that what you 're saying ? That he 's alive ? &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPYes , Miss Barham , we think he is . &nbsp; EMILYOh , dear . . . oh , dear . . . It 's all she can get out . She stares helplessly at all of them , her eyes blinking , and then , raises her face , tears slipping in individual beads out from beneath her lashes , nevertheless exhilarated by a faint , mute smile of ineffable joy . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPMiss Barham , we 're almost as happy about this as you are . &nbsp; EMILYThank you , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPHey , Bus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southampton just as fast as you can make it . Get going . ( shakes Spaulding 's hand ) Goodby , Harry . &nbsp; SPAULDINGGood trip , sir .  --  119  --  He turns , seizes the hands being offered to him from the open doorway of the DC-4 and clambers up into the plane . The Admiral suddenly reappears in the doorway of the plane , and calls to Cummings . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPOh , Bus . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , sir . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUPYou were going to tell me something before about Charlie on D-Day . Cummings hesitates briefly , then calls back to the Admiral . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSOh , nothing , sir . Have a good flight . &nbsp; ADMIRAL JESSUP ( to Cummings ) Well , do n't forget . I want him in Washington tomorrow . I do n't care what brass you have to throw off the plane . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYes , do n't worry , sir . I 'll have him on the first flight out of Southampton . &nbsp; A GROUND CREWMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , sir . Cummings nods brusquely , turns on his heel and strides off in the direction of Chief Petty Officer Adams , waiting apprehensively by his car . Emily , still enchanted , trots along behind him . Spaulding swerves off to where the official cars and the other drivers are waiting . In the background , propellers of the DC-4 suddenly whir into activity . About halfway to Adams , Cummings whirls on Emily and shouts something at her . The DC-4 slowly taxies off in the background . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( shouting to be heard over the motors ) What I did n't tell the Admiral back there was that Charlie Madison became the first man on Omaha Beach because I chased him up there with a Colt 45 ! He was ,  --  120  --  in fact , running the other way !  --  bolting under fire , an errant act of cowardice in the face of the enemy ! Our big brass-band hero is a big brass-band coward ! But I did n't tell the Admiral that because the Navy needs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Charlie Madison ! It 's a hoax , Emily , a hoax ! The whole thing 's a hoax ! &nbsp; EMILY ( could n't be prouder ) Ah , that 's my Charlie ! Craven to the end ! Behind them , the DC-4 suddenly fills the night with the ROAR of its motors . Cummings strides off again to Adams at the car , Emily happily behind him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( shouts to Spaulding ) Harry , clear me a space for Madison on the next flight out of Southampton ! I 'll call you from the hospital there ! Section Details HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE A typical , improvised military office in another , smaller , quonset hut . One enters from the street through a plain wooden door . A second one in the opposite wall leads outside to the interior area of the hospital . This door bears a placard : NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL . A NURSE CAPTAIN sits behind the principal desk ; several ARMY CLERKS sit behind other desks rattling away on their typewriters or filing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , as we cut in . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( on phone ) Harry , I 'm in the Administrative Office right now  --  Chief Petty Officer Adams is studying the bulletin board which has a splendid large poster on it advising G.I.s to watch out for V.D. Emily is pacing restlessly around the crowded , clattery room . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( on phone ) I can have Madison at the airport by one o'clock . Now do n't worry about it . You just clear a place on the plane for him , that 's all .  --  121  --  Emily , in a feverish state of impatience , goes to the door marked No Admittance , opens it halfway , and looks out . The Nurse Captain notes this sympathetically . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( on phone ) You told Grissom ? When ? You told the Public Relations Office ? Harry , what the hell 's the matter with you . We 'll have every correspondent in London down here  --  &nbsp; THE NURSE CAPTAIN ( solicitously , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go on through and wait for him outside . &nbsp; EMILYThank you . She steps out of the office . HOSPITAL , OUTSIDE OFFICE . NIGHT A very long paved footpath and arcaded passageway are lit just enough for camera purposes . The rest of the hospital sleeps silently in the dark night . Emily smokes anxiously . Now , a NURSE trundles a small medical cart across the roofed passageway at the extreme background of the frame , and Emily whirls to it . Disappointed , she turns full-face to to the camera and lights another cigarette . How silent it all is now . Suddenly , she senses Madison through the small of her back , and she slowly turns so that we see ACROSS her down the long length of dimly-lit footpath . There , at the far end , turning in from the roofed passageway , is Charlie . He is dressed , walking with a noticeable limp , using a cane . She starts involuntarily a few paces up the path , then stops . Madison , who had been rapt in his brown study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking down the footpath to Emily , half-shadowed but lit enough to see she is smiling . Behind her , the Administration Office hut , black-out shades drawn , with cracks of light here and there . &nbsp; EMILYYou 're limping , Commander . The old wound acting up ?  --  122  --  Madison limps a few slow steps down toward her . He stops , regards her warily . Emily now ambles slowly up the path to him . &nbsp; EMILYWell , where have you been ? We expected you back a week ago yesterday . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm sorry , I had to go to France for a few days . It 's out of season this time of year . &nbsp; EMILYNo one worth knowing was there , I 'm sure . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONVery rough element going to France these days . The two of them regard each other on the footpath . Then suddenly , she whirls over the few yards separating them and into his arms . They embrace . &nbsp; EMILYOh , Charlie . Oh , Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful of my leg . &nbsp; EMILYOh , shut up . Let me hold you . HOSPITAL , ADMINISTRATION OFFICE The office is jammed with NEWSPAPERMEN , perhaps twenty of them , both uniformed and civilian , with and without cameras . Cummings , Adams and a Clerk are trying to get them back outside . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( shouting ) All right ! All right ! I have n't seen him myself yet ! A camera-flash explodes almost in his face . &nbsp; NURSE CAPTAIN ( shouting ) You 'll have to wait outside ! I 'm terribly sorry ! You 'll have to wait outside ! SHOUTS and VOICES from the reporters : " When was he brought here ? ! "  --  123  --   --  " Is he seriously wounded ? ! "  --  " Is he coming out ? What 's going on ? "  --  " What 's this about de Gaulle ? " &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( to Adams ) I better get him . Cummings crosses quickly to the door marked No Admittance , reaches for the knob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He quickly shuts the door and hurries up the path to the lovers . FULL SHOT of Madison and Emily in embrace . Madison looks up over her shoulder and Emily turns her head to see what the flare of noise was . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSHey Charlie ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONDo n't you come within cane 's distance of me , you fink . You tried to kill me . Madison releases himself from Emily 's arms . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSOh go on , Charlie . Do n't make such a big dramatic deal out of this . Right now , I 've got a plane waiting to take you back to Washington . Now we have to be at the airport in half an hour , and there are about twenty reporters in that office and more piling in by the minute . We have five minutes for pictures and a few questions , so let me brief you quickly on what you 're to say . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm going to say the truth , Bus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my little hoax you know , Charlie . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONEnough . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSWell , your last words as you led the charge up the beach were , " Okay , men , let 's show'em whose beach this is ! "  --  124  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONNot quite the epic stature of " We 've just begun to fight , " Bus . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSYeah , well . . . you know . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm going to tell them the truth , Bus . I 'm going to tell anyone who wants to know the plain , unattractive and not very epic truth . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie , we do n't have much time  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 'm going to tell them that a deranged Admiral had a demented idea for a lunatic movie whose only purpose was to juice up the Navy 's bid for military appropriations ; that my gallant wounds were inflicted on me by my brother officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( beginning to suspect Madison is serious ) Charlie , you 've got a legitimate beef against me , okay . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON . . . and that my last inspirational words as I led the charge away from the beach were , " Let 's get the hell out of here . " Cummings and Emily look quizzically at Madison . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI 've had a bad week , Bus . I 've been in battle and I 've seen the howl and heard the horror of it again . I will not contribute to your wretched little hoax . I will not help you preserve the wonder of war . I want people to know I was a coward . I want people to know the whole shabby story about my heroism . Emily does n't quite trust her ears . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGSCharlie , I do n't understand you . Do you know what 'll happen if . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONOh , I know what 'll happen . I 'll embarrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humiliate my family , and probably get myself thrown in the brig for a couple of years .  --  125  --  &nbsp; EMILYThen why do it ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONBecause it 's the right thing to do . CLOSE-UP of Emily , stunned , open-mouthed with disbelief . &nbsp; EMILYI ca n't believe it ! Is this the Charlie Madison who once said : " God save us all from people who do the right thing ! It 's the rest of us who always get our backs broken ! ? " Are you seriously going to destroy everything that means anything to you , Charlie , in a futile gesture of virtue ? And you 're going to put yourself in jail , are you ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONI do n't care what happens to me . &nbsp; EMILYHow bloody brave of you . But you do care what happens to me . At least you said you did . What am I supposed to do while you sit about in your prison cell for five or six years , admiring the glisten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADISONEmily , I want the world to know what a fraud war is . &nbsp; EMILYBut war is n't a fraud , Charlie ; it 's very real . At least , that 's what you 've always tried to tell me , is n't it ? That we shall never get rid of war by pretending it 's unreal ? It 's the virtue of war that 's the fraud , not war itself . It 's the valor and the self-sacrifice and the goodness of war that needs the exposing . Here you are , being brave , self-sacrificing and positively clanking with moral fervor , perpetuating the very things you detest , merely to do the right thing . Honestly , your conversion to morality is actually funny , Charlie . All this while , I 've been terrified of becoming Americanized , and you , you silly ass , have turned into a bloody sentimental Englishman . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONEmily , there 's a matter of principle involved here . &nbsp; EMILYA matter of what ? Oh , Charlie , did n't you once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's house anyway ? " &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONEmily , if a man knows the truth , he has to say it .  --  126  --  Madison and Emily regard each other , shamelessly in love . &nbsp; EMILY ( meaning : " I love you " ) Is this the Charlie Madison who once said : " I 'm not equipped to deal with the truth . I let God worry about the truth . I just want to know the momentary fact of things . " Your idea of facts , you said . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( meaning " I love you too " ) . . . were you , a home , a country , a world , and a universe in that order . &nbsp; EMILYWell , I 'm quite prepared to supply all that as my end of the deal . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISONWhat do you get out of it ? &nbsp; EMILYI 'll settle for a Hershey bar . They embrace . The door of the Administration Office opens , and Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nurse Captain fills the rectangle of light made by the open doorway . &nbsp; ADAMS ( hurrying up ) Hey , Bus ! There must be a hundred of them ! There 's correspondents all over the place . ( in passing ) Hi , Charlie ! &nbsp; THE NURSE CAPTAIN ( calling from the door ) Commander , would you please come ? We ca n't have all these people here ! Madison , who has been locked in a mutually-obsessed trance with Emily during all this , now smiles and turns to Cummings , who has n't understood a word that was said during the previous dialogue . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES E. MADISON ( wrapping one arm around Emily and the other around Cummings , He jovially says to Cummings ) All right , fink , how do you want me to play it ? Modest and self-effacing ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COMMANDER BUS CUMMINGS ( as they move down the path to the Administration Office ) Thanks , Charlie . I 'll make this up to you . I 'll do anything you say .  --  127  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ) Oh , I 've got something in mind for you , buddy . By now , the rectangle of light made by the open Administration Office door is filling up with correspondents , and , in a moment , the whole screen is a constant flare of flashbulbs . THE NORTH POLE . DAY Actually , we dissolve in on a photograph of a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington , D.C. Madison stands in the back of the main limousine , waving at the crowds who are flinging ticker-tape at him . DOLLY SLOWLY BACK to show , first , that it is a photograph on the front page of the New York Globe . Then , we see that the man looking at the Globe is Lieutenant Commander Cummings , swathed in furs and parka with just enough of his frozen face sticking out to identify him . CONTINUE TO DOLLY EVEN FURTHER BACK until all that can be seen of poor Cummings is a small black figure on an endless desolation of snow and ice . On screen the following legend : Virtue Is its Own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
