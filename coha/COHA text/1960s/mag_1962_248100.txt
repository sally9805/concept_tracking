As white-robed Shinto priests performed intricate purification ceremonies , a potbellied turboprop transport rolled out of a hangar at Nagoya 's Komaki Airport , taxied down a runway and roared aloft . An hour later , when the plane set back down at Komaki , a waiting throng of businessmen and Japanese air force brass broke into exultant banzais . The YS 11 , first Japanese-designed commercial transport to be built since World War II , had completed its maiden flight . <P> Brainchild of a five-man engineering team headed by wispy Jiro Horikoshi , designer of World War II 's deadly Zero fighter , the YS 11 is a response to mounting Japanese sentiment that " Japan must get its own skies back . " Grounded by Occupation edicts from the end of World War II until 1952 , the once potent Japanese aircraft industry has fluttered along since then by producing a handful of U.S.-designed planes under license . <P> How much the YS 11 will do to revive the industry is debatable . Built by the Nihon Aeroplane Manufacturing Co. ( which was formed especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane incorporates a high percentage of foreign components , including its twin Rolls-Royce Dart RDa. 10/1 engines . In their desire to sell the YS 11 as a latter-day replacement for the workhorse DC-3 , its designers sacrificed both speed ( 295 m.p.h. ) and range ( 380 miles with a full load of 60 passengers ) in order to cut the plane 's normal take-off run to as little as 3,000 ft . Trouble is that by December 1963 , when the first YS 11 production model is scheduled for completion , the skies may well be swarming with competition from short-range pure jets such as British Aircraft Corp . ' s BAC One-Eleven , which also aspires to the title of " the new DC-3. "
