txt President Johnson pledged last night to take important new steps toward lessening world tensions if he is elected . He used the forum of the Alfred E. Smith memorial dinner to hail an improvement in Soviet-American relations . He said relations between the two powers had " come a long way since shoes were banged on desks here in New York and a summit meeting collapsed in Paris . " The President was clearly tired after a strenuous day of campaigning . He said at the outset that he would delete portions of his prepared speech because of the late hour ? he did not start speaking until 11:14 P.M. Among the portions he deleted was a reference to impending moves to strengthen peace , and a hint of possible new arms agreements with the Soviet Union . But he said he stood by everything in his prepared text . His aides in Washington had regarded it as a major foreign policy speech . 2,000 Hear President The President was heard by 2,000 persons who paid $100 each to attend the dinner in the Waldorf-Astoria . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . In his reference to peace moves , the President 's prepared text said : " I believe we may be nearing a time for further and more lasting steps toward decreasing tensions and a diminishing arms race . " I will try to take these steps ? always in consultation with our friends . " I will expect respect for our courage and our convictions . I will offer understanding for the concerns and interests of others . " I will work for the growth of freedom and the survival of man . " The President was given a 30-second standing ovation when he started to speak , and was interruped six times by applause , the heartiest coming when he declared he had no intention of withdrawing front the United Nations . When he finished , he was applauded for 40 seconds . In his opening remarks the President replied with good hi mor to the gibes of Governor Rockefeller . In a speech earlier , the Governor alluded to the carpetbag charge that Republicans have levied against the President 's former Attorney General , Robert F. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of the Republican incumbent , Kenneth B. Keating . Mixed boos and cheers had greeted Governor Rockefeller 's ironic reference to " visitors from other states . " The Governor said he would not be surprised if other celebrated intruders besides Mr. Kennedy entered the New York political scene . Turning to Mayor Wagner , the Governor said : " There is a rumor that Y. A. Tittle may run for Mayor and Yogi Berra , for Governor . " Matter of Immigration And he added amid laughter : " Maybe we had better concen trate on cherishing New York . We not only have a World 's Fair , but we have other wonders : We both have new political companions  --  pick Nixon for me and Bobby Kennedy for you . " The President , in reply , said : " I gather that the affable Governor does not share some of his colleagues ' views on immigration , or perhaps we are still free at least to immigrate between the states . " The President said that the Chinese - Soviet disagreement gave the United States a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no longer one cold war , " he said . " There are many . They differ in temperature , intensity and danger . " A Warning on Asia Mr. Johnson , turning specifically to the situation in Asia , said that the struggles there would depend on the will of the Asian people . He said that the United States would answer calls of Asians for help , and added : " We will not permit the great civilizations of the East ? almost half the people of the world  --  to be swallowed up in Communist conquest . Let . no one be foolhardy enough to doubt the strength of that commitment . " Hoarse and tired from an exhausting campaign schedule , President Johnson made abbreviated speeches in Paramus , N. J. , and at the Wilkes-BarreScranton Airport , Avoca , Pa. , before he came , to New York at 1:32 P.M. The crowds that greeted him were enthusiastic , but much smaller than the frenzied throngs that acclaimed John F. Kennedy in a tickertape parade up lower Broadway four years ago . The route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the usual dispute between political advisers ? who wanted maxireum exposure for the President and Mr. Kennedy , who rode with the President ? aod the police , who were concerned about security . Besides , the President had to compete with the sixth game of the World Series , which had just started in St. Louis and was flashing on the television screens of Harlem as his motorcade left the Triborough Bridge and started down Second Avenue . A soundtruck preceded the motorcade by 30 minutes , urging the public to stand behind the police barricades to hail the President . The police , having learned of Mr. Johnson 's penchant for bounding from his automobile Ito greet big crowds , were ex. - Dec ing him to sn-ip beiefly 125th Street , and perhaps atl other intersections . Assemblyman Frank G. Ros-1 setti waited hopefully beside his campaign truck at 124th Street , but the Presidential mo- torcade sped through . It was the first exposure of a Southern-born President to . the Harlem ghetto . The crowd of perhaps 2,500 , massed on the sidewalks between 125th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President and Mr. Kennedy moved swiftly by them benind a roaring phalanx of 30 motorcycle policemen . Down 2d Avenue the crowds were thinner . In Yorkville 500 persons applauded and cheered when the motorcade passed 86th Street and Second Avenue . The President waved both arms and smiled . Many Security Men Not until he reached the Waldorf-Astoria at 2:10 P.M. did he attract a big crowd . There were about 5,000 behind police barricades in the vicinity of the hotel . The President , gratified , ordered the driver of his bubbletop car to drive on Park Avenue between 50th and 48th Streets , giving the crowd massed on the west side of Park /Avenue a chance to see him . Police helicopters circled overhead , and the hotel and nearby skyscrapers were thick with police and Secret Service men . In the roaring crowd there seemed to be only one heckler a man e- standin on the curb near 48th Street , who cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted , " Boo , boo . " Mr. Kennedy , who stood to gain most from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the relatively poor exposure to the crowds . Both Mr. Kennedy and Senator Keating attended the Alfred E. Smith dinner , but ' hey were not among the speakers . President Johnson plans to have Mr. Kennedy with him all day today for rallies in Rochester and Buffalo , followed by a 30-mile motorcade in Brooklyn , and a big Liberal party rally in Madison Square Garden tonight . At the Garden rally , the President is expected to hail the candidacy of Mr. Kennedy . The Alfred E. Smith Memorial , dinner , a tribute to the late Governor , is always an important event in- a Presidential election year . In 1960 the host , Cardinal Spellman , invited both John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard M. Nixon . Both candidates spoke . Because the event is non- , political , President Johnson made no reference last night to the campaign in his prepared , speech . But he cautioned his audience , to guard against - simple slogans on foreign policy , and his listeners may have thought of the Republican Presidential nominee Senator Barry Goldwater when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world are wrong . They are not necessarily false . They are just inadequate . " It is true , for example , that Communism is a danger . But Russia is a different kind of danger from Yugoslavia . A small Communist party in Africa is different from the Government of Red China . " These different dangers require different policies , different actions , and different replies . " Beware of those who come to you with simple slogans . Theirs is the path of peril and not of peace . " Would Strengthen U.N . The Administration 's foreign policy has come under sharp attack from Senator Goldwater , who has accused President Johnson of being " soft on Communism . " In his prepared speech the President pointed out that this country 's policies toward the world had ben carefully built by leaders of both parties over a generation . " We have followed a steady course , not as a result of a conspiracy , and not because we have stifled debate , " he said . " We have followed it because these policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . " Mr. Johnson strongly defended the United Nations , and said that the present constitutional crisis in that organization , caused by the Soviet refusal to pay arrears on the United Nations ' police action in the Congo and Middle East , must be resolved " so that every nation bears its full share of the costs and burdens . " He added : " Let no one think this position is shaped by the pressures of an election . This principle is vital if the United Nations is to command the respect and confidence which its great purpose requires . " He said he did not intend to withdraw from the United Nations . He intended to strengthen it rather than weaken it . " With all its defects , " he said , " the United Nations has been a source of innumerable achievements for peace and for the dignity of man . " The President promised a new multilateral foreign aid program in which the West would jointly distribute foods and agricultural skills . Proposes Joint Venture " I will propose steps to use the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint effort to eliminate hunger and starvation , " he said . " We will seek ways to stabilize the prices , of the tropical ! commodities which are the life ! blood of many economies . I ! will press for prompt execution ! of the worldwide coffee agreement , and seek action for other products . " Cardinal Speinnqn. who pre-1 lided , announced that he would ! leave for Rome in a few days to participate in the remaining ' sessions of the Vatican Council . ' He said he had regained his health . The Cardinal , who un- ' derwent a prostate operation ' late in the summer , suffered a virus infection in September . The Cardinal said he " rejoiced and felt proud " at the recent action of the council reaffirming " the right of all men to worship God according to their individual consciences , and of their duty to love their fellow men whether they were Jewish , Protestant or Catholic or whatever their beliefs may be .
