txt Soviet scientists are clamoring at the doors of industry for more and better computers . The demand is great , they say . Factories , ministries , research centers has designed electronic computers as good as those in the West , industry is slow to produce them and the application of computer technology in industry is lagging . Viewed against the background of the Soviet rivalry with the United States , this lag is of visible concern here . One of the nation 's leading scientists warned recently that computer technology " could become the decisive factor in the competition of social systems . " It is not known how many computers there are in Soviet industry , since the Russians publish no figures . Academician Georgy Y. Pukhov , deputy director of the Ukraine Academy of Sciences Institute of Cybernetics , told this reporter he thought there were " over 10,000 " operating in the chemical , // *Soviet firms clamor for more computers // metallurgical , shipbuilding , and other industries . But , he added , " There are not enough for the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marchuk , said in a newspaper article last month that production of computers is " extremely inadequate , " that it could be increased " three to five times , " and that this should be done " without delay , " Some large computers The Russians ' fastest computer , designed by Sergei A. Lebedev and called the BESM-6 , is capable of about one million operations a second . At least five of these computers are known to exist at various research centers . There may be more , but even so their number is small . Kiev 's modern , expanding , Institute of Cybernetics , one of three leading computer research centers in the country , concentrates on two basic tasks . One is to study the interaction of men and machines  --  to develop computers that combine the easiest input by man with the fasteSt output of machine . The second is to mechanize the designing and production of computers : " In the Soviet Union computers are used to make individual computer elements , " commented Academician Pukhov " but they are not making whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the technology of Soviet computers , the quiet-mannered scientist said that semiconductors are still used in building computers , since integrated circuits are too costly for mass production . But he added that technology is moving in this direction and integrated circuits would probably be introduced " in the next three or four years . " In the opinion of Western experts , the Soviets today are using computers to operate individual machines in such areas as space and defense , where the state has invested heavily in crash programs . But it is not thought they are employed to control entire production processes . One observable trend of computer application is in the area of inventory control and production planning at the factory level . Two computer systems now are being tested in Soviet industry , one at the Lvov Television Plant under the aegis of the Kiev Institute . This correspondent visited a modern plant in the western Ukrainian town of Lvov and was shown the two Minsk-22 computers which are the basis of the system . They are used basically to help plan television production , functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , called the " information computer center . " ? Serviced by two programmers , the ' computers tell plant officials where TV parts are at any given moment , how many there are , and when to order supplies . They keep track of output and , on the basis of the factory 's plan , calculate production assignments for the next shift . Overlooking the conveyor belts in a large production room are blinking panels which show the number of television sets rolling off the assembly line and the number yet to be produced . No production process is controlled by the computers , however . According to the center 's youthful director , . the Minsk-22 's , perform 50 different tasks , and some 6 to 10 programs are used for each task . This suggests that the Kiev group is still experimenting with different types of programs . Factory officials are enthusiastic . Since computers were installed 11/2 years ago , they say , production of television sets has increased 7 percent . Output this year is expected to reach 500,000  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a million . The next step planned by the factory is to change over to a " coordinated control center " and to use the computers for quality control and for determining the best combination of parts to produce reliable , inexpensive TV sets , especially for color television . Organization criticized By their own admission , the Soviets face many problems in computer development . While the basic structure of their machines is good  --  Academician Pukhov says they are on a par with and in some cases better than American computers  --  they are short on what are called peripherals , devices for input and output of information . Soviet machines can do hundreds of thousands of calculations per second , for instance , but the speed of output is slow . Academician Marchuk , who directs the computer center of the Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk , terms the shortage of peripherals the " Achilles ' heel " of Soviet computers . There is serious need , he writes , for such subsidiary equipment as readers , perforators , teletypes , magnetic memory drums , and printers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Academician Marchuk , - is the fact that so many different research bodies and ministries now are involved in making computers and elements . " With seven nannies , no one looks after the baby , " he says and he calls for the formation of a single coordinating body to distribute funds allocated for computer development and to see that the technology is applied in the economy . Politics lurks in wings In the Soviet Union , with its statecointrolled economy , the development of computer technology has political overtones , since computers could affect Marxist control of decisionmaking . Some Soviet economists have suggested , for instance , that computers could estimate the real prices of products ( now fixed by central planners ) and help develop a logical price structure . At this stage such ideas are kept well in the background , however , and the emphasis of computer use today is on production rather than central planning . Future development is likely to be carefully controlled , so that planners will have their say in what problems the computers attack .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
