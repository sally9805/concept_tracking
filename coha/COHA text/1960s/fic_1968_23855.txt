51 IN THE FARAWAY COUNTRY OF MONTGOMERY , ALABAMA a story by Almena Lomax At eight o'clock that morning Mrs. Goode called to say in her twisted , limping accents , " Di'n ' git ennybody up , did ah ? Ah called to tell y'all Robinson ' n ' Mistuh Goode be ovah theah d'rec'ly . " She would have made it sound like the visit of a head of state even had I not been a Negro . She called her husband " Mr. Goode " the way Mama Julia , who was from Mobile , called Pappy " Mr. Roach " ; the way my grandmother always referred to the grandfather I never saw after we moved away from Galveston as " Mr. Davis . " My mother called my father " Doll " or , when she was mad at him , she called him by his full name , Clifford Adew Davis . I have never since heard the name , Adel 's , except when my brother painfully and embarrassedly had to give his full name to a teacher or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's Scotch , my mother said . My grandfather , black as he was , " the blackest man I ever saw , " my mother used to say , was part Scotch , that and Jamaican . That 's how he came to Galveston . He sailed to this country from the West Indies and settled in Galveston and went into the insurance business , teaching school on the side . If my mother and father had lived down South after my sister Gwen was born , instead of up North in Chicago , my mother would have called my father " Mr. Davis , " too . It 's a way wellborn Southern women of either race have of underlining the status or protecting the dignity of their men . Though , Mrs. Goode did n't look too wellborn . She was a little toad of a woman , dark and fleshy-featured , with a bird 's nest of mixed gray and black hair squatting on her head . If my motherhad seen her , she would have said she looked like she had a " touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that she looked like she had Negro blood . But not Mr. Goode . He was all pink and white like strawberry and vanilla ice cream , and when you saw him , you wanted to take a spoon and start eating . He was also a real Johnny Reb. which was the name of his business , an office supply company in Montgomery , and he let you know it right away . When I went to their store to buy my mimeograph machine . Mrs. Goode practically let me have the run of the place . I did n't have but $60 to pay down on an $800 machine , but I have " more nerve than Dick Tracy , " my mother always said , and I had to have that machine and supplies , too , to get out a newspaper I was running over in Tuskegee , and I gave her the full treatment , the " whole hit , " of jive and salesmanship that I had learned from running a newspaper on a shoestring back in Los Angeles . We hit it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nerve and determination . She kept looking at me admiringly while I filled out the credit application and looking over at two of my girls who came with me . " Where 'd yo ' mamma git all that enuhgy ? " she 'd ask the girls . The girls , who were holding their breath for fear I was n't going to pull it off with $60 , just looked back at her wide-eyed and shook their heads . But I was n't the ! east bit afraid . It was n't just the treatment I was giving her . You know , determined , dynamic , earnest woman trying to DO something . In my brief time in the South , I had 52 IN THE FARAWAY COUNTRY OF MONTGOMERY , ALABAMA learned how anxious Southerners were to trade . They had seen on television how the other half of the country lived and they were in a hurry to catch up , to get into the Affluent Society . Credit is much easier to get down South than up North . Also , I knew white folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or conditional sales contracts down there . They 've got ways of making them pay . Not that the Goodes would resort to those ways . They were very genteel people , even if Mr. Goode was a real Reb and went to some pains when 1 first started doing business with them to let me know that I was black and he was white and unreconstructed . When I met. him , I had already been there once and , as I said , had practically walked nut with the store . I had the machine , a high-speed electric Kojo , four cartons of mimeograph paper , a dozen cartridges of ink , several bottles of correction fluid , a stylus ; and Robinson , Johnny Reb 's manager , and as pallid and white as Mr. Goode was pink and white , had spent at least two hours teaching me how to run the machine and how to clean it , besides skeptically and a bit sourly , though he did n't dare show it before Mrs. Goode , loading the machine and supplies into the trunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have given Mr. Goode a fit when he came back from a long lunch at the Jeff Davis Hotel around the corner on Robert E. Lee Street . It was more than $1,000 with the supplies , which should have been written up as a thirty-day charge . Besides that , Mrs. Goode had paid a parking ticket I got out on Lee Street while I was inside buying . When I came in the day I met Mr. Goode . I went straight to the back , throwing a " Hi " at Robinson , who was munching peanuts and waiting on a customer , and started up the stairs to the balcony where Mrs. Goode 's desk was . Mr. Goode was standing at the top of the steps . He looked like he was waiting for me and he might have been . I had telephoned from Tuskegee that I was having trouble with the machine and Mrs. Goode had told me to bring it over . Tuskegee is only 38 miles from Montgomery and most of the town trades over there , except for everyday things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head Almeria Lomax i.e a newspaperivoman whose freelance articles have appeared in " The Nation " and elsewhere . She has six children in school and college . As editor-publisher of the Los Angeles " Tribune , " Mrs. Lomax won the first Willkie Award for Negro Journalism . of the stairs as I came up . He had on a. gray checked suit with a vest and a gold watch chain looped across his stomach . He was kind of plump , but it was a healthy plumpness . His hair was snow-white and thick for a man eighty years old . It looked like the white cap of a wave , thrown up off his head from a side part which revealed his healthy pink scalp underneath . His face was all pink and white like the strawberry mousse and white divinity fudge my grandmother was so good at making . When I saw him , I wanted to take a bite of him , Johnny Reb , unreconstructed , his business sense outraged by my raid on his business notwithstanding . I have a real thing about old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . You expect them to be good-looking ; they 've got everything going for them . But when you see an old one who 's come through the fire and torment of life with his colors still flying , you want to stand up and cheer . I knew he had posted himself at the head of the stairs as a sign of his authority . Protocol forbade him being introduced to me as the introduction should have been made , as a man to a woman , or a proprietor to a new customer . It would have been different if Mrs. Goode could have said , " Miz Colyer , this is my husband and Johnny Reb 's boss , Mr. Goode , " as she would have had I been a white woman , or , " Mr. Goode , this is that new customer I was tellin ' you about from ovah at Tuske-gee , Miz Colyer , " or maybe even " Thelma . " But the first would n't have done for him , nor the second for me . She knew I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat me like I should have been treated . So she said nothing and Mr. Goode , who undoubtedly knew from knowing his wife and from what she had said about me , what her dilemma was , stood at the head of the stairs , like George Wallace in the schoolhouse door , as the sign of his authority and the Rebellion and unreconstruction and the separation of the races . From the bottom of the stairs , I dug him . Besides , I knew what I had gotten away with . I had been in business myself and I knew the Goodes had n't gotten where they were in business by trusting rootless Northern females with nothing but a gift of gab to bless themselves with . I knew I had jived Mrs. Goode , though 1 did n't intend to let them lose by it . Just the same , I knew how old Mr. Goode was feeling . But I also knew that something had to give and it was n't going to be me , so I started up the stairs . I marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this time , right behind me , and he stood . But two bodies ca n't occupy the same space at the same time and when I had reached the top step , he had stepped back . Then to save his face , I knew , he walked back and stood beside the big six-foot wall safe and looked back at me , like he was guarding it from the Yankees . " Hi , Mrs. Goode , " I said breezily , walking up to her desk . " Hey , theah , " she drawled in accents that Billie Holiday might have used . " You made it , huh ? Them some more of your'n ? " She indicated the boys , Timothy and Matthew , who were eleven and nine . " Yes , " I said . " This is Timothy and this is Matthew . This is Mrs. Geode , boys . " They said , " How do you do ? " without scratching their heads or grinning and , to cover that , she turned to her husband and drawled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three boys an ' three girls , an ' aimin ' to put out a newspapuh ovah theah in Tuskegee . " Mr. Goode made some indignant noises , as if he were getting ready to shoot of like a geyser . But I was ready for him . I hauled out my checkbook and said , " The machine 's out in the car . I might as well make my payment while I 'm here and get some more paper and ink . I 'll pay cash for the paper and ink this time . " " Aw , you don ' have to do tha-at , " Mrs. Goode said , beginning to glow like a potbellied stove , throwing a proud , vindicated glance at Mr. Goode . They must 've had many a session about me over the month since I had opened the account , and you could see that the " bread " I was putting down had put her one up on him . I did n't bother to look at him , but I could feel the relaxing effect the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it more when he left the wall safe and came closer , like a bear enticed by sugar . I was aware that we had n't been introduced and 1 knew we never would be . But when I got through writing the check for the monthly installment , plus four cartons of paper and a dozen cartridges of ink , we began to talk . " You think you can make a go of that newspaper over there in Tuskegee ? " Mr. Goode said , sitting down behind his desk , which faced Mrs. Goode 's . I had already sat down in a chair beside Mrs. Goode 's desk and had motioned the small boys to two chairs over against the railing from which they could look down on Robinson making a sale of Christmas cards . " Yes , " I said . Mr. Goode did n't have much of a Southern accent . He had a rather cultivated voice and manner of a story by Almena Lomax 57 speaking , but he pronounced Tuskegee like all of the white people who do n't live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very simple Indian name , but they make it sound like it has a long tail of " e 's , " and as if it had n't been ever there east of Montgomery for more than a hundred years . It 's because of it being practically an all-Negro town and the white people who do n't live over there like to act like it 's Africa or some strange part of the mission field , savage and un-Christian and in need of civilizing , not a part of Alabama , which is a laugh , of course , Alabama being as savage , un-Christian , and in need of civilizing as the African bush . " Well , I do n't know , " he said slowly . " How 's it selling ? " " Oh , I 've sold all T could print , " I said . Then I decided that the quickest way to get that white man off my back was to attack . " My biggest problems has been your machine , " I said . " That machine is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not ready to switch to printing yet . " I knew I had him there , both on a point of honor and business . " Weil , now , I would n't want to see you do anything rash and premature , " he said . " My mother always said you have to crawl before you walk and you seem to be going at it the right way . Get on your feet . know which way you 're going , then maybe we can help you . You know , I run a print shop as a part of this operation . " " Yes , I know , " I said . I had had my eye on the big Johnny Reb print shop you passed on Highway 80 , coming into Montgomery , before I picked out the company to buy my machine from . 58 IN THE FARAWAY COUNTRY OF MONTGOMERY , ALABAMA " Now , what seems to be the trouble with the machine ? " " It ca n't carry the load , " I said bluntly . " The catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day . I 'm running ten pages , 2,500 copies , but I 'm spacing the run over three or four days , but the machine just is n't bolding up . One part after another keeps breaking down . It 's obviously too big a load for it . I 'm pretty disappointed , " I added . " I like a machine to do what the manufacturer claims it can do . " " I agree with you , " he said firmly . I had touched the most sensitive chord in his makeup . He was sitting up straight behind his desk now and leaning forward , and his voice had the ring of steel endemic to men of commerce at the moment of truth . " I not only agree with you , I guarantee it , " he went on . " Johnny Reb stands behind every machine or piece of goods it sells . " I tell you what I 'm going to do , " he said . " I 'm going to have Robinson take your machine and put one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more expensive model . But this particular machine I 'm going to let you have while we go over yours is a demonstration machine . It 's been in use here in the store for about six months . But it 's only had about five thousand impressions run off it , and it may be a better machine for the kind of work you 're doing than the one you 've got " Now , if you decide it serves your purposes better than the one you have , we 'll work out something where you 'll have to pay a little more for it than you 're paying for the one you have  --  maybe a couple of hundred dollars , it 's a twelve-hundreddollar machine , but your monthly payments wo n't be any more than they are now . How will that suit you ? " " That 'll suit me fine if the machine performs , " I said , getting to my feet , accepting my receipt from Mrs. Goode with thanks and motioning the boys down the stairs ahead of me . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Robinson , Mr. Goode hung about like a floorwalker , his hands in his trouser pockets , his vested belly stuck out , his bright blue eyes watchful and noncommittal . He studied me as if I were a different breed of animal from any he had ever seen before , but I also had the feeling that he protected us from the white Montgomerians whose craggy faces hardened when they walked in and saw me and my children walking and talking uninhibitedly around the store , standing under the hooks of metal plates which still in the year of Our Lord and the 1964 Civil Rights Act said , " White Only , " " Colored Only , " and sold fora dollar , and nudging one another and pointing at them and laughing . And also protecting his craggy-faced Montgomerians from us , moving deftly with a greeting , a word , a handshake , a clasp on the arm to make them continue to feel at home , " somebody special , " and cock of the walk in spite of the undeferential Negroes littering the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine , the big heavy-duty one now . The vertical bands which were covered with plastic had worn and granulated under the demands of our press run , and we had spent a weekend wiping and washing off the silk screen and picking bits of plastic out of the ink and cursing and wasting paper and trying to get out enough readable copies of the paper to satisfy our subscribers . Now it was Monday morning and , in response to a wire he had sent Friday , Mr. Goode had received a pair of vertical bands from the manufacturer on the West Coast and was coming over in person with Robinson to supervise both their installation and the cleaning of the machine . Robinson had worked for Mr. Goode in good times and in bad for almost forty years . It was the only job he had ever had . He was not only Johnny Reb 's manager ; he was Mr. Goode 's slave , his white one , He did n't have any black ones , at least not at the store . He had a Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and packaged paper , stocked the shelves , swept out the store , and when Robinson or the other salesman were rushed , waited on customers . But John was always as self-contained as Mr. Goode . You never saw him skinning ' em back and whining , " How you today , Mistuh Hernaday ? " like you did Robinson , bowing and scraping and backing and hurrying and cackling that little hen cackle of a laugh and munching those peanuts . He was a good-looking boy , dark and slim-waisted with small keen features , a well-shaped head , and a long , lithe body . The whole time we traded there , he never said anything except , " Yes sir , " " No sir , " " Yes mam , " " No mam , " " How you today ? " or , " Thank you , call again . " But I did n't get the impression that he was shy or frightened , just aloof and detached like Mr. Goode , keeping his own counsel , except when he was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving music to match the whir and slash of the wheel and knife of the giant power cutter , moving his body in time to his music and the machine 's voracious sound . Robinson put me in mind of a mouse in a granary , never still , never silent , never relaxed . Even if he were not talking to anybody , he was blowing or grunting or wheezing or twittering or whistling studiously between the gaps in his teeth , his hands , his feet , his - fat little overstuffed mouse bottom swishing and skittering and squatting and rushing . His face had the gray , bloodless , pinched look of a mouse , too . Later , Mrs. Goode wrote me that he had died of cancer . Robinson had two gods , R. C. Goode and Governor George Wallace . He called Mr. Goode " Mr. Bob " and if " Mr. Bob " had told him to go out and hang himself to the tallest pine on Court Street , I am sure he would have said , " Yessir , Mr. Bob , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Wallace , half his whistling was in praise of him . If you asked him how his kitchen garden was coming along out in Comer subdivision where he and his wife lived in a neat brick home built with FHA financing , he would say , " Coming along fine , thanks to George Wallace l " George Wallace had improved the corn that was being grown in Alabama so you could get real " ras'in ' ears , " not that dry , hard stuff that looked like a cracker 's teeth ; he had improved the soil , the roads , education , the economic outlook , even the climate and race relations if you listened to Robinson . I never did learn Robinson 's full name , though we spent many hours together in Tuskegee and Montgomery working out my problems with the mimeograph machine . And I never heard him called anything but Robinson . Even when Mrs. Goode would write to me , she 'd refer to him simply as Robinson and her husband as Mr. Goode . Robinson drove Mr. Goode over from Montgomery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tires on the driveway and looked out the front window and saw Mr. Goode 's Chrysler station wagon sweep up and park on the thick carpet of pine needles in front of the garage door . Mr. Goode was sitting up straight as a rod on the front seat . He sat while Robinson jumped out and rushed around and opened the door for him . Then he got out slowly and stately and a little apprehensively , I thought . Suddenly , I wondered if he had ever been in a Negro 's house before . That happens down there , you know . They live so that they ca n't move without stepping on the Negro . Negroes come into every corner of their souls , let alone their homes , yet most of them have never entered a Negro home . They never know how the Negro lives , or what he is like inside himself , while Negroes know all about them . They walked up on the porch , Robinson clucking along beside Mr. Goode , his tidy little repair a story by Almeria Lomax 59 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his left hand under the old man 's arm . " Good morning , " I greeted them , smiling and again having that longing to take a spoonful of the old man . " Come in . " Robinson was looking at me carefully , but I thought there was a note of confidence in his face . He was used to me now . He knew I knew " my place , " as I saw it , and the way I saw it , he thought , was n't going to upset his " Mr. Bob " and his precious white man 's dignity any . But Mr. Goode did n't seem to be too sure . He looked at me warily and then suddenly his eyes seemed to take a great gulp of me , like a swimmer gulps air just before plunging into water , and ho plunged in . There had been frost on the ground and the trees that morning , and he had on his overcoat . As he stepped through the door , he removed his hat . " Atta boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured soothingly out loud , " May I take your hat , Mr. Goode ? " He was doing better than that cracker termite man who had come to spray once a week until we got rid of everything that had been roosting and nesting and breeding and boring into the house for several years before we had rented it , and whom I had told not to come back until he got so he could take off his hat inside the house . But " Robert " was n't going all the way yet , " No , I 'll keep my hat . I thank you just the same , " he said firmly . I led them through the living room and down the hall to the small study I used as a combination office and pressroom . Michael 's door was closed . He was home from Atlanta , studying for mid-term finals because the house , when his brothers and sisters were at school , was quieter than either the dormitories or the library at Morehouse . But he had insisted that he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let " those crackers " know there was a " man around the house . " I knew it was a pointless demonstration . I was n't in any danger of attack from either Robinson or Mr. Goode , but more important , I knew that neither one of them would acknowledge his existence as a " man around the house , " or anything else . He had been to Johnny Reb 's with me a couple of times and I had introduced him to Robinson and to Mr. Goode the first time and had told them when they said in place of " How do you do , " " You 've got lots of help , " " No , Michael is in college in Atlanta , " and then he ceased to exist for them even while his six-foot , four-inch body remained standing in front of them . They knew Tuskegee had a Negro college and Montgomery , too , but a Negro 60 IN THE FARAWAY COUNTRY OF MONTGOMERY , ALABAMA male college student was an unreality as long as they refused to recognize him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family , our casualness and the absence of the usual Alabama Negro inhibitions or fronts or disguises , our strange Northern speech , and the startling frankness of my publication , which I sent over to them and they promptly subscribed to , for them to assimilate without tangling with such exotic flora and fauna as a Negro male who was getting a college OFF CAMPUS by Malcolm Cowley " Your career and achievement " he skipped some words between dashes ? " are of abiding importance to us and our reference users , " and now the qualifying clause , " although your sketch was transferred some time ago to a non-current category ( because of retirement or other circumstances affecting current national reference interest ) . " A printed card from Who 's Who : when the postman came sloshing through the snow that morning , it was the only mail .

Paint flakes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his books . " Please sign , date and return card even if no data additions are required . " Would there be any ? he wondered . His old wife putters in the kitchen ; now she is rinsing the breakfast dishes . The pump comes on with a cardiac gasp . " If biographee is no longer living , recipient of card should kindly so indicate on the space provided . " " I shall so indicate , " he said the mortgage paid , his papers tiled away , his career and achievement filed away , his heart filed away on a cardiogram , his life on a punch card transferred some time ago to a non-current category . education " up in Atlanta " and would never be a waiter or a delivery boy or a porter . I could see that Mr. Goode liked the way I was set up . The machine was set on a heavy old desk alongside a window but out from it so that you could get at it from both sides . Two smaller desks were ranged alongside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I cut my stencils . On the other was the battered , souped-up old Royal on which I wrote my copy . Along the back wall were bookcases with my stacks of the issues 1 had published , my stencil files , my supplies , and books and reference material . Along the opposite wall from the machine was a Danish sofa with throw pillows and an Indian blanket . The heater glowed warm and red at the foot of it , and the thin winter sun shone through the window which looked out on the forest which went with the house and which had pines so tall I could n't see their tops , not even from the upstairs windows , and which fell away into a soft , trackless density out of which a bobcat was just as likely to pad , or a covey of quail to rush upward , as the squirrels which plunged up and down the trunks of the trees or leaped dizzyingly from branch to branch . It was very cozy and yet workmanlike , and Mr. Goode sighed and began automatically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goode , " I said in a casual voice . " Rest your coat if you like . " Robinson turned dutifully to help him , but he snapped at him as quick as one of the squirrels . " Get on with your work , Robinson . You got a job there . " " Yessir , Mr. Bob . " " Mr. Bob " finished unbuttoning his coat , but he did n't take it off . He settled tentatively on the sofa and looked out tenderly on the trees and squirrels . It was impossible to resist them . " Look at those rascals , " he finally said and settled back against the sofa cushions , still clutching his hat in his left hand , but his right beginning absently to tug the coat off his shoulders . Robinson and I ignored him , but not entirely by design . Robinson did have a job in front of him . I took the cover off the machine and we stood looking at it . I had cleaned it some , but it was still oozing ink from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclog the feed line . Nothing was left of the vertical hands except the thin wire which formed their frame . Robinson began to whistle thinly through the gaps in his teeth and to blow and grunt and talk to himself contentedly as he went patiently about the business of breaking down the machine , cleaning its parts , reassembling it , and putting on the new bands . I left it with him . I was n't about to help that white man , I said to myself , after the weekend his machine had put me through . I perched on the wooden stool I kept beside the bookcase and gazed contentedly out at the woods . I could have sat like that for days . I 'm crazy about Alabama . If it were n't for the schools , which I do n't care what Robinson says , white or Negro , are n't fit to educate a cretin , I would never have left . And I 'm going back someday . I do n't know when . But my idea of heaven is to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hanks of the Chattahoochee River , like my Aunt Minnie has for fifty-eight years , " and hated every moment of it , " she always adds . I even liked what the kids at Tuskegee Institute called " those crazy HI peckerwoods . " They did n't bother me . They probably would have if I had stayed long enough , the kind of thing I was writing in my mimeographed paper , stuff like " Register and vote . There can be a Negro sitting in the Governor 's chair at Montgomery in ten years , " and then sending a copy special-delivery and underlined to George Wallace . I 'm something of a rebel myself . Tuskegee has a softly rolling terrain . The house we were living in was built by a West Indian doctor for his first wife . They had lots of money and she had very fancy ideas . Like most of the houses of the black bourgeoisie in Tuskegee , it was split-level . The front was level with the highway , Old Montgomery Road , which runs by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide stone veranda with three entrances and a two-car garage which opened into the sun porch at the back . The back where we were looked down onto a canopied patio which opened into the basement where there were a playroom , a couple of bedrooms , a bath , and a laundry room . Upstairs , where Michele , Michael 's older sister , had retreated with her Kennedy books and a " Yuk I " when I told her that Robinson and Mr. Goode were coming over  --  she did n't share my fondness for Southern white people  --  there were three more bedrooms and a bath and a small sitting room . Out in the pines , the squirrels were having themselves a hall . There were two or three in every tree you wanted to look at and there were pines as far back as you could see . The squirrels would plunge down the trunks of the trees from heights of forty or fifty feet in seconds , two or three seconds . They were so fast your eye could hardly follow them . Or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story by Almena Lomax and leap to another on another tree . The branch would bend slightly and the squirrel , without even a pause for balance , would be off along the branch , down the trunk , across the bed of pine needles , cones , and withered kudzu vines and leaves , and up another tree , all lightning fast and as sure and graceful as a ballerina . Every once in a while , there would be a flash of color , bright-red or yellow or blue , and a bird would dart through the trees and perch on one of the branches , then whisk of again . I was a bird watcher while I lived in Tuskegee , but I never did learn any of their names , unlike the other journalists of the region who regularly devoted columns of the Montgomery Advertiser and the Alabama Journal and the Birmingham Herald and the Opelika Times to the habits of the birds which rested in their backyards . As a matter of fact , birds , roses , and azaleas rank with " nigras " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " heart of Dixie . " " Who owns this property ? " Mr. Goode suddenly broke his rapt contemplation of the forest to ask above Robinson 's whistles , wheezes , grunts , and the creaking of his joints as he squatted to get a line on the fit of a pair of rullers or the position of a lever . " A doctor named Walcott . He lives down in Pascagoula now , " I said . " A Negro ? " Mr. Goode was certainly an unusual Alabamian , Outside of Tuskegee , where the whites all learned to pronounce Negro correctly during the five-year boycott the Negroes staged after the city fathers gerrymandered the town to cut out all but five Negro families to keep Negroes from controlling the elections , I had n't encountered ten white people who could say Negro and not " nigra . " " Yes . " " He owns all that out there , I reckon , " Mr. Goode said , moving his right arm , which was free now of his overcoat , in an are to take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walcott place from the immense grounds of Dr. and Mrs. Brockenbury next door . " Yes , " I said . " I do n't know how far back , though . I 've never been all the way back to the fence I understand is back there . I met up with a snake one day while walking , and by mutual agreement , he stays on that side and I keep to this side of the pines . " He smiled at me then , and it was like the splintering of the thin ice which forms in the night during Alabama winters . The children rush to be the first to shatter it with their heels on the way to the car . They give the thin smooth panes a 62 IN THE FARAWAY COUNTRY OF MONTGOMERY , ALABAMA blow , and they splinter into star shapes which then catch the chill morning sun , and suddenly there are spangles shimmering before your eyes . He sat and watched the antics of the squirrels some more , and then after a bit , his bright blue eyes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , taking in the Venetian blinds , the high ceiling , the smooth rose-colored paint on the walls , the mahogany woodwork , the handsome chandelier . His eyes moved to the north window , to the clump of oak trees on the right side of the house , to the camellia bushes heavy , despite the frost , with pink , white , red , and candy-striped blooms , to the old-fashioned well which Dr. Walcott had preserved there and surrounded with a low concrete wall . It certainly was n't any sharecropper 's cabin , nor like the chicken coops and vegetable crates of houses you see Negroes living in all over Montgomery . Suddenly , he sat up straight and laid his hat carefully on one knee and shook his overcoat off his shoulders as if he had business to attend to and did n't want to he encumbered . " I was delayed in driving over here , " he began , speaking deliberately and looking straight at me , the look in his eyes as well as his words seeming to deny the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of eyes , " by an old preacher of your race , Preacher Jim , we call him . He has been coming to my office regularly once a month for forty-five years , and I always help him out with five dollars or so . I guess he uses it in whatever work he does ; I do n't know . I never ask . I just give him what I know he 's come for . " His words dropped intact , complete , not just in themselves , but in their meaning , their significance , to him and presumably to me and to the Negro doctor who owned the land and the house we were sitting in and who left it to rent out or decay and went off to Pascagoula and made more money , much more , and bought more land and built a much finer house , and to the NAACP and CORE and Snick and the Freedom Riders and Negro college professors and students . Probably the only person to whom Mr. Goode 's words were not expected to have significance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as Mr. Goode was concerned , they were like the squirrels in the trees of the Walcott place ; they came with the property , but were not counted in its value . When he had done speaking , he kept on looking at me out of those unbelievably clear , bright , and pure blue eyes . His gaze was not so much unfathomable as translucent . Bright , glorious , and as empty as a baby 's . I looked back at him . I did not frown or change the expression in my face at all to show that I was sorry he felt he had to say that . I did not offer him the balm of saying , " How nice , " or , " Is that so ? " just looked at him levelly and impassively as at star shapes of ice which had melted and become mud and were n't spangled anymore and said somberly , without any inflection in my voice , " Oh . " He looked away and suddenly , as if a knob had been turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeze and whistle and grunt and creak up a breeze . " Robinson , you make more noise than that machine when it 's going full clip , " Mr. Goode said from behind the barricade of his white neck and platinum white hair and rosy cheeks . " Yessir , Mr. Bob , sho ' do . I 'm a noisy one fo ' a fack , " and laughter gurgled out of Robinson like breaking wind . " Now , you got a stencil you want to try her out on ? " Robinson asked in a few minutes , looking up proudly from over the shining clean machine , wiping his fingers tidily with a rag and depositing it in the wastebasket behind him which was filled almost to overflowing with the inky rags and paper with which he had cleaned the machine . " Sure . I 'll let you get started on this week 's edition , " I said , reaching behind me and taking from a shelf the stencil I had finished cutting just before they arrived . Robinson plugged in the machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then neatly and expertly , he fitted the stencil onto the gleaming silk screen . Mr. Goode and I watched , fascinated , but in a sort of limbo . Machines were Robinson 's life , mimeograph machines , copying machines , adding machines , typewriters , stitchers , paper cutters . His eyes were gleaming as at a lovely woman he expected to love him back . But to Mr. Goode , machines represented figures on his profit-and-loss statement , inventory , property , muney in the bank , his standing in the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce , his status in the Rotary Club , the Lions Club , and in the lounge of the Jeff Davis Hotel . While to me , the mimeograph machine was a thing of beauty if it did n't break down , did n't throw ink , did n't tear stencils , got out my 3,500 copies of the Tribune ( circulation was up ) , but if it did n't , it had about the same meaning to me that Robinson had to " Mr. Bob . " Robinson 's dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen while the other turned the lever which turned the drum manually . Then he switched to automatic and stood aside . The drum turned and began to shuttle out sheets of printed paper . He snatched one in midair before it touched down in the tray below . " How 's that ? " he asked , handing it to me . " I do n't know , " I said cautiously . " What 's this black bar down at the bottom ? " " Dawggone ! " Robinson exclaimed softly . " What 's that ? That should n't be theah . Was n't nothin ' wrong with the stencil that I saw . " " No , it was n't on the stencil , " I said . " Look , it 's getting bigger ! " And I indicated the receiving tray into which the sheets were falling like leaves . " The silk screen 's slipping . " " Dawggone ! " Robinson exclaimed again . " I thought them vertical bands looked funny . " " Something wrong , Robinson ? " Mr. Goode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our mundane world and could see at a glance that his presence was needed . " I think so , Mr. Bob . I think them vertical bands was the wrong size . " " Confound it ! " he exclaimed . Afterwards I thought that it was a real " quality " exclamation . No " Damn it ! " No " Dawggone ! " As Negroes would say , " Class tells . " " Turn that thing off , Robinson , " he ordered . " You 're just wasting paper . " " Yessir , Mr. Bob . " " Did you check the size of those bands before you put them on ? " " Nosir , Mr. Bob , I did n't . I jes ' took it for granted they 'd send the right size . " " Never take anything for granted , Robinson . Look at the wrapping . " With a doleful expression on his face , Robinson dug into the wastebasket for the brown paper wrapping the bands had come in . I resigned myself to being late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not yet noon , the thin sun had paled , and the squirrels had vanished as if stricken from the limbs of the trees , and the woods itself looked gray and ' whiskery with wintry age . " Here ' t is , " Robinson said . He smoothed the brown wrapper out neatly on a sheet of the spoiled paper and glanced at it briefly . " Yep , it was a wrong one all right . Them bands is for a Numbuh 310 . " He looked up and stood looking miserably over at Mr. Goode . " I should'a looked before bringin ' you way ovah heal , Mr. Bob . " Mr. Goode dismissed his woe with a wave of his beautifully manicured right hand . " It was n't no more your fault than it was mine , Robinson . I signed for it at the Air Express office . I should have looked and sent it right back . " I sat back up on the stool and let them figure a way out . It was out of mine or Robinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Bob . " a story by Almena Lomax 63 " May I use your phone ? " the old man asked me . " Certainly , " I said , indicating the extension on the end table at his right . " I want to make a long. - distance call to the manufacturer , " he explained carefully . " I will make sure the operator puts the charges on my bill . " " Go right ahead , " I said . He moved over a bit on the sofa and picked up the receiver . Robinson , his face crossed and crisscrossed with worry like a pinch-faced old woman 's , began to remove the bands and wipe them off and wrap them in their old wrapper . " Operator , " Mr. Goode was saying into the telephone , " this is R. C. Goode , of the Johnny Reb Stationery and Office Supply Company of Montgomery . . . " He paused as if giving her time to digest that . " Yes , that 's right , " he said smoothly . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manufacturing Company there . I will give you the number , but first , I want you to make a note to charge this call to my telephone at the Johnny Reb Company in Montgomery , not to the number I am calling from . Do you understand that ? " Again he paused . The operator appeared to understand for he began in the same smooth , firm voice . " My number in Montgomery is 232-6418 . You have that ? " Now , get me 846-9111 in San Francisco , California . I 'll talk to whoever answers . " He settled back against the cushions to wait . Robinson took off the stencil and blotted it between two used pieces of mimeograph paper , and I put it back on the shelf , and he began to wipe down the machine preparatory to covering it . Then Mr. Goode sat up straight again . He sat very straight as he did in the midst of a business discussion behind his desk , his shoulders squared , his chin thrust forward , his eyes alert . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is R. C. Goode , of the Johnny Reb Stationery and Office Supply Company in Montgomery ? " He stopped suddenly and a frown of annoyance appeared on his face between his thick white silk eyebrows . " I said , of the Johnny Reb Stationery and Office Supply Company in Montgomery , " he began again , and was halted again . " Montgomery , " he repeated firmly . Then , " Montgomery , Alabama , " he said , adding the last word uncertainly , almost incredulously , plaintively , and in shock as if someone in the lounge of the Jeff Davis Hotel in Montgomery had suddenly challenged his credit rating .
