txt A tractor driven by a weather-beaten old man slowly pulled . a plow across a small field . A hundred yards away , in the'yard of a sprawling whitewashed house , an elderly woman swept the ground near her pig and rabbit Dens . In this outlying corner of Palomares it was difficult to imagine on such a quiet day the furious activity that has taken place since an unarmed American hydrogen bomb fell in the field 10 weeks ago . A TNT charge that was part of the bomb 's mechanism exploded and sprayed radioactive material over a side area . The result , here and elsewhere in the area where other bombs fell , was the most extensive and arduous nucleardecontamination effort ever undertaken by the United States . It began with 185 men spending more than two weeks , much of the time on their knees , determining the boundaries of the area that had been ? affected .

The first bomb landed intact in a dry riverbed east of the village and was immediately recovered . The second and third bombs caused a vast and urgent problem because they released the radioactive material  --  though not of any intensity harmful to life , according to official sources ? in the middle of a populated area . The fourth bomb remained lost until March 16 , when ! the Navy located it at the bottom of the Mediterranean . Efforts to recover the bomb on the sea floor have so ? far been unsuccessful . Most of the details about the decontamination operation have come to light only since the cleanup was completed and Maj. Gen. Delmar E. Wilson , commander of the Spain-based United States 16th Air Force , could proclaim that Palomare5. had been restored to normal . When the decontamination effort started , the 185-man team lafbored to establish the outer limits of a 640-acre rectangular zone , including the - pillage and fields around it , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in.stru , . , , , , Rients resembling large tele : phones to detect the radioactivity , the men had moved slowly across the contaminated area taking readings on everything . In this back-breaking labor each man averaged an acre in ? a 12-hour day . Because the . wind had blown the third bomb 's uranium and plutonium particles almost two miles into the black porous mountains beyond the fishing village of Villarico , east of Palomares , the men had to crawl over the jagged rocks there , too . Under an agreement with the Spanish Nuclear Energy Commission , the Air Force undertook to scrape topsoil in barren areas where the radiation count warranted it . In cultivated fields , scraping and plowing were ordered on the basis of a. much lower count . The Air Force men scraped off and shipped to the atomic cemetery in South Carolina two inches of topsoil from the one and a half acres in the hills . It added up to more than 1,600 tons of soil packed in steel drums .

Then came the plowing under of the contaminated fields . Col. Alton E. White , a Texas engineer and farmer who is the 16th Air Force 's director of engineering , reported that 854 separate plots of land totaling 386 acres were plowed 10 inches deep . When decontamination was completed in each plot , the owner was handed a certificate signed by United States and Spanish officials declaring his land to be free of radioactivity . Colonel White also replaced contaminated topsoil with earth ' brought from another site . He had his men build miles of barbed-wire fences and new stone posts along property lines where the searchers had torn out tons of cactus fences to facilitate operations . While the decontamination went on , the troops also had to cut and tear out thousands of truckloads of tomato plants and vegetation and burn them at a deserted site in the dry river bed .

At the outset they wore face masks and used surgical gloves under heavy cotton gloves . Soon , though , this precaution was abandoned and often men with bare hands picked up pieces of bomb in areas showing high radioactivity . At the end of each day , however , they showered in the cleanup areas and were issued clean coveralls . All were checked by doctors , with negative results . After the cleanup operation was completed , the question remained whether Palomares was really back to normal . In the immediate sense , the answer seemed to be affirmative . With the new planting season beginning this week , the men were back in the fields . The three schools in the area had long since reopened .
