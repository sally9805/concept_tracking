txt The main dish General de Gaulle served up in his semiannual lecture to the press was his familiar specialty ; roast ally in sweet-sour sauce . He has put the United States on notice publicly , as he did privately last summer , ? that all American . troops and bases on- French soil must come under French control before April 4 , 1969 . By the same date , the remaining French troops and personnel . in NATO are to be withdrawn from allied commands and , presumably , from integrated.headquarters such as SHAPE . The French President says that the North Atlantic alliance is still " useful " ? he used to call it " indispensable . ' Yet his mention of the April 4 , 1969 , date involves an implied threat to renounce , the treaty , when its twentieth anniversary makes that possible , unless the organization of the affiance is altered to suit his taste . The general has yet to say precisely what his taste is . He is unlikely to do so this year ? but not because President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials suggest . France is heading . toward Parliamentary elections in the next twelve months . General de Gaulle 's majority in the National Assembly and the future of his regime wills be at stake . His difficulty in winning the December Presidential election is forcing him now to alter his tactics abroad as well as at home . At home he seeks to stimulate the economy after two years of deflation . In foreign policy he must act on December 's lesson that disputes with his Common Market neighbors ? can cost critical votes . The French President may not worry about a row with the United States , but he can not now afford the bitter conflict with other Europeans that any attempt to dismantle NATO would precipitate . The Presidential election proved that seven years of Gaullism have failed , to weaken the broad commitment of " Frenchmen both to reconciliation with Germany and unification of Europe . It has forced the general to liquidate his boycott of the Common Market ? to make conciliatory noises about Britain and to stage an amiable meeting with Chancellor Erhard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of negotiations  --  broken off in 1962-ffor a political union of the six Common Market countries . He has expressed support for " a lowering of all tariffs " in the Kennedy Round . And he even conceded ? at least verbally  --  that a political union of . the Six " can and must be a valid partner in all fields " for . . . the United States . It is the first time General de Gaulle has ever paid lip service to the concept of Atlantic partnership urged by President Kennedy and Jean Monnet . Domestic ' politics is not the entire explanation of de Gaulle 's surprising new course . On his Moscow visit , the French President would like to speak for the six Common Market countries , rather than France alone . His past efforts to organize the Six have failed because he tried to dominate , not lead . Now he is making a new effort  --  but his Common Market partners are skeptical . They , too , await the French Parliamentary election , as does Washington . When that vote is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to gauge what the ' future holds in relations with Charles de Gaulle .
