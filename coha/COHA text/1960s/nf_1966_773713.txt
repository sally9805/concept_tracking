txt // crete and individual actualities ( " basic facts , " " qualities of sense " ) . The highest genus is " simple " because it is the common denominator of everything else . The most concrete fact or quality is " simple " because it is the common denominator of nothing else . Neither , we learn , has " parts . " How are we to test whether a quality does or does not have parts ? Is spatial expanse a " part " of red ? Is brightness ? Or contrast with an environing ground ? Whether these are " parts " or not , they are certainly constituent traits , and indeed the kind of constituent traits without which red is not possible . When it is protested that it is the " sense quality " which is simple , does this expression somehow get rid of the quality in any other respect ? A " sensation of red " has the traits that the " quality of red " necessarily has , such as expanse or spread-outness , and contrast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " minimally is and means , and what the sensing of red is and entails . The term " red " is the name for a natural complex . And so is the term " spread-out . " The metaphysics of natural complexes denies the discriminability of anything without ramification and constitution ? of anything unrelated and not located in an order , of anything free of traits affecting and affected by other traits . The underlying dissatisfaction with the view that every quality is a natural complex , whether in its relation to other qualities or in its relation to sensing , rests on two informal arguments that tend to linger . The first is that if expanse , contrast , and other traits are present in the case of a specific quality red , they are also present in the case of qualities other than red , // for instance yellow , so that in each case there must be a unique and distinguishing residuum , and it is this which is the simple irreducible red or yellow . But the circumstance that two complexes have common or similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexes . And this circumstance is even an indispensable condition of discrimination . Distinguishability is not an affair between perfectly simple or single qualities . On the contrary , absolutely unique qualities would be non-comparable . If any complex may belong to more than one order , then theoretically there is no limit to the number of similar traits that two given complexes may have while remaining different and distinguishable . The difference between complexes , in other words , may be revealed by their location . Where , for instance , in an order of classification two traits are considered abstractly and found to be the same , in an order of analysis the structure of the traits may be quite different . The second lingering argument is that certain " whatchamacallits " ( we must n't beg the question by calling them " complexes " ) are " unities " first and foremost , and that if they are constituted of plural traits these traits are irrelevant in a peculiar way . The confusion in this argument will become evident ; but by way of contrast it provides opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every complex has an integrity . Whatever the boundaries or limits of complexes may happen to be , whatever may be the conditions under which these limits obtain , wherever these limits may lie , any complex has just the status , just the relations , just the constitution that // it has . This is its integrity , that in which its being " a " complex and " that " complex consists . Integrity entails both uniqueness and commonness . A complex has not only an integrity but also a " scope . " The scope of a complex will be defined subsequently in a cumulative way : by consideration of its forms , by comparison with the idea of integrity , and by its role in the definition of relation . The integrity of a complex is always conditional , in the sense that it is minimally determined by the location of the complex in this or that order of complexes . A complex has an integrity for each of its ordinal locations . The continuity and totality of its locations , the interrelation of its integrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is itself an integrity , the gross integrity of that which is plurally located , whether successively or simultaneously . A contour is the integrity of a complex not in so far as the complex transcends all orders but in so far as it belongs to many orders . The identity of a complex is the continuous relation that obtains between the contour of a complex and any of its integrities . One way of looking at integrity is in terms of its implicit recognition within the human order ? or , what in effect is the same , within the order of continuing interrelation between human and non-human complexes . The expression " a complex " is the most insistent verbal mode of setting apart whatever is discriminated and regarded as whole . It suggests an integrity in the formation of which man has had a part . Discriminations are , so to speak , framings of complexes from the welter of complexes . They may or may not // be conscious . In so far as they serve needs , they make for long-term good or evil whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-instrumental profusion , punctuating the life of man by virtue merely of his sentience or of his situation . Nature provides the human animal with dim alternatives , and he , destined as he is in one of his dimensions to accept , frames with a robust disrespect for actualities . The process of discriminating , framing , selecting is the pulse of human utterance . Utterance ranges from the primordial maneuvers and responses ? those which men can not help making and which are humanly taken for granted , but which nevertheless vary individually ? to the most intricate methodic products . Depending upon which essential aspect of the human process is emphasized , utterance may be seen as " production " or as " judgment . " Man produces ( a ) by acting in relation to the integrities among which he finds himself , ( b ) by contriving new integrities , and ( c ) by propositionally structuring integrities in order to affirm or test his suspicions . He is the creature that judges the complexes of nature by producing in these three modes . In practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their analytical separation and preservation is imperative if a theory of the human process is to fit , with any adequacy at all , the animal that has stumbled fantastically among peaks and troughs . The products of men are made possible by natural complexes that lend themselves to identification . Each product is a complex that has its own integrity , even if it is of momentary duration and small importance . // A product emerges in just the way it does , and has just the multifariousness that it has . Whatever the product , the fact that it is a product , that it is an integrity , means that it has a unitary aspect . And likewise , whatever the complex , the fact that it is a complex implies unity ( or unitariness ) in some respect . Every crosssection of nature , every combination , temporal stretch , accident , or flicker has an integrity in an order . Thus the view that certain complexes are unities " first and foremost " is without meaning . It makes sense only to say that given complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . The integrity of a complex belongs to it not in spite of but because of its multiplicity and relatedness. v All natural complexes are relational , though not only relational . Any complex is related to others , though not to all others ; and its traits are related to one another , though not necessarily each to every other . Whatever is , is in some relation : a given complex may be unrelated to another given complex , but not unrelated to any other . A complex related to another complex in one respect may not be related to it in another respect . There is no end to the relational " chain " of a complex ; and there is no end to the explorability of a complex , whether in respect of its relational traits or any other . A relation as such is a complex , analyzable as all are . No complex is inherently " more of a complex " or " more complex " than any other , nor unqualifiedly " simpler " than any other . The whole is not simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . // The genus is not less analyzable than a species , nor a species less analyzable than the genus . The principal qualification that must be made , partly because of dominant habits in human discourse , applies to complexes in an order of estimation ; that is , in a certain sub-order of the human order . Here we may speak , with entire justification , of differences in " simplicity " or " complexity . " Yet even here , since any one analysis can be pursued as indefinitely far as any other , the differences lie not in the relative number of traits belonging to a complex or its analysis , but ( a ) in the relative importance assigned to it , or in the relative interest aroused by it , and ( b ) in the relative adequacy , at a particular time , of the devices employed to manipulate it deliberatively . This is what is meant by the apparently commonplace opinion that some problems or some objectives are simpler than others . Importance and interest are themselves , of course , natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , which is the chief factor determining the boundaries of certain types of perspective . There are also , to be sure , compulsive conditions of nature that influence estimations of what is important . Two of these , described in the next section , are the relative comprehensiveness and the relative pervasiveness of natural complexes . In sensation the diversifying aspects of a complex ( the complex sensed ) are submerged . They are neglected by the sensing organism . ( Whether a sensation is " pure " or not is beside the point . ) In sensation , no less than in all other processes and situations , man is both manipulating and assimilating complexes of the // world available to him . Sensing is a way of functioning wherein the deliberative aspect possible to manipulation is all but irrelevant . Sheer sensory feeling is a relation between complexes . It is a relation which men seem always to have regarded as the most primitive form of encounter . By some , notably some philosophers , it is regarded as the only form of encounter . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may regard these as levels of sensory encounter informed by respectively greater degrees of conjecture or probing . All three are discriminative , but differently discriminative . It is not merely what they discriminate but how they discriminate that defines the levels . Actually , while still in a sensory capacity , we may encounter quite different aspects of a given complex ? for example , a complex in its status as a symptom or in its status as a problem . The difference in the levels lies in the relative accessibility ? accessibility to sensing ? of the order within which the sensed complex is located . Observation yields greater access , sensation lesser . Not all complexes can be sensed . But those complexes that are available to sensation are encountered just as integrities , **33;317;TOOLONG . They neither are , nor are encountered as , ontological simples , perfect homogeneities . They neither are , nor are encountered as , indivisible . And they may , or may not , be encountered as undivided . In one respect , the " object " in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . In another respect , constituent traits , together with their relative contrasts ( divisions ) , are present together in the complex sensed . // In so far as the complex sensed is undivided , it may be called , not inappropriately , " individual . " If what is individual in this meaning of the term is to be called " simple , " then any natural complex that becomes sensed thereby becomes " simple . " It is not by virtue of what happens to be sensed that this kind of simplicity enters the sensory relation ; it is because of the nature of this relation that whatever is sensed acquires such simplicity . Why should the three levels be called levels of " sensory " encounter ? Because , it is sometimes assumed , an encounter of this kind is more " direct " than any other . But the definition of " direct " is very difficult . It is possible to think the other way round , of directness of encounter as that which is sensory in character . Is the perception of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of a mathematical similarity , or of a spatial relation , less " direct " than the perception of a color ? And when we ask , further , whether the perception of a spatial relation should be regarded as " sensory " perception , the meaning of " direct " becomes still more indecisive . In whatever way " direct " is to be defined , if we assume that sensation is the " most " direct of the three levels of sensory encounter , nothing implies that it must be instantaneous or devoid of gradations . Directness of encounter may continue indefinitely . As a phase within a wider sensory process , and beyond this , within an experiential process , sensation literally preserves certain kinds of integrities . The notion of sensation as an all-or-none occurrence of infinitesimal duration still carries extraordinary weight . It is probably // perpetuated by the social need , or supposed need , for single trait-labels , names that are thought to facilitate communication . The fact , however , that children do not always sense in a way which harmonizes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their limited powers of expression and report ? their relative lack of control over names . They appear to discriminate and to embrace what is not in accord with the standardized modes of sensory life . Thus the familiar view that children and poets have much in common is far from being precious or exaggerated . Sensation is that kind of relation in which certain integrities as such become conspicuous , and hence expediently negotiable , utilizable . In sensation , we said , the many and different aspects of a complex are functionally annulled . But just as we may sense a complexas-an-integrity , so we may methodically relate to that complex-as-an-integrity . Methodically we may submerge the contrasting traits within the complex . In our relation to a complex we may deliberately neglect or strategically disregard the relationality within the complex and the relations of the complex . But we can not regard the integrity as somehow isolated in its being , or as intrinsically free of relation . We may speak of the integrity as " felt , " but the assumption that there are integrities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An integrity need not be inquired into . Not to inquire into it may be suitable to a purpose or circumstantially desirable . But to suppose that it can not be inquired into , that it is not the " kind of thing " that can be " described or defined , " is to suppose it the // sole inhabitant of an order detached from every other order ? in effect , to suppose it ( in securely negative fashion ) " non-natural . " Dewey , who like innumerable others thinks there are " undefinable and indescribable qualities , " qualities that are " ineffable , " beclouds the natural status that he insists on assigning to these qualities. ? A feeling is itself a complex that is analyzable , not a non-relational monadic ultimate . To analyze a feeling through an enumeration or description of its traits may be undesirable in certain types of situation . The description , like any other description , may be better or worse , more or less clarifying . To interpret and clarify the feeling through action , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of situation it may also be true that to act is far less difficult ( for some men ) than to describe traits . But conditions of relative strategy and appropriateness aside , there is no good reason to believe that a description of traits is ever intrinsically less possible than an action . Leibniz , who affirms the indubitable being of simples , at times equates simplicity with indivisibility , and at times equates simplicity with uniqueness . In terms of the latter inclination , he sees the " essence " of a so-called simple substance as actually a multiplicity of traits , but a unique multiplicity , a totality consisting of " all the predicates of which the substance is or may become the subject . " 7 Here the simple is that which is sui generis but not necessarily unanalyzable . Whitehead , taking it for granted that " simplicity " means unanalyzability , distinguishes simplicity from atomicity , rejecting simplicity and accepting atomicity. // Atomicity he construes as genuinely individual being . And he regards his atoms as " final " or " ultimate " actualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For the meditating philosopher , " says Husserl , " the world is only something that claims being . " 8 Just what the world would amount to ( for the meditating philosopher ) if it lost its claim , is bewildering . Presumably it would still be tolerated , and allowed a role of some kind somehow , whether it were degraded , forgotten , or renamed . In any case , a metaphysics of natural complexes requires a quite different keynote . According to Randall , " Reality " means either everything whatsoever ? as we are here taking it ? or else that a distinction of relative importance has been made . In any other than an evaluative sense , to say that only the Good is " real , " only Matter is " real , " only Mind is " real , " only Energy is " real , " is to express a prejudice refuted by a child 's first thought or by every smallest grain of sand . No , everything encountered in any way is somehow real . The significant question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but how and in what sense it is real , and how it is related to and functions among other reals . To take " the real " as in fundamental contrast to what appears to us , is to identify it with " the Good . " . . . Such identification seems to have resulted invariably in confusions and insoluble contradictions. ? Now along with the notion of a complex as " unreal " we must discard the notion of some complexes as " less " and other complexes as " more " real . Let us contrast a principle of ontological priority ? which has flourished // from Parmenides to Whitehead and Heidegger , and which continues to flourish in unsuspected ways ? with a principle of ontological parity . In terms of the latter , whatever is discriminated in any way ( whether it is " encountered " or produced or otherwise related to ) is a natural complex , and no complex is more " real , " more " natural , " more " genuine , " or more " ultimate " than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-range rhetorical one , for a distinction between the real and the " really real , " between being and " true being . " Among the favorite perennial candidates for the honor of " being " more truly or more completely than anything else is " primary substance " or " primary being . " It has been the standing historical comfort of " tough-minded " philosophers , preserving their confidence in the solid concreteness of the spatio-temporal individual . No discriminanda can be consigned to " non-being , " on pain of contradiction ; for they have the being that enables them to be discriminated . This being may consist in the being of a picture in a book ; of an image or a fantasy ; of a plan private to one man or common to many men ; of a verbal expression ; of a pain , a dream , a habit , a fear , an error , a tradition , a bond among persons . Some discriminanda strike us as deserving no further attention ; others , as requiring clarification , action , or portrayal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , even though people can not ascertain that it has . Sometimes there is common agreement that a word or chain of words has not succeeded in achieving a discrimination other than the pattern of its own verbal being . Some philosophers think that // action , in contrast to thought , does not function to discriminate . But when there is a discriminandum , of whatever kind or status , its being has neither more nor less of being than the being of any other.l ? The principle of ontological parity scarcely implies that there are no differences among natural complexes . On the contrary , it presupposes that no two complexes , in whatever order and however discriminated , are similar in all respects . Their discriminability forces us to preserve their integrity , or better , to acknowledge it . Natural complexes , moreover , differ in both kind and scope . Difference is so basic that every distinction good and bad , every opinion shallow or deep , every fiction , hallucination , or deception , every product social or individual , is recognized as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , they are preserved . What is abolished is any inference , from A 's being less courageous than B or more skillful than B , that something is more or less real , of greater or lesser being , than something else . Little courage is not a lesser reality than great courage . The preservation of degree actually requires the principle of parity . Just as the principle does not warrant the attribution of higher reality to that which exemplifies a trait in higher degree , so it does not justify the attribution of lesser reality or unreality to that which exemplifies a trait in lower degree . No distinction , then , is dismissed . It only awaits its analysis ? the interpretation of " how and in what sense it is real . " All complexes are equally " authentic " as complexes , distressing as this may be to certain points of view whose metaphysical orientation actually damRUDIMENTARY // ages an ethical purpose which it is believed to support . The natural parity of all complexes , their ontological integrity , is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principle of parity obliges us to receive and accept all discriminanda . The conception of ontological priority , on the other hand , makes all ascertainable differences suspect , and instead of interpreting their relative character and ordinal location , always stands ready to efface them . There are many possible ways of trying to justify the principle of ontological priority . It is a principle which seems to reflect a deep , standing need , and it lends itself to gratuitous affirmation and reaffirmation regardless of argument . We shall try to formulate a number of grounds for it , all different , and to show the untenable consequences which they entail . More important , perhaps , will be the concomitant opportunity to develop , by contrast , additional properties and distinctions in the theory of natural complexes . 1 . Complex B , it might be held , is " more real " than complex A when A is dependent upon B but B is not dependent upon A. The forms of " dependency " are of course various . We may assume that causal dependency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by another which is its necessary and sufficient condition , is as persuasive as any other form . Causes , then , must be more real than their effects . Now since B , as cause of A , is itself the effect of a cause , and this in turn the effect of a prior cause . . . and since A , as effect of B , is also cause of a further effect . . . there seems to be only one major conclusion consistent with the initial supposition : that remoter causes are // more real than proximate causes . Each complex is more real than its posterity but less real than its ancestry . And from this it follows that the universe of actualities , to speak of no other , is becoming less and less real . The ensuing eschatology is grotesque . All the reality lost would have to be restored by an ontological resurrection if the Last Judgment were to be dramatically potent . Even an interpretation that would construe greater reality to mean greater goodness would fail dismally by this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of men than the truth that an effect may be more admirable , more salutary , more encouraging morally than its cause ; or the truth that human products are often much more important to mankind than their producers are . 2 . Complex B , it might be held , is " more real " than complex A when A is merely a component of B , for B may contain not only A but other components . But as in the preceding position , an innocent-sounding assumption leads to stultifying results . If A is a component of B , and B a component of a still larger whole C , then B in turn is less real than C ; and so on " upwards " ( or " outwards " ) , so that only a universe or grand totality is truly real , while its most " minute " components or elements are least real . One ironic consequence is that what is putatively " indivisible " or " simple " emerges here as least real , instead of being an " ultimate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and components but in terms of wholes and parts , it is equally weak . All components would seem to be parts , but not all parts components . A man who is part of a religious movement is not a component of // the movement in the sense that a wall or a joist is a component of a house . In one respect , a man is part of a corporation ; in another , the corporation is part of his life . In neither of these or various other senses of " part " is the part a component . If , without qualification , wholes are said to be more real than parts , the corporation must be more real than the man who is part of it ; and at the same time the corporation must be less real than the life of the man who is part of that corporation . ( It will be recalled that the generic term embracing " parts " and " components , " as well as any other sub-complexes , is " constituents . " ) 3 . Complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real " than complex A when the scope of B is greater or wider or more far-reaching than the scope of A. It is necessary to examine the idea of scope , with the purpose of showing that there are well-grounded distinctions in the scope of natural complexes , but that these distinctions actually render " degree of reality " an unsatisfactory and dispensable concept . ( a ) B is greater in scope than A if it is more comprehensive or more generic than A. One complex is more comprehensive than another if it is not always a manifestation of the other but the other is always a manifestation of it . Juvenile crime is , let us say , a manifestation of the more comprehensive condition of social confusion and violence . Here the less comprehensive complex would also typically be called a " part " of the more comprehensive one . Being a sister is a manifestation of being a sibling : being a sibling is more comprehensive than being a sister . But in this case it is the more comprehensive complex that would most typi36 RUDIMENTARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less comprehensive : being a sibling is part of what being a sister is or means . In each of the two examples it is possible , if less typical , to see the " part " in reverse . There is a sense in which social confusion is " part " of a juvenile crime ; and there is a sense in which being a sister is " part " of what it can mean to be a sibling . The contrasting senses correspond to two of the senses which Aristotle enumerates for " in " : the species , in one sense , is in the genus ; the genus , in another sense , is in the species . If we consider once more the case of being a sibling as more comprehensive than and yet part of being a sister , we observe that the generic trait is part of a specific trait but not part of a " whole " in any obvious respect . To show it as part of a whole , we should have to frame and discriminate a natural complex that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generic trait is part of the " whole structure of traits " which constitutes the specific trait . ( b ) B is greater in scope than A if it is more pervasive than A. One complex is more pervasive than another if it is recurrent under more various conditions , or more widespread in its presence , or more extensive in its influence , or more diverse in its ramifications , than the other . A nation is a more pervasive complex than a stone in a cave , an ocean more pervasive than a swamp in a field . Being more comprehensive entails being more pervasive , at least in some respects . The class of physical bodies , which is more comprehensive than the class of sentient bodies , is also more pervasive in the spatial distribution of its members . ( It is less pervasive , for instance , in the communiRUDIMENTARY // cative powers of its members . ) Being a sibling , which is more generic or comprehensive than being a sister , is also more pervasive because its occurrence is more frequent and widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converse is not true . Nations are more pervasive than stones in caves , but neither more nor less comprehensive . To the extent that these are unrelated complexes , their comparative comprehensiveness might appear to be decidable not in terms of either as comprehended or embraced by the other but in terms of their respective divisibility , as kinds or types , into less comprehensive complexes . By this standard , however , there can be as many species of stones lying in caves as there are species of nations . The sense of overwhelmingly different magnitude that arises in a comparison of this kind , the sense that one of the two complexes " includes " far more than the other , boils down to a sense of relative pervasiveness . Although relative pervasiveness is often difficult to ascertain , this is a question of degree . In gross terms , if two complexes were selected at random , it probably would make sense to say that one was more pervasive than the other . In the matter of comprehensiveness , on the other hand , there is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected complexes , making the question of their relative comprehensiveness impossible to answer . To vary the illustrations : in human affairs wastefulness may be more pervasive than planning , dullness more pervasive than imaginativeness . Even where two complexes , one of which is more pervasive than the other , are causally related , neither is necessarily more // comprehensive than the other . Thus misunderstanding is a cause of divorce ; it is a more pervasive human complex than divorce , but not necessarily more comprehensive , for divorce is not always a manifestation of misunderstanding . Does the problem of incommensurability cast doubt upon the metaphysical goal of seeking to discriminate generic complexes that have the widest possible scope ? No ; the complexes sought by philosophy are deliberately selected for their commensurateness and applicability . Their comprehensiveness must be exhibited as a relation that they bear to numerous and diverse other complexes . Thus comprehensiveness and pervasiveness are two forms of scope in natural complexes . There is no reason to believe that the kind of difference each represents gives any comfort to the doctrine of ontological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors in its contour or province . Lesser scope does not diminish the " naturalness " of a complex , nor does greater scope increase it . Nor is there any ethical significance in the idea of scope as such . Only when the ethical significance of a complex has already been established can greater or lesser scope be ethically relevant . One impulse which motivates the doctrine of priority expresses itself in the concern that gradations in nature should be recognized . Herein lurks the deceptiveness of the doctrine . For to " recognize " gradation by seeing one extreme of a scale as the realm of the ultimately real , and the other extreme as the realm of the unreal or least real , is in effect to drive attention // away from one of the extremes . For what is unreal is either impossible of query or unworthy of it . Consider the fatuity of a newly identified , newly located " unreality . " Query , by its products , multiplies the complexes of nature . Can there be a more ludicrous idea than invention through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , its pervasiveness and comprehensiveness , may also be regarded as its " inclusiveness . " The latter notion has an unmistakable value , despite its somewhat indefinite character . There is much advantage to thinking of any natural complex as " including " traits or sub-complexes , or of an order of complexes as including complexes that are discriminable also in another order . Something like " inclusiveness " is pertinent to the understanding of what is meant by a natural complex . Every complex is inclusive , regardless of the way in which it is inclusive . Stated in the manner that has here been formalized , every complex has scope , no matter what the degree of its pervasiveness or the mode of its comprehensiveness. 4 . Complex B , it might be held , is " more real " than complex A when B is more " determinate " than A. It is easy to see , at the very outset , that if the notion of determinateness varies , contrary conceptions can be made equally plausible . For example , where the " determinate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more real than facts . Where the " determinate " suggests the concrete and the particular , forms are held to be less real than facts . In a discussion of determinateness , the notions of actuality and possibility are inevitable . Most people // accept the twinship or correlation of the two in the sense that if one talks of actuality one must talk of possibility and vice versa . Nevertheless , philosophers are less worried about actuality than about possibility . After all , they feel , actuality is ? well , actuality ; but just what is possibility ? It does not occur to them that the familiar presence of actual " things " does not clarify the concept of actuality . They are content with the plain man 's impression that the actual is near and accessible , the possible remote and insubstantial . No matter how primitive their metaphysics of actuality , philosophers seldom hesitate to talk of possibility as if it were illegitimately claiming to rival actuality in rank . They warn against the danger of ascribing to possibility the same status as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the " kind of thing " possibilities are , and about where possibilities could be , violate the warning in the most serious way . Philosophers are wary of what some of them have called " possible entities . " It is worth observing that we can hardly do without speaking of possibilities , but can very easily do without speaking of " entities . " This term tends to obstruct , not only an adequate approach to the conception of possibility , but an adequate approach to the conception of actuality . The relevant considerations at the moment , then , are that the difficulties in the understanding of possibility do not justify abstention from thought about the relation between the possible and the actual ; that the question , What is the nature of possibility ? does not interfere with the recognition of possibilities and their significance ; and // that the question , What is the nature of actuality ? is not less difficult than the preceding question . Let us state five conceptions of " the determinate " : I. That which is stable or constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . That which is not merely active but individual , or individually active . IV . That which is " complete . " V. That upon which other complexes are more " dependent " than it is upon them . And let us consider each of these separately . I. This view of the determinate can serve as the basis of a contention ? altogether opposed to the dominant one , according to which " determinate " at the very least means " actual " ? that possibilities are more determinate than actualities . Thus : Some actualities are more stable or constant than others , but no actuality is as stable as a possibility can be . Actualities are subject to modification . Possibilities , on the contrary , are not ; they remain intact , whether they are exemplified or not . But in response to this contention : possibilities are mortal and modifiable , even as actualities are . The possibility of all Americans being literate by 196o has ceased to obtain . Possibilities can be modified in their relation to actualities . In order to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be perfectly exempt from any kind of modification , a possibility would have to be totally unrelated , insulated from all actualities and all other possibilities . This means that it could not be located in any order whatever , and // therefore could not have been discriminated as that possibility . Are all actualities " subject to modification " ? When the latter phrase is used and it is contended that they are , there is surely a certain model of actuality that is presupposed and that governs the answer . The question will have to be dealt with later in a number of contexts , along with the question whether any possibility is not " subject to modification . " Answers will emerge , but not without the aid of additional categories . IT . This view can serve as the basis for a contention that actualities are more determinate than possibilities . For are not actualities agential and efficacious , and are not possibilities inert and non-efficacious ? But against this contention it can be argued that our ordinary notion of agency and efficacy is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with one conspicuous type of actuality . If a possibility merely as such can not be said to yield a " result , " neither can an actuality merely as such . Every actuality has limits . These represent " its " possibilities ; in familiar cases they are sometimes called " powers " or " potentialities . " Any " result " involves both an antecedent actuality and the possibilities resident in that actuality . III . This view implies that , among actualities , individuals are " most fully " determinate . Since " societies , " for instance , are constituted by individuals , and not the other way round , individuals are the " ultimate " agents . But although societies can not attain results that inRUDIMENTARY // dividuals can , they can attain results , and results that individuals can not . Basically this is a commonplace of everyday belief , but it is also more than defensible metaphysically . For we can not entertain the notion of a society , or even of a mere grouping , without taking seriously the relations that obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor can we recognize any complex as a society without recognizing the difference between an organization of individuals and an abstract number of individuals . A social complex is differently agential but not less truly agential than an individual . And are societies constituted by individuals but not the other way round ? If " constituted by " meant " composed of , " the answer might be , yes . But to be a " constituent , " as we have seen , does not necessarily mean to be a " component . " What it means , more generally , is to be a trait that is relevant . The society of which an individual is member may enter into the complex that constitutes an individual , just as an individual may enter into the complex that constitutes a society . Indeed , so far as an individual at random is concerned , a society may be relevant to its integrity in a far more fundamental way than that individual is to the integrity of the society . In the consideration of this point we have proceeded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurrently identifiable groups ) of individuals . If relations and structures , for example , may be regarded as actual , then the question whether individuals are the " most " determinate actualities is even farther from resolution ? or even more artificial and // ill-founded than we are thus far in a position to indicate . IV . This view can lend itself ( a ) to a claim that possibilities are more determinate than actualities , since they are " complete " just as they are , without actualization , whereas actualities " become " complete and may cease to be complete ; ( b ) to a claim that actualities are more determinate than possibilities , since they are the " fulfillments " of possibilities , which as such are " unfulfilled " and hence incomplete ; ( c ) to a claim that societies are more determinate than individuals , having the completeness of a whole which transcends any part ; ( d ) to a claim that individuals are more determinate than societies , having the completeness that consists in indivisibility , as contrasted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , " ( a ) ? ( d ) , is a mixture of plausibility and speciousness . Each is of very limited significance . It seems far more significant to note that whatever is discriminable as a complex is fully as much a complex as any other ; that any complex , whether possibility or actuality , is " complete " in so far as it inherently has an integrity . Nevertheless , it is desirable to continue the dialectic of comment on each of the conflicting claims , the further to prepare for theoretical reorientation . ( a ) What it means for an actuality to " become complete " or cease to be complete is itself a nice question , and so is the allied question , at just what point an actuality may justifiably be deemed complete . ( b ) Every possibility is of course subject to actualization , but actualization does not complete it as a possibility . As a posRUDIMENTARY // sibility , it is complete whether it is actualized or not . If , moreover , an actuality is the " fulfillment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an actuality is itself " fulfilled " or complete . ( c ) Why should a whole be more complete than a part ? It is complete as a whole , and the part is complete as a part . There is undoubtedly an everyday sense in which , by a quantitative criterion , completeness is achieved when a vessel is filled or when pieces are assembled into a whole . But in these instances , the presence of a project waiting to be completed does not prove the point . For another project may be completed only when a vessel is emptied or when a whole is dismembered and separated into pieces . ( d ) There is no reason for that which is ( allegedly ) indivisible to be considered more complete than that which is divisible . The integrity of neither is a model for the integrity of the other . Neither relates to the other on a scale of degrees . And if a scale were constructed , it could be constructed to show the relative completeness and incompleteness of either . V. This view can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less dependent upon actualities than actualities upon them . For possibilities are what they are whether actualized or not , whereas actualities are what they are in virtue of the possibilities that there are . ( b ) Actualities are less dependent upon possibilities than possibilities upon them . For actualities are dependent upon other actualities : merely because they exemplify possibilities does not mean that they are products or effects of possibilities . ( c ) Societies are less dependent upon individuals than individuals upon // them . For a society endures though each individual in it eventually perishes , whereas individuals never exist in isolation . A society is dependent only upon some present collectivity of individuals ? but not on any given individual , not on any specific number of individuals , and not on the same collectivity. ( d ) Individuals are less dependent upon societies than societies upon them . For individuals are irreducible and societies are not . The same individual can be in either or both of two societies . All the foregoing claims in V , ( a ) ? ( d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dependencies " are co-dependencies. ( a ) It is true that specific possibilities do not require , for their being , actualization or eventual actualities : but in one or another sense they do presuppose correlative actualities , which precede them or are their contemporaries . Possibilities are " for " and " of " actualities . They are ( to speak roughly until we come to Chapter IV ) " conditions " for actualities and " natural definitions " of the boundaries or limits of actualities ? however familiar or however bizarre these boundaries might appear to be . ( b ) Actualities are always actualizations of possibilities . If there were an exception to this , it would have to be an actuality which arose or prevailed regardless of any or all possibilities ? whatever that might mean . An actuality is not the product merely of possibilities ; but neither is it the product merely of actualities as such and unqualifiedly . It is a product of those actualities which provide the conditions or possibilities for it ? that is , which make it possible , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to produce it . ( c ) A society in which // individuals simply " participate " is presumably like a box which continues in its identity though continually filled with new individual articles , or like a ship indifferent to the personnel of crew and passengers . But even a box can not contain any number or any kind of articles , nor can a ship have any number or any kind of personnel if it is to be a ship . A society is more than a multiplicity of individuals , but not more than an order of individuals . The nature and continuation of the order is dependent at all times upon the traits of individuals and upon the relations among individuals which arise and which expire . ( d ) Individuals are inherently social or associational ; no individual is without some mode of relation to other individuals . For as a natural complex it bears traits imposed by nature upon all complexes . It is related to those complexes which are conditions for its integrity , and in turn it has a sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical relatedness to other complexes . Finally , each individual , as a natural complex , is an order of traits . It is a society of subaltern complexes . It is no more and no less " irreducible " than any other complex . Thus " dependence " is meaningful in various ways . But lesser dependence as a criterion of greater determinateness is reminiscent of the untenable versions of " substance " ( if indeed the notion permits any tenable versions at all ) ? substance as less dependent than anything else : as the bearer of traits that is itself unanalyzable into traits , as the subject of predications that is itself not predicable of anything , as that which " is in itself " and is not in anything else . // The monstrous commitment facing such views is a notion of the fully determinate as that which is independent of traits . But philosophers never have been deterred from seeking a blend of the notion of determinateness with the notions of independence and completeness . Accordingly , that which is " in itself " is metamorphosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is independent of traits to that which is the bearer of all traits and is therefore alone " truly " in itself . But other philosophers have been unwilling to veer to this extreme and to identify the fully determinate with one basic order of traits , fearing that the notion of individuality is thereby eliminated . They have preferred to retain but to reinterpret the conception of a plurality of entities ( " substances " ) each of which is complete . Completeness is thus held to belong not to the " ultimacy " of a universal order but to the " ultimacy " of its parts ? to genuine " atoms " of reality . The completeness of each of these atoms or individuals lies , however , not in its " independence " but in its being uniquely " a system of all things " ( for example , Leibniz and Whitehead ) . Traitlessness is banished . Completeness is reconciled with finitude . An individual or atom , though finite , is fully determinate , because unique relatedness to everything else is basic to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " actual entities " ) are " the final real things of which the world is made up . There is no going behind actual entities to find anything more real . " These " final realities " are also described as " devoid of all indetermination , " as " complete " ( or " completely real " ) , and as // " devoid of all indecision . " They are not individual in a mere loose or rhetorical sense . Unlike what one might wish to identify , for instance , as an individual culture or nation , they have " absolute individuality . " And as such , they have " an absolute reality . " Actual entities are construed as " activities " and " processes . " In so far as they are " grouped " into one or another kind of " nexus " or order , such as a " society , " they compose a reality which alone has the property of " enduring . " Societies , however , must not be confused with these " completely real things " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes are themselves " composite " and " analyzable , " and in " an indefinite number of ways . " They have their own " component elements , " of as many kinds as there are modes of analysis . Nevertheless , to these component elements " complete actuality " does not belong ; they are " subordinate elements " only.11 It turns out , then , in Whitehead , that ( I ) the atomic actualities always have component elements ; and that ( 2 ) the atomic actualities are always components in an order or nexus of actualities . Yet somehow the former kind of components , considered as realities , are less real , less " ultimate , " than the latter kind of components . An atomic actuality is more real than its components , but an order of such actualities is less real than its components . Both that which goes to constitute an atom and that which an atom goes to constitute are less real than the atom . All this , curiously , in spite of the fact that the atoms are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in spite of the fact that these // atoms are as inconceivable apart from an order as an order is apart from them . It turns out , also , that ( , ) the atoms or " final realities " are actualities ; so that actualities are more real than possibilities . This in spite of the fact that the atomic actualities do not endure but only become and perish , while " pure " possibilities ( " eternal objects " ) neither become nor perish ; and in spite of the fact that actualities are dependent , for their being , upon possibilities getting realized in them , while these pure possibilities are not dependent , for their being , upon any actualities ? they are " the same for all actual entities . " It turns out , finally , that ( 4 ) possibility is " deficiently actual . " Why this makes it less than " really real " is a puzzle ; for by the same token , actuality should be " deficiently possible " or " deficiently eternal . " Just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it is essentially contrasted , or to which it is essentially correlated , is problematical , to say the least . Is a male " deficiently female " and a female " deficiently male " ? Is a society " deficiently individual " ? If so , should an individual not be considered " deficiently social " ? An atomic theory of " ultimate actualities " is a type of metaphysical theory stressing the crucial role of " components . " To be sure , Whitehead 's components , as " processes , " are a far cry from the tendency to think of building blocks as the model type of component . But not all natural complexes can be interpreted in terms of components , and especially not in terms of a single type . Whitehead conceives of his " ultimate actualities " as processes containing a phase in which they // achieve " full determinateness . " The view of determinateness that is implied is an unnecessarily restricted one . There is certainly a sense in which each phase of a process is no less determinate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ontological atoms , like their more familiar namesakes , can be relatively final in a functional capacity ; that is , as explanatory or exhibitive devices accomplishing an envisaged aim in a particular perspective . That atoms of actuality should be unqualifiedly construed as the " really real things " proves only that there is an aesthetic or methodological bias , or an underlying predisposition of common sense , the absolutist cravings of which are appeased by the notion of actuality and not by the notion of possibility . No natural complex can be a metaphysical atom , unless we wish to hold that whatever is discriminable is " atomic " in some respect , whether it is actual or possible , individual or social . Perhaps each is " atomic " in the sense that there is an order to the nature of which it contributes . Its own integrity is dependent on this order , within which it is located . But at bottom , metaphysical atomism does not belong and can not survive in a theory of natural complexes . The required stretching of the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lend it whatever value it should have , serves no purpose . Since every complex includes and is included in a complex , all atoms would have to include and be included in atoms . All complexes would have equal claim ; and if all complexes are atoms , none is . II PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE i EVERY NATURAL complex prevails . Does this appear to be a strangely incomplete statement ? Explanations , of course , have to be made ; implications have to be drawn . But the framework thus far provided should exclude certain interpretations at the outset ; for example , that according to this statement , every complex must be recognized to " exist . " The concept of natural complex , as a metaphysical category of unlimited applicability , can not be significantly interpreted by a concept applicable only to some of its instances . It makes sense to say that whatever exists is an actuality . But there are actualities which , on the basis of considerations that will emerge , we might not wish to call " existences . " And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possibilities prevail as well as actualities . Are we saying , then , that to prevail is to " be " ? We are not saying this , although we are assuming it perforce : a natural complex which has no being is a self-contradictory idea . In the present conceptual structure , a being which is not a natural complex is also a self-contradictory idea . To say that a natural complex has being is discursively unavoidable . But it is not very enlightening . To begin with , a complex prevails in the sense that // it might not have been " provided " by nature , might not have been " constituted , " but has been . The complex " obtains . " This minimal sense could well justify calling every complex an " obtenance . " The principle of ontological parity could be stated in positive terms , and without dependence upon the conceptual associates of " reality , " to the effect that all discriminanda are obtenances , regardless of what else they are in comparison with one another . For certain purposes of emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . To say that every complex obtains underscores the idea that anything identified , whether as framed or as found , has an inviolability merely as such . But beyond this , in saying ( more strongly ) that every complex prevails we are implying that it is ineluctable ; that it has a sphere of primacy and domination ; that it is restrictive and exclusive of other complexes . Is there a sphere , then , in which each complex is not primary and dominant ? And if a complex is exclusive of other complexes , does this mean that it may not also be receptive of other complexes or traits ? It will soon be clear that although every complex must be said to prevail , prevalence is not the only basic dimension . Every complex is prevalent in a certain respect , in a certain way . This is true of the complex merely as a complex : it prevails as against some other complex that might have prevailed instead or in its stead . And this is true also of the complex considered as possessing traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another subaltern respect , any of its traits prevailing as against other traits which might have pre54 PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE vailed instead . The expression " might have , " which is here required grammatically , should not lead back insensibly to the thought that only what is actual " prevails , " as against what is possible . On the contrary , a possibility equally prevails , either as against any other possibility that might have prevailed instead , or as against the kind of world that would not have provided it or anything like it . The very concept of prevalence is introduced partly in order to permit recognition of possibility with categorial adequacy . ii Consider a complex commonly identified as a process ; for example , the ebb and flow of the tides . The prevalence of this complex takes the form of a continuing occurrence , a recurrence . When we say that in a given order this process and not another prevails , we are identifying a specific kind of occurrence . But we can also say that , in a more inclusive order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of process . It prevails , not as against another kind of process , but as against another kind of natural complex , as against the absence of process , the absence of traits such as continuation and recurrence . Or consider a complex that is described as a structure , whether it be the structure of a bridge , of an inference , or of a poem . Here the prevalence lies in a kind of invariance . This is what prevails as against some other kind of invariance or some other kind of constancy . But again , the structure also prevails as against a complex in which the structural factor is of secondary moment . In the complex known as a history , // the history of a man or of a people , the prevalence takes the form of an endurance amidst vicissitudes ? of a limited span , a continuing identity , with spatial as well as temporal traits . In the complex known as a fact , the prevalence takes the form of a terminated and irreversible occurrence . A law prevails when complexes within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however sporadic or regular these conditions may be . A complex can be said not to prevail with respect to an order in which it is not located . For by the same token , what is located in that order prevails over what is not . Thus if every complex is prevalent in a certain respect , it is also not prevalent in a certain respect ; and in terms of the innumerable orders to which it does not belong , it is not prevalent in innumerable respects . But of basic importance is the consideration that even in an order to which a complex does belong it can be said not to be prevalent . Although as a complex it must always prevail in some order ( in some " respect " ) , it may not prevail in every order to which it belongs . A complex may cease to be prevalent in all respects ( " cease to be " ) . Or it may cease to be prevalent in a particular respect in which it was prevalent ? that is , by coming to prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It prevails in so far as it excludes other complexes , but what it may also exclude is a former integrity of its own . Now when a complex located in a given order is not prevalent in that order or ceases to be prevalent in that order , we shall say that it is alescent , or an alescence . Alescent and alescence are derived ( or subtracted ) // from " coalescence , " a coming together of complexes . The terms are suggested by the Latin alescere , to grow up , here converted to the sense of arising or ( somewhat less generally ) coming about or taking place . These approximations to " alescence , " however , are rough , especially when separated from another group of approximations . For alescence also signifies deviation or variation . It is that dimension of nature in which the specific integrities of complexes initially are what they are and how they are , whether in time , within an organization of traits , or within an order of encounter . It suggests origination or nascence or incipience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oddity , or of deterioration ; the incipience of ordinal relocation or of difference within an order . Variation is difference in so far as it is initial . We shall be as much concerned to show what alescence is not as to show what it is . Particularly unsuitable as an equivalent , for instance , is " becoming , " which carries unacceptable implications both of a moral and a metaphysical kind ; or " change , " which ( to mention only one difficulty ) is not applicable to certain types of complex that can be alescent . A complex is prevalent in so far as it excludes traits from its contour . A complex is alescent in so far as it admits traits into its contour . The same complex can be prevalent in one order , alescent in another . We shall say that in so far as it is alescent , it is not prevalent ; in so far as it is prevalent , it is not alescent . An order implies relations among complexes . A given complex possesses its status in virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different status in virtue of a different sphere of relations , a different ordinal location . A complex which ceases to prevail can not , in one sense , be said to " admit traits into its contour . " Its ceasing means that a contour of integrities ceases . But the ceasing , located as it is within a more inclusive complex or order , may mean that the latter complex is alescent ? that it is admitting traits into its contour . A cloud is dissipated , a contract is broken , a threat disappears : traits are thereby introduced into the contour of an individual cloud mass , a social relation , a pattern of possibilities . But even the complex which ceases to be is admitting traits as it is ceasing to be ? admitting traits of dissolution or destruction . Both this complex and the more inclusive complex , then , are alescent , each in its way . Four forms of alescence may be distinguished , though they may be intermingled . In augmentative alescence a prevailing complex is extended , increased , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expiration or extinction of a complex that has prevailed . In the third form , coalescence , a complex arises from a junction or intersection or novel configuration of complexes : there is variation in the world without deviation from any prevalent complex in particular , and without any particular complex having to be augmented or despoiled . The fourth form , vagrant alescence , involves that which has a " chance " or " dangling " character . In the midst of a given prevalence , there may be alescence . ( Conversely , where there is alescence , it is // always in the midst of some prevalence . ) Thus in the process of the tides , each wave that is idiosyncratic ? that deviates from the typical pattern of all the waves ? is an alescent complex . In the functioning of a machine , fluctuating quality of operation , from inefficiency and roughness to efficiency and smoothness , and back again , from uniformity to imperfection , is an alescent complex , or multitude of alescences within the more inclusive complex that prevails . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prevalence or continuing order seems to require numerous alescent stresses , from minor conflicts and ostensible discontinuities to crises and portents . Like all prevalences , a history embraces subaltern prevalences . It embraces subaltern alescences , of the kind just mentioned . The language of a people is a prevalence within which there are phonetic and semantic alescences , complexes of differing scope . But the same language as present within another order , as a historical and geographical complex , is a gradual , prolonged alescence in the history of the people . A mountain range is a prevalence that once emerged as an alescence of the earth 's surface and that now has its own subaltern alescences such as eroding areas , unexpected vegetation , agricultural improvement , and agricultural abuse . Can we " step twice into the same river " ? We can step into the same river any number of times , if we stay alive and the river remains accessible to us . The notion that movement and variation destroy or becloud the integrity of complexes , or that ceaseless flow somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex with some of its alescent traits . // The water of the river moves , and it is n't necessary to contest the idea that in a given area at two times the water is different . But the waters are the same waters , the prevailing waters . As an inclusive prevalence , the river is not just water . The spatial dimensions of the river bed comprise a constancy , a subaltern prevalence , in which the indubitable minute variations are negligible . So far as the act of stepping is concerned , even large variations would be negligible , or better , irrelevant . A step on dry land would not resemble a previous step in all respects any more than a step into flowing water would . Stepping , then , is also interpretable as a prevalence . The integrity of the complex is not affected by alescent occurrences within certain limits , though the integrity of some of its subaltern complexes must be . In the midst of an alescence there is always a prevalence . Each of the constituents of an alescent complex prevails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own primacy : there is something which it excludes or precedes or supersedes . The alescence in which these constituents are subaltern is shaped , or continues to be shaped , just the same . For an alescent complex can be regarded as embracing but not as reducible to prevalent constituents . In so far as an alescence can be said to be " complete " ? in so far as any complex can be said to be " complete " ? it can be regarded as a prevalence in some order . A spatio-temporal complex , say an " event " ( an occurrence in so far as it is unique ) , may be concomitantly prevalent and alescent in its beginning . In so far as it is incipient , it is an alescence within a more in6o PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE clusive complex . But in so far as it has already begun , to however minimal an extent , it is definitive occurrence ? that which has the prevalent irreversibility of fact . Thenceforth , within the event , the concomitance may persist . The way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the incipient within the more widely established . What is true of events , however , is not true of recurrences . The " beginning " of each instance of a recurrence , in the sense of the typical first stage or phase , is not an alescence but a subaltern prevalence . May every prevalent complex have alescent constituents ? ( a ) Some prevalences may have alescent constituents which do not affect the integrity of the complex . ( b ) Some may have alescent constituents which do affect the integrity of the complex . ( c ) Some seem not to have constituents which are in any sense alescent . To illustrate . ( a ) The physical laws of the solar system prevail , and the system prevails as a system , despite the occurrence of unprecedented events within the system . ( b ) In a vastly larger order of time , which includes the order within which the solar system and its laws prevail , this system may itself be an odd or eccentric event , a vagrant alescence . Or the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutionary order within which the solar system and its laws arise as a conjunction of circumstances , achieve a stable pattern and constitute a prevalence , and then cease to prevail . The sequence within the order would be : a coalescence , an augmentative alescence , a prevalence , a spoliative alescence. ( c ) In the order of reasoning , the law of non-contradiction is a prevalent principle with // no constituents that would seem to justify description as alescent . Besides the question just asked ( " May every prevalent complex have alescent constituents ? " ) two others impose themselves . First : Is every complex that is prevalent in one order alescent in some other order ? And as part of the question we are prompted to ask whether the principle of non-contradiction is an exception in this respect too . It seems justifiable to answer that every prevalence can be an alescence in some order ; that even a law of logic can acquire quite another integrity , say in an order of speculation , or in some other order of query such as literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume all kinds of functions and relations , and be seen in various roles . Its function as an inviolable governing principle of ratiocination may become irrelevant , even though the integrity of that function in a ratiocinative order is not subject to spoliative alescence in the way that a physical law is . But there seems to be no ground for saying that every complex prevalent in one order is alescent in some other order . Second : Is every complex that is alescent in one order prevalent in another ? The answer to this question is easier and has already been given . For to the extent that every complex is irrefragably a complex , in its dimension of exclusion and identity and distinguishability , it prevails . In so far as a complex is alescent , it can not be prevalent , but there must always be another respect in which it is prevalent . None of these considerations affects the distinction or the weight of the distinction between the two dimensions // of nature , nor does it make either of them more important than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of alescence must be morally neutral as well as genuinely applicable to a great range of manifestations . What about birth and death , which are sharp , vivid categories ? But if we are inclined to think of every alescence as either a birth or a death , we should be prepared to think of what follows a birth and precedes a death , namely a " life , " and this , for a number of reasons , is metaphysically precarious . Despite all their descriptive and analogical advantages , the ideas of birth and death have implications which are hard to dispel and which would destroy their general applicability if not dispelled . ( a ) Birth and death suggest a " natural history , " a typical history . But the beginning and ending of a natural history , in so far as they may be regarded as alescent at all , are scarcely the only kind of alescence. ( b ) Birth and death suggest " subjects " which are born and which die ; and ( c ) they possibly suggest , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not typically involve " subjects " at all , while augmentative and spoliative alescence may characterize complexes which are not interpretable in terms of individual identity and which are best not interpreted as endurances . A clear type of alescence is variation of instances from the norm within a prevalence such as a physical law , which certainly can not be said to endure in the sense that a man or a rock endures . Birth and death , then , are not adePREVALENCE // quate to explain alescence . They can only be regarded as themselves circumstantial manifestations of alescence . They can also be seen , in a more pervasive order , as prevalences , prevalences which take the form of awesome regularities . Alescence is represented by variation , but it is neither solely nor necessarily the basis of variety . It is represented by deviation , but it is neither solely nor necessarily the basis of uniqueness . Among the prevalences of nature there is inexhaustible difference . The traits of any prevalence comprise a variety . Even if there were simples , since simples would differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enduring " thing " are various , as are the stages , periods , phases , functions , or relations within other prevalences . Alescence is indeed the condition for the advent , and therefore the extension or increase , of variety . But complexes may be alescent without introducing variety at all . They may , for example , only terminate a prevalence . A dying may be like any other dying , but in its circumstantial introduction of a complex , in its arising as an event , it is an alescence which brings to an end the prevalent order consisting in an individual history . Uniqueness , like variety , is not locatable in alescent complexes alone . It is part of the integrity of every complex . In the most fundamental sense , any complex is unique merely by virtue of its distinguishability from any other . But this sense is not trivial , because it can not be by an absolutely " single " trait that any complex is distinguished from the complex most similar to it . The " single " trait is always an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different traits in a complex " outnumbering " the similar or common traits that determines " more " or " less " uniqueness . In any case , although it is significant to say that alescence is what increases the variety in the world , it does not seem significant to say that alescence is what increases uniqueness in the world . What does increase , but also decrease , by alescence is the prominence of this or that uniqueness in the perspectives of men . We should also guard against the tendency to think of alescence as necessarily " particular . " A class of revolutionary ideas or of deviant happenings , a general trend of behavior , may be an alescence . Augmentative alescence is not mere quantitative increase , nor is spoliative alescence mere separation or diminution . A cancer , a spoliative alescence , is a quantitative increase which conceals a pervasive decline of functions . In the complexes of ethical experience and in human distinctions of worth , the forms of alescence may be deceptive . An augmentative alescence may consist in the emergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an expansion or a literal growth but of a situation promoted , made viable ? an evil relation disappearing , a cancer regressing , large bodies of incompetents reduced . On the other hand , a human corruption or decline , constituting a spoliative alescence , may take the form of an increase in burdensome detail , a growth of anxiety , a multiplication of codes and statutes . A coalescence is an arising that is not traceable to any " single " complex . It is not reducible to augmentation or spoliation , though it may eventuate in either // of these . It is an aspect of nature in which there is more " varying from " than " varying of . " When numerous occurrences , each in itself perhaps inconsequential , are joined and patterned , a complex arises which is alescent primarily in so far as it adds to the configurations of the world without directly augmenting or despoiling anything in particular . If there is deviation of any kind in a coalescence , it is collective deviation from complexes which retain their general character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade where others did and at the same time that others did , a center for an economic market arose . No distributive modification of economic practices directly took place , though inevitably , many augmentations and spoliations accrued . Like coalescence , though without junctions or parallelisms , vagrant alescence is a varying " from . " A meteorite falling in a certain path and landing in a certain place is a vagrant alescent complex . It is a variation from a diffused prevalence , but not a deviation from any prevalence in particular . Like coalescence , vagrant alescence may eventuate in other forms . When two opposing ice hockey players strike the puck simultaneously it becomes a " loose puck , " veering erratically between the two goals or toward one of them . In this status , unmodified by anything else , it is a vagrant alescence . If shortly afterward the puck is hit for a score , there is an augmentation of one side 's action and a spoliation of the other 's . The loose puck may be seen as located in either or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two complexes , one more inclusive than the other ) . It may be seen as part of an order which // contains it as a vagrant alescence and which is succeeded by another order containing an augmentative alescence ; or it may be seen as part of an inclusive continuing order which culminates , as it were , in an augmentation. iv Although every natural complex prevails in some respect , it is important to focus upon traits the comprehensiveness of which helps especially to clarify the concept of prevalence . We have indicated a number of these , such as continuation , recurrence , constancy , irreversibility , endurance . In a given prevalence there may be one or more . Whenever we think of a complex as a fact , or think of the factual aspect of a complex , the fundamental trait of the prevalence is irreversibility ; endurance and constancy are not present or not relevant . In a process , for instance digestion , there are recurrences , constancies which are not recurrences , and endurances ; there are also events , i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are recurrent sequences : some of the sequences recur in wider spans , or less frequently , than others . There is a constancy that takes the form of a structure , the digestive " system . " There are enduring organs , and these perform digestive functions . Fact is occurrence in its aspect of finality : what is completed in the form , either of an event or a series of instances within a recurrence , is not modifiable except in its continuing effects . By contrast , process and structure are not unmodifiable . Whether we say , of a process or a structure , that it has ceased to be and has // been succeeded by another , that it has been transformed into another , or that it is the same with different traits , is in part a matter of discriminative emphasis and in part a matter of linguistic or conceptual discretion . Is " a complex with successive stages that are similar " to be distinguished from " two successive complexes that are similar " ? The distinction depends upon what is discriminated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complexes discriminated are alike " realities . " Selectiveness and choice are among the realities of the world that play a role in both the charting and the determination of alescences . A structure is a prevalence that may or may not involve recurrence but that always involves constancy of some kind . Certain structures , for instance the structure of the fixed stars or the structure of an economy , may be said to endure ( whatever their duration may be ) . We speak of them as endurances because we think of them as having arisen . They are prevalences which are founded upon an alescence in the past . We often think of them as relatively distinguishable from that of which they are the structure . The fixed stars might have had a different structure , and so might the economy in question . The case seems otherwise with structures like the structure of a proof or the structure of a poem . It is of dubious meaning to say that the same proof or the same poem might have had another structure : they would then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accordingly , if in these cases we say that the structure " endures , " we must mean that it is the proof or poem which " endures . " But a // proof and a poem certainly do not endure in the same sense as a star or an economy . They do not have a " history " in the sense that a star and an economy do . They admit of spoliative alescence , but not in the same sense . And yet it can be said that all four of these complexes ? the star , the economy , the proof , the poem ? arose . The contrast between the two pairs does not reduce to the difference between a complex which is a deliberate product and one which is not . For by this criterion , a star and an economy differ from one another at least as sharply as an economy and a proof do . Moreover , a garden or a bed spread , which are human products in the least complicated sense , are , in respect of their structure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like the poem and the proof . For they are distinguishable from the structure that they " have , " they exhibit a historical type of endurance , and they admit of spoliative alescence in the particular sense of internal decay . Some prevalences have a temporal aspect , others do not . Consider the mode of prevalence we have called constancy . There are constancies , for instance , which consist of temporal sequences and cycles ( the seasons ) . But there are non-temporal constancies which are also sequential ( the series of integers ) and in which there are periodic recurrences ( odd numbers ) . The latter type of constancy , though non-temporal , is " applicable " to the discrimination and analysis of temporal complexes . This applicability is also true of non-temporal constancies which are not sequential ( logical principles ) . There are temporal constancies , namely histories , in which sequences may be less important than endurPREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE 6g ances . A temporal constancy , and in general any temporal prevalence , may be of long or short duration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex as any other history . The season for fasting is not less of a prevalence than the winter season . One reason why possibility has been considered so difficult to interpret by philosophers is its puzzling status in regard to the temporal aspect of actuality . A prevailing possibility may be either continuously present in a given order or recurrent in that order . Any possibility can be regarded as prior in time to its actualizations . This is true for what are sometimes called " remote " possibilities as well as " situational " possibilities . But possibilities also arise in the wake of actual occurrences . After the occurrences , we say that many other occurrences have " become possible " or " are now possible . " Possibilities thus may be justly described as earlier and later . They may come into being or expire . And they may be brought into being or destroyed . Thus they can be either alescent or prevalent . Suppose , for example , that one author plagiarizes another . He thereby brings some possibilities into being and destroys others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be apprehended as a plagiarist . This possibility is an alescence , in the form of a deviation from an order of possibilities and actualities which constitutes a scrupulous life of authorship . In the subsequent order of complexes , this possibility prevails . Its prevalence helps to clarify , retrospectively , its previous character as ( or within ) an alescence ? initially vagrant , then spoliative in an order of moral complexes . Considerations of this kind make it difficult to ac70 PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE cept , at least without further distinctions , the view that possibilities are " eternal . " But they do not guarantee that all kinds of possibilities are temporal in the same sense . We shall postpone the question of the " effects " of possibility . Possibilities may be temporal in the sense of being prior to , coeval with , or posterior to given actualities and other possibilities . They may be said to endure in the sense of prevailing by continuous presence in a given order . This endurance may be brief , related to evanescent conditions ; or it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities , like all complexes , are tied to other prevalences . Does alescence always have a temporal aspect ? Considered in its aspect as variation , it is a varying ? that is , more than a mere difference . For difference , as we have observed , is present among all natural complexes , prevalent or alescent . In a human order like query the temporal aspect of alescence might appear to be all but universal . What arises for man in the process of wondering and probing arises in the cumulative sequences of experience . And yet , troublesome instances in a scientist 's efforts to generalize , or resistant and elusive traits in a novelist 's framing of a character , are varyings that can not be regarded as primarily temporal , as arising in time . These obstacles , spoliations of texture , have their essential significance within a structure ? a structure of ideas , of procedures , or of personality traits . And likewise , wholly apart from the human world , sheer interruptions of uniformity , among the flowers of a field or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configuration of forms rather than // within a succession of occurrences . These too are genuine varyings , not just differences . They arise in the sense in which a rock arises out of a plateau . The beginning or nascence is topographical rather than temporal . Over a large area the land is the same ; at a certain place in this area , it deviates in character . There may be no reason to believe that complexes typically deemed non-temporal , such as purely mathematical traits or abstract logical relations , admit of alescence as integral relations and possibilities . But neither does there seem to be any way of proving that they are exempt from alescence . A point in behalf of their inflexible prevalence is that without employing them inviolate no argument for conceiving them as alescent can be undertaken . This point affirms the inevitability of the prevalence in question , but does not establish its fixity in all possible orders . A counterpoint ( of a type comparable to the original point ) is that theoretical reflection can not rule alescence out of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has the most abstract and intricate character . Actualizations are yet to come . In an order which contains both mathematical possibilities and the human manipulation of them , actualizations can not be antecedently freed of all deviant and unexpected traits . These are the traits that are alescent in the order of query , where moral , mathematical , or aesthetic reflection accept no prior limits to discernment . The contour of any complex , then , may exhibit the two natural dimensions , prevalence and alescence . In // a given order , a complex must be either prevalent or alescent and can not be both . It may be prevalent in one order and alescent in another . If it is alescent in an order , it must be concomitantly prevalent in some other . But not every complex must be alescent . Every complex can be conceived as being alescent in some order , such as an order of query . A complex may be prevalent in an indefinite number of orders , and alescent in an indefinite number of orders . With respect to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not prevail and yet is not alescent either ? orders to which it does not belong at all , i.e. , orders in which it is not a trait or subaltern complex . The contour of a complex is the interrelation of its ordinal integrities . Alescence in a complex ( the alescence of a complex ) is the introduction of some different integrity within the contour of that complex . v The categories of prevalence and alescence must now be distinguished explicitly from various pairs of traditional categories . " Permanence " and " Change . " No major metaphysical concept has flourished with so dim a meaning as has the concept of permanence . It is futile to stake out the limits of this meaning by a survey of historical usages . In common discourse the term is applied as loosely as in metaphysics . The distinctions required by everyday practice carry no extreme claims . The " permanent " is what we can not or need not encompass directly , and this is enough to distinguish it from the " temporary . " When we produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop one set of expectations ; when we produce something temporary , we develop another set . When that which is permanent or temporary is imposed upon us instead of being produced by us , we are not likely to develop our expectations in the same climate of feeling . Sometimes it is the temporary that is to be feared , sometimes the permanent . But in practical reflection on the distinction between the two we are rarely deceived . We do not seriously think of the permanent as everlasting but as matter for the long run , as negligibly variant , as fixed in the degree pertinent to human concern . Metaphysically , permanence seems to imply something beyond " persistence , " which presumably suggests the continuation of an integrity for an indefinite period . Persistence surely , and permanence equivocally , implies endurance . Permanence has been predicated also of that which is said to be perfect and immutable ; of realities that are " unconditioned " or realities that are " simple , " of traits that are " unconditional . " When it relates to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these conceptions of permanence have an empty , fictitious ring . But they bespeak an ethical consciousness which is far from empty and which affects metaphysical discrimination in the form of a search , however ill-directed , for fundamental , illuminating traits . Traditional metaphysics sees permanence as the twin , the necessary correlative , of " change . " So does cracker-barrel wisdom : " what do n't never change " is correlative to " what ai n't never the same . " " Change , " of course , has played as important a social and moral // role as " permanence . " When interpreted as " more real " than permanence , it takes on the meaning of universal " flux . " When interpreted as a condition making for the intelligibility of permanence , the two become polar and interdependent . Nevertheless , change is a more readily applicable concept than permanence , and much less dispensable . Unlike permanence , it is illustratable and discoverable . It allows for degrees , and for comparisons of scope . It suggests many kinds of measurements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory category for philosophic , as opposed to common , use . It is often contrasted , not with permanence but with constancy ; and this , at least , replaces a dubious notion by a viable one . The constancy required for the occurrence of change need be neither a traitless " subject " underlying change nor an eternal " form " against which change is discerned ; it need only be an order of complexes . But the polarity of change and constancy is imperfect . For regular or recurrent change is precisely one form of constancy . Prevalence is not " permanence , " and alescence is not " change . " 1 . Taking any of the aforementioned senses of " permanent , " a prevalence may be impermanent . Nor , as we have seen , is prevalence to be identified with constancy or endurance or persistence . It is the genus of which these may be regarded as species . 2 . Change may be present in a prevalence or in an alescence . In the prevalent constancy of the seasons there is " change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter there is " change . " There is " change " in the prevalence known as a history , and there is " change " in an alescent trend within the history . // 3 . Change may be absent from or irrelevant to an alescent trait . Suppose that in a club the members of which are all classified by custom into a limited number of prepared categories the year after they are admitted , a given member is found to be unclassifiable . This state of affairs is an alescence within a complex . It is deviant , congruous in a way , yet passively incongruous . It does not change . If " changes " in membership or in the relation between individual members and the group can be said to be going on from time to time , or all the time , the essential problem is directly pointed up : relying on the category of change alone , how to distinguish between this and that moment of change in order to discriminate the trait in question . 4 . To complexes which are not actualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose that within a certain range of conditions there is a group of possibilities , and that in the group a new possibility arises . We might be able to say that the " complexion " of the group has " changed . " But we can not say that any given possibility has changed , or that the new possibility " is " a change . We can and should , on the other hand , say that both the group and the new possibility are alescent . A possibility has ( for instance ) augmented a group and a group has been augmented by a possibility . ( Although the group as a group is quite distinguishable from the new possibility , this circumstance does not affect the relational variation , the relational " arising " in which the alescence consists. ) 5 . When the allegedly polar categories of " change and constancy " are applied to certain types of actuality , and even to what is sometimes regarded as the para76 PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE digm condition of actuality , further difficulties present themselves . A spatio-temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is located in more than one order of complexes . In the order where it is a brute finality , a fact , it is a prevalence . In the order where it is an idiosyncratic condition , or a variant , it is an alescence . Yet in each of these aspects , as brute and as idiosyncratic , the event is neither a " constancy " nor a " change . " At best we should have to say that it " represents " or " reflects " a change . But just what change ? Should we say that the order or environment in which the event arose has changed ? But this would not have to be and would not ordinarily be the case . We could say , just as well , or preferably , that the order in which the event arose is still that order , the same order . Thus ? and paradoxically in terms of the " constancy-change " polarity ? neither the order nor the event may be said to have changed . We must patch up by saying either that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event in it , or that there has been not a " change " but a " becoming . " " Being " and " Becoming . " If being and becoming are to be regarded as opposite in the sense that neither is reducible to the other , the distinction is stultifying . It implies that becoming is " non-being , " so that no matter what is discriminated as becoming , it somehow " is not . " This particular kind of opposition emerges as an appearance-reality distinction . On the other hand , if the pair are not opposites in the sense described but are related rather as genus ( being ) to species ( becoming ) , certain traditional problems crop up . Is " being " a genus which is describable in distinction from any of // its species ? Is it " indescribable " in the sense that it is simple or pure ? Is anything discriminable merely in its capacity as " being " ? Whatever the answers to these " problems " may be , prevalence is not to be equated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 . If alescence were equated with becoming and prevalence with being , then , depending upon which version of the being-becoming contrast is stressed , alescence would be either " non-being " or a species of prevalence . The first of these alternatives is absurd , the second false . Alescence is no more a species of prevalence than the other way round . Both are dimensions of natural complexes , such that a complex which is not in the one dimension must be in the other and can be in both only by virtue of different integrities in its contour . 2 . A complex prevails not merely because it is , but because it is in a certain natural dimension . To say that a complex is not prevalent but alescent is not to deny that it " is. " 3 . There are various special reasons why alescence can not be identified with " becoming . " ( a ) Even when becoming is dissociated from any categorial coupling with being , it has been invested by tradition with an emotional burden of meaning , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and sometimes as the " least real " aspect of nature . ( b ) " Becoming " often suggests a " subject " of becoming , even if such a subject is interpreted as the antithesis of a characterless substance . The dimensions of prevalence and alescence do not require the notion of a subject . An alescence // presupposes prevalences , but a prevalence may be preceded and formed by alescences . Grammatically we speak of a complex as alescent . But the complex is not the " subject " of alescence ? it can only be the " subject " of our analysis . Alescence as such does not imply individuality , career , course , or aim in a complex . It implies an arising in an order ; and as many traits or complexes as are relevant to the arising are " subjects . " ( c ) " Becoming " suggests , not always but still too often , evolution , progress , or development , and even design . These concepts or conditions are of no special relevance to the concept of alescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or destructive . ( d ) Becoming is commonly regarded as characteristic of actualities , and is either made the basis of an argument that there are no other kinds of complex , or is contrasted with the " being " of complexes like possibility . In any case , whether or not we can say that a possibility " becomes , " or that it " is a becoming , " we certainly can say that a possibility is alescent , or that it is an alescence. ( e ) " Becoming " not only fails to coincide with the alescent , but it overlaps the prevalent . Thus it can be applied to the basic contour of a history ? to that which makes the history a prevalence . Although the expression " coming about " is a less unsatisfactory approximation to one meaning of alescence than is " becoming , " it is too bland , lacking in exhibitive force , and too awkward in import and use to qualify as a major category . " The Static " and " the Dynamic . " The meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of the two preceding pairs of conceptions . Any attempt to equate " static " with " prevalent " and " dyPREVALENCE // namic " with " alescent " would face the following obstacles , to mention no others . i . Whether the alescent includes the " dynamic " or not , it implies much more . For in the concept of an " arising " there is included not just an origination but the character of the complex involved . Alescence implies not just the arising of a difference , but the difference that has arisen . 2 . We can speak of possibilities as alescent . Whether we can speak of them as " dynamic " seems to raise a different question altogether , the answer to which depends plainly upon antecedent clarification of the term . 3 . The terms " static " and " dynamic " both seem quite applicable to prevalences , the former not more obviously than the latter . " Static " is applicable ( if not very wisely ) to prevalent possibilities , facts , and certain kinds of relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories , processes , and certain other kinds of relations and structures . " Regularity " and " Irregularity . " Although prevalent processes or recurrences might be counted as " regularities , " it is not easy to see how such prevalences as histories , possibilities , or facts could be . Regularity is not even coextensive with constancy . Every regularity might be called a constancy , but the converse is not true . Regularity is commonly ( and etymologically ) associated with laws and rules . But laws and rules themselves may be either prevalent ? in so far as they continue to be exemplified ? or alescent ? in so far as they are complexes that arise originally as variations . If we had to regard all alescences as " irregularities , " we should have to regard all laws in so far as they 8o PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE come to prevail , and all rules in so far as they are laid down , as irregularities . They are , however , not irregularities but new regularities . Considered even in relation to the order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as irregular . The need to distinguish their nascent character from their sphere of dominance is precisely what is to be met by the distinction between alescence and prevalence . " Irregularity " is a manifestation of alescence , not its equivalent . The same may be said of " emergence , " " chance , " and " novelty . " Chance and novelty , each considered by itself , also give the impression of being eligible as an equivalent of alescence . Considered in relation to each other , their eligibility collapses . An alescence may consist in a chance complex . Or an alescence may consist in a novelty . Yet there is no reason at all why a chance complex must be a novelty . And there is no reason at all why a novel complex must be a matter of chance . " Stability " and " Instability . " It is certainly possible , whether useful or not , to think of the complexes of nature in terms of stability and instability , although it is hard to escape the feeling that the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of degree , and that therefore the extremes are less strictly " opposed " than other kinds of " opposites . " A continuum of relative stability also suggests the corollary that the extremes are limits of an " ideal " kind , that they are possibilities rather than actualities . Be this as it may , prevalence can not be equated with stability , nor alescence with instability . 1 . To think of alescence as instability is to neglect // such forms of alescence as cumulative accretion and novelty , and virtually to exclude coalescence . If every complex subject to variation were depicted as an instability , one would be justified in suspecting that the notion of " permanence " was the tacit basis for the depiction . And once again the emphasis would be on the originative factor in alescence to the exclusion of what is originated . What an origination amounts to , its character as a complex , might well signify " stability , " whereas origination considered abstractly might signify lack of stability . 2 . To identify stability with prevalence is to misunderstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prevalence is not necessarily a matter of duration . Within a political revolution , a provisional government is a prevalence , despite the fact that by any historical standard it is a typical form of instability . " Determinateness " and " Indeterminateness . " What does it mean to say that a natural complex is or is not " determinate " ? Philosophers have always been strongly inclined to think of actuality as the minimal condition of determinateness : what " is not yet , " what is still " in the realm of possibility " is indeterminate . Even as an actuality , however , a complex is allowed to be partly indeterminate , when it lacks " definite " traits , when it has " unsettled " aspects . This view implies a " completeness " notion : if all the indefinite aspects of a complex were definite , all the unsettled aspects settled , the complex would be " complete " or completely determinate . To the extent that it makes actuality basic , a view of this kind tends also to lay emphasis on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these emphases rest cry out for articulation . There is no good way to dispense with the concept of determinateness . It plays a particularly useful role when we evaluate certain complexes in the human world . We wish to say , for example , that a meaning is relatively indeterminate , in the sense that it is open to expansion , to alternative constructions , to greater definiteness and precision . Or we wish to say that a man 's obligations in his job are relatively indeterminate , that they have not yet been made determinate . The idea of something " fixed " or not yet fixed is an influential one in human affairs . To fix or make firm suggests , once again , completing . A decision or definition is presumably made determinate when it is " fixed " or " completed . " Is prevalence in some way connected with determinateness , and alescence with indeterminateness ? The question is best answered after a number of other issues are clarified and dealt with . 1 . In place of " fully , " " completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the expression " in all respects . " The phrase " fully determinate " would be replaced by " determinate in all respects . " Then we would be clearly recognizing the principle that a given complex may be located in more than one order of complexes . And we would be forced to see that what is held to be true of a complex in all respects must be held to be true of it no matter to what orders it belongs . 2 . No complex can be said to be indeterminate in all respects . It would not be a complex , and we would be contradicting ourselves by assuming that a disPREVALENCE // crimination has taken place . The latter assumption implies that traits have been made to be or found to be located in an order . A complex indeterminate in all respects would have no traits . For each trait is a determination , implying the exclusion of some other trait and the imposition of limits ? implying a prevalence. 3 . Can a complex be determinate in all respects ? Determinateness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exhausted , and that the complex can not belong to any more or fewer orders than it does . Now whether there are complexes of which this can ever be said is a moot question . That it should be said exclusively of actualities is hard to understand . If any natural complexes at all are subject to alteration or modification or environmental relocation , actualities are . The number of orders in which an actuality is located , and the number and kind of relations into which it may enter , are exhausted or closed only when the actuality ceases to be that actuality . And surely enough , this latter condition for determinateness not only has been taken seriously but has been made fundamental : an actuality is determinate in all respects at the point directly adjacent to its expiration . This is the point at which it is " complete " ; or the point at which nothing else is possible for it . ' 2 With at least as much plausibility , however , one could say that at the point of an actuality 's expiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expiration , and that by not actualizing these possibilities it does not achieve " completeness . " But suppose // this point were ignored . The difficulties would not be ended . If it is at the point of expiration that an actuality is complete , then it is complete whenever it expires , early or late , and in whatever way , and no matter what kind of actuality it is . Whether in catastrophe or in gradual transmutation or in progression through a typical sequence , it can achieve determinateness in all respects only at an infinitesimal moment . However great may be the gap that we suppose between incompletion and completion , at that moment the gap is bridged perfectly and immediately . The paradox we are led to is that completeness is an empty and ghastly condition . 4 . The kinds of actuality that are most often cited as determinate in all respects are fact and feeling . These , it is said , are just what they are and nothing more . They have a finality which makes them " fully actual . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the ground that the " immediacy " and the " complete " specificity of feeling constitute fact in the " ultimate " sense ( Bradley , Whitehead ) . ( a ) But every complex whatever can be said to be " just what it is . " In any order to which a complex belongs it has an integrity . Its traits in that order can be ascertained and can be distinguished from the traits of other complexes . Whatever is said about the determinateness of " atomic actualities " can be said about the determinateness of all others . If there is an order in which an " atomic actuality " is a " subject , " then there is an order in which a given actuality of any kind , and more generally , a given complex of any kind , is a " subject . " If the atomic actuality is said to be deterPREVALENCE // minate by virtue of its uniqueness , the same can be said for any other complex ? a structure , relation , possibility , history , process , regularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex that it is and not to be identified as any other . Any complex , no doubt , can be said also to be " like " some other . But an atomic actuality too is " like " other atomic actualities. ( b ) " Just what it is and nothing more . " If every complex whatever is just what it is , every complex also is " nothing more , " and it takes no acumen to see that this is outwardly a tautologous emphasis . But there is a confusion that lurks here , and it is on this confusion that the case for " full actuality " rests . If we think of " what a complex is " as consisting in its integrity , we may be forgetting that an integrity , dependent on an ordinal location , is not necessarily coextensive with the contour of the complex . Since there is no way of proving that an integrity belonging to a complex , or any finite number of integrities , is all that there are ? exhausts its contour ? we are deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more . " There is no way of establishing that a complex can have only a certain number , or no more than a certain number , of ordinal locations ; or that it can have only a certain number , or no more than a certain number , of traits . Any order to which an actuality belongs includes the effects , the influence , and the restricting limits imposed by that actuality . The order consisting of the effects of a feeling in temporal relation to the feeling as an original occurrence , provides the setting for another integrity of the feeling . The feeling as occurrent , the feeling as remembered , the feeling as impor86 PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE tant or unimportant in the enlarging temporal span , may all be regarded as different integrities of a natural complex . The occurrence , the remembrance , the importance , may each expire . The determinateness of each consists , not in the completion effected by its expiration , but in the distinguishability of its traits , in its discriminable integrity , in the difference it makes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way it determines and limits other complexes . 5 . Every actuality thus has a relative determinateness , a determinateness in given respects . Every actuality also has a relative indeterminateness in so far as it continues to have a contour of integrities , in so far as it may or may not belong to orders to which it does not now belong . Every actuality may be called " complete " in so far as it is an integral complex or integrity . Every actuality may be called " incomplete " in so far as any of its possibilities remain unactualized . If we consider the partly human complex known as a meaning , a complex which , like so many others , men seek both to shape and to explore , we can illustrate its determinateness and indeterminateness in conformity with the generic standard thus far provided . A meaning is determinate to the extent that we can identify it and can distinguish it within an order of complexes ; to the extent that we can trace its relations to alternative meanings and other complexes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain the order or orders in which it belongs , or to the extent that it eludes control despite our resolutions and precautions . Some philosophers believe that determinateness and indeterminateness are matters pertaining only to cogPREVALENCE // nitive structuring and intellectual definition , and not to natural complexes in general . The common usage that corresponds to this viewpoint is the one in which we are said , for example , to " determine " who offended whom and why . Less compatible with the viewpoint is the equally common usage in which it is said that one thing causally " determines " another . Strictly , neither of these usages quite reaches the concept of determinateness . The possible opinion that this concept is more of a hindrance than a help to metaphysical inquiry may well be worth discussion . But if the concept is considered useful or essential in application to complexes which are thought about , which are subjectmatter of knowing , it is arbitrary to assume and to leave unexplained a discontinuity between such complexes and complexes which have not become subjectmatter  --   --  those from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex is determinate , whether it is related or unrelated to mind . Its gross integrity can not be obliterated by decision , or deemed non-prevalent if it falls outside the range of finite intellectual machinery . It is determined by and determines other complexes.l " And any complex also is indeterminate , not only because it has sets of alternative possibilities in which there has not yet been actualization , but because not all of its traits , including possibilities , may yet have arisen . Now among its present sets of alternative possibilities may be its emergence or non-emergence in the order of human experience . Its actual ( actualized ) emergence in human experience , say in an order of scientific awareness , may endow it with another integ88 PREVALENCE AND ALESCENCE rity and make it determinate in a new respect . In this new respect , and at the very same time , it may constitute a " problem " to scientific minds . The solution of the problem by investigation would make the complex determinate in yet another respect . But not in all respects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaust all of its possibilities , any more than its relations within another order would . And its traits within the human order may be far less pervasive than its other traits . Thus ( a ) relative determinateness and indeterminateness belong to natural complexes , and not exclusively to the complexes known as minds or men , any more than actuality and possibility as such belong to minds or men . Nor ( b ) does relative indeterminateness belong solely to **28;352;TOOLONG ( " situations " ) , to existences which are " unsettled , " " objectively " unsettled , supposedly because their relation to human or other organisms is unstable and disquieting , " unresolved . " All complexes are relational , and accordingly it is necessary to speak of the relative determinateness of complexes . But organisms are not a necessary condition of this relationality. 6 . It follows from what has been said that possibilities no less than actualities are both determinate and indeterminate . And it will become clear ( in Chapter IV ) that the present separate treatment of actualities and possibilities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for argumentation . Consider the possibility that the next bomb exploded as a weapon will kill a million people . This possibility is determinate in its integrity of interrelated // traits . It is determined by actualities , such as the existence of bombs and the recurrence of explosions . It is determined by other possibilities , such as the possibility that bombs will continue to be used as weapons . It in turn determines actualities and possibilities ? the actuality , among others , of men living in fear ; the possibility , among others , that men will take remedial measures . At the same time , it is indeterminate with respect to its continuing location in orders of complexes , with respect to the occurrence or non-occurrence of an instance of actualization , and with respect to the place and time of such an instance . 7 . The sense of " completeness " in which completeness coincides with integrity does not eliminate the familiar sense in which a part of that which is repeatedly exemplified , or a phase of a cycle , is " incomplete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cycle leading to a mature organism , is incomplete . ) On the other hand , the distinguishability and integrity of the parts or phases as such makes them as determinate as the more inclusive complex to which they typically belong . ( The seed is a complete seed , complete as a seed . ) Constituents are incomplete in comparison with the typical complexes which provide them with a typical function . The same can not be said of the constituents of complexes which are atypical . Thus the constituents of an event or a history are best thought of not as incomplete but only as less pervasive . These constituents may have no more of a function as constituents than they have merely as complexes distinguished . Subaltern spans in a history may themselves be histories , different in scale but complete as such , like the order in which they // unfold . The sense in which they are incomplete is generically the sense in which the larger history itself is incomplete . 8 . There is no essential connection between determinateness and prevalence or between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen , is determinate in some respects and indeterminate in others . A complex is determinate not in so far as it prevails but merely in so far as it has an integrity . An alescent complex also has an integrity . Any complex is indeterminate in so far as the contour of its integrities , its gross integrity , is not severed from the rest of the world ; in so far as alescence is not foreclosed . A complex which is alescent is determinate in so far as traits have been admitted into its contour , and in so far as its traits are relevant to an order . Only when alescence is confusedly equated with some of its manifestations , such as chance , does its connection with indeterminateness seem to loom large . We can not say , then , that for a complex to exclude traits from its contour ( as a prevalence ) is either less or more of a " determination " than for a complex to admit traits into its contour ( as an alescence ) . " The Intelligible " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevalent is what is intelligible and the alescent what is not intelligible ? In one of two dominant meanings , " intelligible " is contrasted with " sensible . " In the other , it is contrasted with " unintelligible . " In the first meaning , the contrast is between that which is grasped by " intellect " and that which is grasped by " sense . " But there are prevalences in relaPREVALENCE // tion to which intellectual activity ( abstraction and the use of general notions ) is commonly deemed most important , and there are other prevalences in relation to which sensory discrimination may not only be most important but may require a suspension of otherwise useful intellectual habits . In the second sense of " intelligible , " the contrast is between that which meets and that which does not meet the requirements of " knowability " ( whatever these requirements may be ) . But that which is prevalent is not more or less knowable than that which is alescent . There are many different ways or avenues of knowing , whether the complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligible is that which is fixed in its structure . By this standard , certain types of prevalence would obviously not be intelligible , histories in particular . Beneath both the " intelligiblesensible " and the " **27;382;TOOLONG " distinctions there slinks the " unchanging-changing " distinction . But it has already been shown that " change " may or may not be located , or found relevant , either in a prevalence or an alescence . There are individuals and communities of individuals who above all value the record and the effect of what happens to happen . Each addition to the record , even if sorrowful , is within the relative control of judgment , and the major type of gain is increase in the variety of things encountered . To be sure , the record can not survive without dependence upon prevalent symbols , not to mention prevalent capacities , for without them the processes of recognition , communication , and comparison are impossible . But in terms of the // major interest , the symbols are combined and directed in such a way as to dwell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is odd , as well as upon its specific impact . The interest is not in the illustrative or regular aspect of any complex : the importance of the predictive and the uniform is underplayed . That there always have been , not only individuals and groups of individuals , but periods and cultures in which such an interest predominated , is beyond doubt . To them the world and the complexes of the world are not less " intelligible " but just differently assimilated and manipulated ( differently " experienced " ) , differently selected as materials for utterance . Where their productive power takes on methodic form , the prospect for theory may sometimes be darkened ; but at other times it is actually strengthened by the vitality of fresh perception . Knowledge does not vanish if we can conceive of knowledge , of cognitive gain , as inherent in the molding or transmutation of complexes and in the effectiveness of action . So that even if the standard called " knowability " is what is stressed in the idea of " the intelligible , " such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimension of the world is uppermost . III ORDINALITY AND RELATION i EVERY COMPLEX is an order and belongs to an order of complexes . Thus orders are inclusive and belong to more inclusive orders . " Orders " and " an order " are to be distinguished from mere " order . " When the question is asked , " In what order are these bricks to be arranged ? " the tacit assumption may be that the bricks are not without order or pattern and that only a particular kind of order is at issue . Or the assumption may be that action is to confer upon the bricks order as such . The question , " When do these bricks begin to acquire order ? " more plainly makes the latter assumption ? that there may be complexes devoid of order . If the questions were made metaphysically self-conscious , they would take for granted order as such in any complex , and they would always refer only to some manifestation of order that falls within a range of recognizability or familiarity . Order , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by itself , introduce the notion of an order , of a complex as ordinal . Whereas the notion of order may be roughly equated with the notion of form or pattern , the notion of an order must be sharply distinguished from the notion of a pattern or a form . Belonging to an order , being located in an order , // being in various orders , being an order , are conceptions indissociable from the conception of a natural complex . They are ways of representing its ordinality , and without these ways there would be no way of framing the conceptions of prevalence and alescence , or of possibility and actuality . As sheer complex , an order exhibits limitation , multiplicity , and relationality . It is just in so far as the complex is limited that it possesses an integrity and a location . Multiplicity is crucial in the contrast between order and an order . Order by itself implies nothing about the distinguishability and integrity of complexes . It inheres in a complex without respect to the scope , and without respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complex of traits in which multiplicity goes hand in hand with relationality . Strictly , if the relationality of a complex is taken , as it should be , to imply indefinite ramification and division , it already implies multiplicity actual and possible . But multiplicity then can be taken to mean at least the inevitability of distinguishable relations along with all else that constitutes a complex . " An order " needs to be distinguished from " a pattern " or " a form . " The two latter do not so clearly imply multiplicity , if indeed they ever suggest it at all . An order also needs to be distinguished from " a structure . " Up to a point we can link the two , provided that " a structure " is understood , not in the sense of a form or configuration , but in the sense of an encompassing framework , as when we speak of a comprehensive structure or an adequate structure . But only up to a point . For " a structure , " once again , may // entail but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constancy prevailing in an environment of both greater and lesser constancies , or in the midst of inconstancies . As itself a complex , of course , a structure is an order of a specific type ; but it is too special to represent all orders . An order is a sphere of ( or for ) relatedness . It is what " provides " extent , conditions , and kinds of relatedness . Despite the fact that in its multiplicity of traits an order is not " internally " limited , as an order among orders it is precisely what limits . Limitation must be thought of not on the analogy of a finite geometrical figure but in terms of integrity . A complex is an order , however , in so far as it not merely harbors or houses but locates its traits . It is when we think of a prevalence as harboring subaltern prevalences or alescences that we are thinking of a complex in its ordinality . Among other considerations , then , a complex is to be construed as an order because it necessarily has scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be related to each other ; yet all are , in a difficult but insistent sense , commensurate with each other . Unrelated traits may belong to the same order because " between " them there are traits of access , mediating routes . What this means , one may be tempted to say , is that if not every trait in an order is actually related to all others , every trait possibly is . But in the order of an individual history , does it make sense to say that the individual 's first taste of ice cream at the age of three is even possibly related to the validity of the mathematical proof on which he is working at the age of forty ? One need // not go so far as to argue that although the activity of proving is part of the history , the validity of the proof is not . The latter does belong to other orders as well . But so do the other complexes of a history . The validity of the proof is related to the individual 's process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , we are thrown back on the concept of commensurability by virtue of mediating traits . These are the traits that account for " an " order ? for the joint presence , in a complex , of traits that are not related to one another . The validity of a proof may be related to a man 's inquiries , and the early events of his experience may be related to his inquiries , even if the early events can not be related to the validity of the proof . The man 's inquiries mediate between the two ; the two are commensurate by virtue of the mediating trait . What is commensurate with what else determines a complex , and determines for each complex the order that it is . At least part of the answer has been given to a question which is companion to that about the nature of an order ? namely , What does it mean for a complex to have limits or boundaries ? This question might not seem troublesome if each complex had just so many ramifications and were cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . But the meaning of " cut off " would be just as troublesome , and in the primitive conception of a natural complex thus implied , the cluster or container conception of traits would be resurrected . The complexes of nature would turn out to be like a plurality of large and small figures with innumerable shapes , all in a random pattern of intersections and overlappings . The idea of intersecORDINALITY // tion and overlapping is basic enough , but the neatly bounded figures must be transformed back into less neatly mappable orders . If it is justifiable to say that wherever there is commensurateness or mediatability of traits , there is an order or complex ; then we are able to take the next step and say , that in whatever way or at whatever " point " there ceases to be such commensurateness , there is a boundary or limit of the complex . Where traits incommensurable at one point are mediated at another , they belong to another and more inclusive order , the prevalence of which in no way erases the integrity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any other aspect of it , may be alescent . Why are there the limits that there are ? Why are there the complexes that there are ? The question why that which prevails is what prevails and why that which is alescent is what is alescent , whatever prevalences and alescences they are , is a basic form for expression of the sense of mystery , the primordial sense of mystery ? which is not alleviated by the resolution of those specific and recalcitrant issues commonly termed " mysteries " ( the " mystery of Stonehenge , " the " mystery of living tissue " ) . The basic question may be rendered in the form , " Why is all that ever prevails and is alescent what does prevail and is alescent ? " This is quite different from the question , " Why is there a world at all ? " or the question , " Why is there something rather than nothing ? " 14 The latter questions ( B-type ) as distinct from the former ( A-type ) are concerned to ask , not why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prevalences , why any98 ORDINALITY AND RELATION thing prevails at all , why there are complexes . The formulation of these B-type questions entails a theoretical difficulty that the formulation of the A-type does not . One and perhaps both of the alternatives which it verbally posits seem hopelessly resistant to coherent interpretation . As an alternative to " There is a world " it posits " There is no world " or " There is nothing . " Or if we would get rid of the circumstance that the actual statement of these propositions seems to make one of them tautologous and the other selfcontradictory , the B-type questions posit as an alternative to there being something , there being nothing . Whether either of the alternatives thus posited and expressed represents a significant discrimination as such , and whether each of the alternatives is significantly discriminated from the other , is a considerable problem . Part of the problem is whether a question about " the world " should be treated analogously to a question about a finite whole , either with respect to how or whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is to be answered . A-type questions posit alternatives which are comparable to each other . They find mystery in the actualities and possibilities that there are being what they are , whatever they are , other actualities and possibilities being either abstractly conceivable or hypothetically supposable without specification . The primordial sense of mystery is not diminished either by general interpretations in theology or by specific explanations in science . In so far as theology aims to account for what prevails by tracing or attributing this to a grand Prevalence , it plainly begs the // question . In so far as science " explains " specific prevalences by connecting them with others , progressively exposing traits of more inclusive prevalences , it leaves the primordial question intact . The specific answers do not affect the " whatever prevails as it does . " There remains the mystery why in all of the explanations that science gives these are the prevalences that are there to be explained ; why these explanations , these connections , these orders , are what arise and what prevail . ii Historic phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature " suffer to some extent from the confused belief that order ( as such ) is arrangement , and that there is a basic arrangement which nature " has . " Whether these phrases suggest that besides the natural order there is another , a non-natural order , depends upon the angle of philosophic emphasis . To say that nature " is " an order is more meaningful ( or less perplexing ) than to say that nature " has " an order . An order more inclusive than any other is certainly not easy to think of as a storehouse or receptacle of " all things . " The " an " is disturbingly unsatisfactory . Although analogies are not inapplicable to the conception of nature , no single analogy is adequate ; and the kind of conception we are dealing with seems to make mandatory the conclusion that no group or grouping of analogies is adequate except as a stimulus to metaphysical query . But if the idea of an order of nature does not emerge , orders of nature do . Among the subaltern orders that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
