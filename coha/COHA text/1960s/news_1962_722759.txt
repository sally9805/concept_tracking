txt Nelson A. Rockefeller has been re-elected Governor of New York . There is no surprise in his defeat of Robert M. Morgenthau . The only question was by how large a margin he would win . As the returns came in during the evening , it was clear that the Governor had rolled up an adequate victory to keep him well up in the Presidential picture , but had not scored a spectacular or sensational triumph . Mr. Rockefeller has been an able Governor and his record , even though marred by some shortcomings and mistakes , deserved the call to a second term . He campaigned long and hard , as if he believed there was constant danger that his opponent might be gaining on him . Since it is commonly accepted that he ha% his eye on the Republican national convention of 1964 , he was in fact running for Washington as well as Albany , and yesterday 's result will be examined with greatest interest for its significance on the larger political canvas . We welcome Mr. Rockefeller 's re-election . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to direct the state government . He will , furthermore , be a better Governor in the second term than in the first , because he has learned some hard lessons , has become a more able administrator and is now a more effective political leader  --  an essential to influencing constructively the passage of legislation . But his election victory can also be regarded as beneficial beyond New York boundaries ; it puts the Republican party nationally on notice that its best hope lies with a candidate of liberal philosophy . A Rockefeller defeat , or even a near-defeat , would inevitably have been construed as encouragement to reactionaries within the G.O.P. and would have been capitalized by the Goldwater wing . Mr. Morgenthau struggled manfully against heavy odds . He is a man of character and ability ; and we hope and believe that his public career is far from ended . He was , however , slow getting his campaign under way , and when he did get started he did badly . The organization behind him was weak and ineffectual . His fellow Democrats behaved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they guaranteed failure by hardly trying . There was no warmth or vigor to their campaign support of the man they had nominated . He went the route largely alone , an earnest , solitary figure giving his best to a lost cause . Governor Rockefeller has won , but he faces great difficulties , administrative and legislative , at Albany . To the legacy of problems left over from his first term he has added voltmtarilyindeed eagerly  --  a wide array of promises made in the campaign that will keep him busy at least four more years in the fulfillment . Some of these , especially the unqualified and ill-advised pledge against new or increased taxation , will surely haunt him in the days ahead , if he remains true to the pay-as-you-go principle and at the same time honors the commitments on aid to education and to the State University expansion that is the largest unmet responsibility of state government . He needs fullest support as he prepares - for the great undertakings in his second term that will so momentously affect the future well-being of New York State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
