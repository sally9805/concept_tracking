It was like the Liebestod that had killed Isolde on a hundred nights at the opera . The great Wagnerian voice had risen , had touched all the heroic notes , had softened , had faded , had died . For 20 years she was the world 's greatest soprano and for nearly 40 it was hard to imagine Wagner without her . Then , last week , at 67 , after a bedridden year , Kirsten Flagstad died . <P> From her debut at Oslo 's National Theater in 1913 to her farewell on the same stage 40 years to the day later , she was unquestionably the diva of the century . Her voice was at first sweet and small , but by 1935 , when she made her debut at the Met as Sieglinde in Die Walkre , it had grown into immense power and clarity , perfectly even throughout its great range . She had grown with it , and when , as Isolde , she embraced Lauritz Melchior 's Tristan , 400 pounds of lovebird sang from the stage . But together they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Wagner could never again be the same . <P> She had no mind for anything but opera , and before Hitler took Poland she gushed to the press about his beautiful blue eyes . In 1941 she got a Nazi visa to return to occupied Norway , where she lived well on the profits of her husband 's collaborationist lumber business . He died on the eve of his trial during the purge of the quislings in 1946 . When Flagstad returned to the U.S. , she was greeted with pickets , jeers and stink bombs in the concert halls of three cities . But she was innocent , if naive , and the world soon forgave her . And after her long silence , she seemed better than before . <P> She retired time and again , but like Brnnhilde emerging from the fire , she kept making reappearances-a six-week charity tour of 25 concerts , an astonishing , exhausting month-long recording session in which she filled twelve albums with a full Wagnerian repertory . At 60 , the heroic soprano range was still hers-not the top C , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , unfailing . <P> In her last years she took up the direction of the new Norway Opera and retired happily to her great wood house in Kristiansand , on Norway 's south coast . There , amid heavy paintings and great music , she knitted , played solitaire , entertained her friends with evenings of Schumann and Schubert , softly singing the lieder to her own accompaniment . And always , there was the suggestion that given some encouragement , she could still sing the great Liebestod , the song of love-unto-death that belonged to Flagstad.
