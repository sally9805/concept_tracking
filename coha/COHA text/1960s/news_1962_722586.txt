This will allow Illinois to join the leading states in mental health services , he said .

John H. Thompson , military editor of THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE , told delegates that a war is going on in southeast Asia in the same sense that the Korean conflict was a war : American lives are being lost . Seymour Simon , county board president , went to the convention when he was informed ? incorrectly ? that the Legion panned to attack him for suggesting that veterans assistance commission be made a part of the county welfare department . But when he learned that the convention voted only , to oppose his plan , and not him personally , he wished delegates a successful convention and left . The convention also voted to back a Senate bill which would permit veterans and their widows now covered by pension laws to have an annual income of up to $3,600 depending upon the number of dependents . Several delegates unsuccessfully had sought a stand for more liberal benefits . To qualify under the present law , a veteran or widow can have a maximum income of $3,000.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
