Divvying Up Alaska Anchorage Anchorage was still waiting for its first real snow November 25 , though the thermometer never climbed higher than five above zero . Inside a hotel conference room about 20 Alaska business leaders ? clearly frustrated and almost scared ? huddled together , away from the cold and the 3 p.m. gloom . The source of frustration was 4500 miles east by southeast , in Washington , D.C. , where the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs committee was working to keep a pledge to Alaska 's 55,000 Eskimo , Indian , and Aleut citizens . Committee Chairman Henry Jackson had promised the Natives that a bill to extinguish their claims on most of Alaska 's land would be out of the Senate this year . Reports , reaching the businessmen in Anchorage indicated that this first committee markup session went well for the Natives and for their company of lawyers headed by Arthur Goldberg , Ramsey Clark and Thomas Kuchel . After 102 years of US rule , it appeared Alaska 's original inhabitants were on their way to winning a substantial part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alaska 's land mass ) , $5oo million in cash ( about $io , 000 a Native , the money to be distributed to various development corporations ) , and a perpetual two percent from the future mineral production of all public lands in Alaska . In return the Natives would surrender their claims to another 300 million acres of land they once roamed freely . Interestingly , the negotiations were ' taking place between the Alaska Federation of Natives and the Senate committee . The state of Alaska was nowhere in evidence , nor had the state submitted anything like its own settlement proposal . Soon the bankers and oilmen , the publisher and the television station owner in the hotel got a cheering phone call . It came from Governor Keith Miller 's top aide in Juneau , Henry Pratt , who filled everybody in on the state 's first detailed position paper on the subject , released hours before . The governor thought that six million acres would be more than enough for the Natives , that in no case should they get lands that the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from public lands at all . Naturally , the governor said , the Natives should not get rights to such leasable minerals as gas and oil on their lands . As to the AFN bill in general : " I can only consider it as unacceptable , and regret that false hopes have been raised among our Native peoples by the Eastern attorneys representing them . " Miller added he was dispatching state Attorney General Kent Edwards to Washington to explain the state 's viewpoint , finally formulated a year and a half after the first Senate hearings on the subject and a month after the final House hearings . The state Chamber of Commerce went on record supporting Miller in principle ; . so did more that woo people in this state of 283,000 , who signed a petition backing the governor within three days of his announcement . The news media have been covering the land-claims battle dutifully , though not always with as much objectivity as Spiro Agnew says he wants . Commented the Anchorage Daily Times , the state 's largest newspaper , October 18 in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proposed bill . . . is a bombshell packaged in an 85-page bundle now simmering before the Interior committees of Congress . . . Some of the provisions are shocking . " It went on to say that the royalty-sharing provision alone " would amount to hundreds of billions of dollars , " and complained that the bill 's " total effect would be to cripple the development of Alaska . . . . " " And this , " said the Times , " is what the congressional committees must realize , and that is why the Goldberg Line that has been fed to the Alaska Native Federation is a threat to all the people of the 49th state . " The worst example of " gutter journalism " he ever saw , commented Oklahoma Representative Ed Edmondson , here at the time . Some weeks later the much smaller Anchorage Daily News pointed out that for the override to bring the Natives $ioo billion the lands would have to produce minerals worth $5 trillion . But the damage had been done . What the Times and the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to tie up Alaskan development is to force the Natives into court . That almost certainly would cloud title to most of Alaska for a decade or more . Out of responsibility as much as self-interest , the Natives choose to opt for a congressional settlement . They 've made virtually every policy decision on their own . AFN members drafted every important policy position in their bill . Goldberg 's entrance into the case has been fraught with controversy from the start eight months ago . The Natives sought out the former Supreme Court Justice and Secretary of Labor , through his son Robert , an Anchorage lawyer . At first the several dozen lawyers who represent the 28o-odd Native villages resented Goldberg 's presence ? and his decision not to take a fee for himself and insistence that their fees be held within reasonable limits . Though the fight between the Natives and some of their regional attorneys grew bitter , the AFN triumphed and Goldberg took the case . That was the first real test of strength for the fouryear-old organization , and it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natives hunted over or lived on virtually all Alaska before the white man came . And the coming of the white man resulted in the same misery that plagues nearly all America 's aboriginal occupants today ? but it 's worse in Alaska . Village income averages about one quarter that of white Alaskans . One out of ten young Natives graduates from high school . The average age at death is 35 . Before the white man came bringing syphilis , TB and gunpowder , the Natives had a viable culture , It was the white man who invaded ? of ten destroyed ? their hunting grounds , who taught them that the Native culture was inferior while providing a half-cooked version of his own . The Natives have used or occupied virtually all of Alaska since time immemorial . This creates what is known as aboriginal title , which means the federal government can seize Native land ' but third parties like the state ca n't . Congress in 1884 recognized the Natives ' right to their lands , though it postponed the conveying of the white man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the state disclaimed all right and title to lands which may be held by the Natives . Moreover in the Statehood Act , Congress , ten years ago generously gave Alaska the right to select 103 million acres out of its 375 million acre or 586,000 square mile area from the public domain . It also gave the state 90 percent of the government proceeds from mineral production on federal lands . It has never granted a state so high ' a percentage ? let alone total area ? of land . It had always given states a straight 37172 percent of the mineral revenue from federal lands . Congress was generous because Alaska then had no economy to speak of . Now , of course , Alaska is oil rich beyond anyone 's wildest dreams . It took in $903 million in bonuses alone September io , when land on the North Slope was le.ased to oil companies . The Natives say that some form of revenue sharing could well be the state 's best method of preserving its favored position . If this is true ? and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? then the Miller administration is hurting the very interests it seeks to protect . On another count the state view is at best myopic , because it ignores the hugely beneficial impact a settlement would have upon the economy . The Natives today have one-fourth the per capita income of whites . If they earned , say , half as much , their contribution to the Alaskan economy would be huge . On yet a third front , Miller 's position could lead to a breakdown in the delicate negotiations between the Natives and Congress . If this happens and the Natives sue to protect their lands , then the $90o million Trans Alaska Pipeline from the North Slope to the Gulf of Alaska and other forms of development might be stalled for a decade . Whether the state 's campaign is having an effect is hard to say . The Senate Interior Committee has not even settled on a date for its next markup session . The committee said it wanted a bill out by the end of the year , giving the House all of 1971 to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the clock is ticking away .
