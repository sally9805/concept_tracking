* * * * * Blind Man 's Lantern by Allen Kim Lang Successful colonies among the stars require interstellar ships  --  but they require , also , a very special kind of man . A kind you might not think to look for .... Illustrated by Schelling Illustration Walking home in the dark from an evening spent in mischief , a young man spied coming toward him down the road a person with a lamp . When the wayfarers drew abreast , the play-boy saw that the other traveler was the Blind Man from his village . " Blind Man , " the youngster shouted across the road , " what a fool you be ! Why , old No-Eyes , do you bear a lantern , you whose midnight is no darker than his noonday ? " The Blind Man lifted his lamp . " It is not as a light for myself that I carry this , Boy , " he said , " it is to warn off you fools with eyes . "  --  Hausa proverb The Captain shook hands with the black-hatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with men 's business . " It 's been a pleasure to have you and Fraa Stoltzfoos aboard , Aaron , " the Captain said . " Ship 's stores are yours , my friend ; if there 's anything you need , take it and welcome . You 're a long way from the corner grocery . " " My Martha and I have all that 's needful , " Aaron Stoltzfoos said . " We have our plow , our seed , our land . Captain , please tell your men , who treated us strangers as honored guests , we thank them from our hearts . We 'll not soon forget their kindness . " " I 'll tell them , " the Captain promised . Stoltzfoos hoisted himself to the wagon seat and reached a hand down to boost his wife up beside him . Martha Stoltzfoos sat , blushing a bit for having displayed an accidental inch of black stocking before the ship 's officers . She smoothed down her black skirts and apron , patted the candle-snuffer Kapp into place over her prayer-covering , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world outside , her husband said , was a cold one . Now in the Stoltzfoos wagon was the final lot of homestead goods with which these two Amishers would battle the world of Murna . There was the plow and bags of seed , two crates of nervous chickens ; a huge , round tabletop ; an alcohol-burning laboratory incubator , bottles of agar-powder , and a pressure cooker that could can vegetables as readily as it could autoclave culture-media . There was a microscope designed to work by lamplight , as the worldly vanity of electric light would ill suit an Old Order bacteriologist like Martha Stoltzfoos . Walled in by all this gear was another passenger due to debark on Murna , snuffling and grunting with impatience . " Sei schtill , Wutzchen , " Stoltzfoos crooned . " You 'll be in your home pen soon enough . " The Captain raised his hand . The Engineer punched a button to tongue the landing ramp out to Murnan earth . Cold air rammed in from the outside winter . The four horses stomped their hoofs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squealed dismay as the chill hit his nose . " We 're reddi far geh , Captain , " Stoltzfoos said . " My woman and I invite you and your men to feast at our table when you 're back in these parts , five years hence . We 'll stuff you fat as sausages with onion soup and Pannhaas , Knepp and Ebbelkuche , shoo-fly pie and scharifer cider , if the folk here grow apples fit for squeezing . " " You 'll have to set up planks outdoors to feed the lot I 'll be bringing , Aaron , " the Captain said . " Come five-years ' springtime , when I bring your Amish neighbors out , I 'll not forget to have in my pockets a toot of candy for the little Stoltzes I 'll expect to see underfoot . " Martha , whose English was rusty , blushed none the less . Aaron grinned as he slapped the reins over the rumps of his team . " Giddap ! " The cart rumbled across the deck and down the ramp , onto the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and sat as the rope tightened on his noseband . He skidded stubbornly down the ramp till he felt cold earth against his rear . Accepting fate , Yonnie scrambled up and plodded after the wagon . As the Stoltzfooses and the last of their off-worldly goods topped a hillock , they both turned to wave at the ship 's officers . Then , veiled by the dusty fall of snow , they disappeared . * * * * * " I do n't envy them , " the Engineer said , staring out into the wintery world . " Hymie , were you born in a barn ? " the Exec bellowed . " Sorry , sir . " The Engineer raised the landing ramp . Heaters hummed to thaw the hold 's air . " I was thinking about how alone those two folks are now . " " Hardly alone , " the Captain said . " There are four million Murnans , friendly people who consider a white skin no more than a personal idiosyncrasy . Aaron 's what his folks call a Chentelmaan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Engineer said . " Why 'd he come half across Creation to scratch out a living with a horse-drawn plow ? " " He came out here for dirt , " the Captain said . " Soil is more than seed-bed to the Amish . It feeds the Old Order they 're born to . Aaron and Martha Stoltzfoos would rather have built their barns beside the Susquehanna , but all the land there 's taken . Aaron could have taken a job in Lancaster , too ; he could have shaved off his beard , bought a Chevie and moved to the suburbs , and settled down to read an English-language Bible in a steepled church . Instead , he signed a homestead-contract for a hundred acres eighty light-years from home ; and set out to plow the land like his grandpop did . He 'll sweat hard for his piece of Murna , but the Amish always pay well for their land . " " And what do we , the government , I mean , get from the deal ? " the Exec wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hay , like Aaron 's does . " " Cultures skid backwards when they 're transplanted , " the Captain said . " Murnan culture was lifted from Kano , a modern city by the standards of the time ; but , without tools and with a population too small to support technology , the West African apostates from Islam who landed here four hundred years ago slid back to the ways of their grandparents . We want them to get up to date again . We want Murna to become a market . That 's Aaron 's job . Our Amishman has got to start this planet back toward the machine age . " " Seems an odd job to give a fellow who wo n't drive a car or read by electric light , " the Engineer observed . " Not so odd , " the Captain said . " The Amish pretty much invented American agriculture , you know . They 've developed the finest low-energy farming there is . Clover-growing , crop-rotation , using animal manures , those are their inventions . Aaron , by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before you can say Tom Malthus , there 'll be steel cities in this wilderness , filled with citizens eager to open charge accounts for low-gravs and stereo sets . " " You expect our bearded friend to reap quite a harvest , Captain , " the Engineer said . " I just hope the natives here let him plant the seed . " " Did you get along with him , Hymie ? " " Sure , " the Engineer said . " Aaron even made our smiths , those human sharks bound for Qureysh , act friendly . For all his strange ways , he 's a nice guy . " " Nice guy , hell , " the Captain said . " He 's a genius . That seventeenth-century un-scientist has more feeling for folkways in his calloused left hand than you 'd find in all the Colonial Survey . How do you suppose the Old Order maintains itself in Pennsylvania , a tiny Deitsch-speaking enclave surrounded by calico suburbs and ten-lane highways ? They mind their business and leave the neighbors to theirs . The Amish have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are resented , and either slaughtered or absorbed . " " Sometimes digestively , " the Engineer remarked . " Since the Thirty Years ' War , back when ' Hamlet ' was opening in London , these people have been breeding a man who can fit one special niche in society . The failures were killed in the early days , or later went gay and took the trappings of the majority . The successes stayed on the farm , respected and left alone . Aaron has flirted with our century ; he and his wife learned some very un-Amish skills at the Homestead School . The skill that makes Aaron worth his fare out here , though , is an Amish skill , and the rarest one of all . He knows the Right Way to Live , and lives it ; but he knows , too , that your Truth-of-the Universe is something different . And right , for you . He 's quite a man , our Aaron Stoltzfoos . That 's why we dropped him here . " " Better him than me , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned to the Exec . " As soon as we 've lifted , ask Colonel Harris to call on me in my cabin , Gene . Our Marines had better fresh-up their swordsmanship and cavalry tactics if they 're to help our Inad Tuaregs establish that foundry on Qureysh . " " It sometimes seems you 're more Ship 's Anthropologist than Captain , " the Engineer remarked . " I 'm an anthro-apologist , Hymie , like Mr. Kipling , " the Captain said . " There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays . And  --  every  --  single  --  one  --  of  --  them  --  is  --  right ! " Bells rang , and the ship surged . " Aaron and Martha , God keep you , " the Captain said . * * * * * " Whoa ! " Aaron shouted . He peered back toward the ship , floating up into grayness , the cavitation of her wake stirring the snow into patterns like fine-veined marble . " Gott saygen eich , " he said , a prayer for his departing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to freeze the horns off a mooley-cow , " she said . She glanced about at the snow-drifted little trees and clutched her black cloak tighter . " I 'm feared , Stoltz . There 's naught about us now but snow and black heathen . " " It 's fear that is the heathen , " Aaron said . " By the word of the Lord were the heavens made ; and the host of them by the breath of His mouth . " He kissed her . " I welcome you to our new homeland , wife , " he said . Behind them Wutzchen  --  " piglet "  --  grunted . Martha smiled back at the giant porker , perched amongst the cases and bags and household goods like the victim of some bawdy chiavari . " I 've never heard a pig mutter so , " she said . " If he knew that his business here was to flatter the local lady-pigs with farrow , Wutzchen would hop out and run , " Aaron said . " Dummel dich , Stoltz , " Martha said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we do n't have so much as a stove lit in our tent . " Stoltzfoos slapped the team back into motion . " What we need for our journey home are a few of the altie lieder , " he said , reaching back in the wagon for his scarred guitar . He strummed and hummed , then began singing in his clear baritone : " In da guut alt Suumer-zeit ... " ... In da guut alt Suumer-zeit , " Martha 's voice joined him . As they jolted along the path through the pine trees , heading toward Datura-village , near which their homestead stood , they sang the other homey songs to the music of the old guitar . " Drawk Mich Zrick zu Alt Virginye , " nostalgic for the black-garbed Plain-Folk left at home . Then Aaron 's fingers danced a livelier tune on the strings : " Ich fang ' n neie Fashun aw , " he crowed , and Martha joined in : " A new fashion I 'll begin , " they sang , " The hay I 'll cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll loaf in the shade . " And feast on cherry-pie . " I 'll get us a white , smearkase cow , " And a yard full of guinea-hen geese ; " A red-beet tree as high as the moon , " And a patent-leather fence . " The chickens I 'll keep in the kitchen , " they sang ; whereupon Martha broke down laughing . " It 's a new world , and for now a cold world ; but it 's God 's world , with home just up ahead , " Aaron shouted . He pulled the wagon up next to the arctic tent that was to be their temporary farmhouse , beside the wagon loads of provision he 'd brought before . He jumped down and swung Martha to earth . " Light the stove , woman ; make your little kitchen bright , while I make our beasts feel welcome . " The Amishwoman pushed aside the entrance flap of the tent . Enclosed was a circle some twelve feet wide . The floor was bare earth . Once warmed by the pump-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become a bog . Martha went out to the wagon to get a hatchet and set out for the nearby spinny of pines to trim off some twigs . Old Order manner forbid decorative floor-coverings as improper worldly show ; but a springy carpet of pine-twigs could be considered as no more than a wooden floor , keeping two Plain Folk from sinking to their knees in mud . The pots were soon boiling atop the two-burner stove , steaming the tent 's air with onion-tangy tzvivvele Supp and the savory pork-smell of Schnitz un Knepp , a cannibal odor that disturbed not a bit Wutzchen , snoring behind the cookstove . Chickens , penned beneath the bed , chuckled in their bedtime caucus . The cow stood cheek-by-jowl with Yonnie , warming him with platonic graciousness as they shared the hay Aaron had spread before them . Martha stirred her soup . " When the bishop married me to you , " she told Aaron , " he said naught of my having to sleep with a pig . " " Ah , but I thought you knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aaron said , standing close . " It 's Wutz I mean , " she said . " Truly , I mind not a bit living as in one of those automobile-wagons , since it 's with you , and only for a little while . " " I 'll hire a crew of our neighbors to help with the barn tomorrow , " Aaron said . " That done , you 'll have but one pig to sleep with . " After grace , they sat on cases of tobacco to eat their meal from a table of feed sacks covered with oilcloth . " The man in the ship 's little kitchen let me make and freeze pies , Stoltz , " Martha said . " He said we 'd have a deepfreeze big as all outdoors , without electric , so use it . Eat till it 's all , Maan ; there 's more back . " Yonnie bumped against Aaron 's eating-elbow . " No man and his wife have eaten in such a zoo since Noah and his wife left the ark , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palmed it against the bull 's big snout to be snuffled up . " He likes your cooking , " he said . " So wash his face , " Martha told him . * * * * * Outside the tent there was a clatter of horse-iron on frozen ground . " What the die-hinker is that ? " Aaron demanded . He stood and picked up the naphtha lantern . Outside , Aaron saw a tall black stranger , astride a horse as pale as the little Murnan moons that lighted him . " Rankeshi dade ! " the visitor bellowed . " May your life be a long one ! " Aaron Stoltzfoos repeated in Hausa . Observing that his caller was brandishing a clenched fist , the Amishman observed the same ambiguous courtesy . " If you will enter , O Welcome Stranger , my house will be honored . " Illustration " Mother bless thee , Bearded One , " the Murnan said . He dismounted , tossing his reins to one of the four retainers who remained on horseback . He entered the tent after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting his dark eyes flick across Martha 's unveiled face . At the Amishman 's invitation , the visitor sat himself on a tobacco case , revealing as he crossed his legs elaborately embroidered trousers and boot tops worked with designs that would dazzle a Texan . Martha bustled about hiding the remains of their meal . The Murnan 's outer dress was a woolen riga , the neckless gown of his West-African forefathers , with a blanket draped about his shoulders , exactly as those ancestors had worn one in the season of the cold wind called harmattan . Aaron introduced himself as Haruna , the Hausa version of his name ; and the guest made himself known as Sarki  --  Chief  --  of the village of Datura . His given name was Kazunzumi . Wutzchen snuffled in his sleep . The Sarki glanced at the huge pig and smiled . Aaron relaxed a bit . The Islamic interdict on swine had been shed by the Murnans when they 'd become apostates , just as Colonial Survey had guessed . Stoltzfoos ' Hausa , learned at the Homestead School at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , though he discovered , with every experimenter in a new language , that his most useful phrase was magana sanoo-sanoo : " please speak slowly . " Aaron let the Chief commence the desultory conversation that would precede talk of consequence . Martha , ignored by the men , sat on the edge of the bed , reading the big German-language Bible . Aaron and Kazunzumi sang on in the heathen tongue about weather , beasts , and field-crops . The Sarki leaned forward to examine Aaron 's beard and shaven upper lip , once ; and smiled . The Murnan does not wear such . He looked at Martha more casually now , seeing that the husband was not disgraced by his wife 's naked face ; and remarked on the whiteness of her skin in the same tones he 'd mentioned Wutzchen 's remarkable girth . Aaron asked when the snows would cease , when the earth would thaw . The Sarki told him , and said that the land here was as rich as manure . Gradually the talk worked round to problems involving carpenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron was pleased to discover that the natives thought nothing of digging a cellar and raising a barn in midwinter , and that workers could be easily hired . Suddenly Sarki Kazunzumi stood and slapped his palms together . The tent flap was shoved open . Bowed servants , who 'd shivered outside for over an hour , placed their master 's presents on the sack table , on the twig floor , even beside Martha on the bed . There were iron knives , a roast kid , a basket of peanuts , a sack of roasted coffee beans , a string of dried fruit , and a tiny earthware flask of perfume . There was even a woolen riga for Aaron , black , suggesting that the Survey had said a bit to the natives about Amish custom ; and there were bolts of bright-patterned cloth too worldly for aught but quilts and infant-dresses , brightening Martha 's eyes . Aaron stood to accept the guest gifts with elaborate thanks . Sarki Kazunzumi as elaborately bemeaned his offerings . " Musa the carpenter will appear on tomorrow 's tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother willing , visit me in Datura tomorrow . We will together purchase lumber worthy of my friend-neighbor 's barn-making . May the Mother give you strength to farm , Haruna ! May the Mother grant you the light of understanding ! " " Sannu , sannu ! " Stoltzfoos responded . He stood at the door of his tent , holding his lantern high to watch the Sarki and his servants ride off into the darkness . * * * * * " Er iss en groesie Fisch , nee ? " Martha asked . " The biggest fish in these parts , " Aaron agreed . " Did you understand our talk ? " " The heathen speech is hard for me to learn , Stoltz , " Martha admitted , speaking in the dialect they 'd both been reared to . " While you had only the alien speech to study , I spent my time learning to grow the buglets and tell the various sorts apart . Besides , unser guutie Deitschie Schproech , asz unser Erlayser schwetzt , iss guut genunk fa mier . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good enough for me ) . Aaron laughed . " So altfashuned a Maedel I married , " he said . " Woman , you must learn the Hausa , too . We must be friends to these Schwotzers , as we were friends with the English-speakers back in the United Schtayts . " He pushed aside the bolt of Murnan cloth to sit beside his wife , and leafed through the pages of their Familien-Bibel , pages lovingly worn by his father 's fingers , and his grandfather 's . " Listen , " he commanded : " For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills ; a land of wheat , and barley , and vines , and fig trees , and pomegranates ; a land of oil olive , and honey ; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills thou mayest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then thou shalt bless the Lord they God for the good land which He hath given thee . " Aaron closed the big book reverently . " Awmen , " he said . " Awmen , " the woman echoed . " Aaron , with you beside me , I am not fretful . " " And with the Lord above us , I fear not in a strange land , " Aaron said . He bent to scrape a handful of earth from beneath Martha 's pine-twig carpet . " Guuter Gruundt , " he said . " This will grow tall corn . Tobacco , too ; the folk here relish our leaf . There will be deep grasses for the beasts when the snow melts . We will prosper here , wife . " The next morning was cold , but the snowfall had ceased for a spell . The Stoltzfooses had risen well before the dawn ; Martha to feed herself , her husband , and the chickens ; Aaron to ready the horse and wagon for a trip into Datura . He counted out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did some arithmetic , and allowed his wife to pour him a second cup of coffee for the road . " You may expect the Sarki 's wives to visit while I 'm gone , " he remarked . " I 'd be scared half to death ! " Martha Stoltzfoos said . Her hands went to the back of her head , behind the lace prayer covering . " My hair 's all strooby , this place is untidy as an auction yard ; besides , how can I talk with those dark and heathen women ? Them all decked out in golden bangles and silken clothes , most likely , like the bad lady of Babylon ? Aaron Stoltz , I would admire a pretty to ride into town with you . " " Haggling for hired-help is man 's Bissiniss. " he said . " When Kazunzumi 's women come , feed them pie and peaches from the can . You 'll find a way to talk , or women are not sisters . I 'll be back home in time for evening chores . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aaron Stoltzfoos studied the land . A world that could allow so much well-drained black soil to go unfarmed was fortunate indeed , he mused . He thought of his father 's farm , which would be his elder brother 's , squeezed between railroad tracks and a three-lane highway , pressed from the west by an Armstrong Cork plant , the very cornstalks humming in harmony with the electric lines strung across the fields . This land was what the old folks had sought in America so long ago : a wilderness ripe for the plow . The wagon rumbled along the hoof-pocked frozen clay . Aaron analyzed the contours of the hills for watershed and signs of erosion . He studied the patterns of the barren winter fields , fall-plowed and showing here and there the stubble of a crop he did n't recognize . When the clouds scudded for a moment off the sun , he grinned up , and looked back blinded to the road . Good tilth and friendship were promised here , gifts to balance loneliness . Five years from spring , other Amish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have ! For now , though , he and Martha , come from a society so close-knit that each had always known the yield-per-acre of their remotest cousin-german , were in a land as strange as the New York City Aaron , stopping in for a phone-call to the vet had once glimpsed on the screen of a gay-German neighbor 's stereo-set . Datura looked to Aaron like a city from the Bible , giving it a certain vicarious familiarity . The great wall was a block of sunbaked mud , fifty feet tall at the battlements , forty feet thick at its base ; with bright , meaningless flags spotted on either side of the entrance tower . The cowhide-shielded gate was open . Birds popped out of mud nests glued to the mud wall and chattered at Aaron . Small boys wearing too little to be warm appeared at the opening like flies at a hog-slaughtering to add to the din , buzzing and hopping about and waving their arms as they called companions to view the black-bearded stranger . Aaron whoaed his horse and took a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " Zonang ! " he shouted : " Come here ! Is there a boy amongst you brave enough to ride with an off-worlder to the Sarki 's house , pointing him the way ? " One of the boys laughed at Aaron 's slow , careful Hausa . " Let Black-Hat 's whiskers point him the way ! " the boy yelled . " Uwaka ! Ubaka ! " Damning both parents of the rude one , another youngster trotted up to Aaron 's wagon and raised a skinny brown fist in greeting . " Sir Off-Worlder , I who am named Waziri , Musa-the-Carpenter 's son , would be honored to direct you to the house of Sarki Kazunzumi . " " The honor , young man , is mine , " Stoltzfoos assured the lad , raising his own fist gravely . " My name is Haruna , son of Levi , " he said , reaching down to hoist the boy up beside him on the wagon 's seat . " Your friends have ill manners . " He giddapped the horse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Peace , Waziri ! " Aaron protested . " You 'll frighten my poor horse into conniptions . Do you work for your father , the carpenter ? " " To , honorable Haruna , " the boy said . " Yes . " The empty wagon thumped over the wheel-cut streets like a wooden drum . " By the Mother , sir , I have great knowledge of planing and joining ; of all the various sorts of wood , and the curing of them ; all the tools my father uses are as familiar to me as my own left hand . " " Carpentry is a skillful trade , " Aaron said . " Myself , I am but a farmer . " " By Mother 's light ! So am I ! " Waziri said , dazzled by this coincidence . " I can cultivate a field free of all its noxious weeds and touch never a food-plant . I can steer a plow straight as a snapped chalk-string , grade seed with a sure eye ; I can spread manure  --  " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I need a man of just those rare qualifications to work for me . Know you such a paragon ? " " Mother 's name ! Myself , your Honor ! " Aaron Stoltzfoos shook the hand of his hired man , an alien convention that much impressed Waziri . The boy was to draw three hundred anenes a day , some thirty-five cents , well above the local minimum-wage conventions ; and he would get his bed and meals . Aaron 's confidence that the boastful lad would make a farmer was bolstered by Waziri 's loud calculations : " Three hundred coppers a day make , in ten day 's work , a bronze cowrie ; ten big bronzes make a silver cowrie , the price of an acre of land . Haruna , will you teach me your off-world farming ? Will you allow me to buy land that neighbors yours ? " " Sei schtill , Buu , " Aaron said , laughing . " Before you reap your first crop , you must find me the Sarki . " " We are here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house was no larger than its neighbors , Moorish-styled and domed-roofed like the others ; but it wore on its streetside walls designs cut into the stucco , scrolls and arabesques . Just above the doorway , which opened spang onto the broadway of Datura , a grinning face peered down upon the visitors , its eyes ruby-colored glass . Waziri pounded the door for Aaron , and stepped aside to let his new employer do the speaking . They were admitted to the house by a thin , old man wearing a pink turban . As they followed this butler down a hallway , Aaron and Waziri heard the shrieks and giggles of feminine consternation that told of women being herded into the zenana . The Amishman glimpsed one of the ladies , perhaps Sarki Kazunzumi 's most junior wife , dashing toward the female sanctuary . Her eyes were lozenges of antimony ; her hands , dipped in henna , seemed clad in pale kid gloves . Aaron , recalling pointers on Murnan etiquette he 'd received at Georgetown , elaborately did not see the lady . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plush-covered sofa . Waziri was cuffed to a mat beside the door . " Rankeshi dade ! " the Sarki said . " May the Mother bring you the light of understanding . " " Light and long life , O Sarki , " Stoltzfoos said , standing up . " Will the guest who honors my roof-cup taste coffee with his fortunate host ? " the Sarki asked . " The lucky guest will be ever the Sarki 's servant if your Honor allows him to share his pleasure with his fellow-farmer and employee , Waziri the son of Musa , " Aaron said . " You 'd better have hired mice to guard your stored grain , O Haruna ; and blowflies to curry your cattle , than to have engaged the son of Musa as a farmer , " Kazunzumi growled . " Waziri has little light of understanding . He will try to win from the soil what only honest sweat and Mother 's grace can cause to grow . This boy will gray your beard , Haruna . " " Perhaps the sun that warms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron suggested . " Better that your hand should leave the plowhandle from time to time to warm his lazy fundament , " the Sarki said . " Just so , O Sarki , " the Amishman said . " If Waziri does not serve me well , I have an enormous boar who will , if kept long enough from wholesomer food , rid me of a lazy farm-hand . " Waziri grinned at all the attention he was getting from the two most important men in town , and sat expectantly as the turbaned elder brought in coffee . Stoltzfoos watched the Sarki , and aped his actions . Water was served with the coffee ; this was to rinse the mouth that the beverage could be tasted with fresh taste buds . The coffee was brown as floodwater silt , heavy with sugar , and very hot ; and the cups had no handles . " You are the first European I have seen for many years , friend Haruna , " the Sarki said . " It is five years gone that the white off-worlders came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver the land you now farm . " " They bought well , " Aaron said ; " the seller sold justly . When the fist of winter loosens , the soil will prove as rich as butter . " " When the first green breaks through , and you may break the soil without offense , you will do well , " Kazunzumi said . " You are a man who loves the land . " " My fathers have flourished with the soil for twenty generations , " the Amishman said . " I pray another twenty may live to inherit my good fortune . " " Haruna , " the Sarki said , " I see that you are a man of the book , that volume of which Mother in her grace turns over a fresh page each spring . Though your skin is as pale as the flesh of my palm , though you have but one wife , though you speak throat-deep and strangely , yet you and I are more alike than different . The Mother has given you light , Haruna , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words , " Aaron said . " Sir , my good and only wife  --  I am a poor man , and bound by another law than that of the fortunate Kazunzumi  --  adds her thanks to mine for the rich gifts the Chief of Datura presented us , his servants . In simple thanks , I have some poor things to tender our benefactor . " Waziri , perceiving the tenor of Aaron 's talk , sprang to his feet and hastened out to the wagon for the bundles he 'd seen under the seat . He returned , staggering under a seventy-pound bale of long-leaf tobacco , product of Aaron 's father 's farm . He went back for a bolt of scarlet silk for the Sarki 's paramount wife , and strings of candy for the great man 's children . He puffed in with one last brown-wrapped parcel , which he unpacked to display a leather saddle . This confection was embossed with a hundred intricate designs , rich with silver ; un-Amish as a Christmas tree . Judging from the Sarki 's dazzled thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as Kazunzumi had delivered his pyrotechnic speech of thanks , and had directed that Aaron 's gifts be placed on a velvet-draped dais at the end of the room , a roast kid was brought in . Waziri , half drunk with the elegance of it all , fell to like any other adolescent boy , and was soon grease to the armpits . Aaron , more careful , referred his actions to the Sarki 's . The bread must be broken , not cut ; and it was eaten with the right hand only , the left lying in the lap as though broken . Belching seemed to be de rigueur as a tribute to the cuisine , so Aaron belched his stomach flat . Business could now be discussed . Aaron , having no pencil , traced with a greasy finger on the tile floor the outlines of the barn and farmhouse he envisaged . The Sarki from time to time demanded of young Waziri such facts as a carpenter 's son might be expected to know , and added lumber-prices in his head as Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally he told the Amishman what the two buildings would cost . Better pleased by this figure than he 'd expected to be , Aaron initiated the long-drawn ceremony required to discharge himself from Kazunzumi 's hospitality . Illustration As the Stoltzfoos wagon jolted out the gate of Datura , bearing the cot and clothes trunk of Waziri together with the owner of those chattels , the boys who 'd jeered before now stared with respect . The black-hatted Turawa had been to visit the Sarki ; this established him as no safe man to mock . Waziri gave his late playmates no notice beyond sitting rather straighter on the wagon seat than was comfortable . * * * * * There was light enough left when they got back to the farm for Aaron and Waziri to pace out the dimensions of the barn and house . The bank-barn would go up first , of course . No Christian owner of beasts could consent to being well-housed while his animals steamed and shivered in a cloth-sided tent . Waziri pounded stakes into the frozen ground to mark the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to be ditched , and explained how the removed earth would be packed , with the clay dug for the cellar , into a ramp leading to the barn 's second story in the back . Come next fall , the hayladder could be pulled right up that driveway to be unloaded above the stalls . Aaron took the boy to the frozen-solid creek to show him where a wheel could be placed to lift water to a spillway for the upper fields . He introduced his new helper to Wutzchen , and was pleased to hear Waziri speak wistfully of pork chops . Waziri did n't want to meet Martha yet , though . As a proper Murnan boy , he was not eager to be introduced to the boss ' barefaced wife , though she bribed him with a fat wedge of applecake . When Waziri set out with the lantern to tend to the final outdoor chores , Aaron inquired of his wife 's day . The Sarki 's Paramount Wife , with two servants , had indeed visited , bringing more gifts of food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach the Hausa-Pennsylfawnisch Deitsch curtain . " What in the world did you talk about ? " Aaron asked . " First , not knowing what to say , I showed the ladies a drop of vinegar under the microscope , " Martha said . " They screamed when they saw all the wriggly worms , and I was put to it to keep them from bundling back home . Then we talked about you , Stoltz , and about the farm ; and when would I be giving you Kinner to help with all the work , " she said . Martha fiddled with the cloak she was sewing for her husband . " It was largely their heathen speech we used , so I understood only what they pointed at ; but they ate hearty of anything without vinegar in it , and I laughed with them like with friends at a quilting-bee . My , Stoltz ! Those Nay-yer women are lovely , all jeweled like queens , even the servant girls ; even though they have no proper understanding of Christian behavior . " " Did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ach , ja ! They pitied me , I thought , " Martha said . " They said you must be poor , to have but one wife to comfort you ; but they said that if the crops be good , you can earn a second woman by next winter . Chuudes Paste ! " " I hope you told the Sarki 's woman we 've been married only since haying-time , " Aaron said , " and it 's a bit previous for you to be giving me little farmhands . " " I did that , " Martha said . " I told them , too , that by the time the oak leaves are the size of squirrel 's ears  --  if this place has oaks , indeed , or squirrels  --  we 'd have a youngling squalling in our house , loud as any of the Sarki 's . " Waziri , crouched near the tent to pick up such talk as might pass inside concerning himself , was at first dismayed by Aaron 's whoops of joy . Then Martha joined her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered in Low Dutch , the young Murnan chose to believe that the enthusiastic sounds he heard within the tent reflected joy at his employment . * * * * * It was cold the week the barn was raised , and the mattocks had heavy work gouging out frozen earth to be heaped into the bank leading up the back . The Murnan laborers seemed to think midwinter as appropriate as any other time for building ; they said the Mother slept , and would not be disturbed . Martha served coffee and buttermilk-pop at break-time , and presided over noontime feasts , served in several sittings , in the tent . Before the workers left in the evening , Aaron would give each a drink out back , scharifer cider , feeling that they 'd steamed hard enough to earn a sip of something volatile . There are matters , he mused , in which common sense can blink at a bishop ; as in secretly trimming one 's beard a bit , for example , to keep it out of one 's soup ; or plucking a guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was done , the Stoltzfoos Farm was like nothing seen before on Murna . The bank-barn was forty feet high . On its lee side , Aaron had nailed thin , horizontal strips of wood about a foot apart , hoping to encourage the mud-daubing birds he 'd seen on the wall at Datura to plaster their nests onto his barn , and shop for insects in his fields . Lacking concrete , he 'd constructed a roofless stone hut abutting the barn to serve as his manure shed . The farmhouse itself was a bit gay , having an inside toilet to cheat the Murnan winters and a sunporch for Martha 's bacteriological equipment . As the nearest Amish Volle Diener  --  Congregational Bishop  --  was eighty light-years off , and as the circumstances were unusual , Aaron felt that he and Martha were safe from the shunning  --  Meidung  --  that was the Old Order 's manner of punishing Amischers guilty of " going gay " by breaking the church rules against worldly show . A third outbuilding puzzled the Murnan carpenters even more than the two-storied wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidings that could be propped out to let breezes sweep through the building . Aaron explained to Musa the function of this tobacco shed , where he would hang his lathes of long-leafed tobacco to cure from August through November . The tobacco seedlings were already sprouting in Mason jars on the sunporch window-sills . The bank-barn 's basement was also dedicated to tobacco . Here , in midwinter , Aaron and Martha and Waziri would strip , size , and grade the dry leaves for sale in Datura . Tobacco had always been a prime cash-crop for Levi , Aaron 's father . After testing the bitter native leaf , Aaron knew that his Pennsylvania Type 41 would sell better here than anything else he could grow . Martha Stoltzfoos was as busy in her new farmhouse as Aaron and Waziri were in the barn . Her kitchen stove burned all day . Nothing ever seen in Lancaster County , this stove was built of fireclay and brick ; but the food it heated was honest Deitsch . There were pickled eggs and red beets , ginger tomatoes canned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chowchow , pickled red cabbage , Schnitz un Knepp , shoo-fly pie , vanilla pie , rhubarb sauce , Cheddar cheeses the size of Waziri 's head , haystacks of sauerkraut , slices off the great slab of home-preserved chipped beef , milk by the gallon , stewed chicken , popcorn soup , rashers of bacon , rivers of coffee . In the evenings , protecting her fingers from the sin of idleness , Martha quilted and cross-stitched by lamplight . Already her parlor wall boasted a framed motto that reduced to half a dozen German words , the Amish philosophy of life : " What One Likes Doing is No Work . " For all the chill of the late-winter winds , Aaron kept himself and his young helper in a sweat . Martha 's cooking and the heavy work were slabbing muscle onto Waziri 's lean , brown frame . Aaron 's farming methods , so much different to Murnan routines , puzzled and intrigued the boy . Aaron was equally bemused by the local taboos . Why , for example , did all the politer Murnans eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil themselves in his presence ? And what was this Mother-goddess worship that seemed to require no more of its adherents than the inclusion of their deity 's name in every curse , formal and profane ? " Think what you please , but not too loud , " Aaron cautioned himself , and carefully commenced to copy those Murnan speech-forms , gestures , and attitudes that did not conflict with his own deep convictions . But the soil was his employment , not socializing . Aaron wormed his swine , inspected his horse-powered plow and harrow , gazed at the sun , palpated the soil , and prayed for an early spring to a God who understood German . Each day , to keep mold from strangling the moist morsels , he shook the jars of tobacco seed , whose hair-fine sprouts were just splitting the hulls . The rations packaged in Pennsylvania were shrinking . The Stoltzfoos stake of silver and gold cowries was wasting away . Each night , bruised with fatigue , Aaron brought his little household into the parlor while he read from the Book that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honoring his master 's God in his master 's manner , but understood nothing of the hard High German : " For the Lord God will help me : therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a flint , and I know I shall not be ashamed . Awmen . " " Awmen , " said Martha . " Awmen , " said Waziri , fisting his hand in respect to his friend 's bearded God . * * * * * The Murnan neighbors , to whom late winter was the slackest season in the farm-year , visited often to observe and comment on the off-worlder 's work . Aaron Stoltzfoos privately regarded the endless conversations as too much of a good thing ; but he realized that his answering the Murnan 's questions helped work off the obligation he owed the government for the eighty light-years ' transportation it had given him , the opportunity he 'd been given to earn this hundred acres with five years ' work , and the interest-free loans that had put up his barn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant , the neighbors would stuff their pipes with native tobacco , a leaf that would have gagged one of Sir Walter Raleigh 's Indian friends , while the Amishman lit a stogie in self-defense . Why , the neighbor farmers demanded , did Aaron propose to dust his bean-seeds with a powder that looked like soot ? Martha 's microscope , a wonder , introduced the Murnans to bacteria ; and Aaron tediously translated his knowledge of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotes into Hausa . But there were other questions . What was the purpose of the brush stacked on top of the smooth-raked beds where Aaron proposed to plant his tobacco-seedlings ? He explained that fire , second best to steaming , would kill the weed-seeds in the soil , and give the tobacco uncrowded beds to prosper in . Those needles with which he punctured the flanks of his swine and cattle : what devils did they exorcise ? Back to the microscope for an explanation of the disease-process , a sophistication the Murnans had lost in the years since they 'd left Kano . What were the bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the various precincts of his property ? Why did those slips oftentime change color , from blue to pink , or pink-to-blue ? What was in those sacks of stuff  --  no dung of animals , but a sort of flour  --  that he intended to work into his soil ? Aaron answered each question as best he could , Waziri supplying  --  and often inventing  --  Hausa words for concepts like phosphorous , ascarid worms , and litmus . Aaron had as much to learn from his brown-skinned neighbors as he had to teach them . He was persuaded to lay in a supply of seed-yams , guaranteeing a crop that would bring bronze cowries next fall in Datura , the price of next year 's oil and cloth and tools . The peanut , a legume Aaron had no experience of beyond purchasing an occasional tooth-ful at the grocery-store , won half a dozen acres from Korean lespedeza , the crop he 'd at first selected as his soil-improver there . He got acquainted with a plant no Amishman before him had ever sown , a crabgrass called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murna , imported with the first Nigerian colonists . Aaron refused to plant any lalle , the henna-shrub from which the Murnans made the dye to stain their women 's hands , feeling that it would be improper for him to contribute to such a vanity . Bulrush millet , another native crop , was ill suited to Aaron 's well-drained fields . He planned to grow corn , though , the stuff his people called Welschkarn  --  alien corn . Though American enough , maize had been a foreigner to the first Amish farmers , and still carried history in its name . This crop was chiefly for Wutzchen , whose bloodlines , Aaron was confident , would lead to a crop of pork of a quality these heretics from Islam had never tasted before . * * * * * Work was n't everything . One Sunday , after he and Martha had sung together from the Ausbund , and Aaron had read from the Schrift and the Martyr 's Mirror , there was time to play . Sarki Kazunzumi and several other gentlemen who enjoyed City Hall or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stoltzfooses after lunch ; as had Musa the carpenter and his older son , Dauda , Waziri 's brother . Also on the premises were about a dozen of the local farmers and craftsmen , inspecting the curious architecture the off-worlder had introduced to their planet . Aaron , observing that the two classes of his guests were maintaining a polite fiction , each that the other was not present , had an idea . He 'd seen Murnans in town at the midwinter festival , their status-consciousness forgotten in mutual quaffs of fonio-beer or barley-brandy , betting together at horse-races and wheels-of-fortune . " My friends , " the Amishman addressed the Murnans gathered in his barn , inspecting Wutzchen , " let 's play a game of ball . " Kazunzumi looked interested . As the local Chief of State , the Sarki 's approval guaranteed the enthusiasm of all the lesser ranks . Aaron explained the game he had in mind . It was n't baseball , an " English " sport foreign to Amishmen , who can get through their teens without having heard of either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mosch Balle , fits a barnyard better . In lieu of the regulation softball used in the game of Corner Ball , Martha had stitched together a sort of large beanbag . The playing-field Aaron set up with the help of his visitors was a square some twelve yards on a side , fence-rails being propped up to mark its boundaries and fresh straw forked onto it six inches deep as footing . Aaron 's eight-man team was chosen from the working-stiffs . The opposing eight were the Brass . To start the game , four of the proletarians stood at the corners of the square ; and two men of Kazunzumi 's team waited warily within . Aaron commenced to explain the game . To say that the object of Mosch Balle is for a member of the outer , offensive , team to strike an inner , defensive man with the ball is inadequate ; such an explanation is as lacking as to explain baseball as the pitcher 's effort to throw a ball so well that it 's hittable , and so very well that it yet goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , " Aaron told his guests on the field , " we four on the corners will toss the ball back and forth amongst ourselves , shouting Hah , Oh , Tay , with each pitch . Whoever has the ball on Tay has to fling it at one of the two men inside the square . If he misses , he 's Out ; and one of the other men on our team takes his place . If he hits his target-man , the target 's Out , and will be replaced by another man from the Sarki 's team . The team with the last man left on the straw wins the first half . Des iss der Weeg wie mir 's diehne , O.K. ? " " Afuwo ! " the Sarki yelled , a woman 's call , grinning , crouched to spring aside . " Hah ! " Aaron shouted , and tossed the ball to Waziri 's older brother , Dauda . " Oh ! " Dauda yelled , and threw the ball to the shoemaker . " Tay ! " the cobbler exulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men within the square , the village banker . The shoemaker missed , and was retired . The Daturans were soon stripped down to trousers and boots , their black torsos steaming in the cold air . Aaron removed his shirt  --  but not his hat  --  and so far forgot his Hausa in the excitement that he not only rooted for his teammates in Pennsylfawnisch Deitsch , but even punctuated several clumsy plays with raw Fadomm 's . Aaron 's skill won the first half for his team . Blooded , the Chamber of Commerce Eight fought through to win the second half . A tie . The play-off saw the Working-Man 's League pummeled to a standstill by the C-of-C , who took the laurels with a final slam that knocked Waziri into the straw , protesting that it was an accident . Sweating , laughing , social status for the moment forgotten , the teams and their mobs of fans surged into the farmhouse to demand of Martha wedges of raisin pie and big cups of strong coffee . As the guests put their rigas and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank of class , they assured Aaron that the afternoon at the ball game had been a large success . * * * * * The next day was crisp and cold . With nothing more to be done till the soil thawed , Aaron took Waziri down to the creek to investigate his project of irrigating the hilltop acres . The flow of water was so feeble that the little stream was ice to its channel . " Do you have hereabouts a digger-of-waterholes ? " Aaron asked the boy . Waziri nodded , and supplied the Hausa phrase for this skill . " Good . Wonn 's Gottes wille iss , I will find a spot for them to dig , smelling out the water as can my cousin Blue Ball Benjamin Blank , " Aaron said . " Go get from the barn the pliers , the hand-tool that pinches . " Waziri trotted off and brought back the pliers . " What are you up to , Haruna-boss ? " he asked . Aaron was holding the bulldog pliers out before him , one handle in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelling for the well-place , " the Amishman said , pacing deliberately across the field . The boy scampered along beside him . " We will need at least one well to be safe from August draught . Cousin Benjamin found the wet depths in this fashion ; perhaps it will work for me . " Aaron walked , arms outstretched , for half an hour before his face grew taut . He slowed his walking and began to work toward the center of a spiral . Waziri could see the sweat springing up on the young farmer 's brow and fingers , despite the cold breeze that blew . The bulldog pliers trembled as though responding to the throbbing of an engine . Suddenly , as though about to be jerked from Aaron 's hands , the pliers tugged downward so forceably that he had to lift his elbows and flex his wrists to hold onto them . " Put a little pile of stones here , Waziri , " he said . " We 'll have the diggers visit as soon as the ground thaws . " Illustration Waziri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch soft earth until the first grass sprouts , " he said . " Time enough , " Aaron said . He looked up to satisfy himself that his prospective well-site was high enough to avoid drainage from his pig-yard , then left the Murnan boy to pile up a cairn for the diggers . It would be good to have a windmill within ear-shot of the house , he mused ; its squeaking would ease Martha with a homey sound . Illustration Alone for a few minutes , Aaron retired to the workshop in the cellar of the barn . He planed and sanded boards of a native lumber very like to tulipwood . Into the headboard of the cradle he was making , he keyhole-sawed the same sort of broad Dutch heart that had marked his own cradle , and the cradles of all his family back to the days in the Rhineland , before they 'd been driven to America . Martha Stoltzfoos was speaking Hausa better than she 'd spoken English since grade-school days , and she kept busy in the little bacteriological laboratory on her sunporch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and might some day need in earnest ; but she still grew homesick as her child-coming day drew nearer . It was wrong , she told Aaron , for an Amishwoman to have heathen midwives at her lying-in . For all their kindness , the Murnan women could never be as reassuring as the prayer-covered , black-aproned matrons who 'd have attended Martha back home . " Ach , Stoltz , " she told her husband , " if only a few other of unser sart Leit could have come here with us . " " Do n't worry , Love , " Aaron said . " I 've eased calves and colts enough into the world ; man-children ca n't come so different . " " You talk like a man , " Martha accused him . " I wish my Mem was just down the road a piece , ready to come a-running when my time came , " she said . She put one hand on her apron . " Chuudes Paste ! The little rascal is wild as a colt , indeed . Feel him , Stoltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's quickening . " He 'll be of help on the farm , so strong as he is , " he remarked . Then , tugging his hat down tight , Aaron went outdoors , bashful before this mystery . The little creek had thawed , and the light of the sun on a man 's face almost gave back the heat the air extorted . Waziri had gone to town today for some sort of Murnan spring-festival , eager to celebrate his hard-earned wealth on his first day off in months . The place seemed deserted , Aaron felt , without the boy ; without the visitors he 'd played ball and talked crops with , striding up in their scarlet-trimmed rigas to gossip with their friend Haruna . Between the roadway and the house , Aaron knelt to rake up with his fingers a handful of the new-thawed soil . He squeezed it . The clod in his hand broke apart of its own weight : it was not too wet to work . Festival-day though it was to his Schwotzer neighbors , he was eager to spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the barn . He hitched Rosina  --  the dappled mare , named " Raisin " for her spots  --  to the plow and slapped her into motion . Sleek with her winter 's idleness , Rosina was at first unenthusiastic about the plow ; but the spring sun and honest exercise warmed her quickly . Within half an hour she was earning her keep . Though Aaron was plowing shallow , the compact soil broke hard . Rosina leaned into the traces , leaving hoofprints three inches deep . No gasoline tractor , Aaron mused , could ever pull itself through soil so rich and damp . Geilsgrefte , horsepower , was best exerted by a horse , he thought . The brown earth-smells were good . Aaron kicked apart the larger clods , fat with a planet-life of weather and rich decay . This land would take a good deal of disking to get it into shape . His neighbors , who 'd done their heavy plowing just after last fall 's first frost , were already well ahead of him . He stabled Rosina at sundown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cider past Martha 's teetotaling eye . * * * * * Musa the carpenter brought his son home well after dark . Waziri had had adventures , the old man said ; dancing , gambling on the Fool 's Wheel , sampling fonio-beer , celebrating his own young life 's springtime with the earth 's . Both the old man and the boy were barefoot , Aaron noticed ; but said nothing : perhaps shoelessness was part of their spring-festival . Waziri a bit geschwepst with the beer , tottered off to bed . " Thanks to you , friend Haruna , that boy became a man today , " the carpenter said . He accepted a glass of Aaron 's cider . " Today Waziri 's wallet jingled with bronze and copper earned by his own sweat , a manful sound to a lad of fifteen summers . I ask pardon for having returned your laborer in so damaged a condition , brother Haruna ; but you may be consoled with the thought that the Mother 's festival comes but once in the twelve-month . " " No harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering his visitor tobacco . " In my own youth , I sometimes danced with beer-light feet to the music of worldly guitars ; and yet I reached a man 's estate . " Offered a refill for his pipe , Musa raised a hand in polite refusal . " Tomorrow 's sun will not wait on our conversation , and much must be done , in the manner of racers waiting the signal , before the first blade breaks the soil , " he said . " Good night , brother Haruna ; and may Mother grant you light ! " " Mother keep you , brother Musa , " Aaron murmured the heathen phrase without embarrassment . " I 'll guide your feet to your wagon , if I may . " Aaron , carrying the naphtha lantern , led the way across the strip of new-plowed soil . Set by frost into plastic mounds and ridges , the earth bent beneath his shoes and the carpenter 's bare feet . Aaron swung Musa 's picket-iron , the little anchor to which his horse was tethered , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of quilted cloth . " May you journey home in good health , brother Musa , " he said . " Uwaka ! " Musa shouted , staring at the plow-cuts . Aaron Stoltzfoos dropped the lantern to his side , amazed that the dignified old man could be guilty of such an obscenity . Perhaps he 'd misheard . " Haruna , you have damned yourself ! " Musa bellowed . " Cursed be this farm ! Cursed be thy farming ! May thy seedlings rot , may thy corn sprout worms for tassles , may your cattle stink and make early bones ! " " Brother Musa ! " Aaron said . " I am no sib to you , O Bearded One , " Musa said . " Nor will I help you carry the curse you have brought upon yourself by today 's ill-doing . " He darted back to the farmhouse , where he ordered half-wakened Waziri to pad barefoot after him to the wagon , rubbing his eyes . " Come , son , " Musa said . " We must flee these ill-omened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpenter hoisted his boy into the wagon , mounted , and set off into the night . The hoofs of his horse padded softly against the dirt road , unshod . Martha met the bewildered Aaron at the door , wakened by Musa 's shouting . " Wass gibt , Stoltz ? " she asked . " What for was all the carry-on ? " Aaron tugged at his beard . " I do n't know , woman , " he admitted . " Musa the carpenter took one look at the plowing I did today , then cursed me as though he 'd caught me spitting in his well . He got Waziri up from bed and took him home . " He took his wife 's hand . " I 'm sorry he woke you up , Liebchen . " " It was not so much the angry carpenter who waked me as the little jack rabbit you 're father to , " Martha said . " As you say , a Bun who can kick so hard , and barefoot , too , will be a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window onto the dark road . " Farwas hot Musa sell gehuh ? " he asked himself . " What for did Musa do such a thing ? He knows that our ways are different to his . If I did aught wrong , Musa must know it was done not for want to harm . I will go to the village tomorrow ; Musa must forgive me and explain . " " He will , Stoltz . " Martha said . " Kuum , schloef . You 'll be getting up early . " " How can I sleep , not knowing how I have hurt my friend ? " Aaron asked . " You must , " Martha urged him . " Let your cares rest for the night , Aaron . " In the morning , Stoltzfoos prepared for his trip into Datura by donning his Sunday-best . He clipped a black patent-leather bow tie , a wedding gift , onto his white shirt : and fastened up his best broadfall trousers with his dress suspenders . Over this , Aaron put his Mutzi , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd exchanged his broad-brimmed black felt working-hat for another just the same , but unsweated , Aaron was dressed as he 'd be on his way to a House-Amish Sunday meeting back home . " I expect no trouble here , Martha , " he said , tucking a box of stogies under his arm as a little guest-gift for the old carpenter . " Hurry home , Stoltz ; I feel wonderful busy about the middle , " Martha said . There was a noise out on the road . " Listen ! " she said . " Go look the window out , now ; someone is coming the yard in ! " Aaron hastened to lift the green roller-blind over the parlor window . " Ach ; it is the groesie Fisch , Sarki Kazunzumi , with half the folk from town , " he said . " Stay here , woman . I will out and talk with them . " The Sarki sat astride his white pony , staring as Aaron approached him . Behind their chief , on lesser beasts , sat Kazunzumi 's retainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welcome , O Sarki ! " Aaron said , raising his fist . Kazunzumi did not return the Amishman 's salute . " I return your gifts , Lightless One , " he announced . " They are tainted with your blasphemy . " He nodded , and his servants dismounted to stack at the side of the road Aaron 's guest-gifts of months before . The bale of tobacco was set down , the bolt of scarlet silk , the chains of candy , the silver-filigreed saddle . " Now that I owe you naught , Bearded One , we have no further business with one another . " He reined his horse around . " I go in sadness , Haruna , " he said . " What did I do , Kazunzumi ? " Aaron asked . " What am I to make of your displeasure ? " " You have failed us , who was my friend , " the Sarki said . " You will leave this place , taking your woman and your beasts and your sharp-shod horses . " " Sir , where am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haruna ? " the Sarki asked . " Return to your own black-garbed folk , and injure the Mother no longer with your lack of understanding . " " Sarki Kazunzumi , I know not how I erred , " Stoltzfoos said . " As for returning to my own country , that I can not . The off-world vessel that brought us here is star-far away ; and it will not return until we are all five summers older . My Martha is besides with child , and can not safely travel . My land is ripe for seeding . How can I go now ? " " There is wilderness to the south , where no son of the Mother lives , " the Sarki said . " Go there . I care not for heathen who are out of my sight . " " Sir , show us mercy , " Aaron said . Kazunzumi danced his shoeless horse around to face Aaron . " Haruna , who was my friend , whom I thought to stand with me in Mother 's light , I would be merciful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me whom you must beseech , but the Mother who feeds us all . Make amends to Her , then Sarki Kazunzumi will give his ear to your pleas . Without amends , Haruna , you must go from here within the week . " Kazunzumi waved his arm and galloped off toward Datura . His servants followed quickly . On the roadside lay the gifts , dusted from the dirt raised by the horses . * * * * * The Amishman turned toward the house . Martha 's face was at the parlor window , quizzical under her prayer-covering , impatient to hear what had happened . Aaron plodded back to the house with the evil news , stumbling over a clod of earth in the new-turned furrows near the road . Martha met him at the door . " Waas will er ? " she demanded . " He says we must leave our farm . " " Why for ? " she asked . " Somehow , I have offended their fadommt Mum-god , " Aaron said . " The Sarki has granted us a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat on a coffee-colored kitchen chair , his head bowed and his big hands limp between his knees . " Stoltz , where can we go ? " Martha asked . " We have no Freindschaft , no kin , in all this place . " Aaron tightened his hands into fists . " We will not go ! " he vowed . " I will find a way for us to stay . " He broke open the box of cigars that had been meant as a gift for Musa and clamped one of the black stogies between his teeth . " What is their heidisch secret ? " he demanded . " What does the Mother want of me ? " " Aaron Stoltz , " Martha said vigorously , " I 'll have no man of mine offering dignity to a heathen god .

Will you make a golden calf here , as did your namesake Aaron of Egypt , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Woman , I 'll not have you preach to me like a servant of the Book , " Aaron said .

She dabbed a finger at her eye . " Fagep mir , Liebling , " Aaron said . He walked behind the chair where his wife sat . Tenderly , he kneaded the muscles at the back of her neck . " I am trying to get inside Musa 's head , and Kazunzumi 's ; I am trying to see their world through their eyes . It is not an easy thing to do , Martha . Though I lived for a spell among the ' English , ' my head is still House-Amish ; a fat , Dutch cheese . " " It is a good head , " Martha said , relaxing under his massage , " and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear them , and not my man . " " If I knew what the die-hinker our neighbors mean by their Mother-talk , it might be I could see myself through Murnan eyes , as I can hear a bit with Hausa ears , " Aaron said . " Iss sell nix so , Martha ? " " We should have stood at home , and thought with our own good heads , " she said . " Let me think , " Aaron said . " If I were to strike you , wife , " he mused , " it could do you great hurt , and harm our unborn child , Nee ? " " Aaron ! " Martha scooted out from under her husbands kneading hands . " Druuvel dich net ! " he said . " I am only thinking . These blackfolk now , these neighbors who were before last night our friends , speak of Light as our bishop at home speaks of Grace . To have it is to have all , to be one with the congregation . If I can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can again be friends . " Aaron sat down . " I must learn what I have done wrong , " he said . * * * * * " Other than drink a glass of cider now and then , and make worldly music with a guitar , you 've done no wrong , " Martha said stubbornly . " You 're a good man . " " In the Old Order , I am a good man , so long as no Diener makes trouble over a bit of singing or cider , " Aaron said . " As a guest on Murna , I have done some deed that has hurt this Mother-god , whom our neighbors hold dear . " " Heathenish superstition ! " " Martha , love , I am older than you , and a man , " Aaron said . " Give me room to think ! If the goddess-Mother is heathen as Baal , it matters not ; these folk who worship her hold our future in their hands . Besides , we owe them the courtesy not to dance in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' English ' have more grace than that . " Aaron pondered . " Something in the springtime is the Murnan Mother 's gift , her greatest gift . What ? " " Blaspheme not , " Martha said . " Remember Him who causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth . " " Wife , is the True God less , if these people call Him Mother ? " Aaron demanded . " We are too far from home , " the woman sighed . " Such heavy talk is wearisome ; it is for bishops to discourse so , not ordinary folk like us . " " If I ca n't find the light , " Aaron said , " this farm we live on , and hoped to leave to our children , is n't worth the water in a dish of soup . " He slapped his hands together and stood to pace . " Martha , hear me out , " he said . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with lust and against her will , is not that man accursed ? " " Aaron ! " she said . " Haagott , such wicked talk you make ! " " Seen with Murnan eyes , have I not done just such a cursed thing ? " Aaron demanded . " The Mother-god of this world is mit Kinndt , fat with the bounty of springtime . So tender is the swollen belly of the earth that the people here , simple folk with no more subtle God , strip the iron from the hoofs of their horses not to bruise her . They bare their feet in her honor , treat her with the tenderness I treat my beloved Martha . And to this Goddess , swollen earth , I took the plow ! Martha , we are fortunate indeed that our neighbors are gentle people , or I would be hanged now , or stoned to death like the wicked in the old days . Ich hot iere Gotterin awgepockt : I raped their Goddess ! " * * * * * Martha burst into tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest with her balled fists . " Stoltz , I wed you despite your beer-drinking from cans at the Singing , though you play a worldly guitar and sing the English songs , though people told me you drove your gay Uncle Amos ' black-bumpered Ford before you membered to the district ; still , house-Amish pure Old Order though my people are , I married you , from love and youngness and girlish ignorance . But I do not care , even in this wilderness you 've brought us to in that big English ship , to hear such vileness spoke out boldly . Leave me alone . " " I 'll not . " " You 'd best , " she said . " I 'm sore offended in the lad I 'm wifed to . " " Love , Ich bin sorry , " Aaron said . " The Book , though , says just what our neighbors told me : Ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall set you free . I have found the truth , the truth of our dark-skinned friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ da Oppel fuun mein Awk , apple-of-mine-eye sweet Martha ; but I must speak out the truth . " " It is not good enough , " Martha sobbed , " that you accept this brown-skinned , jewel-bedizzened woman-god ; but you must make love to her ; and I , wed to you by the Book , nine months gone with Kinndt , am to make no fuss . " " I loved the Mother-god with the plow , and accidentally , " Aaron bellowed . " Haagott ! woman ; have you no funny ? " " I will birth our child in my lap from laughing , " Martha said , weeping . " Aaron , do what you will . I can hardly walk home to my Mem to bear a son in my girlhood bedroom . We are like Awduum uuu Ayf , like you said ; but the serpent in this Eden pleases me not . " " When I spoke of colts , and the borning of them , " Aaron said , " I forgot me that mares are more sensible than human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man when you married me . All your vapors are naught against my having seen the light . If to stay here , on this land already watered with my hard sweat , I had to slaughter cattle in sacrifice to the Mother , I 'd pick up the knife gladly , and feel it no blasphemy against our God . " " Aaron Stoltz , " Martha said , " I forbid you to lend honor to this god ! " Aaron sat . He unlaced his shoes and tugged them off . " Woman , " he asked softly , " you forbid me ? Martha , for all the love I bear you , there is one rule of our folk that 's as holy as worship ; and that 's that the man is master in his house . " He pulled off his black stockings and stood , barefoot , with callouses won on the black earth of his father 's farm ; dressed otherwise meetly as a deacon . " I will walk to Datura on my naked feet to show our friends I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pregnant earth . I will tell Sarki Kazunzumi that I have seen his light ; that my horses will be unshod as I am , that the Mother will not feel my plow again until the grasses spring , when her time will be accomplished . " Martha crossed her hands about her middle . " Ach , Stoltz , " she said . " Our Buu iss reddi far geh , I think . Today will be his birthday . Do n't let your tenderness to the earth keep you from walking swiftly to Datura ; and when you return , come in a wagon with the Sarki 's ladies , who understand midwifery . I think they will find work here . " " I will hurry , Mother , " Aaron promised . The End .
