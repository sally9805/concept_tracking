txt A conflict between Governor Rockefeller and Senate Majority Leader Walter J. Mahoney deepened today as Senator Mahoney won unanimous endorsement from Republican Senators for a special session of the Legislature to act on reapportionment this year . Mr. Rockefeller has said the Legislature should wait until a pending court case on reapportionment is settled . The endorsement was given at a Senate Republican conference ' called to discuss issues that may arise in the regular session next January . The conference also approved steps taken by Mr. Mahoney and Assembly Speaker Joseph F. Carl:no for a review of the Legislature 's code of ethics . Recommendations Sought Republican legislative leaders have asked S. Stanley Kreutzer , special counsel to the Assembly Ethics Committee , to draw up recommendations for4 more stringent code . The final draft , however , will be made by the G. 0 . P. leaders , since Mr. Kreutzer , as an employe of the committee , can only recommend changes . Mr. Mahoney reported after the closed meeting that there appeared to be no great sentiment among the Senators for a tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

The case is scheduled ' to be argued this fall before the United States Supreme Court . Senator Mahoney said he did not expect a. decision before March , which would be too late to revise legislative districts in time for the 1964 election .

Primary is a Factor Mr , Rockefeller , facing his most difficult budget-balancing problem since he took office , will want to avoid any conflict with the Republican legislative majority at the regular session , which convenes Jan. 8 , because the session will coincide with his campaigning for the New Hampshire Presidential primary , which will be held March 10 . A revolt by the Republicans , such as occurred last winter over his proposals to raise fees , could interfere with his New Hampshire campaign , The reapportionment resolution approved today did not specifically mention a special session , but Senator Mahoney said that that was what it meant . It " urged that a reapportionment law be enacted at the earliest possible time so that the population changes of the past decade may be recognized at the 1964 elections .

Because of population shifts from the city to the suburbs shown by the 1960 Federal Census , the Democrats stand to lose four Senate seats and possibly nine Assembly seats .

The political division in the Senate is now 33 Republicans to 25 Democrats , For the Assembly , Manhattan would lose four seats , Brooklyn three , and the Bronx two under the 1960 Census . Four of these would go to Nassau , two to Suffolk and one each to Dutehess , Monroe , and Onondaga Counties . The Assembly now has 85 Republicans and 65 Democrats .
