The spectacle that unfolded last week on the steps of a courthouse on Mos cow 's Chernyshevsky Street is by now a familiar one in Russia . A crowd of friends and supporters of the accused had come , laden with bouquets of red tu lips and yellow daffodils . Forbidden to attend the closed trial , they huddled in the freezing cold , waiting for a chance to express their sympathy with the lat est victim of the government 's crack down on dissenters . This time the pris oner was a pretty 30-year-old blonde , Irina Belogorodskaya , whose crime consisted of having left her handbag , containing copies of a protest against the ar rest of a political dissident , in a taxi . The charge : " Preparing and distributing false fabrication defaming the Soviet state and social structure . " It took the court only five hours to find her guilty and sen tence her to one year in a labor camp . <P> As she exited from the courtroom in a rain of spring flowers , the crowd shouted , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KGB guard stomped on a bou quet , a girl friend of Irina 's grabbed it and struck the secret policeman on the head with the flowers . After a scuffle , Irina was spirited off to prison in a truck that looked like a bread-delivery wagon . Russian spectators recalled a sim ilar scene in the last chapter of Al exander Solzhenitsyn 's novel The First Circle , when the hero , Gleb Nerzhin , is carried off to a Stalinist concentration camp in a gay orange and blue van marked " Meat . " <P> Irina 's trial was only the latest reminder of the Stalin era . The many hundreds of arrests of dissident intellectuals during the past four years have coincided with an official campaign to rehabilitate Stalin 's wartime image . As the experienced reader of the Soviet press knows , every favorable mention of Stalin heralds some return to Stalinist methods by the authorities , including intimidation , denunciations , arrests and political show trials . <P> The victims are most often young people like Irina Belogorodskaya , whose life story perfectly embodies the generational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tried for possession of documents that quoted a political prisoner as saying that " present conditions in Soviet concentration camps are just as terrible as under Stalin . " Among the few spectators allowed to attend her trial was a high-ranking officer of the organization that , among its other grim tasks , ran those camps for over 40 years . He was Colonel Mikhail Belogorodsky of the KGB , Irina 's father .
