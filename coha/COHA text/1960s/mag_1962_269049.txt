Twice each week , armed guards escort Pastor William Lovell Hull of Jerusalem 's nondenominational Zion Christian Mission into the maximum security cellblock of Israel 's Ramla prison . As he enters , a sallow , thin-faced prisoner behind a thick glass partition snaps to his feet , bows and clicks his heels . Then the two men sit down , take up the earphones and microphones through which they communicate and open their Bibles . Pastor Hull then begins another session of trying to bring Adolf Eichmann back to the Christian faith he left in 1937 . <P> With the approval of the Israeli government and the wary cooperation of the prisoner , Evangelical Preacher Hull has been Eichmann 's spiritual adviser since his conviction . Hull and his wife , who serves as German-English interpreter , are the only strangers Eichmann is allowed to see , and they hope to convert him before the Israel Supreme Court rules , probably next month , on his appeal of his death sentence . <P> Hull at first coldly visualized Eichmann " with a rope around his neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight feeling of compassion , " the preacher still feels that Eichmann had a fair trial and ought to hang for his crimes . " I 'm not interested in his body , " he says . " But I am interested in his soul . He should be given a chance to save it . As Christians , we are obliged to offer him that much . " <P> " Jewish Fables . " Canadian-born Evangelist Hull , 62 , seems oddly matched to his spiritual charge . A former Winnipeg salesman on the Manitoba grain exchange , Hull received " a very real personal call from God to move to Jerusalem " while attending services one night at Winnipeg 's Zion Apostolic Church . He settled down in Palestine in 1935 , following his ordination to the ministry . A strong believer in Israeli independence , Hull has long enjoyed the favor of Israel 's government , and after Eichmann 's conviction Hull offered his services as a spiritual counselor . Eichmann , who had been brought up in Austria 's Evangelical Church , refused at first , agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now seems to welcome Hull 's visits . <P> To bring Eichmann to the point where " God can reach his heart , " Hull has tried to make Eichmann see that God 's judgment of his soul is more important than the Israeli court 's judgment of his body . At their first conference last month , Hull asked Eichmann to turn in his Bible to a text in Ecclesiastes . Eichmann hesitated . " Is n't that in the Old Testament ? " he asked . When Hull said it was , Eichmann answered : " I wo n't read it . I do n't believe in Jewish stories and fables . " Patiently , Hull explained : " I 've laid out a plan of study for you to consider that your soul might be saved , and if you do n't follow the plan I ca n't help you . The Bible is one book . Both Old and New Testaments were written by Jews , and our early church was composed of Jews . " Eichmann thought for a moment , then turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
