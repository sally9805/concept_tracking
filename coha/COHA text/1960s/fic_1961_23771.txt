THE WELL A Story by Hugh Nissenson Drawings by Harvey Dinnerstein S U N D AY . It 's ten-year-old Micah , Aviva 's kid , waiting in front of the dining-hall just before lunch , who brings us the news : One of the Bedouin camels from Ahmad 's camp two kilometers south of the kibbutz has strayed into our date grove to give birth . " Come and ( heel Come and thee ! " Micah cries . Bucktoothed , and with ugly brick-red hair like his mother , he speaks with a lisp , spraying a fine mist of spit into the air that gives me the fantastic notion that he has somehow boiled over from the heat . " Juth for a minute , " he insists . Grossman the mechanic is with me , pale and drawn from his morning 's work in the machine shop and his attack of shil-shul , the chronic dysentery from which he has suffered the last two days . " Pleath , " the boy pleads , but bathed in sweat , and absent-mindedly chewing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shake of his head , and goes inside , slamming the screen door behind him , and stirring up the flies . The boy takes hold of my hand . " It 'll only take a minute . " " Where 's your mother ? " A hubbub around us , as more and more of the chaverim  --  the comrades , members of the collective settlement  --  arrive at the dining-hall from the work shops and the fields . They arc in much the same state as Grossman and myself , and do not care who knows it sullen , completely exhausted by the heat , and oppressed by the prospect of a meager meal and an afternoon 's work still to be done . " Oh pleath . Pleath , " the boy begs , with the rising inflection , the sad whine of the ugly child who has already learned that he can not command attention any other way . " You do n't under-thand . " " Maybe after lunch . " " But that 'll be too late . Hc'th going to kill it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry ! " It 's too much of an effort for me to argue try to understand , and he knows it . Hand mine , he leads me away , past the deserted machine shop and the cow shed where , attracted by the feed , literally hundreds of twittering sparrows are perched on the corrugated tin roof  --  the only life , it seems , besides ourselves , abroad on the desert at this hour of the day . Just noon . At the date grove , row on row of the broad dusty leaves cast no shadow , offer no refuge from the terrific glare of the sun . " Look ! " says the boy . " Where ? " I shield my eyes with my hand , and there , in the direction that he points , just beyond the line of trees to the south , is the camel with her colt 85 that could n't have been born more than an hour before . Beside them , on the ground and swarming with flies , is the bloody sac . A wonderful sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet with only a rudimentary hump , all knees and huge splayed toes , jerks its head convulsively as it sucks at the pendulous swollen udders of the mare . " Promith mel " " What ? " You wo n't let him kill it , will you ? " " Who , Micah , what are you talking about ? " This time , he only has to turn his head . To my left , not ten feet away , and apparently watching us all the while , is a young Bedouin with a rifle , squatting on his hams against one of the trees . " Shalom . " " And peace ; peace unto you , " he replies , speaking Hebrew with a thick Arabic accent . Under the kafiyah that shadows his eyes , a rather handsome , intelligent face ; high cheekbones , a hooked nose , and a thick black mustache that droops down to the corners of his mouth . " Ask him yourself . He says he'th going to kill it . Why ? " says the boy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate  --  what ? In the torpor engendered by the heat , it takes me a moment to understand fully . 1 too , as though compelled , look up at the cloudless sky from which the sun has bleached all the color , leaving a white , translucent haze that dazzles the eyes . " Tell me why ! " It 's the drought , of course . I try to explain to the boy . Now the middle of November , what little autumnal rains the Bedouins depend on to water their herds is more than six weeks overdue . " But what about their well ? " " Ah , now that 's just the trouble . Their well has all gone dry . The colt has to be killed so that their children will have the milk to drink . You would n't want the children to die of thirst , would you ? " " I do n't care . " " Micah ! " " Is our well dry too ? " " Not yet ; no . " " Why not ? " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for more than a year in Israel after college , some of the time on kibbutzim in the Negev and on the Syrian border . He has written screen plays , and his stories have appeared in " Harper 's , " " Commentary , " and other magazines . " It 's deeper . " While we have been talking , the Bedouin has opened the bolt of his rifle  --  an old Lee Enfield .303 , and inserted a cartridge with a click that rivets our attention to the oiled barrel gleaming in the sun . When he stands up in his soiled , billowing pantaloons , the boy can not suppress a shout that makes the mare swivel her head in our direction . She apparently has just become aware of us , and with a kind of comical , bewildered ferocity , lets hang her protruding under-lip , and bares her teeth . The startled colt has stopped sucking , and skitters backwards , with its shaky forelegs locked together , and the back spread awkwardly apart . For the first time , I catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly like a dead vine . " Chaver ! ... But comrade , " the boy shouts , " Micah , come here . Come away . " " Comrade , do n't . " " Come away , I tell you . It 's none of our business . " You promithed . " " No . There 's nothing I can do . " I catch him by the hand and drag him away . At the cowshed , the echoing crack of the shot rouses the sparrows who rise in a dark , twittering mass , circle the silo twice , and begin once again to settle on the sloping tin roof . G ROSSMAN is still in the dining-hall when I get back , sitting alone at a corner table . " Where 's the kid ? " he asks . " I left him at the nursery . " " Aviva was looking for him . " " I know . I saw her . How 's the stomach ? " " Okay . " " Really better ? " Obviously forcing himself to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat 's cheese and chopped cucumbers , washing down mouthfuls of the stuff with sips from a cup of cold water . " The water ' 1I give you cramps . " " No , " he says , " I really feel better . . . . So the Bedouins are beginning to slaughter their herds . " " You heard the shot .... The kid was terribly upset . " " It 's a shame . " " I read in yesterday 's paper that the government says if the drought keeps up , they 'll try and relocate the tribes to better grazing land up north . " " The government , " he grimaces . A stomach spasm ? It 's hard to tell . With a sour expression SG THE WELL on his face , wiping off his mustache , he pushes away the plate of food . Who was doing the shooting ? " One of the younger men . Good-looking . He speaks a little Hebrew , I think . " " Do n't tell me . Not Ali ? " " Which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ali , Sheik Ahmad 's oldest son , with whom Grossman had struck up a friendship two years before , when for a season both of them were shepherds , pasturing their herds together some thirty kilometers or so north of here . " Ah , " he goes on . " It 's a damn shame . By the time the government decides to do anything for them , it 'll be too fate . " " Not necessarily . " " You know it as well as I do . What 's the use ? By the time it goes through all the official channels to provide relief , they 'll have slaughtered all their young animals . What 'll they do come spring ? " " They 'll manage . " " They 'll starve . That 's what . " Then absorbed in thought , he is silent . All around us , like insects in amber , each sound in the room seems embedded and preserved in the thick air , yellowed by the sunlight streaming through the windows ; the clatter of tin forks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices , and pervading all else the buzz of the flies that are so fat and lazy when they alight you can squash them with a finger . " Ali , eh ? " he asks . " 1 have n't seen him in over a year . What do you think ? Maybe I ought to go over and have a talk with him . " " What you ought to do is go back to your room and lie down . " He gives me an ironic glance and is partly right . It 's not his health alone that concerns me , but my reluctance , as elected secretary , more or less a kind of first among equals , general manager of the settlement , to allow the kibbutz to become officially involved in Bedouin affairs at all . " No , " I tell him . " Why not ? We were friends . " " You asked my advice and I 'm telling you . If they really would like us to help them , let them take the initiative for once  --  just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any harm in just talking to Ali . " But there is . That 's the trouble , and Grossman knows it as well as I , in spite of any personal relationship he may have cultivated with the Sheik 's son . For eleven years now , since the establishment of our settlement in the desert byforce of arms , we have lived in a state of truce with Ahmad 's tribe , no more and no less . Time and time again , experience has taught us that when we so much as offer them any material assistance , much less demonstrate a willingness for a real peace , it is refused , and taken for nothing but a display of weakness on our part , a loss of face as far as we are concerned . " No , " I continue , " 1 . . . " But Grossman interrupts by standing up . " No matter . It was just a thought . " He leaves , but all afternoon in the secretary 's office  --  a desk , two rattan chairs , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I should he at work checking a list of supplies to be brought tomorrow in Beersheba . . One hundred kilos baking soda , one hundred salt . . Impossible to keep my mind on it . The office , adjacent to the radio shack , stands on a little rise behind the dining-hall , commanding a view of the desert to the south . Broken up by a network of wadis running east to west  --  dry water courses eroded by flash floods  --  the landscape always gives me the impression that it has been raked by the talons of some gigantic beast . Here and there , glaring in the sun , are white outcroppings of rock ; ribs and spines and shoulder blades , only partly buried by the cracked earth , Yes . It is exactly as though some unimaginable animal has dug at the earth to bury the bones of its prey . . . . Salt , one hundred kilos sugar , tea .. Again and again my gaze returns to the window , but at this distance , the black wool tents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow cast by the afternoon sun on the broken ground . Once , and only for a moment , one of their camels is to be seen , silhouetted against the sky , and again  --  or is it my imagination ? ? I can hear the faint echo of a rifle shot borne on the rising wind . Four-thirty . Finished by now with his work at the machine shop , Grossman is there , I am sure of it , but to speak with All means nothing . That 's the whole point . It is Ahmad himself who has always been responsible for most of the difficulties that exist between us . The absolute ruler of the tribe for over twenty years , he is terrified  --  and with some justification  --  that even the minimal communication between the two communities will undermine his feudal authority . I have seen him only once or twice , at the Kassid or Morris , caf  --  s in Beersheba ; a great hulk of a man , not without dignity , who wears a pointed little beard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , of the color of a slice of apple left exposed to the air . Purportedly still possessed of a harem of twenty women or more , his licentiousness is legendary . One story has it that one day , long ago , at the height of his powers , he came upon a beautiful fourteen-yearold Bedouin girl drawing water from a desert well , and unable to resist making overtures  --  pleading , threatening , promising her anything to get her to join his harem  --  he reduced the child to tears . " Let me go , " she begged . " If you do n't let me go , I 'll tell my father . " " And just who is that ? " Ahmad wanted to know . " A sheik . A very powerful sheik who 'd have you gelded like a horse . " " Who ? " he laughed . " Ahmad . Do you realize that ? Sheik Ahmacl , " was the reply . F I V E - fifteen . Sure enough , Grossman shows up at the office , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and feverish eyes . " So you went . " " Yes . . . " We walk back to his room talks . " Things are terrible there , worse imagined . Their well has been dry since the day before yesterday . What water they have will only last them to the end of the week , if they 're lucky .. . less . . . They 've made up their minds to slaughter most of their herds by then , sell the meat for what they can get in Beersheba , and maybe buy enough water to last them until the rains come . " " Did you speak to Ali ? " " I was right . It was he that you saw . He agrees with me absolutely . If and when the government acts to help them , it 'll be too late . " The evening breeze is blowing from the southwest , drying the sweat from our bodies with a chill , and whipping the sand across the ground with a rasping noise that sets the teeth on edge . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that serve as the bachelor quarters of the settlement . " So All really was willing to speak with you . " " Of course . One must be willing simply to . make the effort . " " And Ahmad ? " Grossman laughs . " The old dog . . . Would you believe it ? Ali told me he 's developed a . taste for European women in his old age . He 's actually gone so far as to place advertisements in three or four papers on the Continent for a new concubine ... preferably young , fat , and blonde . " " But you did n't speak with him . " " It was n't necessary . " " He refused to see you . " " Yes , but it does n't make any difference . He 'll soon be dead . All will be Sheik . He has most of the authority right now . . . . I tell you , this is something new . Times have changed . " " I see . And just what did Ali propose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . Of course , I could see it all with my own eyes . They 're desperate . He ... No . He did n't propose anything . " " But you did . " " No . . . That is , I suggested . . . Actually , I wanted to speak with you first . " 88 THE WELL We go inside his room that resembles nothing so much as a cell with its iron cot and tiled floor . Grossman insists on making coffee , squatting on his hams in front of the kerosene burner in the same posture as All against the date palm . Interesting , the similarities between them . It is never so apparent to me as now . Both of them , Arab and Jew , born in the country , reared here , feeling completely a part of it , even resemble each other physically , affecting the same drooping mustache that is probably Turkish in origin , signifying virility . The water begins to boil on the blue flame . " Yes , " repeats Grossman . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he really believe it ? I do n't know . Maybe it 's so . In any case , what I as a European immigrant can never fully comprehend is the significance of that mustache or peculiar crouch ; the sense of utterly belonging in this country of his birth . Whatever the truth concerning the Bedouins may be , it is that which is at the heart of Grossman 's passionate desire to effect a rapprochement with the tribe . Knowing no other home , he appreciates and respects the Arab 's sense of possession for a land that he loves as well . More , actually speaking fluent Arabic from his childhood , he can remember a time in the not too distant past , when the two populations lived side by side with no more than the usual conflicts that divide one man from another . The fact that he has fought them , has in fact , within my earliest memory of arriving here , fought bravely against Ahmad himself who attacked the settlement on the first night of its establishment , seems to him essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present that counts for him  --  this moment alone , and the future , when the development of the land that he loves will depend first and foremost on peace . " Sugar ? " " No thanks . " He hands me a cup , and sits on the cot which squeaks . " You realize this is the chance we 've been waiting for . " " Maybe . " " But I told you , " he says . " Ali will soon he Sheik . If we can just establish good relations with him now .. . " " But it is n't as if we have n't tried before . What about the drought four years ago ? It was the same thing . They refused any help , and then  --  when was it ? You remember . That little girl with appendicitis . " He remembers , nodding his head sadly in the diminishing light . Two summers ago , rather than trust us to take one of their children into Beersheba for an operation , they apparently preferred to sec her die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ali is different from the old man . He spent almost a year in Tel Aviv , did you know that ? Working at the port . With Jews . That 's where he learned to speak some Hebrew , For the first time , they 're more than willing to accept our help , " " What exactly do you suggest ? " " What about our own well ? " " All right , so far as I understand . " " That 's what I thought . We 've probably more than enough water to see us all through . " " That I could n't say . " " Well , enough for at least a week , surely , if we 're careful . The rains will surely be here by then . " " Then what you want is to have us share our water . " " Exactly . " " That 's , of course , a decision that neither of us can make alone . " " I realize that , " he tells me . " The whole kibbutz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak with you . We 'll hold a meeting . " " When ? " " You should have seen the camp . They 're rationing what water they have , and the kids have sores on their lips . . . the corners of their mouths . , They surrounded me with tin cans , begging for water , as one would beg for alms . " He has neglected to light a lamp . In the gathering dark , his face is almost invisible , and his momentary anguish is communicated only by the timbre of his voice . " When do you want me to call a meeting ? " " What ? . . . Right away . The sooner the better . Tonight , if you can . Right after supper . " " I 'll see what I can dn . " " Wonderful . Oh . I almost forgot . Tell the night watch to let Ali through , will you ? " " You asked him to come here tonight ? " Under his mustache , his teeth gleam faintly as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . " Yes , " he tells me , " of course . About ten . " T H E meeting , held in the dining-hall , and attended by about sixty adult members of the settlement , is over by nine-forty-five . Gross-man 's motion is carried by almost two to one after Lev , the engineer who dug our artesian well four years ago , assures us that in all probability there will be enough water to supply the two communities for at least the next week if we are careful . It 's agreed that the Bedouins are to be permitted to take as much as they need every morning without charge  --  on one condition imposed by Zvika , who holds forth from his bench for more than five minutes , his round face shining with sweat , and his eyes bloodshot from the cigarette smoke that hangs in the air . He is a tractor driver , a man of about twenty-eight , completely bald , and intensely self-conscious about it , so that even indoors , his head is always covered by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A particularly doctrinaire and pedantic Socialist , and an author to boot , he has recently published a book comparing the life of the modern kibbutz to the ancient Hebrew Essenic and early Christian communes . His high-pitched voice drones on . Now , to illustrate some point he is making , he is actually quoting by heart from Philothe Alexandrian writer of antiquity  --  describing the life of the Essenic communes near the Dead Sea that were so much like our own . " For none of them wishes to have any property of his own , but rather by joining together everything without exception , they all have a common profit from it . " Grossman , glancing at his wrist watch , interrupts him impatiently : " Philo ! Who 's Philo ? What 's this Philo got to do with it ? " " I 'm discussing the principles upon which this kibbutz has been founded . Principles which ... " " But there 's a motion on the floor . What 's all this have to do with sharing the water with the Bedouins ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... You are evidently proposing an equitable distribution of the water . All well and good , and in accordance with our principles . But we are dealing here with a feudal lord  --  a Sheik , do n't forget that . What 's there to guarantee that Ahmad will distribute our water fairly among his own people ? Hnw can we be absolutely sure , for example , that it 's not his harem alone , or his relations  --  who knows  --  who are going to benefit . Do I have to tell you . . " " I 've already explained , " says Grossman . " Ali .. . " " What do I care about Ali ? Ahmad . Ahmad is still Sheik , and whether you remember it or not , it was Ahmad who . . . " His shrill voice breaks off , but the rest of the sentence hangs over us as tangibly as the blue smoke . It was Ahmad who ordered the surprise attack on the settlement eleven years ago , and who was re-sponsible for the murder and mutilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As a matter of fact .. . " he resumes . " I guarantee it , " says Grossman . " How ? " " You have my word . I guarantee a fair dis- tribution of the water . I 'll supervise myself . " Zvika shrugs . Aviva rises , yawning behind her hand , and suggests that such a guarantee be amended to the original motion . Shc is exhausted from working all day in the communal laundry , and wants only to he able to go to bed . " Well ? " A show of hands , throwing a forest of shadows resembling pruned trees against the wall . The amended motion is carried unanimously , and we adjourn . " Congratulations , " I tell Grossman , " Thanks . Yes . It 's a beginning , at least . A step in the right direction . " Outside , the wind is blowing from a blue-black sky that is ablaze with the innumerable stars of the desert night . Grossman shivers as we walk back to his room . The cold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned away the atmosphere of the earth , exposing us to a chill from outer space itself . " Ali ought to be here by now . Would you like to come in for a cup of coffee ? " " No thanks . I 'm tired . Bed for me . " A LITTLE later , while brushing my teeth at the pump outside the row of shacks , I catch a glimpse of them both through the window of Grossman 's room . They are standing in the corner , by the orange crate that serves as a bookcase , talking together with cups of coffee in their hands . Once again , their physical resemblance is striking . They are even the same height and , but for the slightly darker cast of the Bedouin 's skin , might be taken for blood relatives , cousins , or even brothers perhaps , with their high cheekbones , and long mustaches that emphasize their thin lips . Are they speaking Arabic or Hebrew ? I am too far away to tell . The Bedouin suddenly laughs , touching Grossman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that they are recalling the memories they have of shepherding together , near Halutza . Now Grossman is laughing too , holding his nose . I was right . They are talking about shepherding  --  the stench of the long-haired sheep , the lonely hours spent under the shade of the cypress tree , with the shared , stale loaf of bread on the grass between them and the goat skin water bag passed from hand to hand . 90 THE WELL M ONDAY , just after dawn , it begins . For almost four hours now , patiently queued in the blazing sun , a long line of Bedouin women  --  perhaps a hundred of them or more , dressed entirely in flowing robes of black wool , with only their eyes showing , and strings of Turkish coins sewed onto their veils  --  draw water from the spigot outside of the cow shed . There is no sound but the twittering of the sparrows and the tinkle of coins as one by one , they bend down and fill the tin cans they have brought with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a naked infant , covered with flies , is to be seen , but it too , as though enjoined by some mysterious command , makes no noise , but only gazes about with solemn , feverish eyes . Grossman and I are supervising . Just from the look of him , he feels no better , worse perhaps . than last night . The exhilaration of getting his motion passed and making arrangements with Ali has worn off . Periodically , he must excuse himself to go to the latrine , and when he returns with an embarrassed smile on his ravaged face , I plead with him to go back to his room and lie down . " No , no , it 's all right . I promised . . . " He dozes a little , stretched out in the bar of shadow cast by the overhanging roof , while the black-robed women shuffle by . In the shed , a cow lows . I too began to fall asleep , only to be abruptly awakened by a confused babble of voices , and a piercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Grossman rubs his eyes . At the spigot , two of the women have gotten into a row . For some reason , one of them , holding up the line , evidently can not make up her mind whether to fill up her rusty can or not . With her hands at her side , clenching and unclenching one fist , she stares at the stream of water that splashes over the hem of her robe and bare feet , while now four or five of the others flap their arms and rage about her . Then , with another shriek , she is shoved aside , stumbling against Grossman who has come up to them , shouting in Arabic at the top of his voice . Silence again , sudden and complete , broken only by the wail of an infant from somewhere in the crowd . " What 's the trouble ? " I ask . " Turn off the water . . . . Just a minute , " he tells me , and then , in Arabic , speaks to the woman who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , apparently mortified by her physical contact with a strange man , she buries her veiled face in her hands and emitsnothing but a high-pitched , quavering wail . It is more than a minute before he can get her to answer . Then , listening attentively , with a puzzled expression on his face , he turns to me . " I do n't understand . " " What does she say ? " " It just does n't make sense . She says that she and her husband are very poor . They will starve because they own only two much goats that will die of thirst unless they can get water . " " Then why does n't she take it ? " " That 's what 's so confusing . She says she ca n't afford it . " " Are you sure ? " " Positive . " " But tell her it 's free . She can take as much as she needs without charge . Did n't you explain that to Ali ? " " Of course . " " Well , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but this time she refuses to answer altogether . It is impossible to determine her age , or even the shape of her body underneath that robe . Only her eyes are visible , yellowed and contracted in the glare of sun . " Useless . . . " Grossman straightens up . The other women have fallen back in a silent semicircle around us . " I just do n't get it . There 's obviously been a misunderstanding of some kind . " " What are you going to do ? " " 1 do n't know . Ask Ali , I guess . " " Now ? " " I suppose so . " " Wait here , I 'll bring the jeep and go with you . " " No , no , there 's no need . " " Do as I say . You 're in no condition to drive . " With one hand to his head , he closes his eyes and makes a gesture as if to shake off the weakness that has hold of him . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to wait . " " For what ? " " They really ca n't afford it . " " Afford what ? What arc you talking about ? " " If we drive over to the camp now , we 'll be considered guests . You know their laws of hospitality . They 'll feel obliged to slaughter a sheep for a meal . " " You wait here . " The communal jeep is kept in the machine shop , but it takes me over twenty minutes to locate Chaim who has charge of the keys . He is working in the shack that houses our electric A STORY BY HUGH NISSENSON 9l generator , repairing a worn fan belt . I could have spared myself the effort . By the time I drive back to the cow shed , All is there . He had apparently just ridden over from the encampment on a small white mare that one of the women holds by the bridle as he dismounts and shakes hands with Grossman who begins talking to him at once , in a low , anxious voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each with his forehead almost touching that of the other , and their hands clasped behind them . " Then you did tell them , " Grossman is saying . The Bedouin nods . " But I still do n't understand . If they know we 're not charging them anything , why does the woman say she ca n't afford it ? " " It 's nothing . " " There must be a reason . " " She 's talking about the tax . " " What tax ? " " A half a pound . " " For what ? Whose ? " " My father 's . For the use of the water . " All is smiling . He is having difficulty in speaking Hebrew so quickly . Now , very slowly , searching for each word , he says , " You must n't bother yourself . " " Do you mean to tell me that your father is taxing them a half a pound per person for the use of water from our well ? " " But of course . " Grossman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifled cry , and the mare tosses her head and chomps at her bit . " Let me get this straight . . " But I have already explained , " says Ali . " There 's no need to concern yourself . This is ? " He completes the sentence in Arabic . " ' Our affair entirely ' . " " Yes , that 's it . It 's the law . The tribe must always pay the Sheik for the right to draw water from the well . " " But the water is ours . " The Bedouin gives a barely perceptible shrug . " Do n't you understand ? " says Grossman . " It 's impossible . It . . . what we want . . . what I promised .. I gave my word . . .. The whole point is for us to share with all of your people fairly an equal distribution . " Again , the Bedouin apparently can not get the drift of the Hebrew . Grossman must translate . " Equal ? " " Yes , " says Grossman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who ca n't afford it ? " " Equal ? " the Bedouin repeats , and then , giving up , he lapses entirely into Arabic . " What 's he saying ? " I ask Grossman . " He says it 's the law . It 's always been the law . He says it 's ... the lord 's ... his father 's right as Sheik to tax them , just as it was his father 's before him , and before that , long before . . . . " " Before what ? " " He did n't say . " I glance at the Bedouin who is looking beyond me , beyond the sloping tin roof of the cow shed and the date grove , toward the desert where the shadows are diminishing as the sun slowly ascends toward noon .... Before . Before us , is of course what he means ; long before our possession of the land , our settlement and government , when free , or at least subject only to his own law , the Bedouin roamed the desert that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grossman . " It 's out of the question . At the meeting , I promised . . . " and then , in a final effort to make himself understood , he too continues in Arabic . Before he has finished , the sun has reached its zenith . His eyes are glazed , his face streaked with sweat . The Bedouin says nothing until , with a hopeless gesture , one palm upraised , he abruptly turns on his naked heel and walks with dignity toward the waiting mare . The little horse takes a mincing step as he swings himself into the wooden saddle , and shouts a word of command to the waiting women , one of whom catches his reins as he leads them away . For almost a minute after they are out of sight , their dust hangs in the air . Grossman coughs , and with averted eyes and saying nothing , goes down on one knee to the spigot , where he catches a few drops of water that cling to the spout , and moistens his parched lips . T UESDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . The colorless sky is empty but for the flocks of ravens that wheel in gigantic circles above the Bedouin camp . From morning to night they are to be seen like spots before the eyes , the symptom of some madness induced by the heat of the sun . Now there can be no doubt of it ; without water , the Bedouins are slaughtering the remainder of their herds . Although I am sure he is aware of what is happening , Grossman makes no mention of it . All day Tuesday he is too sick even to get out of bed . Some of the women take turns bringing him tea and toast , and emptying his bedpan , and for the rest of the time , he lies perfectly still , with his face to the wall . Then , as is sometimes the case , on Thursday morning , although greatly weakened , his stomach spasms have subsided suf-92 THE WELL ficiently for him to get up . Restless and inordinately thirsty , he haunts my office where I am busy writing a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is negotiating with us for the export of our dates overseas . For what seems to be an hour , he sits by the window facing south , sucking on an orange and brushing away the flies that settle on his face and arms . " What do you think ? " he asks at last . " I suppose it 's really Ahmad 's fault . " I put down my pen . " I guess so . " " Still , it 's a shame . There must be something that can be done . " Then , for a while longer , he is silent again . A ray of sunlight , riddled with dust , illuminates his face . In the past few days he has lost weight and looks somehow five years younger and more vulnerable than he really is  --  twenty-six or twenty-seven at the most . The drooping mustache seems more of an affectation than ever , a pretense of manhood pasted on by a kid . " I do n't suppose Ali was here while I was sick . " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll never come back now . Strange . How well it was going that night when he and I had coffee in my room . Ai , if you only knew how sick of it all I am ! " " Of what ? " " This . . . hatred . Did you know that eleven years ago , the night of the attack , I was the one who found Chava ? " " Chava ? " " You remember . Zvika 's wife . " " Chava . Yes . " " She was sleeping in her tent when they came . They went at her with their knives when she was still alive . I 've never told Zvika , of course , but she was still alive when I found her . Sometimes , you know , I still . . . have dreams . " " But you do n't hate them . " " The Bedouins ? I did . Oh , how I did . It 's just  --  how can I possibly explain it ? I told you . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . . . endless . " More silence . He rises abruptly from his chair . " Who can say ? I wonder if it 'll do any good now . " " What 's that ? " I ask . " It could n't do any harm . " " What ? " " It might still help . You never know . " " I see . You want to go to their camp and try to speak with Ali again . " " Yes . " Now it is my turn to say nothing . He shreds the pulp from the orange rind with his teeth . " It 'll be unofficial , of course . No one here will ever know , except you and me . " " Then why tell me ? " " Because I thought you understood . Do n't you see ? It 's better than not doing anything . . letting it go on and on . " What is there to lose ? " " I do n't know . " " Nothing , I tell you . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " I screw on the top of the fountain pen . My sweating wrist has smudged the ink on the letter . It will have to be done over again . " If that 's what you really want . " " Yes . " W E TAKE the jeep . South of the settle- ment , there is only a narrow dirt track that eventually leads to the Egyptian border , just north of Nitzana . Surrounded by the white rocks , we are in the valley of the bones , but even here , in the mouths of the wadis , there is still some scrub vegetation left alive , a gray-green stubble incrusted by the white shells of countless snails . Not a tree is to be seen . " How far now ? " " A half a kilometer . Less , " Grossman shouts . Ahead of us , and to the left , where the track intersects with still another narrower path that leads between the rocks , he slows down . " Their well . " It takes me a moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-raised stones , about knee-high and plastered together with sun-baked mud . He shrugs and drives on , now off the track itself , and up the floor of a huge wadi that runs parallel to the path among the rocks . When he stops , only one black tent can be seen to our right . The rest are apparently hidden around the bend of the wadi walls that are over ten feet tall . " Where is everybody ? " " Hiding , " Grossman explains . " Are they afraid ? " " It 's just the way they are " Well , there 's Ali , at any " Where ? " He is standing with another man in the shadow of a huge boulder about fifty yards away , near the half-skinned carcasses of four or five freshly-slaughtered sheep that lie on the ground covered by a cloud of flies . The blood and flies , the cry of the ravens whose shadows flit across the ground , even the untended fire of dried camel dung smoking in front of the tent give the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The naked child completes the picture . A little boy , perhaps six years old , with a swollen belly and shaved skull , emerges from the tent at our approach with a tin can in his hands . " Brandied Apricots " ? printed in English , coming from God knows where  --  part of the label is clearly visible as he thrusts it before us , begging for water without a sound . " Give him your canteen , " whispers Grossman , " and wait here . " He starts forward . The child , for some reason , refuses to drink from the canteen itself . I must pour the water into the rusty can , but there is too much of it , and it spills to the ground . " Wait ! " I cry , but it is too late . He has already turned and disappeared once more into the tent . Now Grossman is talking , rapidly and in an undertone to Ali , in Arabic , standing with the bloody carcass of the sheep on the ground between them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the first time , I can see him clearly . It 's the old man himself , Ahmacl , the Sheik , fatter and older than I remember him , with a fuller beard that has turned completely gray . Still , unmistakably , it is he ; carrying himself erect , with his shoulders back , and one hand playing with the hilt of a silver dagger stuck in the yellow sash around his waist . Ali has begun to talk too , for the first time , in a loud , clear voice . The old man glances at him , and either because the sun is in his eyes , or because something his son has said amuses him , he screws up his face and shows his teeth in a grimace that could be taken for a smile . Behind me , the child , or someone , stirs in the tent , and when again , I look around , what happens next , happens so quickly that it is only later , in retrospect , that I can visualize it all as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and suddenly , without warning , Grossman has lunged at him , slipping on the bloody ground , so that he is only able to give the Bedouin a glancing blow on the right cheek with his fist . They are clown , the both of them , and for the moment , incredulous , neither I nor the old man can make a move . He is still grimacing , the smile frozen on his face , his fingers spread on the hilt of the knife . A moment more , and both of us still remain where we are . Grossman is the first to get to his feet , staring stupidly clown at the Bedouin who holds his hand to his cheek and rocks his head slightly from side to side . When I come up , the old man retreats another step to the left . " What 's happened ? " I ask . No answer . " What is it ? " Still no response . With his mouth open and the same stupefied expression on his face , Grossman reaches out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " Tell me , " I repeat . The hand smeared with sheep 's blood , is still extended , but now the Bedouin drags himself back on his elbows and spits on the ground with disgust . " He blames us for everything , " says Grossman , getting behind the wheel of the jeep . " The fact that they 've lost their herds . . . this morning , a child died . . . everything . There was nothing could say . He says his father is right . We 've taken their land , and now deny them water . " He tries to turn on the ignition but fumbles with the keys . His hand is trembling . I glance up . The two Bedouins are standing in front of the tent . Something apparently has struck them as funny . The old man , at least , is laughing deep in his throat , with his head thrown back and his hand still on the hilt of his dagger . " Why did you hit him ? " I ask . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . " Ah , dog , " Grossman replies , looking away . " What else could I do ? He called me a dog of a Jew . "
