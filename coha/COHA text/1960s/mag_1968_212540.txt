History surrounds many battles with the aura of legend : Thermopylae , Can nae , Hastings , Verdun , the Bulge . Few of them can match in intensity and fury , or in the significance of their results , the battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43 , when the long thrust of Hitler 's armies into Russia was halted and reversed . This week the 720,000 people of Volgograd-as Stalingrad was renamed in 1961 during Khrushchev 's destalinization campaign-mark the 25th anniversary of the end of the furious battle on the Volga 's west bank , in which about 300,000 soldiers and civilians lost their lives . For its commemoration , the city has a statue of a bosomy Mother Russia waving a sword , which rises 170 feet above the Mamaev Hill , where some of the fiercest fighting raged . Farther down the hill , a wall bears the inscription : " Iron wind beat them in the face , but they still went forward . " <P> Grim Order . Hitler 's Wehrmacht had already goose-stepped over almost all of Europe and more than 700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units were sent to take Stalingrad in August 1942 . As squadrons of Luftwaffe dive bombers darkened the skies above , German troops surged into the city and , toward the north , broke through to the Volga . But Stalin had issued a grim order : " Not one step backward . " With their backs to the river 's edge , the Russians dug in determinedly . They fought the invaders in the streets , factories and cellars for each foot of land , bombarded them from across the river with mortars . A few tied live grenades around themselves and dove under the clanking panzers . Astonishingly , the Russians held off the Germans for three months-long enough for Stalin to reinforce his armies north and south of the city . <P> In the chill of a week in November , those two forces suddenly swept around behind the Nazis and encircled almost 300,000 of them in a giant nutcracker . As the cruel Russian winter began in earnest , temperatures fell to 49 below zero . Frozen German corpses piled up like logs , many still clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud troops began to eat the flesh of horses , cats and rats . Hermann Goring 's airlift brought only a fraction of the promised relief . The city 's rubble grew so high that German tanks were unable to roll over it . Through it all , Hitler insisted that his generals stand firm , refusing to allow them to try to break out of the trap and save part of their army . Against his orders , Field Marshal Friedrich von Paulus surrendered , and on Feb. 2 the last pockets of resistance collapsed . For three days thereafter , Germans at home heard nothing but mournful commentary and dirges on their radios . <P> New Confidence . Many historians regard the battle of Stalingrad as the turning point of World War II , though the Allies ' invasion of Normandy and the successful defense of Britain certainly rival it for the honor . In any case , its impact was as much psychological as military . The battle proved the fallibility of Hitler and the vincibility of the Wehrmacht , which up to then had enjoyed little but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , including a field marshal and 20 generals*-aroused the dormant hopes of the Allies and gave them new confidence .
