Miserable little Qatar ( pop . 35,000 ) , a sun-seared knuckle of sand and stone jutting into the Persian Gulf , was a latecomer in the Middle East oil boom . But when oil poured out in 1949 and the gold started pouring in , wizened old ( 69 ) Sheik Ali bin Abdullah bin Qasim Al Thani had no trouble adjusting his spending habits to those of the other sheiks of Araby . <P> At Doha , capital of Qatar ( pronounced gutter ) , gaudy pink , green and gold palaces sprang up around the huddle of malodorous mud hovels ; one vast pile , reserved for the visiting heads of state , was equipped with air conditioning and window curtains operated by pushbuttons ; the outside walls of the Sheik 's own palace were studded with bare light bulbs that went on by night even when the Sheik was away , which was more often than not . <P> Cars for Jewels . Discovering Switzerland , Ali took to spending summers near the Alps to beat the heat ( around 120 from April to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chartered airliners for himself and his retinue , which was so large that it spilled out of the Sheik 's palatial villa on the shores of Lake Geneva into hotels near by , where the damage to furnishings one season amounted to $20,000 . And when the cool weather arrived up north , the whole entourage would flee across the Mediterranean to Ali 's magnificent mansion on the heights above Beirut , purchased from a Saudi sheik for a reported $1,000,000 . <P> Foreign merchants awaited his trips with anticipation , for the aging Sheik was a generous man . When Saudi Arabia 's King Saud went to Qatar for a royal visit laden with gifts in the form of bags of precious stones , Sheik Ali reciprocated by presenting Saud with 16 automobiles , one with gold fittings . <P> But as Ali 's generosity grew , so did his debts ( about $14 million at last count ) with Doha 's local bankers ; he just could not make ends meet , even though he got $12.5 million from Qatar 's $50 million annual oil revenue . Soon Qatar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khalifa bin Hamad , Ali 's nephew , who thought he was in line for the throne , and was pressing the old man to step down . The British , who watch over Qatar as a protectorate , took a hand when they detected signs of simmering insurrection among the Sheik 's long-suffering subjects . <P> All Expenses Paid . Last week the rheumatic old man yielded . Calling in the family council of 400 Al Thani males , the Sheik abdicated in favor of his son Ahmed , 40 . But word was passed that all the decisions in the new regime will be made by Khalifa as new Crown Prince , who is determined that more of the state 's revenues will be channeled into public-welfare projects . Celebrating , the Al Thanis feasted on lamb and rice , and Qatar 's bankers and merchants flocked in to congratulate the old man , and wish his successor well . Everyone was happy when the new advisory council agreed to pay old Ali 's debts out of state revenue and give him an annual pension big enough to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere handful of servants and wives .
