A Far Country ( by Henry Denker ) concerns Sigmund Freud at 36 , when , butting against the wall of medical opposition , he was also breaking through the wall of man 's unconscious . It specifically concerns his early and famous patient , the young Viennese Elizabeth von Ritter : through opening the shutters of her mind , which had put fetters on her body , Freud released light that , expanding , would flood modern living and penetrate modern thought . Thanks to a sound union of play and production , A Far Country is very often engrossing . <P> If A Far Country is historically Freud 's play , it is dramatically Elizabeth 's story . An attractive , mercurial , at once cool and responsive woman , Elizabeth lost the use of her legs after the death of her father and then her sister , walks on crutches and awaits-or , as Freud suggests , looks forward to-a wheelchair . At first she is mockingly certain that he can find no cure where a shoal of specialists have failed . Then she warms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probing her mind-he probes too far ; for she , meanwhile-talking , laughing , sparring , flirting , recollecting-blurts out too much . She then backs away , but at length her guilty feelings are tormentedly rooted out . <P> However factually accurate or clinically Freudian the play may be , it has a general effect of truth , of document and drama going hand in hand . What is vital to it is the portrait of Freud-dedicated , balked , often brusque-who is ably acted by Steven Hill ; what is crucial is the delineation of Elizabeth , acted with extraordinary suppleness and intelligence by Kim Stanley . Indeed , under Alfred Ryder 's controlled direction and inside Donald Oenslager 's evocative set , the production is everywhere helpful . <P> The weakness of A Far Country is a structural clash between Freud 's play and Elizabeth 's story . Part of the trouble is that where , in another kind of Miracle Worker , Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan are glued inside one consuming relationship , things are quite different here . Elizabeth is but a person , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolutionizer of history . But trouble lies also in the stage itself which , unlike a book , can not bring everything into focus by having everything-including Elizabeth 's story-seen through Freud 's eyes . Hence not Freud but Elizabeth is the dramatic center of Acts I and III . In Act II what properly but disruptively takes over is Freud 's own career , including his relations with his once daring , now success-loving senior colleague , the brilliant Dr. Joseph Breuer ( well played by Sam Wanamaker ) . Once the case history runs away with the play , it proves awkward for the play to run away from the history . <P> But despite its broken impact , A Far Country proves an often vibrant blend , as against the usual clash , of theater and truth . Truth on Broadway is needed , and if Freud helps bring it there , perhaps more Freud would help Broadway , too , out of spending so much of its life on crutches.                 @ @ @ @
