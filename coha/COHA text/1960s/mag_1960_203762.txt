The National Labor Relations Board handed down a historic ruling last week in the longest-and one of the bitterest-major strikes in U.S. labor history . It found Wisconsin 's Kohler Co. , the nation 's third biggest maker of plumbing fixtures , guilty of prolonging a six-year strike against the company by the United Auto Workers . The NLRB found Kohler guilty of unfair labor practices , ordered it to rehire the 1,700 workers discharged after the United Auto Workers called them out on strike-even if it means firing some of the 2,500 nonunion workers that Kohler recruited to break the strike . The union called the decision a victory over " the medieval attitude of Kohler toward its employees . " Kohler officials at once filed an appeal in federal court in Chicago .
