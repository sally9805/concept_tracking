txt Liberal Democrats in the House appear to be gravitating to the view that Representative Adam Clayton Powell should be disciplined but not deprived of his seat . The form of discipline that now seems most likely is denial of his chairmanship of the Education and Labor Committee . Three Democrats , usually classified as liberals and probably the precursors of a much larger group , are inclined at this point to let the Manhattan Democrat take his seat pending an investigation and to impose // some penalty other than exclusion from the House . A fourth would have Mr. Powell stand aside , but not be excluded , pending an investigation . A fifth , who is a member of the House administration subcommittee , said , however , he believed that Mr. Powell would be denied his seat on the basis of the subcommittee 's report , which will be made tomorrow . Reresentative Lionel Van Deerlin of California , who proposed to deny the oath to Mr. Powell , is also rated a liberal Democrat . Mr. Van Deerlin would not declare the Powell seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he would withhold the right to vote pending a report by a committee of nine appointed by the Speaker . Mr. Powell would , meanwhile , retain all other privileges of office . Representative Frank Thompson Jr. , Democrat of New Jersey , said : " I will not vote to vacate the seat . " He meant by that , he said , that the oath of office should be administered but he was not necessarily opposed to some form of discipline . Representative James G. O'Hara , Democrat of Michigan , said of Mr. Thompson 's position : " I think that makes sense . If history is any guide , people are going to want to find a position that does n't go as far as Van Deerlin and does more than nothing . " A third , preferring anonymity now , said : " That is a pretty ( good representation of my own ' members in this matter . Most ' members are not anxious to expel ? or anything so drastic . " All three are members of the Education and Labor Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of House liberals . Mr. Thompson is chairman of the study group , which has decided not to take a position as an organization in the Powell case . A fourth liberal Democrat , Representative Emanuel Celler of Brooklyn , said three weeks ago : " I will support a motion to have Powell stand aside and not take his seat while a committee appointed by . Congress can examine his wrongs or excesses . However , it would be too drastic to expel him from Congress . " Issue in Campaign Mr. Thompson said he opposed vacating the seat because " Mr. Powell 's conduct was an issue in his campaign " and his constituents , nevertheless , chose him . Mr. Thompson added that " excluding him from Congress would achieve nothing " because in a special election he would be re-elected . Then Mr. Thompson declared : He may have communicated his views to liberal Democrats , but he has made himself unavailable for public comment . House action on such an internal matter , contrary to his views , would amount to a major revolt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stage . The House leadership controls significant leverage .
