CHARCO HARBOUR by Godfrey Blunden . 401 pages . Vanguard . $6.95 . <P> <P> For in searching thou shalt finde that the workes of many brave men are buried in oblivion . . . though part of those workes have escaped , the wracke of the rest have perished in the Gulf of time , which hath swallowed the best of many men 's endeavours . - 17th century Hudson Bay Explorer Luke Foxe <P> These words serve as the opening to one of Godfrey Blunden 's chapters . They might well be the emblem of his book . The lost works that he has sought to retrieve from oblivion are those of the crew of H.M.S. Endeavor , a fat British collier fitted out as a naval vessel and dispatched in 1768 to explore the Pacific . <P> Blunden 's revival technique in this historical novel is remarkably restrained . Even when dealing with the ship 's celebrated Captain James Cook , he has refused all concession to the popular taste for heightening drama and homogenizing history . As a consequence , the book may be read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and short on history that its people tend to brood protectively over what little they have-or by students interested in Cook 's voyages . But this would be a pity . Dry and slow as the book often is , Blunden 's novel sometimes glows with absorbing incident , rare , loving knowledge , and austere beauty . <P> Endeavor 's mission was part strategy , part science : to observe the astronomical transit of the planet Venus from Tahiti ; to map coasts and islands ; to collect and classify strange flora and fauna ; to search for a naval base for the coming war with the American colonies , Spain and France . Manned and equipped for all this , the little ship resembled the Swiss Family Robinson afloat . It was stuffed to the gunwales with pigs and goats ( for eating ) , cats and parrots ( to break the monotony ) , even a hunting greyhound named Lady who was used to chase down rare specimens of game . <P> The father figure , however , was far from a permissive Robinson . Cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomer , customarily kept his Yorkshire temper and sizzling vocabulary in check . But , as revealed by his journals and the accounts of his crew , he emerges as something less than the wise and civilized commander painted by Blunden 's countryman Alan Moorehead in The Fatal Impact ( TIME , April 8 , 1966 ) . More Bligh than blithe , even on festive occasions Cook had a provincial prudishness about prurient talk , though he showed a fondness for admiring native women through his telescope . He insisted that his men wash , but he forbade them to pray ( especially when the ship was in danger , as she often was ) for fear that prayer would rob them of the will to work . <P> Expansion of Fact . Nearly everybody aboard who could write seems to have kept some sort of journal , scribbling away in the meridional heat like diary-addicted schoolgirls . Patiently , Blunden has stitched and embroidered it all together-Endeavor 's , wreck on the Great Barrier Reef , refitting at Charco Harbour ( socalled because the aborigines greeted them by shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a seaman named Saunders who lived with the natives for a while and discovered gold . The voyage also seems to have occasioned European man 's first sight of the kangaroo ( it was taken to be a dog ) .
