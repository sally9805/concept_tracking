txt The Big Beaver Ranch near here seems the perfect picture of autumnal tranquility : 378 acres of pasture and golden-umber hills dotted with placidly grazing goats and cattle . But drive on past the ranch and pull up at the Pine Forest Missionary Baptist Church next door . Inside his trailer home , the Rev. James H. Bishop paints a different and sinister picture . " They are after one thing : These Southern states of ours , " says Mr. Bishop , still clad in the overalls he had been wearing while helping to put a new roof on a nearby home . " Our deepest conviction is that they are going to train people to start their new nation here , and that 's why we 're fighting them . " " Them " is the Black Muslims , and their purchase of the Big Beaver , plus another farm in the county and sawmill facilities in nearby Pell City , for $223,251.11 this summer has caused a furor in this central Alabama county . The Muslims insist they 're raising not an army but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago and elsewhere . But few whites here are convinced the real aim is n't to make St. Clair County the capital of the new Nation of Islam . Just Not Our Folks - " People around here are really hot about this ; they are just not our kind of people , " says Bill Dollar , as he fills a customer 's gas tank at his country store across the road from the Muslim ranch . " One of them was in here just now buying gas , and I told him they could save a lot of bloodshed by moving out . " The outcome of the angry battle brewing here may be important to other places , since the Muslims envision this as the first of a series of large-scale food production projects across Dixie . They have been operating a pilot project in Georgia for two years . In Alabama alone they hope to own 100,000 acres by a year from now . The Muslims bought their land here from Ray Wyatt , the Ford dealer in Pell City , and his partner , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target of extreme harassment since the transaction came to light about three weeks ago . Both claim they did n't know that the buyer , a flamboyant Negro named Walter Turner , who is national director of public relations for the Muslims , represented whitehating Elijah Muhammad , leader of the Muslims . But few of their white neighbors believe them . The sale to the Muslims came to light after Mr. Wyatt , 41 , told his brother Wallace , 45 , about it in confidence . Wallace decided he could n't keep quiet . " It was the hardest thing I ever had to do , " he says in the living room of his trim home near the Muslim property . " I told Ray I could n't respect the confidence , because what he did was the lowest-down thing I ever heard of . I told him that when he started talking , I did n't realize he was selling out my children . " So Wallace Wyatt went to the Pine Forest Church at its next gathering to " expose , " as he puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only because the Muslims were their neighbors , but because the church 's cemetery is now surrounded by the Muslim property . " My wife and I had both planned to be buried there , but this knocks that , " says Wallace Wyatt . Some Nasty Incidents Since Mr. Wyatt spoke , life has not been easy for a number of parties involved . ? A Negro worker on the Muslim farm was arrested and charged with trespassing on the property . ( Before the land was sold , it was under a lease that does n't expire until March . The Muslims argue the lease is invalid because the tenant has failed to keep up rent payments . Who 's right will be decided in court . ) ? The same man was arrested at the same time under a state law that requires Nazis , Communists and Black Muslims to register within five days of entering the state . The man , awaiting trial under $10,000 bond , claims he 's not even a Muslim , ? Two Hereford cows in the Muslim herd have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cars parked in a lot beside Ray Wyatt Ford Co. , causing $5,000 in damage , Mr. Wyatt says . ? Mr. Wyatt has n't sold a car since the land sale to the Muslims became known . Starting Dec. 1 , he says , he plans to begin laying off his 30 employes and liquidating the business . And he says that he , his wife and his children are the target of constant telephone death threats .. ? Dr. McClung , the dentist , fled to Mobile to try to start anew , but late last week he returned and said he is going to try to stay . But he severed an business ties with Mr. Wyatt and swore never to have anything to do with Muslims again . A few days before he was ousted as head of the local unit of the John Birch Society . " For the first time in my life , I know what it feels like to be black , " the white dentist says . ? A group called MD. ? Restore Integrity to Development  --  has sprung into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live with them because they do n't believe in Christ , " says its leader , Wallace Wyatt . ( " I know the Jews do n't believe in Christ either , but they 're not a militant race , " he adds . ) ? The state of Alabama has filed four suits trying to show that the Muslims were n't authorized to do business in Alabama and that their land purchases are thus invalid . The strength of the opposition to the Muslim invasion showed clearly last Friday night , when St. Clair County residents filled the gymnasium at Ashville High School , packed the halls outside and overflowed into the school . yard . The crowd came to hear Edwin Strickland , head of a state agency charged with keeping an eye on groups like the Muslims . Mr. Strickland called the Musllnf move into the county the start of " a statewide blockbusting attempt " and warned that as long as the Muslims are allowed to stay , " you 're not going to have ( white ) people running over you trying to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Muslim land buyer and PR man , has been waging his own campaign to convince Alabamans that Muslims are n't such bad folks at all . " All we want to do is show people we can raise crops instead of raising hell on Saturday night , " he says . Asked about rumors that the Muslims here have violent plans , Earl Safford , a Muslim father of 18 who works at the ranch , says , " We 're not going to start no violence against anybody . We 've been taught self-defense , but we do n't believe in violence . " But Alabamans are n't listening . At a press conference Mr. Tattier set up last Waok , only two newsmen showed up to hear him say , " Ray Wyatt did n't sell us that land because he loved Elijah Muhammad . He did it because he loved money . " Last Wednesday , the Muslims chartered a plane to fly a load of St. Clair residents to see the Muslim farm in Georgia and to hear whites there say Muslims make good neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his relatives and employes , only four people showed up for the flight . Whites here figure they already know perfectly well what Muslims are like . " I did n't see how I could benefit " from the PR trip , says the Rev. Elihue Mayo , pastor of the Friendship Freewill Baptist Church in Pell City and a leader of RID . Another local white who was n't on the plane is farmer Ray Thompson . Mr. Thompson , like most county residents , believes the Muslims " will till up the community with niggers . This is the start of a movement to take over the government . " ( When pressed , Mr. Thompson also confesses to an economic motivation : " I 've got 343 acres down past their place , and I figure it 's worth $200 an acre . But If we do n't get them out , it wo n't be worth $100 . " ) And he sums up the feeling of most whites toward Ray Wyatt by prying the chrome " Ray Wyatt Ford Co. " emblem from the tailgate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visitor and saying , " Next time you see Ray , give him that . "
