The British have such a dead-keen sense of humor that they will burst into laughter on hearing that Prince Philip likes to call his wife " Sausage . " Perhaps desperate for relief , penny-wise BBC-TV spent $10,000 last week to import Mort Sahl for a single telecast . Treating him on arrival as if he were an uncommitted king , BBC trotted out 30 London TV and drama critics to hear Sahl at a press conference , including the Observer 's Kenneth Tynan , who , in a red sport jacket , sat cross-legged on the floor at the comedian 's feet , like an elegant retriever . <P> Wandering about town for a week before his broadcast , Sahl ritually shopped for his daily toy ( a $25 Mont Blanc pen , a $5,000 E-type Jaguar ) , once went out at 3 a.m. into the grey vacuum of the London night just to have a look at the outsized eagle atop the new U.S. embassy in Grosvenor Square . Then , taping his show before an audience full of political rebels and comedians ( Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a note on his visit to the House of Commons ( " I thought the debates were a little mannered ; no one used the mace " ) , acknowledged his introduction as " the next Secretary-General of the United Nations " and swung into his show . <P> Putting old targets into transatlantic context , he started in on Joseph P. Kennedy- " You may recall he was in the embassy here in charge of Edward R. Murrow " - and went on spraying in all directions : " Our cars are different . You know , clocks up front and in back-different time zones . " Turning Soviet-American relations into a latter-day bestiary , he noted that " our dogs are affectionate and can fetch newspapers . Russian dogs do n't show affection , but they are all engineers . " Getting around to women , he reached for a rare pun , said : " Women are getting more and more materialistic , always looking for security . They are saying , ' This is the way the world ends , not with a whim but a banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once taught college math , and , as a blackboard illustration of the differences between the exact and inexact sciences , " I drew a woman on a couch , and I explained to the class that in mathematics you moved across the couch and got the girl . In philosophy you never reached her ; and in psychology , you discovered she was n't the right girl for you anyway . " <P> As for Sahl , he discovered that he was not for Britain . Telly viewers thought him too mild and too American . One critic complained that Sahl had not even made fun of cricket or British pubs-obviously two unforgivable omissions .
