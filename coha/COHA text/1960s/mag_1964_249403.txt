After a rough but remarkably successful legislative session , Pennsylvania 's Republican Governor William W. Scranton , 46 , flew to his vacation abode at Hobe Sound , Fla . He spent a couple of weeks playing tennis , reading books ( 17 in all ) and trying to relax . He also dropped in on some old friends in the neighborhood , but after a few such visits his rest was almost ruined . Repeatedly , Scranton was given a sly wink , told what a cagey fellow he was to pretend that he did n't really want the 1964 G.O.P , presidential nomination , and assured that his political strategy was just right . One acquaintance let it be known that he had already underwritten $25,000 in Scranton-for-President campaign contributions . <P> " You Ca n't Do That . " Scranton was appalled . For months he had been telling people that he did not intend to try for the nomination . But still , everybody seemed convinced that he was playing games . He phoned Harrisburg , told Press Secretary Jack Conmy to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass the word that he would have something to say about the presidency . <P> The phone call threw Scranton 's aides into turmoil . He refused to tell them what he planned to say , brushed aside inquiries from even his closest staffers . The day before the press conference , the Philadelphia Inquirer splashed an eight-column headline across its front page announcing that Scranton had decided to reject a draft for the nomination . Even State Attorney General Walter Alessandroni , his top political adviser , did not know what Scranton intended to say . Fearing that he meant to issue a Shermanesque statement , Alessandroni admonished : " You ca n't do that . " <P> The day of the press conference , some 100 newsmen jammed the ornate wood-paneled reception room in Harrisburg 's State House . Scranton , looking tanned and healthy in the glare of television floodlights , read his 600-word statement deliberately , but with such sincerity that at one point tears welled in his eyes . <P> Crystal Clear . " I have emphasized many times in the past that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would do nothing to encourage moves to make me one , " he said . Despite this , many persons " evidently believe that deep in my heart I do desire the nomination and that I am only waiting until the right moment to make my move . This is not true . But it seems to be part of our American folklore to believe that every politician wants to be President . " <P> Scranton said he had considered announcing flatly that he would reject a draft , but " I believe no American has the right to take that position . " If a draft did materialize , he continued , it would have to be " one which I personally would feel came from the hearts of the people , " and not one that was " engineered or arranged . " But he sought to make it " crystal clear " that he would prefer not to be drafted . Said he : " I sincerely do not wish to run . " <P> After the press conference , Scranton aides were elated . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite said no , either . That was what they had feared he would do , and now , in adding up the effects of his statement , his backers came up with some healthy pluses.
