The U.S. was at last paying attention to some of the critics of its Latin America policy . Last week it agreed for the first time to grant Latin American nations long-term loans , repayable in soft currencies , for such social-and visible-ends as slum clearance , schools , hospitals , and land reform . The Administration will ask Congress when it reconvenes in August for $500 million or more for loans to better the lot of the hemisphere 's peoples . The policy reverses the Eisenhower Administration 's previous insistence on hard-currency loans , to be spent mostly on U.S.-made equipment for economic enterprises . <P> Along with the switch of policy , the White House downgraded Roy Richard Rubottom , Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs , to the post of Ambassador to Argentina . During Ru-bottom 's tenure , U.S. handling of Latin American relations has consisted chiefly of making , upon the arrival of a crisis , some concession that the U.S. previously vowed not to make . Item : for years the Latin American nations that rely largely on coffee for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international control over wild price fluctuations . In January 1958 Assistant Secretary Rubottom announced that price support would be " unwieldy and unworkable " ; in May Vice President Nixon was stoned in Peru and Venezuela ; the following month the U.S. joined an international coffee study program . Now , in offering $500 million worth of help for social needs , the U.S. has made a similar about-face , on the heels of new fears that the influence of Nikita Khrushchev may spread across the neglected hemisphere . The trouble with this policy is that the U.S. pays the bills but its enemies get the credit for spurring it into action . <P> Angry at the policy shortcomings that made him the target of Latin American stones , spit and insults , Vice President Nixon tried to get rid of Rubottom when he returned from his 1958 trip . The Assistant Secretary was saved by the intervention of ' his longtime friend Milton Eisenhower , but now Dwight Eisenhower is alarmed at the setbacks the U.S. has suffered in Latin America . One recent influence on Ike is Peru 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House last month , who argues that the U.S. should help meet some of Latin America 's social needs-though he agrees that Latin Americans must do more for themselves . The U.S. is preparing to grant Peru $25 million in loans for housing and land reform . <P> Rubottom 's successor will be Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thomas C. Mann . He has served as embassy counselor in Guatemala and Ambassador to El Salvador . He is credited with drawing up the plan for U.S. participation in the international coffee agreement .
