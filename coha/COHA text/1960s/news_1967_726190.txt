txt The commander in chief of the United States armed forces has ordered more pressure on the opponent in Vietnam . He goes to Guam in order to plan operations . The very fact that no spectacular announcement is likely , that the White House cautions against expecting one at Guam , is part of the grim , military decor of the talks . This is described as a business conference , mostly military business . Its object , as President Johnson steadily reminds his hearers , is not war but peace . His advisers point out that another round of diplomatic peace efforts has just ended in stalemate . The President thereupon made a firm decision . He will not yield to those who want him to pay a military cost  --  by halting the bombing of North Vietnam  --  in return for a nonmilitary step by Hanoi : the presumed willingness to sit down at a table and talk . Military readiness So " measured " escalation has begun again , with new targets for bombing in the North and more aggressive operations in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . And the commander in chief goes to the Pacific theater , to a military base , to perform his function of command . The President is understood to have three objects . ? One is to plan the use , for the first time , of an American array of forces that now are large enough , toughened and experienced by combat , and sufficiently well supplied to do a job . Until recently , Gen. William C. Westmoreland did not have this degree of readiness and much of his energy went into the build-up . He i.ow is set to go . The new strategy and tactics are already being tried out . Newspaper reporters on the scene are part skeptical , part impressed . ? A second aim is to restore the national credibility : to demonstrate to Hanoi that despite political differences at home , even prominent ones , the United States will not flinch from what it considers to be a policing task . - The presence of the commander in chief at Guam is calculated to show that he and the President are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain point , the President has full power to act abroad . What he orders will be done . ? The third objective is political . The President has steadily intensified his effoils to encourage civilian self-government in South Vietnam , as a specific means of making freedom real to the villagers and giving them an attractive alternative to rule by the Viet Cong . Progress toward what he describes as self-help , both in government and economic development , will be reviewed at Guam . At present it is not planned to have South Vietnamese officials on hand ? which some have considered significant because the present military rulers are soon to transfer many of their functions to elected ' officials . So the Guam conference is not expected to take its place in the series of political spectaculars which began with the Honolulu conference a year ago , and continued at Manila last fall , laying down a charter for the political policy of the United States and the government at Saigon. - Showdown avoided But the most delicate phase of the " other war " is at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent assembly in Saigon that the military regime will , in fact , yield a significant part of its power to a new civil government . And the military leaders , for their part , are reserving their position carefully and seem determined not to let the war effort be undermined by any softness or muddle on the political front . The United States is known to be working discreetly to avoid a confrontation or showdown , and to produce a constructive adjust . ment between the two . Deep-lying suspicions on both sides have to be moderated . The White House knows that the Saigon military has the power of coup d ' ? tat , but so do the military forces of the United States have the ultimate power , if it comes to that . Within these bounds of decision , any con. elusions or attitudes of the President developed at Guam could swing the balance in the coming summer and fall months of political maneuver , at Saigon . Since the President 's intent is believed to be that of impressing Hanoi  --  and Peking and Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pursuit of peace , the American power center at Guam is said to have been selected with this in mind .
