On occasion , President Johnson has attended Sunday morning worship services at St. Mark 's Episcopal Church in Washington , where , like most of the congregation , he goes to the altar rail to receive Holy Communion . But Lyndon Johnson is not an Episcopalian ( although his wife and daughters are ) , and a confirmation rubric of the book of Common Prayer states that " none be admitted to the Holy Communion until such time as he be confirmed , or be ready and desirous to be confirmed . " Rev. Albert du Bois , executive director of the stiffly Anglo-Catholic American Church Union , questions whether Johnson is entitled to Communion . <P> Writing in the monthly American Church News , Canon du Bois admits that the President " is undoubtedly receiving Communion at Episcopal altars in good faith and in sincerity . " Nonetheless , he argues that priests who have admitted non-Episcopalians to Communion make it difficult for the clergy , " who wish to maintain the church 's law and discipline but who do not wish to make an issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President ought to legalize things by presenting himself to a bishop for confirmation . <P> Theologically speaking , the Protestant Episcopal Church has always been a " closed Communion " faith , in contrast to the Disciples of Christ , to which Johnson belongs , and many other Protestant groups that welcome all baptized Christians to the altar . The Episcopal reasoning is that people should not receive the sacrament together if they do not agree on what it signifies . But observance of the confirmation rubric varies widely from church to church , and two Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Bishops ( 1920 and 1930 ) have stated that it does not " necessarily apply . " Only about two-thirds of the nation 's 3,587,000 Episcopalians have gone through the ceremony of confirmation , in which they testify to their belief before a bishop and receive the laying on of hands . Few priests would ever refuse Communion to a stranger , *although most churches will not allow uncon firmed members to assume lay offices . <P> In any case , Johnson is not likely to get turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diocese that favors open Communion . Bishop William Creighton says that " the President , of course , is welcome to receive Holy Communion in our churches . " <P> <P> *Unconfirmed children , at the now-popular family service , can approach the altar with their parents , cross their arms and receive the priest 's blessing instead of the consecrated bread and wine .
