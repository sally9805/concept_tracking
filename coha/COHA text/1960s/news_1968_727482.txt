txt The flight from the franc gained momentum today and the French Government studied new measures to tighten credit . As in Britain , worried owners of the national currency were increasingly turning it into gold and , even more , into German marks . The volume of gold trading on the Bourse here jumped to $6-million today from $4-million yesterday and $1-million normally . The price , essentially dictated by the London market . rose from $39.98 an ounce to S40.07. the highest in weeks . Gold coins , the refuge of small hoarders , rose more sharply . Much larger sums arc understood to have been invested in gold and marks through Swiss banks . Despite denials from the West German Government , speculators were betting that the mark would soon be revalued . They assumed that Bonn was under heavy pressure from Washington , London and Paris to raise its exchange rate to stem the flood of dollars , pounds and francs into West Germany . This has heightened interest in the meeting of Western monetary authorities next Sunday in Basel , Switzerland . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has succeeded in holding prices stable while inflation has been growing in the United States , Britain and , since last June , France . As a result , German exports have become relatively cheaper and foreign goods relatively dearer , so money has flowed steadily into German vaults . Specula. - tion has turned this flow into a flood . Reserves Ebb Fast French official reserves of gold and foreign exchange dropped nearly $27-million , to $4.24-billion , in the last week reported , which ended Nov. 7 . The actual outflow , however , is thought to be running several times that rate . Under the " swap " arrangement between the Bank of France and other central banks , currencies may be temporarily exchanged without publicity . They show up on the books as assets instead of liabilities . Financial opinion here accepts , at least for the immediate future , the Government 's assurance that there will be no devaluation of the franc . There was agreement with President de Gaulle 's comment yesterday that this would be " the worst possible absurdity . " Rueff Chides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devaluation , several experts said this cure would not work unless it was accompanied by measures to stop the march of in flation  --  that is , the printing of new money . The economist Jacques Rueff , often described as President de Gaulle 's mentor on monetary problems , chided the Bank of France today for its recent policy of easy money . He pointed out that the drain of nearly $3-billion in gold from France since the troubles of last June had been offset almost exactly by new credits issued by the Bank of France . In effect , the bank was putting out paper to replace the vanishing gold . The general strike of last spring brought a sudden increase of well over one-tenth in the nation 's wage bill and a sharp increase in Government spending . This resulted in higher prices , higher consumption and a strong recovery of business ? not strong enough , however , to put much of a dent in unemployment , which is rather arbitrarily estimated at 500 , - 000 . This factor and the need to avoid new causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To protect the franc , the Government applied selective restraints on credits . On Tuesday the Bank of France not only raised its discount rate but also began to limit amounts of funds granted to borrowers . As a result some borrowers today had to pay 9.25 and ** cent interest for credit while others were paying nearly 2 per cent less on similar security . With the outflow of francs continuing , the Government was reported to be studying new measures , among them curbs on the terms and volume of installment credit and an extension of the cheap credit for exports that is scheduled to expire Jan. 1 . Its continuation would require the approval of France 's Common Market partners , and might bring on retaliatory action from Washington .
