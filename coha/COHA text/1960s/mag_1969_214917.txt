San Francisco State once ranked among the top public colleges in the U.S. It is now a sad symbol of the American campus destroying itself . All sides can share the blame : the minority-group students who made extravagant " nonnegotiable " demands , the divided faculty , the administrators who temporized , the hard-line trustees , the police who broke S.F. 's bloody student strike last winter at a cost of 120 casualties and more than 730 arrests . The past , though , is less important than the future : Is the violence finally under control ? <P> In a report on the traumatic events at the college , a study group of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence warned last week that " the story of San Francisco State is an unfinished story . " Though an uneasy peace prevails , said the group , the deeply rooted problems underlying the crisis at S.F. State and many other colleges remain unsolved . Those problems include " longstanding social and economic injustices and inequities " and the reluctance of those in authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The study group is pessimistic about S.F. State-and any other U.S. college headed for the same vortex . The group urges California officials to launch " a thorough review of the whole spectrum of present educational policy , especially as to admission qualifications and content of curriculum . " Better communication among the different elements of the college is also vital : " Steps must be taken to bring president , faculty and students truly together in critical periods . " Without such reforms , said the group , the future is bleak : " An overriding public opinion may force the conversion of San Francisco State and other colleges into screened and guarded camps , institutions of learning in name only and in reality isolated from the mainstream of American life .
