The Nazi Duke of Coburg made several visits during the mid-1930s to his second cousin , Britain 's new King Edward VIII . Once , the royal cousins chatted " with pipe at the fireside " in Windsor Castle , another time at tea in Buckingham Palace with Mary , the Queen Mother . <P> The talks roused little interest at the time , and were soon overshadowed by the melodrama of Edward 's abdication in order to marry " the woman I love ' ' - the twice-divorced American socialite , Wallis Warfield Simpson . Since then , the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , growing paler and frailer with the passage of years , have drifted from Portugal to the West Indies , from Manhattan to Paris . Their pastimes have been the trifling ones of showing up at balls , growing roses . <P> " Who Is King Here ? " But last week the long-forgotten chats of the Duke of Coburg were making headlines in London newspapers as the German aristocrat was revealed also as a special emissary sent by Hitler to Britain because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations appeared in the latest batch of captured Nazi documents published jointly last week by the British , French and U.S. governments . Coburg 's " Strictly Confidential " report was addressed " Only for the Fhrer and Party Member v. Ribbentrop ( No Copy ) , " and said of Edward VIII that " for him a German-British alliance is an urgent necessity and a guiding principle of British foreign policy . " Coburg eagerly suggested that discussions about future relations be held between Hitler and Britain 's Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin . The King , said Coburg , " replied in the following words : ' Who is King here , Baldwin or I ? I , myself , wish to talk to Hitler and will do so here or in Germany . Tell him that , please . ' " <P> Britain 's Interests . The charge of pro-German sympathies has often been made against the German-descended Duke of Windsor , most notably after the publication of other captured Nazi documents five years ago . The London Daily Express dismissed the late Duke of Coburg 's account as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi , spreading news he knew would be welcome in Berlin . " <P> But the Daily Mirror 's columnist Cassandra seemed convinced of Windsor 's " close and cordial relationships with the Nazi regime . " <P> At week 's end the Duke of Windsor , now 68 , denied most-but not all-of the published reports . " They give a generally false impression , " he declared in a statement issued by his secretary in France , adding : " It must be remembered that the Duke , with the majority of the people who had the interests of Great Britain at heart , was striving for some understanding with Germany .
