Walter Francis Dillingham was proud of being a karnaaina ( oldtimer ) and he loved Hawaii 's traditions . He seldom appeared without an orchid in his lapel , and he was pleased that the women of his family learned to do the hula . Yet , for all his fondness for the old ways , Dillingham probably did more to mold a modern Hawaii than any other man . And when he died last week at 88 , the islands mourned the loss of " Uncle Walter , " who in a sense had been patriarch to a whole state . <P> The first Dillingham in the islands was Walter 's father-Benjamin Franklin Dillingham , first officer on a clipper ship out of San Francisco . In Honolulu on shore leave in 1865 , he fell off a horse , broke his leg , and settled down for life . Benjamin bought a hardware store , married a missionary 's daughter , had four children . In 1888 the ambitious ex-sailor got a royal franchise from King Kalakaua to build a narrow-gauge railroad to haul sugar cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " Dillingham 's Folly . " But it was a huge success , became a key first step in the Dillingham family 's development of the islands . <P> On a Shoestring . A decade later , Benjamin tried another railroad on the big island of Hawaii . This one was indeed a folly , wound up putting the Dillinghams $4,000,000 in debt-a bigger deficit than the entire Territory of Hawaii had at the time . Walter was called home from Harvard in 1900 to help straighten out the mess , and when Benjamin 's health failed , he took over the business . <P> Creditors hounded him so much , Walter recalled , that he used to hide under desks to avoid them , took to meeting the trains himself so he could " collect fares to pay a few creditors the next day . " But as he fought to pull the family out of debt , Walter had his own ideas . In 1902 he borrowed $5,000 to start the Hawaiian Dredging Co. - something he himself considered " strictly a shoestring venture .

Walter Dillingham used the muck dragged up from the sea to fill in low , marshy areas around Honolulu , over the years created 5,000 acres of solid ground that now holds a full third of the city 's population , is valued at upwards of $280 million . Most valuable of all is a section that before 1925 was nothing but a narrow sand crescent , covered with foul-smelling flotsam and surrounded by 1,000 acres of swamp . Dillingham 's men slashed a two-mile canal through the marshes , and drained the area . It is now called Waikiki Beach . <P> Dillingham 's enterprises grew to be worth at least $150 million , and the family 's influence in Hawaii was unsurpassed . During World War II , when Franklin Roosevelt wanted to know about the situation in Hawaii , he phoned Walter Dillingham . When President Eisenhower visited the islands , he stepped off his plane , looked about and immediately asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
