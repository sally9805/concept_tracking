Boston men call it the " snake pit . " To their wives and daughters , it is the " fabulous FABB . " By any name , Filene 's Automatic Bargain Basement is the town 's most riotous mob scene since the Boston Massacre . <P> Filene 's has been in business for 61 years , and is testament to the curious fever that infects bargain hunters . Driven by the notion that they are saving while spending , they not only buy more than they need but , as Basement General Merchandise Manager James Gormley says , " they end up spending more money than they would normally . " Each day throngs of shoppers-as many as 200,000 at Christmas time-surge through the store 's three dungeon-like underground levels , fighting for everything from name-brand nylon panties at 39 a pair to a Russian sable worth $8,500 and a positive steal at $3,000 . As the outlet for surplus stock from such fashionable stores as Saks Fifth Avenue , Neiman-Marcus and I. Magnin , the basement has become the happy hunting ground for Beacon Hill dowagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly in from New York , Philadelphia , Washington , and as far west as Chicago . <P> No newcomer , though , is any match for the Boston supershoppers . Money pinned to their bras , they spend part of every business day prowling the basement 's depths while TV cameras and store detectives with walkie-talkies watch . Though some supershoppers resell their bargains at a profit , the most sophisticated brave the basement for the thrill of the hunt . Such is Mrs. Josephine Conroy of Needham , Mass. , an attractive , smartly attired ( all in Filene 's bargains ) grandmother . <P> Hooked on Filene 's , she spends at least one hour each day in the basement " poking around . " She explains , " It 's a challenge to see how well you know your merchandise , your materials , your designers . You have to leave your courtesy at home and get there and mix it up like a longshoreman . But the joy of finding a really good bargain is worth it . " One typical joyful day during last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her two daughters , Terry , 27 , a Spanish teacher at the State College at Boston , and Mariann , 23 , a housewife , meet at Colstone 's Restaurant in The Hub . Huddled conspiratorily over their coffee , they plot the day 's assault . " Terry , " says Mrs. Conroy , " you hit the $6.95 dress sale . Mariann , you head directly for that special on pants suits . I 'll case the men 's department . " <P> 9:05 . Manager Gormley leaves his office to make last-minute checks with some of 800 employees . Eying crowds jammed behind restraining ropes at 13 entrances , he makes certain that nearby telephones are removed from their cradles . On more than one occasion , tense shoppers have stampeded when they mistook a phone ring for the gong announcing basement 's opening . <P> 9:30 . Opening gong sounds . Conroys , now at front of crowd , fan out through basement . Other women come running and dodging like halfbacks from all directions , swiveling past pyramids of shoes ( $4.95 ) , bins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique copper lanterns ( $25 ) . " As you 're running , " explains Mrs. Conroy later , " you have to keep one eye up to spot the sizes and one eye down to make sure someone is n't trying to trip you . "
