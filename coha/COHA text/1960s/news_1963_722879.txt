txt Washington In his State of the Union message President Kennedy has declared  --  to a Congress more receptive than last year 's ? that the tide of world events is finally running favorable to the free-world alliance . But he immediately adopted the stance once taken by Sir Winston Churchill , declaring with an eye on the sluggish economic front , that " we have only begun . " To energize the economy he asked for tax cuts totalling $13,500,000,000 , phased over three calendar years . He proposed tax reforms to produce $3,500,000,000 . President Kennedy 's whole 5,500-word message  --  delivered in person to Congress ? was cautiously optimistic . The Cuba crisis had been surmounted , the Western powers are growing in strength , the Soviet-China alliance has been sundered , he noted . But again he warned that the price of victory would be costly ? more defense spending , a continuing foreign-aid program . On the domestic side he proposed a medicare program , federal aid to transportation , a domestic peace corps . Progress Reported " We shall be judged more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , " he commented . President Kennedy will spell out his proposals more specifically in his budget message Thursday , the economic report next Monday , and a major tax message immediately following . While Congress applauded this report given halfway through Mr. Kennedy 's elected term , he is certain to draw Republican fire because Cuba is still in Castro hands , the budget is rising , and there is no end to costly foreign aid . Summing up the world situation President Kennedy observed : " Steady progress has been made in building a world of order . The people of West Berlin remain both free and secure . A settlement , though still precarious , has been reached in Laos . The spearpoint of aggression has been blunted in Vietnam . The end of agony may be in sight in the Congo . The doctrine of troika is dead . And , while danger continues , a deadly threat has been removed from Cuba . " iCuts Spelled Out But the President warned that " this is the side of the hill , not the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , we must expand the long-run strength of our economy . " To remedy the drag of a tax system " designed to check inflation in earlier years , ( which ) now checks growth instead , " the President proposed this tax reduction formula : 1 . A. cut of $11,000,000,000 in individual income taxes , reducing the tax rate , now ranging from 20 percent to 91 percent , down to 14 percent and 65 percent . 2 . A reduction in corporate rates of $2,500,000,000 ? from 52 per rent to the permanent pre-Korean level of .47 percent . Stopgap Shift These reductions , phased over three years , would begin in 1963 with a cut of some $6 , - 000,000,000 . Structural changes and reforms , beginning in 1964 , would broaden the tax base , end some unspecified preferences , and in general offset some $3,500,000,000 of the revenue loss . Budgetary receipts would also be increased at the outset by shifting the tax payments of larger corporations to a more current time schedule , thus handing the treasury $1,500 , - 000,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula would increase the federal deficit , but insisted this would be only temporary . He assured that his new fiscal ' 64 budget would be cut below this year 's levels except for defense , space , and interest on the national debt , which would be higher . On the foreign front , President Kennedy remarked that the United States has recently doubled its space program and " undertaken the most far-reaching defense improvements " in peacetime history . He saw four special avenues of opportunity and challenge ahead : The Atlantic Alliance , where " ways must be found to increase the role of our partners in planning , manning and directing a truly multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate NATO alliance . " The developing nations , which are beginning to realize " that our approach to their diverse needs is resilient and resourceful , while the Communists are still relying on ancient doctrines and dogmas . " The new Sino-Soviet difficulties , The search for peace . Here President Kennedy said vigorously " I foresee no spectacular reversal in Communist methods or goals . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union to walk the path of peace , then let her know that all free nations will journey ? with her . " Kennedy proposals detailed : Page 16.
