Center of attraction at Britain 's Farnborough air show last week was none of the fast new aircraft roaring overhead but an 11-ft. groundling : the first publicly displayed model of the 100-passenger , Mach 2.2 Super Caravelle that British Aircraft Corp . and France 's Sud Aviation propose to build jointly . Though design of the delta-wing plane is completed and current plans call for flight tests in 1966 , final approval of the project is yet to come from the British and French governments . <P> There is still plenty of argument about whether that approval should be given , since development of the Super Caravelle is expected to cost in the neighborhood of $560 million . Some British planemakers say that the money would be better spent increasing the all-weather reliability of existing subsonic aircraft . But with U.S. planemakers working toward a Mach 3 airliner and Russian competition in supersonic air transport only a matter of time , BAG and Sud Aviation argue that the Super Caravelle is needed to assure Europe a continuing role in the long-haul civil aviation industry .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
