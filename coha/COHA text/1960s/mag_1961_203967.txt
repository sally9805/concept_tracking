French Composer Francis Poulenc has a favorite religious scene : the painting by Andrea Mantegna ( 1431-1506 ) in one corner of which a small rabbit crouches unaware of the tragedy being unfolded on the Mount of Olives behind him . It is the kind of light but not irreverent touch that Roman Catholic Poulenc himself strives for in many of his religious works . Last week the Boston Symphony introduced U.S. audiences to the latest and perhaps most contrast-filled of Poulenc 's compositions-his Gloria , in which he says he tried " to write a joyous hymn to the glory of God . " <P> If the piece suggests Mantegna in mood , it is closer to a modern painter in manner . " The colors , " says Poulenc , " are very clear , primary colors-rude and violent like the Provence chapel of Matisse . " Scored for chorus , soprano , and a sort of celestial band of horns and strings , Poulenc 's 25-minute Gloria proved to be a work of sharply profiled contrasts , at times deeply reverent ( in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times mischievous and almost jazzy . Among its memorable moments : the opening of the second section , " Laudamus Te , " with the dissonant cry of French horns followed by the syncopated chanting of the chorus ; the movingly lyric third section with its bell-like soprano solo . " Domine Deus " ; the quietly majestic ending in a mood of " pity and peace . " <P> Poulenc wrote Gloria , as he writes all of his music , in his 16th century country home in Touraine , because " like wine , which can grow only in its own soil , I can compose only in France . " Originally , he intended it for one of his favorite singers , Italian Soprano Rosanna Carteri ( " She has a voice with lipstick and powder " ) , but at the work 's premiere the principal part was sung by U.S. Negro Soprano Adele Addison , who so impressed Poulenc that he interrupted a rehearsal to shout : " Parfait ! Parfait ! La perfection ! " Poulenc plans to write a new opera for La Scala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , for a male chorus and children 's chorus , to be performed at the opening of Manhattan 's Lincoln Center . Both will be " completely , completely , completely different " from what he has done before . " Every age of man has its music , " says Composer Poulenc . " Now that I am 62 , my music is very lyric and tragic-it is my maturity . "
