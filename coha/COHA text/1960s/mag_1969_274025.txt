Paul McCracken , the President 's chief economist , rather charitably calls that tense period of waiting and watching " the awkward months . " Last week , seven months after Washington 's policymakers set the anti-inflationary course of tight money and tough budgeting , there were indications that the economic slowdown is starting . <P> By the yardstick that is most apparent to Americans-prices-the economic situation is more alarming than ever . The Labor Department reported last week that consumer prices spurted at an annual rate of 7.2% in June , double May 's increase . The rise was led by the higher cost of food , particularly meat . But prices should begin to slow down later this year as lagging beef and pork production picks up , and as unsustainably high rises in services and medical costs taper off . Clothing and furniture prices should level out this month . Nevertheless , over the past twelve months , the dollar has shrunk in value to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ib. for round steak and 48 a lb. for tomatoes . Admittedly , he is more able than before to foot the bill . After declining for some time , the average U.S. worker 's real purchasing power has begun to climb because most wage increases are now exceeding rises in the cost of living .

But tight money and prospects of less exuberant demand have begun to change boardroom thinking . The Business Council expects that spending will increase only 11% this year and probably much less in 1970 . Robert Tyson , U.S. Steel 's Finance Committee chairman , concedes that the scarcity of credit may force cutbacks in 1970 . " If you do n't have the money , you ca n't spend it , " says he . " It is as simple as that . " <P> Lower Yields . In general , only companies with earnings problems are actually cutting their 1969 spending . Chrysler Corp. , whose earnings plunged 51% last quarter , has deeply slashed its $300 million capital-spending plans for 1969 .
