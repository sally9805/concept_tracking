Mi Yglesias ' current work is The Goodbye Land ( Pantheon ) . While more than 700 members of the press attended the daytime screenings ? of Lincoln Center 's New York Film Festival features at Philharmonic Hall , and while the hordes of paying customers crowded the shows that began at 6.30 in the evening , a very special group queued up three and tour times a day for free tickets to the documentaries being shown at the 212-seat auditorium of the Library of the Performing Arts . Young film makers , buffs , students , social-minded intellectuals ( the men without beards had superb , varied sideburns ) made up most of those who came a good hour in advance when the tickets for each event were distributed an unorthodox-looking crowd and perhaps the most sophisticated , nonviolent , humane group you can get together in New York these days . Yet their anxiety about being on time for tickets and about getting into the theatre as soon as the doors opened ? not just their anxiousness but also their lively , downright un-American way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panic Obviously , they wished the whole program of " The Social Film in Cinema " had not taken place As if to prove the guards right , the early evening show on the third day , which included a Cuban-made documentary on the American Negro and another , made here , on Malcolm X , was interrupted by the New York City pobomb had been placed in the auditolice , who had received a report that a A ? rium . An unusual scene was enacted : the cops were polite , the audience im I pertinent . A lieutenant announced a valuable jewel had been lost , in order not to alarm the gathering , the audiience answered that there is no such thing as a valuable jewel and most refused to look under their seats as they were requested . Two young Negro militants in front of me were particularly t indignant , and one called out " If this movie were not about blacks , you would not have dared to stop no ' And all of us , of course , agreed . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably unnoticed by most  --  at least in its most astonishing detail . Jerry Stoll 's Sons and Daughters , an account of the Berkeley students ' antiwar demonstrations , cut frequently to lines of police holding their clubs in both hands behind their hacks  --  his variation of the Potemkin-steps sequence  --  and each time we all hissed with gusto , only to find as the hissing THE NATioN/Ociober 23 , 1967 died down that some one had been clapping from the back of the auditorium all the while . It was no surprise to make out in the dark auditorium the uniform of a security guard . Nor even , when one thought about it sadly , that he was a Negro , a martinet who had been the most officious and outraged of those out in the lobby . The twenty " events " of the series  --  not all were films ; some were panel discussions and interviews with directors  --  allowed for more audience reaction than applause and hissing . Some of the audience , of course , seemed to have come for just that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compliment to the pertinence and liveliness of the films and panelists that most who asked questions or announced their film credos from their seats were responding to broader imperatives . They were concerned about the subject of the film and whether each film maker 's aesthetics qualified as the best way to get at the truth of the scene , or they were simply curious about how some scene had been shot . These interests tended to discourage verbal exhibitionists , and when that did n't work , the audience asked them to shut up : no one was disposed to suffer fools gladly . There were never empty seats for film showings  --  in the case of Black Natchez and The Titicut Follies , hundreds were turned away  --  but it was surprising to see the auditorium filled for panel discussions . At 1:30 one afternoon there was an overflow audience for a discussion ( with illustrations ) of " Reality Cinema : Whose Truth ? " The enthusiasm was understandable , since the panel included David Maysles and Don Pennebaker , directors whose work might be classed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Wasserman and Harold Mayer , whose work for television is perforce more conventional . Maysles felt his work was sufficiently known to the audience , but each of the other three showed a sequence from one of his films , Pennebaker showing a complete short work on the wedding of Timothy Leary Whereas in his full-length feature on Bob Dylan , Never Look Back , that had recently opened in New York , Pennebaker followed the subject without cutting away , often switch-panning dizzily ; for the Leary picture he had two cameras running simultaneously , so that what looked like cutting , he explained , was not That is , it was no violation of his aesthetics that a sequence of Leary getting into his tuxedo is followed by his bride having her hair done in another room at the house at Milbrook , for both events happened at the same THE NATION/October 23 , 1967 time and were so caught by Pennebaker 's synchronized cameras . Pennebaker felt that this method allowed him to be true to what was happening , though the shifting back and forth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editing . Pennebaker then explained why he did n't want his films to be called documentaries . Documentaries search out all the data that can be obtained about a particular subject and present them to the audience . Whereas he ( Maysles nodded approvingly throughout Pennebaker 's comments ) only collected what his camera caught , he did n't know whether it was correct or not . Maysles went on : " I am not interested in truth , " he said . A well-dressed lady in the audience , who was not as young as she perhaps imagined , explained , while Pennebaker and Maysles approved , that " their " generation responded to such films almost intuitively , not as to the " manipulated " documentaries , because spontaneity was bred in the bone with them . " As if the jam session for us is . . . " she said , and completed the idea with a gesture of one hand . By this time Wasserman and Mayer were on the defensive . Earlier , Wasserman had volunteered that in the sequence he 'd shown of Hoffa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience in the hall after the session was over in order to get reaction shots that his camera had not caught at the time Hoffa was speaking . In other words , he had staged some of the shots in order to be true to the range of response which had been there in the union meeting . Pennebaker and Maysles had - listened to that without comment , but when the audience seemed theirs , Pennebaker explained that he could never do that . " I would n't think of asking Dylan to walk through a doorway again because I had n't caught it the first time . " There were murmurs of approval . At this moment Pauline Kael , sitting in the audience , decided to ask Pennebaker a couple of questions . First , she wanted to know what the sequence of Dylan singing to sharecroppers was doing in the midst of his film about Dylan 's English tour . He explained that some other film maker had sent it to him and that when he was editing his film he simply spliced it in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright smile . " I 've never taken it out . " " In other words , " Miss Kael said , " your aesthetics shifts too . " Both Maysles and Pennebaker had stated several times that their films do not depend for interest on the fact that , say , Timothy Leary is the subject . Miss Kael pointed out that Pennebaker had done Marlon Brando , Bob Dylan , now Leary , and Pennebaker insisted that though he was interested in the people he 'd filmed , who they were was of no importance . Miss Kael then asked if Dylan was 11 ; s idea or if Dylan 's manager had first suggested it . Pennebaker said the manager had approached him first , but that this made no difference . " It looked to me like A Hero Is Born , " Miss Kael said , " what with all the halo lighting . " Pennebaker 's smile was pained but he gallantly replied , " if that is the case , it is my fault . " Miss Kael was marvelously relentless : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film about Norman Mailer .. ? " It was fortunate that the discussion cleared the air about cinema verite because it made obvious that the departure from conventional narration of some of the exciting documentaries exhibited was due more to lightweight sound and camera equipment than to theory . Films like Warrendale ( a moving , beautifully made one about disturbed children ) and The Titicut Follies ( a muckraking look at a Massachusetts jail for the criminally insane ) are the more powerful because they are able to let the people filmed speak for themselves . Even some of the television documentaries , still adhering to the old form , like Lay My Burden Down and The Mills Of the Gods , when they move in for a close look , can achieve an intimacy and unstaged quality that is extraordinarily moving . It is still the subject and what the director ( who must continue to be interested in editing ) makes of it that matters . What these young and not-soyoung documentary film makers are doing , if the festival program can he trusted , is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sons and Daughters is a superb account of the impasse which peaceful opposition to the war has reached ; as is Ed Pincus and David Neuman 's Black Natchez a devastating picture of the black freedom movement 's failures  --  in which they have the courage to show Charles Evers and the NAACP as the " bad guys . " In Lay My Burden Down , Jack Willis went to the Selma area one year after the march and showed how conditions have worsened for the Negro ; it contains one sequence about a Negro sharecropper family , so beautiful and intimate , that you can not shake it off . That they can now get almost anything down on film and on the sound track can be an easy temptation for young film makers : they seem not to want to let go . They can be repetitive and , for want of narration , let their story line flounder . Exposure to audiences is how these directors can learn . but that 1S exactly what their films are not getting . The lucky ones get shown on New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  how many can not be accommodated anywhere ? A young man named Peter Adair made a film called The Holy Ghost People about the snake-handling religious sect in West Virginia , and proved how much is to be gotten from a close look at people ? even people from whom one might have thought it better to look the other way . I stood in line with Mr. Adair on another day , waiting to get into a panel event , and asked him if he had plans for a new film . " Oh , I have many projects , " he said , " but no money . It takes more time to raise the money than to make the films . It 's a drag . I have decided to give up the whole thing many times . " Behind us the line for the next documentary got so long it turned the corner . A pity some exhibitor was not there to see that documentary programs might fill his theatre .               @ @ @ @ @ @
