A ) a leading member of Australia 's Communist Party , Novelist Frank Hardy returned from his first trip to Russia in 1951 with a panegyric of Stalin and all his works . Hardy went back to the Soviet Union after the Czechoslovak crisis to report for the London Sunday Times on the country 's postinvasion mood . This time , no longer an admirer of the late Soviet dictator , he returned with a chilling account of a resurgence of Stalinism . Wrote Hardy last week : " The old methods of administrative pressure , blanket censorship and even naked terror are on their way back . " <P> Shortly after Hardy arrived in Moscow , Poet Evgeny Evtushenko , an old friend , came round to his hotel . " We meet at a moment of truth , " Evtushenko told him . " I wrote to my government to oppose the action in Czechoslovakia . <P> Now they say I am the enemy of the state . To whom shall I write ? " Hardy says that Evtushenko was forced to delete 80 previously published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scarcely alone among Soviet writers in his opposition to the invasion . The hard-lining officials of the Writers Union , he reports , were unable to gather enough signatures for a declaration supporting the Soviet action . A compromise letter was finally produced , much milder in tone and with only 34 signers - out of a union membership of 6,600 writers . <P> In Moscow , as in other world capitals , the rumor was that the Soviet leaders in the Politburo disagreed over the invasion of Czechoslovakia . " The main Moscow gossip , " writes Hardy , " concerns the division over the Czechoslovak invasion . Three out of eleven are said to have opposed it . " <P> The three : Premier Aleksei Kosygin , Trade Union Head Aleksandr Shelepin , and Party Secretary Mikhail Suslov . <P> Hardy reports another intriguing rumor about Russia 's deposed ruler : " Khrushchev himself , when told of the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia , said to friends , ' I believe that the 1956 intervention in Hungary was justified - but I cried for three days after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not cry . ' " <P> Whatever the differences among the Soviet leaders may have been , Hardy is unequivocal about the outcome : " Stalin 's heirs occupy all the positions of power . Like Stalin , they fear the people and the truth . They created the Czechoslovak crisis and used it to intimidate the positive forces which oppose them at home . " <P> " I had liked to believe , " says Hardy , " that the younger generation growing up would transform the situation until a Leningrad writer told me : That 's where you are wrong . The older neo-Stalinists are dreadfully mistaken , but you can struggle against them because they believe in something . The younger ones coming up believe in nothing-except their own power and privilege . ' It is a bleak thought , the older bureaucrats poisoned with Stalinism , the younger with cynicism .
