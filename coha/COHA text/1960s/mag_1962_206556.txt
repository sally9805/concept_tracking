In 1933 The New Yorker carried a memorable cartoon showing two coal miners looking up goggle-eyed , and one exclaiming : " For gosh sakes . here comes Mrs. Roosevelt . " It was hilarious if only because it was so true : soon afterward Eleanor Roosevelt indeed descended into a coal mine . In those days she had not yet become controversial : to her critics she was a gadabout and do-gooder , to her admirers she was a dedicated friend of the oppressed , and to everyone , she was a marvel of omnipresent vitality . Later she aroused stronger passions ; she was both hated and loved . But she outlived most of the controversy and became the world 's most admired and most talked-about woman . To the world , she was Eleanor . <P> As Eleanor , she wrote her own legend . She often mentioned her ugly-duckling childhood . She sadly recalled how she was ruled by a domineering mother-in-law . She constantly spoke of her innate shyness . She presented an image of sweet uncomplicated Eleanor , who occasionally oversimplified quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all humanity . She never wrote " I think . . . " ; she always wrote " I feel . . . " But in nurturing this legend , Eleanor Roosevelt did herself an injustice . She did feel-but she also thought . And she had one of the sharpest intellects that the U.S. has known . Did she know what she wanted ?

Although she never lived to see it , she was until the day of her death the most effective advocate of welfare-state equalitarianism . <P> Eleanor cared nothing about female fashion or protocol . She could happily journey off to England for a visit with King George and Queen Elizabeth , Queen Mother Mary , and the Winston Churchills carrying just one evening dress , two day dresses , one suit and a few blouses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park with a hot dog and mustard picnic-that was real Americanism . She knew she was homely , so she scorned lipstick and powder , always considered comb and hairbrush sufficient . <P> Girlhood Granny . Yet , simple as she tried to portray herself , she was a complicated woman with an agonizingly complex background . Her mother , Mrs. Anna Hall Roosevelt , was a beautiful lady with little capacity for motherhood . Eleanor remembered standing in the parlor doorway at home as a child , " often with my finger in my mouth . " and hearing her mother tell visitors : " She is such a funny child , so old-fashioned that we always call her Granny . " Recalled Eleanor , " I wanted to sink through the floor in shame .
