txt Letters to The Times T. 46 Letters to The Times Developing Italy 's South Official ? Says Region Participates in Boom TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read only today in The New York Times of Sept. 14 Arnaldo Cortesi 's story from Naples which was headlined " Many Italians Question Merits of Program to Develop South . " In pointing out that due to the different rates of growth registered in northern and southern Italy the gap between these two regions has grown even - wider despite efforts made in the last 12 years , Mr. Cortesi fails to bring out certain facts essential tor a correct evaluation of the results achieved . In the first place , it should be recalled that this gap had been growing wider for almost one century in Italy 's history . This provides a measure of the efforts required to reverse this trend . In the second place , it must be pointed out that the gap has been widening at - a slower rate than in the past and , more important still , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not sufficient to report that over , the last 12 years per capita income in the south has been increasing at slightly more than 3 per cent a year  --  already an appreciable result if compared to the growth rates of any underdeveloped area , and even to the growth rate of many of the more advanced nations ? without saying that this growth rate , which averaged 2.7 per cent a year from 1951 to 1957 , has gone up to 4.6 per cent a year over the last tour years . Lag Decreasing For the same reasons it is important to note that the lag between consumption increases and production increases  --  a lag fully justifiedl by the initial starting conditions ? has been growing smaller , and has been practically eliminated in the last few years . The truth is that the " Italian miracle " ? one factor in which was certainly the policy of expenditures in the south , which has been effective in expanding markets and stimulating further growth in the northern regions ? is really moving southward . It is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boom period where territorial unbalances are present , as indicated even by the experience of the United States , southern Italy has not been lagging behind the rest of Italy . Confirmation of this contention is to be found in the fact that Italian industrial interests are planning to increase their investments in the south over the next four years by more than 12 per cent per annum , while such investments are expected to remain almost constant in the other regions . New Plants . Further confirmation can be found in the fact that several . foreign concerns , and particularly American ones , are installing new plants in the south . In conclusion , I think it is fair to say that the replacement of a dynamic development process for the age-old stagnation of the underdeveloped regions of the south constitutes a result which , while not completely achieved , is not out of proportion to the efforts made in a period as short as 12 years , and provides , for the measuring of the usefulness of such efforts , a yardstick more significant than a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . GIULIO PASTORE , Chairman , Committee of Ministers for Southern Italy . Rome , Sept. 27 , 1962 . WNDT Praised TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As an educator , I was hopefully curious about the opening of the new educational television station WNDT . Now I am elated . The thrill of seeing such high quality material as the Casals instructional concert , an actual United Nations broadcast , dancers from Thailand , and many other fine programs has evoked feelings in me probably very similar . to those of scientists at the success and magnitude of a space probe , or of another specialist when a vital breakthrough occurs . I have often polled my junior high school social studies classes to find out how many hours a week my students spend before the TV screen . The results were incredible to me . In most instances 30 to 50 hours a week was common . Most of the programs viewed were of the violent or frivolous type . Sometimes , when blank faces too often greeted my attempts to stimulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's rough . Think of the myriad inconsistent and foolish distractions vying for their conscious and unconscious attend tion . " ; But like most teachers . who believie in their work , . I kept trying . Now I have the aid of the wonderful Channel 13 . Each day I ' assign television programs for my students to view and report upon . I believe my classes would join me in thanking our city and all those connected with this undertaking . MARTIN LICKER , Teacher of Social Studies , Junior High School 120 , Bronx . New York , Sept. 28 , 1962 . Racial Differences Denied Anthropologists Quoted on Negroes ' Biological Equality To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Oct. 3 the pages of The- New York Times included a paid advertisement purporting to be an open letter to President Kennedy , suggesting that the actions of ? the Federal Government in Mississippi were ill-advised- because the races of man have been found by scientists to be unequal in intellectual endowment . The content of that statement is false . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States whose memberships comprise almost all of the qualified scientists whose work is in the area of racial differences . Both of these associations at their most recent annual meetings took firm and unambiguous stands on the matter . Because of the gravity and timeliness of the issue it is of value to reproduce the words of the relevant documents . On Nov. 17 , 1961 , the American Anthropological Association adopted by unanimous vote ( 192-0 ) the following resolution : " The American Anthropological Association repudiates statements now appearing in the United States that Negroes are biologically and in innate mental ability inferior to whites , and reaffirms the fact that there is no scientifically established evidence to justify the exclusion of any race from the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . The basic principles of equality of opportunity and equality before the law are compatible with all that is known about human biology . All races possess the abilities needed to participate fully in the democratic way of life and in modern technological civilization . " Resolution Cited The American Association of Physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April 30-May 2 of this year : " We , the members of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists professionally concerned with differences in man , deplore the misuse of science to advocate racism . We condemn - such writings as ' Race and Reason ' that urge the denial of basic rights to human beings . " We sympathize with those of our fellow teachers who have been forced by misguided officials to teach race concepts that have no scientific foundation , and we affirm , as We have in the past , that there is nothing in science that justifies the denial of opportunities or rights to any group by virtue of race . " These unequivocal statements are publicly recorded expressions of curTent scientific thinking in the matter of race . Anyone seeking to represent that opinion as standing to the contrary is uttering falsehood . MORTON H. FRIED , Professor of Anthropology , Columbia University . New York , Oct. 3 , 1962 . To Abolish Boxing TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wholeheartedly support your editorial of Sept. 29 entitled " K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport " which has as its purpose the intentional maiming and injury of one 's opponent . Perhaps an analogy might be found in the day of the ? gladiators . There are other sports , of course , which do result in injuries , oftentimes fatal , but these activities , such as football , lacrosse and rugby football , have as their objective victory via points . In boxing it is obvious that the supreme goal is victory via physical beating , with the inevitable result of physical injury to the body or brain . Recognizing that boxing is ? the very antithesis of sport , I introduced a proposal in the State Legislature in 1960 to abolish boxing in the State of New York . I reintroduced it in 1961 and 1962 and all events from the date of the introduction Of this measure have proved the wisdom of this proposal . BENTLEY KASSAL , Member of Assembly , New York County . New York , Oct. 2 , 1962.                   @ @
