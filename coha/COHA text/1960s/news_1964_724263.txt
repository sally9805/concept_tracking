PRESIDENT 'S STATEMENT Together with ail Americans , I have been disturbed by the riots which took place this past summer in some of our cities . The preservation of order in such circumstances is the responsibility of the local communities and the states , but the fact that such riots can occur is a matter of national concern as well as personal concern to me . I have today asked Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigation , to make public a report summarizing the available facts developed by the bureau on the causes and development of these riots . Mr. Hoover 's report indicates that : 9No definite pattern was found to exist in connection with the riots from one city to another . The riots did not have a single cause and can not be attributed to any identifiable group of individuals . g The riots occurred in communities with economic and social problems crying out for solution . - 9Local police acted with great restraint in the face of vidlent abuse . The riots ? as well as other criminal and juvenile delinquency problems in our cities  --  are closely connected to school dropouts . The mass of people in each community , white and Negro alike , deplored the riots and have cooperated to maintain law and order . ' lEach riot began with a single incident and was aggravated by hoodlums and habitnafiawbreakers. 4No evidence was found that the riots were organized on national basis by any single person , group of persons , or organization , Actions Are Listed I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , I have directed the F.B.I . through its National Academy to make riot training available for all police departments in the United States . Second , I have instructed the Secretary of Defense to enlarge the program of the United States Army for demonstrating techniques of riot control . We will make these techniques a larger part of the . training of the National Guard of the various states and we will make them available to local police forces as well . Third , I have directeed the Secretary of Health , Educe. tion and Welfare to make a study of the dropout program followed in the District of Columbia  --  one of the most intensive in the nation  --  and other places , and to make recommendations to me as soon as possible on what further steps might be taken by the Federal Government to assist in meeting this important problem . Fourth , at an appropriate ? time I intend to call a conference of state and city officials to discuss ways in which the Federal Government can continue to be of assistance in this whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to civil peace . I call upon all our fellow citizens to remember that respect for law and order and ' regard for each pawn 's rights are the coner.stones of selfgovernment in a democracy . The AdMinieratebil feels strongly that this must be a society of law and order in which citizens live by recognized rules of conduct . To that end , we not only enforce Federal Acts but cooperate at all levels of government to assure that civil peace shall be maintained . Every citizen , regardless of his race , creed , or color , is entitled to equal justice ! And every citizen is entitled to be secure in his person on our city streets or in the countryside . The F.B.I .

In addition , the F.B.I . has sponsored just this summer 228 conferences which were attended by 20,184 people representing 6,406 police agencies on the problems of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cooperation so that our citizens may live in dignity and in security .
