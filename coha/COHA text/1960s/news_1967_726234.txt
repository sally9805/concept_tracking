txt The city 's Superintendent of Schools charged yesterday that Mayor Lindsay was trying to bypass the Board of Education to " get more power to control the city 's schools . " . The charge by the Superintendent , Dr. Bernard E. Donovan , came in the growing controversy over decentralizing the city 's school system . A decentralization plan is required if the city is to qualify for increased aid under legislation that passed the Legislature yesterday in Albany . Mayor Lindsay noted on his weekly radio program yesterday that the legislation required him to come up with his own plan for decentralizing the school system . The Mayor 's intention to provide his own plan spurred Dr. Donovan 's charge . Members of the Board of Education , although appointed by the Mayor , are responsible to the state for the education of the city 's pupils . A Measure of Autonomy The board , which says it has been studying the decentralization idea for some time to forge more effective links between the individual schools and the communities they serve , yesterday announced its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school principals and local superintendents in the city 's 30 school districts a measure of autonomy over such things as budgeting and curriculum for the first time . It also provides for increased consultation by the 30 district school boards with the Superintendent in running the local schools . Previously the kcal boards had been little more than figurehead groups . Superintendent Donovan endorsed the board 's proposal and said it marked a " major change in policy . " Speaks at Conference Dr. Donovan spoke yesterday at a conference on " Our City 's Schools : Problems and Promise , " which was held at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue , 30 West 68th Street . He expanded on his remarks in an interview later . He said that starting next September money would be allocated to district superintendents and they in turn would apportion the money according to the needs of the district . The superintendents would have a free hand , Dr. Donovan said , but they would also be responsible for keeping up educational standards . Previously , money had been allocated directly to specific schools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with individual school principals . They would also consult directly with the local school boards , but these boards would have no veto power because state law , Dr. Donovan said , still , limits them to an advisory role . Asked if he would press for changing the law to allow the local boards to exercise ' real power , Dr .. Dpnovan said he would have to wait and see how the new plan works out . The local boards are each made up of 10 members appointed by the Board of Education from local parent and community organizations . They are paid no salary . Dr. Donovan said the new plan " does not mean that the Board'of Education should give up its authority ' to , run the schools , but it . does mean the parent must have a more effective role . " He said the decentralization plan actually would strengthen the board by relieving it of a lot of local red tape and allowing to concentrate on the broader issues that affect the entire city . " Dr. Donovan conceded that the board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go far enough . " But , he added , " the Mayor has plans , too , and they go too far . " Asked about the Mayor 's plans , Dr. Donovan said he did not think the Mayor had any specific details yet except for taking over the power of the Board of Education . Mayor Lindsay had proposed to the Legislature that each of the city 's boroughs be considered as a separate school disc , ict in computing state aid . This would give the city increased.state revenues . In his plea for increased state aid , the Mayor made no mention of setting up separate school boards for each of the five boroughs to supplement or even supplant the one over-all city school board now in existence . But the legislation demanded more than just ' a fiscal maneuvering . It said the Mayor , in consultatChn with the Board of Education , must come up with an effective plan for decentralisation by next Dec. 1 to qualify for the increased aid . The increased aid is expected to amount to $54-million in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated on a formula that ' takes into account the real estate valuation in each school district and the number of pupils in the district . Districts with high real estate values in relation to the number of pupils receive less aid than those with lower values . The Lindsay argument is that high values in Manhattan and Queens inflate the , city 's overall real estate valuation and thus cut down on the state aid . In his program last night , broadcast over WNYC , the Mayor said he had been charged by the Legislature to come up with " a fair , responsible and reasonable plan for administrative decentralization of the school system . " " This will not be easy to do , " he added , " and there was much dissent from this particular piece of legislation , particularly on the part of the Board of Education itself , who felt the board , rather than the Mayor , should have the primary responsibility for doing this . " There is little point ' in debating that too much , " he went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter is that this was the insistence and the condition of the State Legislature , and we 'll live up to it .
