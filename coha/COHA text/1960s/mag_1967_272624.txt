Up to 75 million people in the U.S. are exposed each year to diagnostic medical X rays ; 50 million have dental X rays ; 8,000,000 are fluoroscoped . According to Karl Z. Morgan , health physicist on the 1943 Manhattan Project and now at Oak Ridge National Laboratory , many of the millions are probably being dangerously overexposed to radiation . Before the Senate Commerce Committee last week , Dr. Morgan admitted that statistics on radiation hazards are guesses at best-but he suggested that anywhere from 3,500 to 30,000 U.S. deaths may result each year from the cumulative effects of radiation . <P> Man-made radiation ( now equal to half the total of natural radiation ) adds up to 55 mR* annually for every American , said Dr. Morgan , and 90% of this comes from diagnostic X rays . At Oak Ridge , where nuclear physicists are so conscious of radiation hazards that they have done everything conceivable to reduce them , the skin exposure from a chest X ray is 10 mR . This low and relatively safe dose can be matched in any well-equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified personnel in many of the better hospitals . But , said Dr. Morgan , the equipment and methods vary so widely , especially in doctors ' private offices , that the exposures for this one procedure range all the way up to 1,000 mR , with the U.S. average estimated at 200 mR . <P> When the doctor uses a fluoroscope to see the thoracic organs in motion , the range is from 5 mR to 400 mR . <P> The most obvious effect of excessive radiation exposure is a superficial burn . <P> Later , skin cancer may develop at this site , said Dr. Morgan . Hidden from view are internal cancers ( especially of the thyroid ) , which may take many years to develop , and leukemia or " cancer of the blood . " If a woman has a pelvic X ray in the first weeks of pregnancy , the fetus may be damaged , to be aborted or stillborn , or the child may eventually develop leukemia . Completely hidden from diagnosis or measurement are genetic effects , which do not appear until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost in lives and health , X-ray diagnosis is enormously beneficial , Dr. Morgan declared , and undoubtedly saves many tens of thousands of lives annually . The trouble , he emphasized , is not in the available equipment : everything that is needed to reduce the national total of dental X-ray doses to 1% of the current level , and to reduce all diagnostic exposures to 10% , is already perfected and on the market . The fault , said Dr. Morgan , lies in poor techniques , the use of improper ( usually old ) equipment , the lack of concern by doctors , dentists and technicians for the radiation protection of the patient and their lack of training , and the lack of effective regulation by the states . <P> " In many cases , " said Dr. Morgan , " the exposures are actually given by nurses , secretaries and even by temporary employees such as typists who operate the machines part time . In many of the states , no training or experience is required of the doctor before he uses his X-ray equipment on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays must have his automobile inspected periodically and must have a driver 's license before he can operate it . Yet the X-ray machine he operates may be obsolete and may fail to meet minimum standards , and he may have little or no training or knowledge in how best to operate it . "
