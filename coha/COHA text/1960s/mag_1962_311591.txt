Last year , when Russia sent Cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov into successive space orbits , in neither case did Soviet officialdom reveal anything about the flights until both men were safely aloft . Last week , as U.S. Astronaut John Glenn whirled three times around the globe to his place among American heroes ( see THE NATION ) , the entire world watched his flight . If the U.S. 's open invitation scored any points in the cold war , a share of the credit belongs to Lieut . Colonel John Anthony Powers , 39 , whose deep , deliberately composed voice , issuing from millions of radio and TV sets , kept up a running account of the first U.S. manned orbit . <P> As public affairs officer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Project Mercury since 1959 , Powers has become just about the best-known public relations man in the world . But he is not the usual picture of a PRO . By trade he is a U.S. Air Force pilot and a combat veteran of two wars . <P> Snatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 5ft. 6 in. , weighs 145 lbs. - is balanced by a deep-dyed dedication to his job and an inexhaustible ambition to be seen and heard . Too small for football at high school in Downers Grove , Ill. , a westside Chicago suburb . Powers turned cheerleader instead . He is still remembered as the most boisterous crowd rouser in the school 's history . But he was just the right size-and temperament-to be a fighter pilot , and after graduation he enlisted in the Air Corps in 1942 . <P> From then on , Shorty volunteered for duties that carried both the possibility of glory and the element of risk . He did not go into fighters but into transports , which in wartime can be just as rugged . He was one of six pilots who volunteered to learn the dangerous technique of snatching fully loaded troop gliders off the ground , later spent the tag end of the war ferrying gasoline in vulnerable cargo planes to General Patton 's command in Germany . He saw duty in the Berlin airlift of 1948-49-winged in and out of Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flew 55 night bombing missions in B-26 light bombers , collected more than his quota of flak-and ultimately the Bronze Star , the Air Medal , the D.F.C . and combat promotion to major . <P> In his post at NASA , Powers has developed a showman 's skill-and a banty rooster 's assurance . Scarcely anyone but newsmen and the astronauts knew who Shorty was until 3 o'clock one April morning in 1961 , when John G. Warner , a young United Press International rewrite-man in Washington , roused Powers from sleep at Langley Air Force Base , Va . Russia had just orbited Gagarin , and for long minutes , Powers patiently , even graciously , resisted the U.P.I , man 's insistence on waking one of the astronauts for comment . At last , his patience exhausted . Shorty blurted the ill-advised statement that no one has since let him forget : " If you want anything from us , you jerk , the answer is that we 're all asleep .
