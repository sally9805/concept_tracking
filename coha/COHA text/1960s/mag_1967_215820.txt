Addressing 3,500 guests during the annual Al Smith dinner at Manhattan 's Waldorf Astoria last week , Ambassador Goldberg enjoined them : " In this debate , let us shun intolerance like the plague . As our sons and daughters would say : ' Let 's cool it . ' " <P> What Goldberg hoped above all to cool was the increasingly intemperate and illogical verbal donnybrook over Viet Nam . Other referees weighed in . In the Senate , Washington Democrat Henry Jackson said that both sides " ought to be engaged in reasoning together , not in cutting each other up . " In the House , Ohio 's Robert Taft called for " a pause in verbal bombing . " <P> There was scant hope of dialectical deescalation . The New York Times 's James Reston and other columnists helped keep the temperatures high . They accused Secretary of State Dean Rusk of having revived the dreaded specter of the " yellow peril " when he told a news conference two weeks ago that the U.S. was in Viet Nam because " within the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland , armed with nuclear weapons , with no certainty about what their attitude toward the rest of Asia will be . " Minnesota 's Democratic Senator Eugene McCarthy , a former college economics teacher , echoed the charge . Pundit Walter Lippmann adduced a more directly racial argument with a proposal that the U.S. " pull back from the Vietnamese mainland to continental islands inhabited by Western white men " - namely , Australia and New Zealand . <P> Outraged by the yellow-peril charge , Rusk went to the unusual length of issuing a formal statement to challenge the accusation . " The Secretary wholly repudiates the effort to put into his mouth or into his mind the notion of the yellow peril , " the statement began . His comments on the looming threat of a nuclear-armed China , it added , " have nothing to do with race . " <P> To the Barricades . Continuing the counterattack that he mounted earlier in the month , Lyndon Johnson sent several members of his official family to the barricades with speeches criticizing his critics . On an educational TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seek " to make China our enemy , " but " to contain the militant instincts or aggressive patterns of Communist China 's conduct . " Both the second-and third-ranking men in the State Department defended the Administration 's policies-Under Secretary Nicholas Katzenbach in a speech at Connecticut 's Fairfield University and Under Secretary for Political Affairs Eugene V. Rostow during a regional foreign-policy conference in Lawrence , Kans . Even Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman ventured into the relatively unfamiliar field of foreign policy . In Syracuse , he declared that Asian leaders " are desperately concerned over the Chinese threat " and " almost without exception back what we are doing in Viet Nam . " <P> The Administration had little to show for its efforts . Pollster George Gallup estimated that 20 million Americans-more than one out of every six adults - who once approved of the war have come to consider it " a mistake " during the past two years . A total of 46 million Americans , or 41% of the adult population , now disapprove of the war , Gallup added .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
