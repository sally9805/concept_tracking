 | THE SOUND I always hear inside a sea shell is that wild music of wind and wave on the broken shore of Point Arena , California . As a boy I wandered that coast , following the ebbing tide and the morning fog into another world . There cliffs brood over a smashing surf ; weathered rocks stand sentinel over tidal pools thick with kelp . In those pools , as in dark mirrors reflecting life 's beginnings , I glimpsed many wonders ? anemones green with algae , starfish with skins of purple and pink , and sea urchins , the porcupines of the sea . In one such pool I first chanced upon the chiton ( pronounced KY-ton ) , a small oval animal attached to the underside of a boulder . Across its back stretched eight hinged plates of armor , held in place by a leathery girdle ? spiked with bristles . Gently , I pried the strange creature loose with my pocket knife and placed it on top of the rock . It immediately rolled into a ball , like a miniature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool , and I hastened back to shore with my prize . The tiny armored creature fired my curiosity , and soon I was poring over books on natural history . The chiton 's coat of mail is the product of a special fold of thick tissue called the mantle . I learned that the animal adheres to rocks with a strong ventral muscle , the foot . Chitons ( page 404 ) browse on algae , scraping off digestible bits with the radula ? a filelike tongue , coated with sharp teeth , that uncoils like a piece of thorny ribbon from the mouth . Patient Survivors of Primeval Seas Thus the humble chiton introduced me to that populous and varied phylum , the Mollusca , one of earth 's most fascinating life forms . This primitive member also displayed for me the special equipment by which the molluscan way of doing things has endured for eons .

The mantle is pitted with countless pores , e open ends of tubes through which the imal secretes particles of the limy substance at forms the shell . This material solidifies ickly in a thin layer . Upon this fragile wall other is laid , often cross-grain to the first , d then another , until the edifice is built up .

Some species make the interior walls of alternate layers of lime and horny tissue , coated with microscopic lime crystals that overlap each other in the manner of roof shingles . Light bouncing from the edges of the shingles produces the luster we know as mother-of-pearl . Mankind has always been astonished by the fantastic structures that the mantle can produce ? the frozen starlight of the Venus comb murex , the gleaming marble mound of the cowrie , the ivory minaret of the auger , the massive alabaster battlements of the conch , the petrified flowers of the thorny oyster . Only a highly sophisticated and biologically successful animal could create such magnificent architecture . With a secure shell produced by the mantle , with a radula to help probe for and prepare its food , and with a strong foot for locomotion , the shell-bearing Mollusca have made their way onto every continent . They dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of environment . A few daring adventurers have learned to survive above the snow line of the Himalayas , in the piping-hot water of thermal springs , in the solid ice of frozen ponds , in the dry wastes of shimmering deserts , and in the sea 's abyssal deeps , where the pressure mounts to tons per square inch . Most of the ocean 's 50,000 shellbearing species , however , prefer to live at moderate depths ? on coral reefs and continental shelves . Coquinas Known by Many Names The most familiar mollusks are those commonly associated with man 's dinner plate ? the succulent oysters , clams , scallops , and mussels that have provided human meals for thousands of years . All are members of a teeming class known as the bivalves ? mollusks with two shells hinged together . The first living mollusks that the Zahls met as a family were bivalves . It was a bright August afternoon , and my son Paul , then  | seven , and I were strolling the beach of Sanibel Island , a shell collector 's paradise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dotted the white sands around us ? lifeless hulks washed ashore by the surf . Paul , with the enthusiasm of childhood , was gathering up cat 's paws and turkey wings and pectens and whelks and others that attracted his eye . Suddenly he stopped , staring straight down as a wide tongue of surf swirled the sand around his bare feet . " They 're alive ! " he cried . " Dad ! They 're alive ! " Hundreds of tiny clams , each less than an inch long , squirmed about Paul 's toes and ankles . They tumbled , dived , and dug furiously to return to their burrows from which the wave had troweled them . Quickly we cupped up handfuls of the animated sand . When the fan-shaped shells were strained out , each revealed a different pattern and color , all with the sheen of lacquered fingernails ( below ) . Wonder comes in all colors to the author 's son , Paul , Jr. , on Sanibel Island .

That evening we talked of this fascinating realm of nature as we sat on the porch of our beach cottage admiring a golden Sanibel sunset , with piled-up clouds reflecting the last light of day . It was the quiet beginning of a continuing interest in mollusks for young Paul . In the years that followed , we learned a great deal more about bivalves , which we came to call simply " the clams . " Baby Oysters Lead an Active Life There are about 10,000 different species in the great clam class . Most of us think immediately of the quahog , Mercenaria mercenaria , and of the edible oyster , Crassostrea virginica , a lowly creature that spends its adult life fastened in one place like a living stone . But many bivalves do incredible things . Scallops leap and swim . Mussels tether themselves like dirigibles . Shipworms cut through timber . Pens produce a golden thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The giant clams are farmers ; small gardens of algae grow within their mantles . And everyone knows of the fabulous pearl oysters , the Pinctada , that surround bits of irritating matter inside their shells with iridescent globes prized throughout man 's history ( page 411 ) . Most bivalves begin life foot-loose and fancy-free . During their childhood , which may last from a few hours to a few weeks , the tiny creatures propel themselves about the watery neighborhood with their hundreds of cilia . Even the oysters , the very souls of sedentary propriety , swish to and fro until they realize they are built to sit it out . After the brief swimming period , they drift downward looking for a secure place in the world . In this stage , oysters are called spat . If lucky , the spat attaches itself to a solid object and becomes sessile for life ( page 400 ) . If a spat happens to land in soft mud , however , it soon perishes . Chesapeake Bay oystermen spread tons of cultch ? empty shells ? over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing in life. * Even then danger lurks nearby , usually in the sinister form of a snail , Urosalpinx cinerea , the oyster drill . Sidling up to a bivalve , the drill saws a neat hole in one valve with its radula , inserts a tubelike proboscis , and sucks up its victim 's flesh . So precarious is the life of the spat , and so ' See " The Sailing Oystermen of Chesapeake Bay , " by Luis Marden , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , December 1967. 391  | small are its chances of survival , that an adult female may produce several hundred million eggs at a time ? of which only a few will develop . The eggs are released into clouds of sperm ejected by a nearby male . Said the English satirist Swift : " He was a bold man that first eat an oyster . " Today , around Chesapeake Bay , the oyster is big business . Some 5,000,000 bushels are caught and sold each season . Gourmets like them on the half shell , plump and juicy . For shell collectors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bivalve called the thorny oyster ( actually , a relative of the scallop ) is a different cup of chowder . The many different members of the genus Spondylus are among the showiest of all bivalves . Most of them wear brilliant pinks , reds , and yellows , and bear on their oval backs long spines and fronds that give them a resemblance to stony flowers ; they are sometimes called chrysanthemum shells ( page 425 ) . Scallops Abound in Classical Art All shells lure the human imagination to journeys through the world , to tropical coves where waves lisp quietly against a white shore , to wind-swept islands dreaming in sunlit silence at world 's end . But the lively scallop beckons us to a marvelous journey through man 's history , for it is the artistic royalty of the entire mollusk domain . The art of ancient times made constant use of scallop shells . Archeologists probing the dry hills of Anatolia and the ruins of Greece have found statuettes of Aphrodite , whom the Romans called Venus , stepping from a scallop shell . Her symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pompeii , in mosaics at Herculaneum , in the niches of ancient chapels . The scallop is especially prevalent on funerary monuments ? adorning lead coffins from Roman Britain and marble sarcophagi from Asia Minor , and alternating with the palm trees of paradise in Byzantine tombs . The case can be made that the scallop symbolizes resurrection , when the dead rise from their tombs just as the goddess stepped from her shell . The scallop became a symbol of Western Christendom when Crusaders picked up Pecten jacobaeus shells along the Palestinian coast and wore them on their helmets and hats ? a kind of bumper sticker or shoulder patch saying , " I was there . " In the 12th century pilgrims wore Pecten inaximus as a badge en route to the purported tomb of St. James the Apostle at Santiago de 393  | Compostela , Spain ? after Jerusalem and Rome the third great pilgrimage of the Middle Ages . If you ever see a statue of a saint in a European church and he is wearing a scallop shell in the brim of his hat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James . An event of such magnitude in the life of a knight or a sinner deserved remembrance . As an English verse ascribed to Thomas Fuller , an 18th-century physician , runs : The scallop shows a coat of arms , That , of the bearer 's line , Someone in former days hath been To Santiago 's shrine . Such fervent adventurers were legion ; today the scallop shell adorns the coats of arms of many families , including those of Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Anthony Eden . A student of these insignia who happened upon live scallops under Atlantic waters would be in for a breathtaking surprise . He might think that he had dropped in on a swarm of flying saucers . The scallop of the U. S. Pacific Coast , Chlamys hericius ; the well-known Atlantic bay scallop , Argopecten irradians ; and that collector 's favorite , the cheery little calico scallop of Southeastern U. S. and Caribbean waters , Argopecten gibbus ? all are champion swimmers . Scallops in action look like kites caught in a high wind . They swim in quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out forcefully between the two valves ( cover and pages 406-7 ) . When danger threatens , usually in the form of a starfish , scallops blast off in a cloud of sand . Laggards pay dearly . The starfish wraps  | the scallop in its arms , equipped with rows of sucker-bearing feet , and begins a grim tug of war . Sometimes the battle lasts for hours , but almost always with the same conclusion ? exhaustion of the mollusk , forced opening of the shells , and dinner for the starfish . The victor devours its prey by extending its movable stomach between the scallop 's valves and digesting its meal in situ a disagreeable but efficient system . I once ventured into the waters off Woods Hole , Massachusetts , in quest of flying scallops and found them in convention on grassy banks only a few feet down . But they also congregate as deep as 50 feet . Scallop Sees With a Hundred Eyes When at rest , the great scallop lies on its larger , slightly curved shell with the flat , smaller valve uppermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantle and a fringe of feathery tentacles that can detect subtle chemical changes in the water . One of nature 's most startling sights , however , is the Atlantic bay scallop 's double row of eyes bright-blue beads , as many as a hundred , strung between the tentacles like Christmas-tree ornaments ( preceding pages ) . Some of the eyes are larger than others , but all are equipped with lens , retina , and optic nerve . When disturbed , the scallop closes its shell , often leaving a tiny crack through which the rows of unblinking eyes peer out . Somewhere nearby , the scuba diver will find clusters of tiny kites whose lines seem to have been tangled in slender bushes . These are young scallops that have tethered themselves to hydroids by a web of threads known as the byssus , which they have spun somewhat as spiders do . Mollusks that spin spider webs ? Strange as it seems , many shells familiar in collections once rode at anchor at the end of a byssus . The scallop eventually breaks away from its byssus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mytilus edulis , spend their adult lives spinning and tying guy lines to rocks and stones , and to each other . Europeans devour mussels by the ton , as the strains of " Molly Malone " remind us . And harvesting a mussel entails cutting it out from its sturdy web of byssus mooring lines . I spent hours one afternoon peering into the water near a Pacific Coast wharf and watching mussels move , extremely slowly , by paying out their byssus webs and working their way along like mountaineers. @# The artists of the byssus-spinning bivalves are the pen shells of the Mediterranean , Pinna nobilis , whose silky thread was the " cloth of gold " of the ancient world . Artisans of the city of Tarentum ( modern Taranto in Italy ) were famous for this rarest of all fabrics . Procopius mentions that Emperor Justinian presented to the satraps of Armenia robes spun of byssus threads . Across the instep of the Italian boot from Tarentum , a Roman market stands partially submerged in the sea at Pozzuoli . The land on which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Visitors today can see strange pits in the solid marble pillars . The holes were made by the " rockeater , " a small mussel called Lithophaga , while the foundation was under water . A Clam " Invented " Hydraulic Mining Many bivalves burrow into solid rock . Lithophaga performs its stunt by secreting an acid that eats away the limestone ; a distant relative in the Arctic , Hiatella , can put a six-inch hole in concrete . Bivalves that dig into sand and mud , like the familiar and much admired angel wing of our Atlantic Coast , actually pull themselves into the ground . The narrow tip of the foot extends and wriggles into the sand . Then the mollusk inflates the foot with blood so that a rigid bulb forms like an anchor at the end , and with it the animal pulls itself into the sand . The razor clam has anticipated modern hydraulic mining by squirting a jet of water  | into the hole as it pulls itself in ; the mud washes out and the hole gets deeper . The terrors among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives ? which have been wreaking havoc on wooden ships and wharves since man first built them . Using the filelike surfaces of its two shells , a teredo can bore as far as two and a half feet into a ship 's timbers. * The teredo creates such destruction that it forced naval builders to sheathe ships ' bottoms with copper . Even in this century its invisible damage toppled the municipal wharf of Benicia , California . The shipworm lines its tunnel with a shelly coat , and trails behind it two tubes for feeding and discharging waste . It spends its entire adult life secure in its burrow . One might consider this the ultimate in self-sufficiency . But that honor , to my mind , is reserved for the largest of the tridacnid clams of Australia 's Great Barrier Reef . ' I will never forget peering into the clear waters ringing Green Island and seeing giant clams ( Tridacna gigas ) three feet long and weighing several hundred pounds ( pages 428-9 ) .

A close examination of the mantle reveals bright spots that are , in effect , small skylights . Below them , the mantle contains chambers ( we can almost say " greenhouses " ) filled with growing algae . The skylights are actually lenses that direct sunlight into the gardens . There , recent research leads me to believe , the algae remove and utilize waste products from the clam 's tissues , while the clam uses oxygen , and possibly organic nutrients , produced by the plants during photosynthesis . On reefs farther to the south I waded into the domain of the giant clams ' smaller cousins ( Tridacna maxima ) . Their mantles , flowing like rivers of color , were unforgettable ? electric blue , vivid orange , green , canary yellow , mottled , striped , speckled in every hue . As I made my way across the tricky coral , the valves of the cantaloupe-size clams shut with such force that water spouted into the air ; then , as I passed , they slowly reopened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick as garden hoses .

In the stomach , a crystalline , knoblike " style " ? unique to certain mollusks and the only known rotating mechanism in animals ? releases enzymes and stirs food particles to aid digestion .

Then the catch muscle takes over and holds valves closed , permitting survival on coastal flats between tides and on the journey to the dinner table . boiling whirlpools of the Strait of Messina , we brought back not only Pinna nobilis but another shell associated with the pomp of ancient royalty. * This was Murex brandaris , a shell that launched a thousand ships and helped determine the course of ancient empire . From this three-inch mollusk and the related Trunculariopsis , Phoenician artisans of the cities of Tyre and Sidon made the splendid purple dye that has been the color of royalty ever since . They pushed across the Mediterranean in search of them .

The result was a clear broth that changed in sunlight to bright yellow , through shades of green to blue , and finally to a permanent brilliant magenta . Cloth dyed with this beautiful and enduring purple cost $10,000 to $12,000 a pound . Only the rich and the mighty were allowed to wear it , and the phrase " born to the purple " became a fixture . Indo-Pacific Holds Varied Treasures The Mediterranean lies within one of the four regions into which malacologists divide the world of marine mollusks ( map , pages 396-7 ) . But by far the most fabulous for the diversity of its shell-bearing animals is the Indo-Pacific , a vast reach of water extending from the Red Sea and eastern coast of Africa across the Indian Ocean , and into the Pacific beyond Hawaii and Easter Island .

But the center of this vast zone , and a mecca for shell collectors , is the Philippine archipelago , with its thousands of islands , reefs , channels , bays , seas , and record offshore deeps . For years I talked of a trip to the Philippines to observe living shells in their undersea habitats , far removed from the museum tray or trophy cabinet . Eventually these dreams knitted into reality , and I set out for Zamboanga , on the island of Mindanao . I flew across the Pacific by jet ? and reflected upon the small irony that mollusks themselves " invented " jet propulsion . I was thinking specifically of the squid , octopus , and cuttlefish , all members in good standing of a great class of mollusks ? the Cephalopoda . The name means " head-foot , " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mollusk Without a Shell Put a shell on an octopus , and you will see a typical mollusk ? the covering mantle , under it the body and its organs , the projecting head , and a radula inside the mouth . Included in many collections are the fossilized shells carried by the ancestors of modern Cephalopoda ? curved , coiled , or bullet-shaped caps under which the primitive animals may have swum upright . The cuttlefish of eastern Atlantic , Mediterranean , and Asian waters still produce a small , limy shell ,  | worn inside , that is sold as cuttlebone to keep canaries happy . The squid carries about a small internal shell its so-called " pen " shaped like an antique quill . While the squid 's mantle does not secrete a covering shell , it does serve as a propulsion device . Water gathered in the mantle cavity is blasted out from a nozzle , and the animal darts backward .

The delicate case holds the animal and her eggs , its buoyancy preventing them from sinking . The chambered nautilus , on the other hand , swims near the ocean bottom inside a heavy shell .

Back on shore , I transferred the catch to a battery of aerated sea-water aquariums I had set up in my workroom . At first the creatures seemed hesitant in their new surroundings . Then as I watched , a stromb cautiously extended its stalked eyes for a look around ( page 395 top ) , and a cone began to move tentatively over the sandy bottom . A friend , Professor Jose Domantay , a marine biologist retired in Zamboanga , suggested a place where I might photograph gastropods in their natural habitat . He described a sand bar on a nearby island that was a favored haunt of the beautiful bat volute , Aulica vespertilio . " Volutes spend much of their time in the sand , " he said , " but if you can be there during the last half hour of an ebbing tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later I was on that bar , wading through clear , shin-deep water , alert for tracks on the ripply bottom .

At the end of a third my probing fingers felt something hard . Digging fast , I overtook and lifted out a magnificently tapered shell , amber hued , with bold zigzag markings . On contact the gastropod retreated into its whorl . I carried my prize shoreward to where the sea was a thin sheet of liquid glass , and set it before me on the sand bottom . Familiar terrain restored the volute 's confidence ; almost immediately there was action . The fleshy foot began to spread ever so slightly beyond the shell , permitting an inflow of water . This not only started respiration , but also stimulated olfactory organs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water around it . Now the grotesquely shaped lump of the head emerged from the shell . Its pair of tentacles bore invisible sense organs for measuring temperature and pressure . At this stage action stopped again , as yet another set of sensors , farther back within the body mass , was brought into play . Microscopic limestone grains were constantly shifting in response to gravity , gently brushing against touch-sensitive cells . Nerve connectives reported these shiftings to ganglia , or neural centers , which in the mollusk serve as primitive brains . There , as in a computer , the animal 's horizontal and vertical planes were being determined , and the information relayed to appropriate muscles , which in turn made body adjustments .

The head protruded fully and a pair of eyes , one at the base of each tentacle , established visual contact with the surroundings . Finally , up reared a snorkel-like tube to convey water to the interior . Apparently no further threat to safety registered , for with its zebra-striped foot now flattened and spread like a carpet , the animal began to slide gracefully over the sand . But suddenly something in the environment , possibly my shadow or the click of my camera , called for a hasty dive . The foot 's front edge angled sharply and , as if slicing into soft butter , drew the entire creature into the sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save for the snorkel 's tip , and even that might easily have been mistaken for a mere worm hole in the sand . My favorite among the Gastropoda is the cowrie . When I mentioned this to Fernando G. Dayrit , former curator of shells at the Philippine National Museum in Manila , he said : " Go straight to Evaristo Zambo . You will find him in Cebu . Shells are his life , and he will show you where the rare ones are . " Zambo , an amiable and articulate graduate of the University of the Philippines , agreed immediately to lead me to cowrie habitats . Camotes Sea Yields Rare Cowries On a brilliant blue morning we set out from Zambo 's home port of Mandaue , a few miles north of the city of Cebu , bound for an area known as the Camotes Sea . Here , in a channel separating Cebu from its satellite island of Mactan , Zambo had found a new species , christened Homalocantha zanzboi by American conchologists . Zambo 's boat was a wonder of invention . Broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual outriggers , a tiny pilothouse , and an equally miniature galley ( page 420 ) . There was a forward cabin on whose floor boards I slept when time and weather permitted . Projecting over the water on the port side was a cramped annex referred to by its designerbuilder as the " discomfort room . " A one-cylinder inboard diesel pushed us along at a good four knots ; for greater speed to outmaneuver a storm ( or , as I was warned , to escape hijackers who sometimes ply these waters ) , auxiliary outboards lay ready . The vessel drew very little water , making it ideal for work in reef shallows . As we lingered over gorgeously colored coral beds , Zambo sent his crew ? cook , mo- torman , and deckhand ? overboard for shells . Effortlessly , they brought up bonnets , helmets , cones , sundials , murexes , turbans , and now and then a pearl oyster . I placed the choicest into a live well we had improvised alongside the boat . Rejects were claimed by the crew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ate a conventional lunch , the crew tossed a few handfuls of rice into a pot of boiling water . Into another went the leftover mollusks . When cooked , they were drained and served in a dishpan set on the afterdeck . One lad selected a steaming pearl oyster , valves now wholly relaxed by the cooking ; another chose a Corms textile , dangerous when alive . With audible gusto , they ate the lot . When I described the caution urged on some of our military personnel regarding toxic sea animals during World War II , Zambo laughed , " The sea people here eat every mollusk they can lay hands on , with the exception of a large white cowrie . Even that is n't harmful ? it just does n't taste good . " At the public market in Zamboanga I had seen heaps of live shells of every description being sold as standard table fare . That evening we struck a course for some distant palm-studded isles . Near land , we cautiously poled through a mine field of barely submerged coral heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soft fire , we watched as the tide ebbed and the coral seemed to rise like a lost continent around us . Well before sunrise I awoke to find our boat resting on the bottom . The smooth and shallow sea of the evening before had become a vast expanse of coral , sand flats , and quiet pools , a realm of flamboyant color . We could easily hop overboard and set out walking across the reef . " This is one of the richest cowrie habitats I know , " said Zambo , " but I hope you will not mention its precise location . A stampede of collectors would be hard on conservation . as well as on the market . " Take these sieve and zigzag cowries , " he continued , lifting the edge of a loose coral rock as though he knew exactly what to expect underneath . " A few hundred prime specimens sent to the U. S. or Europe would lower their value drastically . " I stooped to examine the coral 's underside . Amid its clutter of sponge growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more enameled lumps , some no larger than a salted peanut . Disturbed , they had snatched in their mantles , revealing the color and markings of their shells . And indeed the two species Zambo mentioned were there , Cypraea cribraria , richly brown with white splotches , and Cypraea ziczac , with rows of tent markings across its polished dome and an orange underside flecked with chestnut dots . Within a few hours we had harvested scores of money cowries , Cypraea moneta , knobby and pale yellow , used even today for barter in parts of the South Pacific ; ring cowries , Cypraea annulus , creamcolored and crowned with a circlet of yellow-orange ; intricately patterned reticulated cowries , Cypraea maculata ; Arabian cowries , Cypraea arabica , gray with brown markings that resembled Arabic script ; and larger tiger cowries , Cypraea tigris , sold in souvenir shops throughout the world ( preceding pages ) . Living cowries in motion are among nature 's most fascinating sights .

Some shine with a vivid scarlet ; others are  | rich brown or purest white sprinkled with spots of black . The cowrie glides across the rough coral on its undulating foot without once lifting a hem or shifting a degree off course . The mantle , wrapping completely around the shell and hiding it from view , is festooned with branched filaments , looking like a grove of leafless trees riding a rainbow hill . Shells Followed Trade in Ancient World Many cowries are avidly sought by collectors . Good specimens of some , like Cypraea valentia and Cypraea leucodon , bring prices of several thousand dollars . The collecting excursion with Zambo brought to mind the rich history of conchology ; as long as there have been men , there have been collectors of sea shells , for both food and ornament . Archeologists find sea shells in grave sites all over the world , some dating from 15,000 years ago . Such finds trace ancient paths of commerce : a Pacific shell discovered in the ruin of an Arizona pueblo , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic shell in an Etruscan grave . Suetonius tells us that one of the first major-league collectors was that madman the Emperor Caligula . Arriving with his legions at the English Channel during the spring of A.D. 40 , he looked at that forbidding barrier and decided that he would rather conquer Neptune than the Britons . He therefore  | issued orders to his troops , drawn up in battle array , to begin gathering sea shells along the French shore , surely one of the strangest commands to an invasion army in history . He went back to Rome with what he called " the spoils of conquered ocean " ! The ashes of Pompeii have yielded specimens from another ancient collection . Most of the shells are Mediterranean , but a few , including a textile cone , came from as far away as the Indian Ocean . Collecting in the modern sense began when Dutch merchant ships sailed back to Amsterdam with the colonial spoils of the East Indies . The first field naturalists were often the administrators of empire . One , Georg Eberhard Rumphius , spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ambon , site of a small trading post in the East Indies . During the 17th century , he wrote a masterwork of natural history based on observation ; some of his names for mollusks were adopted by Linnaeus half a century later . Great Collections Started as " Cabinets " During the 17th and 18th centuries it became the fashion in Europe for cultivated men to assemble " cabinets " : large rooms crampacked with every kind of curious object imaginable ? birds , animals , fish , shells , minerals , weapons , primitive utensils , coins , bones . Sir Hans Sloane 's cabinet became the nucleus of the great collection now belonging to the British Museum in London . In 1625 the Englishman John Tradescant commissioned Edward Nicholas , on behalf of the Duke of Buckingham , to " Deall withe All Marchants from All Places But Espetially the Virgine &; Bermewde &; Newfound Land Men ... to furnishe His Grace Withe All manner of Beasts &; fowells and Birdes ... shells ...

Among her treasures , Elizabeth Bligh counted " a very perfect specimen " of the precious wentletrap . They , too , made their way to the British Museum . Thus the great collections of Europe grew . Some of them eventually flowered into national museums replete with rare and beautiful shells .  | A killer cone attacks : Lying in the sand , two-inch-long Conus striatus extended its proboscis toward a blenny . When the sensitive tube brushed against the fish , a barbed harpoon , similar to the one at right , darted out .

Price of " Spiral Staircase " Tumbles Perhaps the first of these ? and one still greatly admired and avidly collected , although no longer at astronomical prices ? is Epitonium scalare , the precious wentletrap . A lovelier thing is hard to imagine ( page 415 ) . Christened by the Dutch with their word for " spiral staircase , " it was the possession of royalty . Catherine of Russia owned a large one ; so did Queen Louisa Ulrica of Sweden . Tradition tells of Emperor Francis I , husband of Maria Theresa , paying 4,000 Austrian guilders for one in 1750 ? a sum roughly translated into $20,000 today . In recent years , as shell collectors have probed into the lairs of the wentletraps near Sumatra and Australia and other parts of the Indo-Pacific , the price has fallen . One dealer , in 1958 , listed two of these " very rare beautiful shells " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how any price could truly reflect the wentletrap 's intricate structure and beauty of design . For more than two centuries collectors considered the rarest and most expensive shell in the world to be Conus gloriamaris , the beautiful glory of the seas . This regal shell , with its tapered spire and its elegant color patterns reticulated like the finest needlework , satisfies both the artist 's requirement of exceptional beauty and the collector 's demand for exceptional rarity . Before 1837 only half a dozen were known to exist . In that year a famous British collector , Hugh Cuming , visiting a reef near Jagna , Bohol Island , in the Philippines , turned over a small rock , and found two , side by side . He  | known ? one in the British Museum , one at Harvard University , and one in the extensive private collection of John E. du Pont of Newtown Square , Pennsylvania . Mr. du Pont kindly permitted us to photograph some of his treasures for this article . I found one of the rare glory of the seas cones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Bernardino Guerrero of Manila . My visit to their home climaxed three months spent studying the mollusks of Philippine waters . As I stood before the fantasia of shells displayed in glass cabinets , my hand went almost involuntarily toward a strikingly handsome , gently curving shell with a greenish-white surface , Dentalium elephantinum ( page 424 ) . The small tusk shell , also known as a tooth shell , represented another of the large classes of the mollusk phylum , the Scaphopoda , which means " digging foot . " Indians Bought Wives With Shells Members of the Scaphopoda have fascinated people since time immemorial , for nature designed them as though she intended them to be strung into superlative necklaces . Gleaming like ivory , slightly curved , open at both ends , they invite collection . When trappers of the Hudson 's Bay Company arrived on the North Pacific coast of America , they found a lively currency ? Dentalium pretiosum , the money tooth shell . A string of large ones might pay for a canoe or a squaw . Tooth , or tusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy bottoms from the shallows to very deep water . The animal inside is blind and has no gills ; it spends its life with the larger end of the tusk stuck in the sand . The mollusk breathes by taking in and expelling water through the hole at the smaller end . To burrow into the sea bottom , the creature extends a little digging tool from the large end of the shell ? a foot that some people think resembles a horse 's hoof ? and plows in at an angle , until only the tip , like a white dagger , is left exposed . Once secure , the tooth probes around in the sand with a cluster of ciliated tentacles . These sweep microscopic organisms into its mouth in such steady profusion that one 19th-century malacologist referred to the common tooth shell of Europe , Dentalium vulgare , as a " fastidious Pig from the herd of Epicurus .... " As I admired other shells in the Guerrero collection , Mr. Guerrero left for a moment and returned with a small box . His wife  | All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffled jaws , its exhalant siphon gaping . Popular legend pictures swimmers such as this pretty snorkeler trapped in the valves , but the chances of such an accident are slight . Tridacna gigas ? the world 's largest bivalve ? harbors " gardens " of algae within the thick mantle tissue , speckling it with green . This behemoth lies 10 feet deep on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef . EKTACHROME BY BEN CROPP ? NG.5. opened it with great care . From its velvet-lined interior she lifted out and placed in my hand a light-brown shell , four inches long , with small white triangular markings . This was a perfect Conus gloriamaris ( page 415 ) . My hostess told me that she had once refused an offer of $2,000 for it . For both collectors and scientists , the lure of shells rests in part on the generosity of the oceans that continue to yield unsuspected treasures . Perhaps the most sensational find of our generation occurred in 1952 when the Danish research vessel Galathea hauled up a handful of " living fossils " from a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 10 tiny animals , about an inch long , were living examples of a kind of primitive mollusk thought to have vanished 350 million years ago . Looking like little buttons , the simple mollusks set off a lively debate among scholars . Some pointed to the paired muscles , gills , and kidneys and hailed the discovery as a " missing link " between mollusks and the wormlike annelids . A pair of flaps behind the mouth suggested those of a modern clam , and a small bunch of tentacles in front of the foot were thought to correspond to those of the squid and octopus . These mollusks were assigned to the class Monoplacophora , which had been created in 1940 to cover fossil species . In 1958 the U. S. research ship Vema dredged four more specimens from their hiding place 19,000 feet down in the Peru-Chile Trench . Since then others have been found by deep dredging . Shells Hold the Record of Eons Another unexpected glimpse into early mollusk life came in 1963 when the Gerda , a research ship of the Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living Pleurotomarian , or slit shell , from the waters off Sombrero Key , Florida . Mikadotrochus amabilis was the first new species of Pleurotomarian found in the Caribbean in more than 100 years . Fifteen species are now known to exist ? the majority from recent finds in Japanese , Indonesian , southern African , and Caribbean waters . Since 1964 , the National Geographic Society has supported several voyages of the Gerda , with many exciting results . In 1965 , University of Miami researchers dredged from Bahama waters three species of slit shells , two of them new to science . Another new species was added during a Gerda cruise in 1966 . Thus each year brings the bright hope of discovery and knowledge . And each year , I am sure , some boy makes his way to the edge of the sea and finds there a fellow creature of his planet that evokes the magic of creation .
