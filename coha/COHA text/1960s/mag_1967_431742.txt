 | Movie Report IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT . A man is murdered in Sparta , Mississippi , and the first man hauled in is a Philadelphia Negro ( Sidney Poitier ) ? simply because he 's a stranger in town . When the sheriff ( Rod Steiger ) finds that the Yankee is a cop and a homicide expert at that , the two have no choice but to get along until they find the murderer . It 's a crowded 109 minutes , what with a murder mystery and racial tensions at work . As a result , the mystery is a little hard to follow . Poitier is very good ? his usual gentle , controlled self ? but Steiger is brilliant . This time he plays a short-tempered , gum-chawing sheriff . You might not recognize him as the same man who played in The Pawnbroker and Dr. Zhivago . Photography has both the realism of a documentary and the best of Hollywood wide-screen color techniques . A thoughtful , exciting movie . Not to be missed . THE NAKED RUNNER . London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unwitting furniture designer ( Frank Sinatra ) to murder a scientist . Their plan is a little too complex to be real , but the furniture designer 's desperation is very real . You are right there with him , feeling desperate and angry enough yourself to sympathize with what he finally does ? kill a man . And you 're still angry when you leave the theater , for , unlike The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , this unwilling agent finds no way to denounce the men who have used him . A fast pace plus fine acting from Sinatra , Peter Vaughan and Derren Nesbitt make this a first-rate picture . THE FLIMFLAM MAN . A flimflam man is a con man . Mordecai Jones ( George C. Scott ) is a flimflam man with principles . Young Curley ( Michael Sarrazin ) , AWOL from Ft . Bragg and idealistic , joins up with Mordecai for a time and the result is a funny , unpretentious film with a happily unpredictable plot . 42           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
