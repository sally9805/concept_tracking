There are 25,000 registered fighting dogs in Japan , where dogfighting is still legal , although a growing body of humanitarians wants to outlaw it . Japan 's dogfight fans include doctors , lawyers , farmers , miners , laborers and even company executives , but their interest is less in the outcome than in the sport itself . Strangly enough , for a country that has mastered the art of miniaturization , the Japanese fighting dog , known as the Tosa , is rather large . The Japanese say he is a descendant of the old English mastiff , a massive beast that sometimes weighed as much as 200 pounds . // Japanese tradition has it that the modern Tosa originated in the 17th century , when an English frigate struck a reef in Tosa Bay on the eastern side of Shikoku , the smallest of the four Japanese home islands . The Japanese of that distant day were not noted for their hospitality and what became of the captain and crew of the ship was never recorded . But in the wreckage of the frigate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown dog , whose instinct as a fighter led him to defeat all the best local dogs . // Records were kept of this dog 's bloodline . Through the years , the original Tosa strain was mixed with blood from the akita , a strong draft dog from northern Japan similar to a Siberian husky , the English bulldog and the English pointer . The English pointer cross produced a sprinkling of white , which persists today in the dainty white stockings often seen on a modern Tosa . However , the Tosa district is no longer the chief breeding area for the fighting dogs , which are bred all over Japan , many close to Tokyo . // The modern Tosa is still large ; one recent champion weighed in at 154 pounds . This is heavier than the average fighting Tosa , whose weight is closer to 90 pounds . The Tosa often has the black muzzle of the English mastiff and is usually fawn in color . A chunky dog , 26 to 30 inches at the shoulder , with a full but not barreled chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sculptured musculature of a boxer or the statuesque tenseness of a Doberman pinscher . He is rather a shambling , rugged , not unfriendly fellow with the solid hulk of a football tackle . // Outside the fighting ring , the Tosa has the phlegmatic temperament of most massive dogs . Do n't trouble him and he wo n't trouble you . He is surprisingly tolerant of smaller dogs , as long as they remain respectful . And , as with many working breeds , the Tosa functions better when not subjected to cuddling , petting and other demonstrations of human affection . Tosa owners are unanimous in believing that too much affection makes a dog less capable of achieving and holding a fighting edge . Few Tosas are treated as family pets , and most are housed in large wooden cages . Perhaps because of this , they tend to be one-man dogs . // Tosas are trained to be fighters , but they are carefully kept away from serious combat with other dogs until they are at least 1 years old . At that age , a Tosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , to develop his confidence and teach him the technique of fighting . Because the Japanese consider a silent dogfight more satisfying esthetically than a noisy one , Tosas must learn to fight without making a sound . If a young dog growls while fighting , he is reprimanded but is still encouraged to continue the fight . This lends an eerie quality to the contests , like the silence that prevails when Siamese fighting fish are battling to the death . // The dogs fight on a raised wooden platform covered with old carpeting in an octagonal ring , 15 feet wide . The dog owners and three referees perch around it during the fight , while the audience sits slightly below , as at a boxing match . // The Japanese , with their love of rank and ceremony , have designated three championship grades : Yokozuna , Ozeki and Sekiwake  --  the same ranks used in classifying Sumo wrestling champions . The rules vary for different classes . In the championship classes , the dogs are allowed one minute of grace , during which they may growl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unranked dogs are allowed two minutes of preparation time . Once this period is over , if either dog makes the slightest sound he will lose the match . Several matches are stopped during every tournament , when alert judges hear a sound the audience does not . // The time limit for a match is 30 minutes , but they rarely go the limit . If both dogs are on their feet fighting to the end , each is credited with a win . If excessive bleeding occurs , if one dog establishes immediate superiority over another or if one dog is unwilling to fight , the match is halted . // After a particularly hard exchange , the judges will often stop the fight to look the dogs over . If a dog sits down from exhaustion , he must regain his feet within three minutes or lose . Tosas will sometimes lean on each other , ribs pounding , paws thrown over their opponent 's shoulders , and ignore the cries of their owners and the crowd to mix it up . If one dog begins fighting within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses . Experienced dogs seem to fight by the rules , resting periodically before starting in again . // The Japanese fans ' attitude toward dogfighting is best understood when one realizes there is no gambling or betting . Tosas are fought strictly for sport , and when a judge stops a fight , his decision is never protested . // The atmosphere of a Japanese dogfight is like that of a family picnic . Men bring their wives and children , sit on straw mats and enjoy the spectacle . After the matches , owners bathe their dogs , dress them in the championship belt and robe proper to their status and parade them in front of the crowd . Silver loving cups , championship trophies and flags are presented to both winners and losers . Many bows and congratulations are exchanged and much good-humored chaffing goes on between the owners . Challenges are called as the crowd applauds the official announcement of a dog 's victory or promotion to a higher championship class . // At the last prefectural ( countywide ) tournament in Ito , 70 miles south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . His owner , wearing the heavy plus fours , two-toed cloth boots and English cap of the Japanese worker on a holiday , leaped into the ring to explain that his dog was nervous in front of such a large crowd . The owner tipped his cap and bowed low in four directions before leading his peace-loving dog away to wild applause . // Those in favor of the sport point out . that a Tosa has never been killed or crippled in a fight . A veterinarian is always present and his decision to stop a fight , like that of the referee , is never protested . Legal dogfighting in Japan is vastly different from the illegal sport conducted on remote farms in the United States by gamblers and coarse-grained owners . The Japanese sincerely believe their gigantic dogs enjoy the matches . // " Their tails wag as they fight , thus do they not fight with pleasure ? " an old man asked me.
