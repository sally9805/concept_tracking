A Labor M.P . under the pressure of Harold Wilson 's majority of three , lives in a state of virtual siege these days . The siege castle , of course , includes those pleasant precincts of the Palace of Westminster where a barbershop , showers , a gym , restaurants and a wine cellar exist . Nonetheless , from Monday through Thursday , Wilson 's members are hostages against the dread possibility of a sudden vote in Commons in which the government might not be able to muster its slim majority-and thus might conceivably be toppled from power . Only when " paired " with an absent Tory M.P . can a Laborite be excused during the sessions , which sometimes run all night . Otherwise he must stay within sprinting distance of the Commons ' doors , which are locked exactly seven minutes after a division bell sounds . <P> " Resign ! " Labor 's worst fears nearly materialized one night last week on an amendment to the finance bill . When the division bell sounded , Labor 's Postmaster-General , Anthony Wedgewood Benn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell sounds . Another backbencher , Michael English , was working on a research project in the basement , where he had arranged to be telephoned ; the switchboard was jammed . Parliamentary Secretary Norman Pentland was chatting with a friend when he heard the clanging ; deciding to finish his conversation , he arrived just as the Commons ' doors were slammed in his face . <P> As easily as that , Labor 's three-vote majority was gone . The House was unaware of what had happened until the vote was announced : 281 for , 281 against . After a stunned moment of disbelief , the Tories began to shout , " Resign ! resign ! " Shadow Chancellor Edward Heath leaped to his feet to proclaim , " It is quite apparent the government is in no position to carry on its business . Send for the Prime Minister-wherever he may be ! " <P> Wherever Harold Wilson was , he was not needed . Following custom in a tie , the chairman voted with the government , and on the next division Labor mustered a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wilson could have called for a vote of confidence and won it : neither Labor nor the Conservatives are , in fact , ready for a new election yet . <P> Nihilistic Genius . Still , the tie was a reminder of how close Wilson 's government is to the edge of power-and there are signs of some dissatisfaction in Britain with Wilson 's stewardship . Wilson 's economic policy has not yet righted sterling nor has it had its impact on modernizing the British economy ( see WORLD BUSINESS ) . Little of Wilson 's legislative program has been successful , and what many Britons remember best are the new taxes on cigarettes , liquor and car licenses , which produced the biggest boost in the average Briton 's cost of living in a decade . Declared the Economist , which strongly supported Wilson in last October 's election : the current economic state is " an achievement of nihilistic genius after seven months of Labor 's economic planning . . . Three times round has gone Labor 's gallant ship . How soon does it sink to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
