txt Preston , Ia. , Nov. ** a good thing that all the bees that can lay claim to being citizens of this community do n't decide to come to town some Saturday night and hobnob with the rest of the citizens . If they all got together at once , these bees would weigh in at a ratio of about 600,000 to one over the rest of the citizens . There are almost 1,000 friendly folks who live full time in Preston . At the peak of the honey season in summer , the beekeepers of the community have an estimated 600 million bees , which are not entirely unfriendly and , if you wish to believe Oliver Meyer , may be even rather jolly at times . Million Pounds a Year Meyer should know . Ile is credited with starting it all . If it had n't been for him , Preston might not now be extracting and shipping a million pounds of honey a year .

" As it is , the bees do visit Preston , particularly in the spring , tho fortunately not all at once . And when bee and citizen encounter each other on the streets , the coustomary hat tipping and other pleasantries are in order , after which each I goes his . own way . " In the spring . of the year there 'll be a lot of bees flying up and down the streets , " said the mayor , who operates a clothing store . " People cuss those darn bees , but we 've never ' had any disturbances , and they do n't hurt anything . " They wo n't cause any trouble in town if you keep them well fed . Got to keep a bee well fed .

" Nearly everyone around here is what you might call bee minded . Nobody has been stung to any extent . " Meyer , 65 , retired three years ago after 50 years as this community 's leading beekeeper . As a youngster he suffered polio , had difficulty walking , and had to wear leg braces . Lot of Work The son of a farmer , he spent much time as a youth watching a ... elderly woman work with some hives of bees in her yard . " It looked like a good thing for a guy who could n't do a lot of work to get into , " he recalled . " But it turned out to be pretty much work anyway . " When he was 13 , Meyer bought two colonies of bees from the woman . Before he retired a half century later , he was keeping as many at 2,000 colonies and was operating a custom extracting and marketing business . " Ollie Meyer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beekeeper around here started with him . He helped them in every way , including financially . " Meyer said there are about a half dozen large beekeepers and a few smaller ones in and around Preston . He estimated they have 10,000 colonies , which produce an average of 100 pounds of honey a colony a season . A colony is a swarm of bees , workers and drones , clustered about a queen in a hive . These colonies have a peak population of 60,000 bees in summer . In winter they are kept in cellars or other storage buildings . In spring they are transported in trucks to outyards on farms within a 50 mile radius of Preston . That gives the bees plenty of flight area to find nectar and make honey from sweet and white Dutch clover , alfalfa , and other plants . Meyer said he always likes to emphasize that bees are valuable to farmers as pollinators , as well as to beekeepers .

Meyer said he disliked retiring , but decided to do so because the work was too heavy and it was difficult to get help . Biggest beekeeper in the area now , lie said , is Elmer Junior Yaddof who started working for him as a school boy and now has 2,600 colonies and an extracting plant . " It 's a business that creeps up on you , " Meyer said . " I wish I could start over and give it another 50 years . I met a lot of fine people and a lot of fine bees . "
