Broadway Joe Namath ( see cover ) is the folk hero of the new generation . He is long hair , a Fu Manchu mustache worth $10,000 to shave off , swinging nights in the live spots of the big city , the dream lover of the stewardi  --  all that spells insouciant youth in the Jet Age . // Besides all that , Namath is a superb quarterback who in the Super Bowl last week proved that his talent is as big as his mouth  --  which makes it a very big talent , indeed . He went from Broadway Joe to Super Joe on a cloud-covered afternoon in Miami , whipping the Baltimore Colts , champions of the National Football League , 16-7 in the process . // Almost no one thought the New York Jets could penetrate the fine Baltimore defense , but Namath was sure of it and said so . " We 're a better team than Baltimore , " he said before the game . He was lying by the pool at the Gait Ocean Mile Hotel , where the Jets stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a bit of Dean Martin in his relaxed confidence and in the droop of his heavy-lidded eyes . He is a man of immense self-assurance and , as he showed early in the week , a man of startling honesty . // " Earl Morrall would be third-string quarterback on the Jets , " he said . " There are maybe five or six better quarterbacks than Morrall in the AFL. " // It was called loudmouthing , bragging , but as it turned out , Super Joe told it the way it was . In a surpassing display of passing accuracy and mental agility , he picked the Colt defense apart . Then , with a comfortable 16-0 lead , he prudently relied upon a surprisingly strong running game through most of the fourth quarter to protect that lead . He read the puzzling Colt defenses as easily as if they had been printed in comic books , and the Colt blitz , a fearsome thing during the regular NFL season , only provided Namath with the opportunity to complete key passes . // " We want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . " Joe reads the blitz real well . We like blitzing teams . " When it was over , Namath said , " I 'll tell you one thing . No champagne in the dressing room of the world champions is a ridiculous thing . Of course , I 've never been here before . " // Having embellished his image a bit , he went on to more serious things . " Do I regret what I said before the game ? " he asked rhetorically . " No , I meant every word of it . I never thought there was any question about our moving against their ' great ' defense . I 'm sorry that Don Shula took what I said about Morrall as a rap . I only meant it as a statement of fact . " // " Can you go over your emotions now ? " someone asked him , and Namath thought for a moment . " No , " he said . " That would take too much time and too much thinking . I 'd rather just enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Namath , the Jet victory was built on an exceptionally strong performance from an offensive line that has protected Namath like the palace guard all year , dogged , insistent running by Fullback Matt Snell and an inspired performance by the supposedly weak Jet secondary . // The Joe Namath of the defensive troops was elderly Johnny Sample , who once played for Baltimore and who had the difficult task of guarding the Colts ' Willie Richardson . " We can win , " Sample said before the game . " I 've been waiting three years for this . The National Football League blackballed me and took the bread off my table . " // The Jet defense planned to deny the Colts the devastating inside running that had riddled the Cleveland Browns in the NFL championship game . Larry Grantham , a light corner linebacker who played 20 pounds better than his weight , said , " All week long all you read about was Joe Namath against the great Baltimore defense , and nobody wrote anything about our defense . But we felt that we had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their defense has been giving Morrall the ball in good field position so he never had to drive more than 50 or 60 yards for a touchdown . We knew if we could make him go farther than that he would mess up eventually  --  and he did . " // The weak spots in the Jet defense , supposedly vulnerable to the Colt passing attack , were believed to be Cornerbacks Randy Beverly and Sample , but both proved to be exceptionally prickly obstacles . The Baltimore offense , even with Morrall having a disastrous day , often moved the ball rather handily , but each time it arrived at the gates to the end zone the Jets produced a drive-stopping play . Often it was Sample or Beverly who played William Tell . // On its first offensive series , Baltimore appeared ready to substantiate the opinion of the bookies and the sportswriters . " The writers said the NFL would kick the hell out of our quarterback , " Sample said . " But players play the game , not writers . " // Morrall passed to John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards . Tom Matte swept right end for 10 yards and Jerry Hill swept left end for seven more . Then Morrall passed to Tight End Tom Mitchell at the 19 for still another first down . But at this point the Jet defense forced two incompletions and on third down Sample and Beverly clung to Colt receivers so closely that Morrall could not find a target and ran for no gain . Lou Michaels missed a field goal from the 27-yard line and it was still 0-0. // The next time Baltimore threatened , Beverly made the first of his two key interceptions . The Colts had recovered a Jet fumble on the New York 12 , and on third and four from the New York six Morrall fired a cannon-shot pass at Mitchell over the Jet goal line . The ball hit Mitchell in the shoulder pad , caromed high in the air and Beverly made a diving , off-balance interception 10 yards away in the corner of the end zone . // Namath used this break as the springboard for a brilliantly executed 80-yard touchdown drive that pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took 12 plays to negotiate the touchdown and he accepted all the variations , stunts and devices of the Colt defense with equanimity . // On this drive Namath began by using Snell four times in a row for 26 yards . Snell is a 219-pound fullback in his fifth year with the Jets and he reserved his best performance of the season for this game . Early in the week Snell had had a damaged knee drained of fluid , but now he ran as friskily as if he had 18-year-old , undamaged legs . // " Their defensive line likes to hit and slide off the block , " he said later . " They have great pursuit , so we did n't want to try to run anything that would delay hitting the hole . We were hitting to the right side of their defensive line . I 've been telling reporters for a long time that Winston Hill is a great offensive tackle and today he proved it . I mean when he blocks , he does n't just get a stalemate with the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The long gainer for Snell on his four carries was a draw , a play that stung the Colts over and over again as the Jets did what the Colts were supposed to do  --  control the ball on a long drive . With the Colt defense properly concerned with the Jet running attack , Namath went to the air . // The Colt defense demonstrated a fascination for Don Maynard , the fastest of the Jet receivers , who has been described as a faster Raymond Berry with not quite as good moves , He may be better than that . " They had a strong rotation toward Don , " said George Sauer , the other wide receiver . " Most clubs will do that to the receiver who has the most speed . " // On the first pass after Snell 's four runs , Namath went to Sauer . Don Shinnick , the linebacker , had dropped back deep in the area . He nearly intercepted the ball . " I was a little off balance and I had to make sure I knocked it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " // Namath hit Bill Mathis , in for Snell , on an outlet pass for six yards , then came back to Sauer in the cracks of the zone twice , once for 14 yards and again for 11 . The Colts had not expected him to throw much to his running backs , figuring that he would have to keep them at home to protect him from Baltimore 's pass rush . But now he hit Snell for 12 yards , down to the Baltimore nine . // From there , Namath calmly went back to the run and Snell carried twice , scoring the second time from four yards out over the vulnerable right side of the Colt line . Again he started inside , veered out and slashed across off a block by Tackle Hill . // " Snell is a great runner , " Hill said after the game . " He does n't ask for much room . The mediocre backs come back to the huddle and cry if they did n't get a hole big enough to back a truck through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best teams in our league What 's so special about the Colts ? " // By now five minutes and 57 seconds had elapsed in the second quarter and the Colts began to come apart a bit . A player who preferred to be unidentified said , " We should have had points on the board with the way we moved the ball , and we were behind 7-0 . We should have stuck to the game plan , but we began to panic . That 's what they were supposed to do , but they played with great poise . We didn't. " // Late in the second period , strong Safety Jim Hudson made a good play on a Colt maneuver that might have turned the game around . The Colts had the ball on the New York 41 with 25 seconds to go , and Morrall tried a bit of razzle-dazzle that should have resulted in a touchdown. // He handed the ball to Tom Matte on a sweep to the right  --  a play on which Matte had been effective  --  and Matte , in mid-sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field to Morrall . Far downfield in the corner near the goal line , Jimmy Orr was jumping up and down and waving his arms frantically , completely overlooked by the Jet defense . But Morrall did not see him and threw over the middle deep toward Fullback Jerry Hill . Hudson nipped in ahead of Hill and intercepted the ball . // " I was the primary receiver , " Orr said later . " Earl said he just did n't see me . I was open from here to Tampa . " // Bill Curry , the Colt center who was in shock for an hour after the game , said , " I 'm just a lineman but I looked up and saw Jimmy open . I do n't know what happened . " // On the first play of the second half , the Jets recovered a Matte fumble and Jim Turner kicked a field goal to make it 10-0 . When the Jets stopped Baltimore again , Namath took his team back down the field , where Turner kicked another field goal . // At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter , Baltimore Coach Don Shula turned to John Unitas , the master quarterback who spent this season on the bench nursing a tennis elbow . Johnny U. got the Colts their touchdown and showed flickers of his old mastery as he led them 80 yards for the score , completing four passes on the drive . Yet , in a way , it was sad . Unitas hit four passes , but he missed six , and when the Colts tried an onside kick and recovered the ball on the Jet 44 with three minutes and 14 seconds to go , Unitas could n't pull it off . He hit three passes in a row , but then he missed three to lose the ball . He got it once more but he could not score again . // So the era of John Unitas ended and the day of Broadway Joe and the mod quarterback began . John is crew cut and quiet and Joe has long hair and a big mouth , but haircuts and gab obviously have nothing to do with the efficiency of quarterbacks. // Namath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after eight years of existence , but only the third Super Bowl matchup . It might convince some AFL owners they should keep the present league alignments intact when the two meet in Palm Springs on March 17 to arrange the scheduling merger . Wayne Valley , an owner of the Oakland Raiders , is one AFL owner who wants to keep his league as it is. // If the AFL stays together as an operating unit , it will owe its existence in part to a stubby little man named Weeb Ewbank , who last week gave Joe Namath a brilliant game plan and who won NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 with Johnny Unitas and the Colts . Ewbank , in discussing the two great quarterbacks he has coached to championships , often mistakenly says Namath when he means Unitas. // But it was Broadway Joe  --  or Super Joe , if you prefer  --  who did the big job in this game . It is easy to understand why Ewbank has difficulty separating Johnny U. and Super Joe in his mind . They are so different  --  yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
