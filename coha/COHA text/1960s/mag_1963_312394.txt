WEEK in and week out , our correspondents see a lot of history being made ; and having filed their stories to TIME , they are apt to continue thinking about their subject . Many of their choicest anecdotes , their best quotes and their ideas on the subject will have appeared in the magazine , but they also know that a cumulative survey of the events they have lived with and reflected upon will have its own special appeal . And so these trained observers , on their own time or on leave of absence , sit down to write correspondents ' books , those valuable first steps into history . <P> Two such works appear this week , from the typewriters of TIME correspondents . Hugh Sidey has closely covered the President since senatorial days , and tells about it in John F. Kennedy , President-A Reporter 's Inside Story ( Atheneum , $6.95 ) . Sidey is one of that " haughty elite , " the regular White House correspondents : " When they move around the country in the wake of the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks , respected by college journalism students-in short , they are somebodies by association . ' ' But at other times , dashing across fields to catch up with a presidential party , Sidey wonders whether " strong legs are more of a requirement than big brains . " <P> In his book , he is now able to describe the times , usually after some shattering public event , when the President , trusting Sidey 's confidence , would talk alone with him at day 's end . Under the ground rules , the substance of the President 's candid feelings about men and problems were often expressed in TIME without any reference to these conversations . Sidey 's book is sympathetic to his subject , but not uncritical . He prefers to call it keeping the necessary middle distance of the journalist , " an outsider 's view of inside the White House . " <P> Robert Blair Kaiser studied ten years for the priesthood before becoming a journalist . Fluent in Latin , he was assigned by TIME to cover the Ecumenical Council of the Vatican in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the 1963 Overseas Press Club award for the best magazine reporting on foreign affairs . Recently he took time off to write Pope , Council and World ( Macmillan ; $4.95 ) . So that he could get the solitude he wanted , he checked in at the Roman College of an international missionary order , and there for six weeks wrote from 8 in the morning until 1 the next , taking time out to go home to lunch with his wife Susan and daughter Polly . His book has already appeared in England and been highly praised . In the London Sunday Times , Critic John Raymond asserts : " Mr. Kaiser writes in TIME style at its best-which is to say that his book is contemporary history recorded at a high level .
