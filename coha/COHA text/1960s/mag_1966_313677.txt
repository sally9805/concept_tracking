THE prime purpose of journalism is to shed light . And our main medium for such illumination is the printed word . The words for this week 's cover story on San Francisco Giants Pitcher Juan Marichal are those of Sport Writer Charles Parmiter , working with a good infield of correspondents , all under the editing eye of Senior Editor George Daniels . Parmiter 's story sheds new light not only on the sport but also on the science and sociology of baseball . <P> <P> Two components of the cover story clearly demonstrate another method of illumination : the graphic arts . One is the cover itself , the first for TIME by California Artist Gerald Gooch , who , having once aspired to a career in professional baseball , approached his commission with zest . His nine sequential oil studies of Marichal in the act of making a single pitch are a rare example of an artist catching this kind of action . " You will notice , " says Gooch , " that the three panels from upper right to lower left , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the pitch . It 's sort of a slow-motion sequence . It 's what you see at the ball game . The action shown in the other panels happens too fast for most persons to see . I decided on nine panels because there are nine innings in a baseball game and nine players on a team . The panels are in threes because there are three outs to an inning , and also-it 's three strikes and you 're out . " <P> To Cartographer Robert M. Chapin Jr . fell the intricate assignment of showing precisely what happens to the baseball as Marichal pitches-fastball , screwball , slider and curve . Marichal posed his right hand and ball grip for the four photographs in the diagram that illustrates the cover story , and made several suggestions and corrections in the drafts of Chapin 's drawing . It should be pointed out that Chapin brought some baseball credentials of his own to the task . He once pitched for the Pirates - the Park Road Pirates of Washington , D.C. <P> <P> SINCE 1961 , when the Exhibition Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3,000,000 people have attended its art shows and educational exhibitions , which are open free to the public seven days a week . Last week the New York Board of Trade presented its Business and the Arts Award to Time Inc. for making the center available " as a showcase for major art presentation . "
