Since most men and women can not know the hour of their death , they fritter away hours and hours of their lives . But suppose one is young and knows one 's death is imminent ? The idea that animated Director Vittorio De Sica in making A Place for Lovers was to find the one life imperative that possesses the force of death . That imperative is love - life at its most vibrant intensity . <P> If the film he made had not proved to be woefully inept , its theme might have made it grand , tragic and compellingly romantic . As it is , it merely gives Faye Dunaway a chance for a last , torpid , tuberculous fling . TB may or may not be the unnamed mortal disease that she has . She behaves pretty much like a willful child playing hooky from the sanatorium . As her erotic partner , Marcello Mastroianni displays all the zest of a man summoned up for tax evasion . He appears to be lipreading his English , although the script seems to find the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scriptwriters who supposedly worked on the film must have spent enough time at the water-cooler to flood a camel . The only smidgin of plot is that Dunaway makes a late abortive attempt at suicide , something the film successfully achieves after about ten minutes .
