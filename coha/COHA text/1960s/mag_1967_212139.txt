Harold Pinter is the Pavlov of playwrights . He feeds questions and withholds answers , leaving playgoers in a state of salivary anxiety . Written by Pinter in 1958 , but opening on Broadway last week , The Birthday Party is certain to evoke in audiences another tantalized swivet . <P> The play 's deadfall guy , Stanley ( James Patterson ) , a paranoid expianist , is a mildly sinister human cipher and the sole boarder of a dilapidated rooming house at an English seaside resort . His landlady , Meg ( Ruth White ) cuddles and cossets him ; unfailingly , she treats Stanley and her whey-faced husband to the breakfast specialty of the house , corn flakes and fried bread . Stanley has even less stomach for breakfast when he learns that two men named Goldberg ( Ed Flanders ) and McCann ( Edward Winter ) have come to the house as roomers . <P> McCann is edgy and truculent ; Goldberg is expansive and sentimental as he reminisces about his mother 's gefilte fish . In Act II , they pistol-whip Stanley with words-mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A birthday party for Stanley turns into a Walpurgisnacht , as the lights go out and Stanley goes berserk trying to throttle Meg and rape a nubile bundle of fluff called Lulu ( Alexandra Berlin ) . Act III finds Stanley looking like a waxed zombie , Goldberg and McCann promising that " Monty " will take care of Stanley , and escorting him to something that seems suspiciously like a hearse . At the end , Meg and her husband retire to their corn flakes . <P> What is Stanley 's crime ? Are Goldberg and McCann agents of a murder ring , symbols of organized society , or instruments of fate ? What torture do the pair inflict on Stanley ? Rarely has Pinter left more to the playgoer 's imagination . The American cast keeps its English accents tidy but not its performances , and Director Alan Schneider lets the first act drowse . Basically , the play lacks the athletic snap and resonance of The Caretaker 's dialogue and the musky animal magnetism of The Homecoming family . But whether or not he baffles playgoers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jitters that likes its comedy sauced with cruelty . He taps the adrenal flow of anxiety and guilt that contemporary audiences bring into the theater with them . Mirrored in his comedies of terror , playgoers can see the resurgence of their own childlike fears , sense their own sadomasochistic impulses , detect the image of themselves as pawns of chance in a chaotic and absurd cosmos . <P> Pinter 's play patterns coalesce about three recurring elements and phases-the room , the torment , and the expiation . The room is the setting , the torment is often an extended abrasive comic put-on , and the expiation is usually an act of physical or psychic violence . The room is a square womb . Though lighted , it seems dark , partly because it is sometimes windowless or tightly curtained against any blade of outside light . Outside this haven of refuge lurks the nameless , faceless intruder who will violate the safety and innocence of the room .
