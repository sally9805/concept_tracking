In casual fashion , juvenile judge got to know juvenile delinquent . Wearing sports shirts and slacks or shorts , 32 judges took long walks , played ball and sipped sodas with 33 youths from the Lookout Mountain School for Boys , a reform school in Golden , Colo . And the jurists learned a few things . <P> One youngster told about smoking through green peppers : he said he pushed out the core of a green pepper , inserted a cigarette and got high from the smoke 's drawing across the pepper seeds . The judges learned the inmates ' definition of " spot " and " non-spot " peopie : the spots succeed through education ; the non-spots take what they want and resent authority . <P> 15-Minute Hearings . Juvenile folklore is only part of the instruction at the four-week summer college that winds up this week at the University of Colorado . Conducted by the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges , the school is designed to help the jurists learn criminal-law procedure and adjust to the Supreme Court 's recent decision In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same constitutional safeguards that adults enjoy . Because of the decision and recommendations by the President 's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice , juveniles are emerging from legal limbo . For years they were handled under a system that was supposed to treat youths almost like psychiatric patients , a theory that made procedural safeguards seem obstructionist . As it turned out , the system commonly punished acts , like using obscene language , that are rarely considered crimes when committed by adults . <P> For all its flaws , the juvenile-court system has developed some outstanding judges . Colorado 's Ben B. Lindsey , the famous advocate of " companionate marriage " who died in 1943 , spent four decades introducing numerous reforms , such as a Colorado law forbidding the charging of children under 16 with crime . Juvenile Judge Orman W. Ketcham , of Washington , D.C. , a faculty member of the current summer college , has campaigned for years for stronger legal safeguards for children . Justine Wise Polier , for 32 years a justice in New York 's family courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . <P> All the same , most of the nation 's current 3,000 juvenile court judges urgently need help in adjusting to change . Despite enormous case loads ( the 15-to-17 age group has the highest crime rate ) , the juvenile judge is often low man in the judicial hierarchy . One-fifth of juvenile-court judges never attended college ; about half have no undergraduate degrees . Although the system emphasizes rehabilitation , one-third of the full-time judges have no probation officers or social workers available . <P> <P> One in Six . All portents indicate that the juvenile judge will face more problems in the future . By 1975 , almost half the population will be 21 or under . Before his 18th birthday , one boy out of every six will be referred to a juvenile court for a delinquent act .
