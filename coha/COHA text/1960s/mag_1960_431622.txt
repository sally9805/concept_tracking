 | Handsome , volatile , magnetic , alternately exuberant and depressed , Francis Albert Sinatra , usually referred to simply as " Frank " or " Sinatra " or " The Voice , " now fortytwo enervating years old , a man whose hair is thinning as rapidly as his moods and torments and whims and rages are thickening in frequency , is today at the peak of his many careers . Few men ever manage to pack as much frenetic activity into three score and ten as Sinatra has jammed into less than a half century . He is known today mainly as a singer and an actor , but he is more than that : he is also a director , occasional writer , producer , music publisher , composer , gambler , carouser , practical joker , political campaigner , father , and lover . The first seven of these diverse occupations will bring Sinatra an estimated four million dollars this year ( some say it will be as much as seven million ) , much of which , after the government has taken its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuits . He will spend it freely , for he is absolutely convinced that there is  | much , much more where it all came from . He is fully aware that Sinatra is the greatest single male drawing card that is to be found in the entertainment business today . At the same time , Sinatra is something phenomenal . He is not merely an entertainer and a personality . He is an immensely powerful force ? a law unto himself . His lank shadow , now bulging a bit at the waist , falls across the world of show business . The psychological drives that usually send a performer into the business are generally quieted after security and recognition have been achieved . Sinatra has not relaxed in the least . Indeed , as he has grown bigger and more powerful , he has grown more demandingly arrogant ; he even flaunts his arrogance in public . The vast amounts of money he has made apparently have not been able to buy him emotional security . Where Sinatra once enchanted , he now enslaves ? as proved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubadours , for some inexplicable reason , attract retinues , but Sinatra 's entourage is something special . It is composed of friends , associates , press agents , song pluggers , and cosmeticians , but , in addition , it is composed of stars who are very nearly as big as is Frank Sinatra himself . This entourage is often referred to as " The Clan . " When the members of the Clan who are performers ? Dean Martin , Sammy Davis , Jr. , Peter Lawford , and Joey Bishop get together with Sinatra for a public appearance , they reverently call him " The Leader , " and he speaks of the gathering as " The Summit Meeting . " This is a joke , but at bottom it is not ; it is kidding on the square . It is as though the approval of millions , freely handed hint , openly dedicated to him , were  | not enough for Sinatra , as though he craved attention so desperately that he had to bestow it on himself . Sinatra 's power is not merely personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high among the top-drawing film attractions , he can demand a share in the production of the film from all major studios that ask for his services ? and practically all of them are constantly asking for his services . " Frank could spend the rest of his life making all the films offered to him in a single month , " a friend of his has told me . He also can demand the right of approval of the production staff and of his costars . This means that he can , by grimacing , put the kiss of death on an actor or actress he does not like ? or build up an inflated reputation for one he does like . AT CAPITOL Records . Sinatra is the acknowledged king . He seldom makes an LP disk that does not hit the 200,000-copy mark . A new Sinatra LP is all but automatically played on the nation 's radio stations . Officials at Capitol let him pick his own tunes and his own accompanists . They listen carefully to his advice , too . They bow to his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record at midnight , they pay the overtime charges without protest . A word from Sinatra can boost the progress of new singers or slow that of others . Similarly , Sinatra is powerful in the selection of songs that the company records , not only for his records but for those made by others . He has interests in a couple of music-publishing companies , the names of which change from time to time ; the biggest was called Barton . He can dictate to these companies the songs he wishes to be plugged , by live performance on television and radio . " A few months back there was a small revival of Oh , Look at Me Now , ' a song Frank used to sing with Tommy Dorsey , " a publisher told me . " I could n't understand why . Then I learned that Frank wanted it brought back . He 'd called the company that handled it and offered to put his own plugging facilities behind it . Then he 'd called other singers and asked them to use it . Before long ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , as well , the talent-agency business . There is every indication that his oft-voiced determination to form a talent agency of his own may become reality before this year is out . It is taken for granted that members of his Clan will flock into any new organization he may form or will even follow him if he decides to go to another organization . " Sure , I 'd go where Frank goes , " Dean Martin once told me , as though there were no question in his mind . And it is conceivable that others in show business would follow along , just to be sure of being on the winning team . How Sinatra can throw his 140-odd  | pounds of weight around when he wishes was indicated by a situation that developed when he held his Summit Meeting at his favorite Miami Beach hotel this past March . Sammy Davis , Jr. , was under exclusive contract to another hotel ; his contract stated he could not appear , even in an informal , impromptu way , anywhere else in Miami Beach . Sinatra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When Frank wants something , he drips charm . " a friend says . He wanted Davis . Before the manager could object , Sinatra had proposed a solution . " How about making an exception ? " he said . " We wo n't advertise him ; as far as the general public knows , you 'll still have him exclusively . " And he promised to make it seem that Davis had just dropped in to see his pals . Then he promised a favor to the manager ; the latter agreed ; Sammy Davis , Jr. , appeared . What all of this means to you is that Francis Albert Sinatra exercises a most powerful control over much of what you enjoy ( or do n't enjoy ) in films , on television , on records , on the radio , in nightclubs ? indeed , in every medium of entertainment except newspapers and magazines . To Sinatra 's apparently intense disgust , there is very little he can do about controlling the press . Nevertheless , he tries . When any clearly independent writer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket of silence over all his companions . Sometimes he threatens lawsuits . Occasionally he actually does sue when a published article displeases him . Sinatra 's influence as a pace setter is unparalleled in Hollywood . The informality of many recent TV extravaganzas ( shows in which a couple of singers simply stand around and sing snatches of tunes ) is an attempt to copy the successful shows Sinatra has done . Sinatra also has tremendous influence on the changing styles of music . It used to be that most singers sang ballads with strings or soft reeds as a background . Sinatra has always liked to sing with a strong beat . In recent years he has been making more and more records with Nelson Riddle. an arranger known for his use of dynamics and for his contrasts in brass and strings . Many other singers are hiring Riddle-oriented arrangers and leaders . FULLY aware of all these facts , Sinatra still does not seem to live comfortably with them . He continues to assert himself as though he were climbing and not yet on the top . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both powerful and seemingly insatiable , could conceivably determine the quality of the entertainment you see and hear ? may lie in his chilling awareness that if he has not yet begun to slip he ultimately will . All performers fall out of favor eventually to some degree ; this is as sure as the change of seasons in nature . Yet Sinatra evidently refuses to recognize inevitability ; he is , he seems bound to proclaim over and over , the indestructible exception . His attitude seems to be that failure must not happen to him . He will fight it off by sheer power . Failure is only for those he calls the " clydes " ? the " squares , " the inepts , those on whom fortune has not smiled . In 1951 and 1952 Sinatra himself appeared to have reached the end of one of the most fantastic ropes ever woven by pure appeal to the ticket-buying public . From 1945 on he had been earning over a million dollars a year ; highbrow magazines were printing articles about his unprecedented hold on not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandparents . His rise had made those of Rudy Vallee and Bing Crosby seem like ripples beside the tidal wave of his personal popularity . ALL at once , Sinatra was in trouble . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , his home film studio , was disturbed by his habit of producing unfavorable headlines ; his records were not selling as well as they had been ; even in nightclubs he was not drawing as he once had . He seemed to be washed up . He was broke , and he was borrowing from friends . His second marriage , to Ava Gardner , was falling apart . He was as low as a man of his former eminence could get . Then he pulled himself off the floor . Buddy Adler , now production chief at Twentieth Century-Fox , was a Columbia Pictures producer under the bombastic and autocratic Harry Cohn . Sinatra went to Adler and offered to play Maggio in From Here to Eternity for nothing . ( Or his agents made the offer : there are as many versions of this story as there are people to tell it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part and was given eight thousand dollars for his services ? plus , eventually . an Academy Award ; plus , almost at once , an even greater measure of esteem than he had had before . Hit films followed- one after another . He was red-hot again . Today Sinatra refuses to admit he was ever down and close to being out . " What do they mean . I was finished ? " he once shouted , a friend reports . " I was never finished ! " " You were close . Frank . " the friend said placatingly ( nearly all Sinatra 's friends are accustomed to speaking to him in soothing tones ) . " I was never finished ! " he yelled . according to this friend . " I showed them , did n't I ? " There is no denying it . But somewhere , under the red-faced belligerence , there may be a small , pulsating vein of uncertainty . Of late Sinatra has been getting enough bad reviews to unsettle the average performer . Few critics saw anything valid in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as badly as James Jones 's original book had been . In the London Daily Express , critic-pianist Robin Douglas-Home wrote of Sinatra 's last long-playing record : He is not " up to brilliant standard ... . The roundness of his voice of the early days seems to have given way recently to a harsher , coarser tone that gets more pronounced with each new record . .. . John Crosby , the television and radio columnist , recently said , " I have always thought he was one of the greatest performers that ever lived , but he 's getting awfully sloppy . . . . He 's doing too many things to do any of them well . " And a columnist for a news magazine recently wrote of Sinatra 's performance in CanCan : " His tired voice and gestures may suggest to moviegoers ... that Sinatrophy is setting in . " SINATRA himself is hoarding and husbanding " the Voice . " Except when recording , he usually tries to avoid singing with a big , dynamic band . In personal appearances he prefers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by vibraharpist Red Norvo , which demands less volume from his lungs and vocal cords . When Norvo was touring Europe with Benny Goodman last autumn . he was barraged suddenly by cables and telephone calls . Sinatra had forgotten he had a television show coming up . He wanted Norvo back at once . He offered to fly him in , to send Goodman a substitute musician- then to send Norvo back . When it became clear that Norvo could not make proper connections in time . Sinatra was furious ? at himself . for forgetting . Many of Sinatra 's rages are directed at himself . Before he moved into the $250,000 house he now occupies in Pacific Palisades. he lived in a small duplex on Wilshire Boulevard , a little beyond Beverly Hills . Agent Irving Paul Lazar lived next door , in a mirror-image apartment decorated- as Sinatra 's had been . by Loretta Young 's mother . Mrs. Gladys Belzer . Often Lazar would come home late at night and see Sinatra alone in his flat , hunched over a table with a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done or had failed to do , the hi-fi system rattling desolately against the walls . " I used to try to cheer him up , " Lazar once told me. " but when he got in one of those moods . there was nothing anybody could do . " Another friend says , " When Sinatra gets sore , he screams and shouts and throws things : then , a second later . he apologizes . He does some nice things . Once , on location in Spain . he was furious at one of the prop kids for something ; he said he would have him fired . Then . later . when he was feeling better , he heard the kid had a relative in the hospital ; he picked up a part of the bill . Frank is harder on himself than he is on others . " Using Norvo 's accompaniment is not the only way in which Sinatra tries to preserve his voice . Three years ago , on a nightclub date , he would come on the stage . eyes blazing , fingers snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding to the tumultuous applause with a half-dozen encores . In recent appearances I have seen him make , he seldom has sung more than one chorus of any given song . has sung fewer songs . and often has abandoned some songs after a few lines . Also . of late , he has been resorting to such tricks as using his own words and phrases as crutches to help him get over the more rocky passages . Lyric-changing is only one small . aa.a  | manifestation of Sinatra 's insistence that he is the Leader and that the Leader can do no wrong . Possibly because he continually has to reassure himself that all is well in his domain , he goes out of his way to prove it . He even risks popular disapproval . Last March he made headlines by hiring Albert Maltz to write the screenplay for a planned Sinatraproduced film . The Execution of Private Slovik . Maltz is one of a group of writers known as the Hollywood Ten ; he served a prison sentence for contempt of Congress after he had refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood that the Ten , " officially " blacklisted by studios , had been writing scripts under the table . so to speak , ever since they got out of jail . Sinatra may have felt that it was more honest ( his friends say he has a passion for stark honesty ) to come out in the open with the hiring of Maltz , but many interpreted it as an insult to the public . Sinatra was subjected to an enormous amount of criticism , by newspaper editorial and from pulpit and lectern , and finally announced that he was dropping Maltz . Such a complete concession ? even to such indignant and overwhelming public opinion as Sinatra faced in the Maltz situation ? is so uncharacteristic of the Frank Sinatra of today that observers are inclined to the belief that some tremendous and unusual pressure must have been applied to Sinatra to make him give up his stand . He said , among other things in a statement explaining his decision , that his fancily had influenced him . ( A better guess was that Senator John F. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the former ambasador to England , Joseph P. Kennedy , applied the pressure . The theory was that the elder Kennedy would have seen to it that Sinatra would have been completely disassociated from the Kennedy campaign had Sinatra not complied . ) Involvement in politics , of course , is not new for Sinatra . Probably through the good offices of Peter Lawford , who is married to Senator Kennedy 's sister Patricia . Sinatra recorded quite a few plugs for the Kennedy cause . He also campaigned for Presidents Roosevelt and Truman and for Adlai Stevenson , twice . Sinatra 's friends like to rib him by asking him whether he plans to become Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare if Kennedy is elected ... . Now and then word of Sinatra 's apparent contempt for the public seeps through the stone wall erected around the performer by his press agents , the firm of Henry Rogers-Warren Cowan , Inc . In Madison . Indiana . Sinatra , on location for Some Came Running , was riding in a bus past people who were lined up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them that they could not hear . " Look at that ugly broad over there , " he allegedly said . " Hi , fat boy . Hi , you horrible bag . " All the while he kept beaming . Outside a bar named the Oasis , he flourished a glass in the air . " Our people do not flaunt their drinking . . . . We like to think we 're gentlemen , " one Madison resident said . Later Sinatra was accused of having abused a sixty-seven-year-old clerk in the motel in which he was staying because the clerk had become confused when given a series of complicated orders for hamburgers ( members of the Clan are constantly sending out for sandwiches and pizzas ) . AN UNWRITTEN ? and ironclad ? showbusiness law holds that jokes about race , color , and religion are , no matter what their intent , offensive to the majority of people . In the past Sinatra himself has made several gestures toward the improvement of human relations . His short  | film , The House I Live In , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Boston , when a radio engineer slurred a Jewish musician , Sinatra cracked him with a bottle , and when a counterman in a diner refused to serve a Negro , Sinatra slugged him . " Nothing brings out Frank 's temper as quickly as bigotry , " his press agent , Warren Cowan , says . In view of this , some recent developments are incomprehensible . For example . what I heard during a performance of Sinatra 's Summit Meeting in Miami Beach in March made me wonder if my ears were working properly . Not only antirace and antireligion jokes but also open profanity cascaded from the stage . SINATRA demands ? and gets ? strict obedience from those around him . While he was working in Las Vegas , he decreed that none of his gang should set foot inside a certain club ; nobody would have considered defying him . He insists on absolute loyalty , even to the point that none of his cronies may say anything remotely critical of him . For example . in the winter of 1959 , Sammy Davis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disk jockey in Chicago . said , " Talent is not an excuse for bad manners . I love Frank , but there are many things he does that there is no excuse for .... " Word at once came to him that Sinatra was furious . Sinatra is said to have got a tape of the program . He took action promptly . He had previously had the screenplay of Never So Feu. rewritten so that there would he a part for Davis . He ordered the Negro part written out and hired actor Steve McQueen instead . Earl Wilson , the Broadway re : porter , later said , " ' T was reported that Sammy was ready to hurl himself prostrate on the stage to ask Frank 's forgiveness . " Later Sinatra did relent. and since then Davis has seemed determined never to fall from favor again , using only the must . glowing terms when he speaks of the Leader . On March 25. 1959 , while Davis was appearing at the Copacabana in Manhattan . I interviewed him in his suite in the Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chair , leaping to the huge sofa and squatting there on his haunches ; he was like an excitable nuthatch . When I asked Davis about Sinatra 's reactions to his Chicago comments , he said he could not discuss the incident . Presently I asked him what it was about Sinatra that caused him and other members of the Clan to be so slavish in their adoration . Davis looked shocked . He glanced over his shoulder nervously , then said solemnly . " Why . because Frank is a very . very . very great man . " Dean Martin later echoed this to me in an interview . " That Frank 's the greatest , " he said . " A great , great man , that Frank . " With his new great success . Sinatra has taken on the lush living habits of the very , very rich . Harry Kurnitz. the screen writer and humorist. told of the time he was a guest on a yacht Sinatra had chartered for a group of friends for a cruise down the California coast . " Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host since Lorenzo de Medici . " Commenting on Sinatra 's apparently inexhaustible energy and ability to stay up until all hours . Kurnitz added , " You know , Frank is the only person in the world who will invite you to a black-tie dinner and tell you to bring your sunglasses . " On that same cruise , according to actor Martin Gabel , husband of TV personality Arlene Francis , Sinatra hired a seaplane to follow the yacht . " to take guests home and bring aboard new waves of them . " Once , last spring in Miami Beach . when he needed a haircut , Sinatra had his own barber flown in from New York and gave him a hundred-dollar tip ; when his throat was bothering him . he had his physician brought down . When he gambles. he plunges like the legendary Beta-Million Gates . " I 've seen him go up to the baccarat table with ten thousand dollars , sit down . put the bundle on the table , ride it up to thirty thousand , lose it , and walk away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norio . At Monte Carlo , columnist Leonard Lyons once watched Sinatra place a packet of ten-thousand-franc notes ( approximately two thousand dollars ) on the red , lose with one turn of the wheel , then take out another packet of hills of the same denomination , and another , and keep playing until the place closed and he was ahead by around three thousand dollars . He walked out jauntily , leading his entourage to a nightclub named the Ali Baba . where he suddenly was moved to sing . The piano player did not suit him . He gave the man ten thousand francs to let his own accompanist take over . THE Clan , evidently believing that imitation is the most desirable form of flattery , does its best to emulate its Leader in his gaudy ways . All members ? with the possible exception of two female members , Shirley MacLaine and Judy Garland ( the latter has been ill and in- active of late ) , who , because they are women , can not be miniature Sinatrastry to be like the Leader at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy theirs from a Hollywood tailor named Sy Devore ; Dean Martin gives Devore screen credit on his TV shows ) , and they even drive cars like Frank 's . His is a Dual-Chia , a custom-made model with an American motor and an Italian body , costing around ten thousand dollars . Martin once told me , regretfully , he had tried to buy a Dual-Chia but could not find anybody who would sell him one . He now drives a Jaguar hard-top roadster. evidently with Sinatra 's approval . The Clan also tries to emulate Sinatra 's own peculiar speech habits . All secret societies have secret languages , but the Clan 's is so obscure that a lady reporter once complained , after Sinatra had granted her a few minutes of his time , " For years I tried to get an exclusive interview . . . and when I got one , I could n't understand a word he said . " ONCE Sinatra has put his stamp of approval on a slang word- it is obligatory for the members to use it on all occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Sinatra would interject it into his songs and use it whenever he wanted to express approval . as in : " Shirley MacLaine is a ring-a-ding broad . " " Broad , " of course , is the standard Clan word for " woman . " even a respectable woman- although Sinatra sometimes applies it to women he does not like . A girl who especially pleases him is a " gasser. " and anything that is fun or thrilling is a " gas . " The synonym for almost any word is " Clyde , " which originally had an off-color meaning among show folk- as in " Kick him in the Clyde . " Sinatra and his cronies now use it for nearly everything . " Hand me the Clyde , " Sinatra might say --  asking for the telephone book On the unlikely event he ever looks up a number in the telephone book ) : or . " Let 's go to the Clyde , " meaning- " Let 's go into the dining room " or " Let 's go to the party . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often says , " I think it 's going to rain . " This means that the Leader wishes to go elsewhere . Sinatra is always going elsewhere : he once said to director Vincente Minnelli- " I ca n't help it . Nobody seems to be able to help me with it . I 've got to go ! I have to move ! " He was gripped by this compulsion the night of the reception following Jack Benny 's ( laughter 's first wedding . The Bennys are topflight Beverly Hills socialites , loved and respected members of a community that prizes talent even above riches . They had given their daughter such an elaborate party that their peers talked about it for weeks afterward . Sinatra became bored soon after he and his group had arrived . " I think it 's going to rain . " he muttered . Those who did not hear him nevertheless sensed his eagerness to move . His entire party departed . Sinatra 's war with the press has now become familiar to the public . He has insisted that the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Aronowitz once commented in the New York Post , absolving himself of all blame for the destruction of two marriages . He has kept himself almost entirely aloof from reporters . With a few exceptions , no reporter has had anything amounting to a genuine interview with Sinatra for two years . Requests for interviews are turned aside with the explanation that Sinatra is " away , " " sick , " or " busy . " Whether he wishes to be or not , Sinatra has become the most feared man in Hollywood . " Sinatra is a closed corporation in this town , " a veteran Hollywood reporter told me recently . " No one will talk about him . He 's an untouchable . " Sinatra takes nearly everything written about him the wrong way . for some rea-on that is not entirely clear . When Bill Davidson , one of the best of the " reporters in depth , " wrote a three-part article about Sinatra for Look magazine , in which he indicated that the performer was less than superhuman , Sinatra promptly filed suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , claiming that the magazine had invaded Sinatra 's privacy , was substituted . That suit is now awaiting trial in the Los Angeles courts . When I began working on this article , I sent a telegram asking for an interview with Sinatra to Warren Cowan. his press agent . It was never answered , but I was told by Guy Mc:Dwaine. then an employee of Cowan 's , " My strongest recommendation to him will be that he see you . I ca n't promise anything beyond that . " When I reached Miami Beach , Mcllwaine stated , first , that Frank was " too tied up over the Albert Maltz thing " ( he had just hired Maltz , and the press was hitting him hard ) and , second . that he was " too busy rehearsing his television - how " ( the show , telecast in May , in which he welcomed back Elvis Presley to civilian life ) . I learned it is useless to attempt to get others to talk about the Leader . Dean Martin , Sammy Davis , Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinatra 's right-hand man ) , Mack Gray , Beans Ponedel ( Sinatra 's make-up man ) persistently avoided me . I finally gave up trying to see them . ILL this would have been merely frustrating if it had not been for one incident that was alarming . While I was in Miami Beach on this story , my phone rang at four one morning . Word apparently had been circulated that I was writing an article . A low voice said . " German ? " ( this is a common mispronunciation of my name ) . " If you know what 's good for you , " the voice went on , " lay off Frank . " The receiver clicked in my ear . At first I was convinced it was a joke . The trouble was , my rapidly beating heart did n't act as if it had been a joke ; nor did my shaking hands . It had to be a prank , I reasoned . Even those most infected by Sinatra 's highly contagious devil-may-care attitude would not be rash enough to threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much has been written of Sinatra 's hoodlum companions . Whether he has any such connections is difficult to verify . However , the fact that Sinatra himself is only too well aware that many people believe he has them is evinced by a line he permits Joey Bishop to use in the Summit Meeting act : " Later on , " says Bishop , " Sinatra will give a lecture on all the good work the Maffia does . " Sinatra does not depend on his cohorts to be pugnacious in his behalf . He does considerable fighting on his own , or he has in the past . In Monte Carlo one night , he was approached by an Englishman who once had insulted Ava Gardner . The man put out his hand , trying to patch things up . He was well over 6 ' 4 " and weighed at least 250 pounds . Sinatra stared at him contemptuously . " Beat it , bum , " he said . Taken aback , the man ? who could have demolished Sinatra with one slap ? retreated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash one of Sinatra 's parties in Palm Springs . Later he disappeared , and a friend asked what had happened to him . " He became punched , " Sinatra said , with a wink . Besides the actual physical combat , there also have been any number of verbal set-tos with directors , producers , and other actors . Sinatra walked off the set of Carousel when it was on location in Maine because he disagreed with Henry Ephron , the producer . On the Some Came Running location in Indiana , M-G-M executive producer Sol Siegel had to make peace between Sinatra and Vincente Minnelli , the director . The Guys and Dolls set was a far from happy one ; Sinatra and Marlon Brando could not get along together . WHEN Sinatra is working , either things go his way or he automatically rebels . He sets his own hours , usually beginning work at 11 A.M. This invariably costs a studio extra money , since overtime costs mount considerably when a company has to be kept working until seven or eight P.M. , as is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also made on his own personal schedule . He has been known to keep an orchestra waiting around a studio until close to midnight , when he feels relaxed enough to sing at his best . Sinatra claims he works as he does because he knows exactly what is best for him . Directors who have worked with him have been known to disagree . " If he would just listen , " Stanley Kramer , the producer-director , once said , " he might become the greatest actor in the world . " Sinatra will seldom listen . He dictates not only to the director and producer , but even to minor participants . On many occasions he acts also as an unofficial casting director . Shirley MacLaine 's rapid rise has not come about entirely as a result of her talent , which is adequate . It is reasonable to assume that Sinatra 's interest in her and his encouragement have been of great help . Time and time again Sinatra has told people that he hates being alone . And it is a good possibility that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionship . The same might be said of his relationships with women . To list all of Sinatra 's girls would be an endless task , but in recent years Lauren Bacall was the front runner , as far as the Hollywood guessers were concerned , whenever anyone happened to ask , " Will Sinatra marry again ? " Sinatra met Miss Bacall while her husband , Humphrey Bogart . was still alive . Bogart then led a small group , called " The Holmby Hills Rat Pack . " which met regularly at his house to mock stuffy Hollywood society . Sinatra became a member in good standing . " He 's a hell of a guy , " Bogart once said to me . " He tries to live his own life . If he could only stay away from broads and devote some time to developing himself as an actor , he 'd be one of the best in the business . " Sinatra was around the Bogart house frequently . not only when the Rat Pack was in executive session but at other times . He sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by in the afternoon , stay for dinner , and sit around until late at night . " I do n't know what it is about this joint ; it seems to be a kind of home for him . " Bogart told me . " It 's as though he does n't have a home of his own . We seem to be parent symbols or something . Or maybe it 's just that he likes a place where he can relax completely . " After Bogart died , perhaps it was only natural for Lauren Bacall to turn to Sinatra for companionship , but their relations rapidly progressed upward from mere sociability . One evening , while the relationship was at its warmest . I had a drink with her in Beverly Hills . She was awaiting a telephone call from Sinatra , who was in Florida . Her eyes danced in anticipation . After she came from speaking to him on the phone , she was radiantly happy . " Are you going to marry him ? " I asked bluntly . She gave me a mysterious smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that they were to be married . Some men close to Sinatra have told me he was infuriated ; they say he blamed Miss Bacall for the report and forthwith broke off their relationship . Others say she was troubled by rumors she kept hearing of Sinatra 's herculean interest in the opposite sex and decided that he could not take Bogart 's place as a father for her children . Whatever happened , a month or so later , when they brushed near each other at a party . they scarcely spoke . The romance had lasted a year . Recently Miss Bacall told me that Sinatra still calls her occasionally . Others have reported that he calls his first wife . Nancy , nearly every day . And others claim that he is still in love with Ava Gardner . Last year , Sinatra was involved with Lady Adelle Beatty , the American-born ex-wife of Earl Beatty , son of Admiral Beatty , hero of Jutland . She visited him in the United States . at Palm Springs , and also went to see him when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in London ( where he demonstrated to British reporters that his hatred of the press is not limited by national boundaries : " He appeared to loathe us just as much as he loathes Americans , " said Gerald McKnight of the Sunday Dispatch ) . Sinatra was annoyed by reports that he was about to marry Lady Beatty ; he told an audience ( which included Princess Margaret ) , " I did not come here to get married . " One friend of Lady Beatty 's recently told me , " She felt he was too mercurial for marriage . " Sinatra 's reason for the eventual breakup has not been registered for posterity . Sinatra. as a lover , is a hit like an avalanche . Not long ago a starlet , who was his girl for a full four days ( thereby setting some sort of tenure record ) , described his courtship . " First , there were the incessant calls . " she said . " Funny calls ? joky , kookie calls . You know , Frank is a real wit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said to her . ) " Then there were all the flowers and champagne and presents by the dozen . And then , when he finally got back to town ( he 'd been away ) . there were the nights at his favorite restaurants . " She stopped . I prodded her to go on . " There 's nothing more ; " she said . I persisted . " No , really , " she said in bewilderment . " All of a sudden he just stopped . I mean , he just did n't call . " Some girls last longer than others . Sinatra 's current interest is Juliet Prowse , the dancer . ( That is , she is at this writing . By the time this is read , she may have been replaced . ) SINATRA 'S friends say his romantic ardor is an indication of his fundamental zest for life and experience . Psychiatrists might have different views , taking into consideration the fact that he is fantastically meticulous . He takes a shower two or three times a day , changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his quarters be kept immaculate . He will not listen to criticism of any kind . Such behavior could suggest that Sinatra was wounded emotionally when he was very young and has not been able to heal the wounds with the salve of maturity . Like his relations with women , the saga of his formative years has been set down so many times that to repeat it except briefly would only waste space . He was born in Hoboken . New Jersey . the only child of a mother who was a minor politician and a father who was the secondary character in the connubial drama . Various relatives and friends helped raise him . Skinny and slight-muscled , he made up for his lack of stature with a compensating cockiness he has never lost . Evidently , as events have shown , he did not make up for it enough , and still has n't . Indication that this background may have left Sinatra emotionally torn can be found in recent accounts of his life written by biographers not strongly influenced by him , his clique , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to see a psychiatrist for a time but then he had given it up ; he had found out " what he wanted to know . " he said . The resulting combination of his behavioral tendencies and of his vast and growing personal power should be a cause of concern to all who watch and listen to popular records , radio and television shows , movies , and nightclub acts . It would be disturbing indeed even if this enormous power were in the hands of a completely stable and predictable human being . When it is in the hands of a man torn by emotions that he apparently either can not or does not care to control . it is something to view with alarm . As Lord Acton 's famous law states : " Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely . "
