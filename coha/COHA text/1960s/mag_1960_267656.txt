Of all the jokes about the Ph.D. , the least funny is that remarkably few Americans earn one . Debatable as the notion may be , a doctorate is considered the desirable qualification for college teaching . In the next decade , colleges will need at least 27,000 new teachers a year . But the present total Ph.D . output is 9,000 a year , and less than half become college teachers . <P> Nonetheless , the Ph.D . shortage is being tackled with burgeoning success by the Princeton-bred Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation , which aims to make professors out of able college students as fast as possible . The recruiters are 900 faculty members throughout the country , who help nominate bright seniors for hard-eyed grilling by 15 regional committees of scholars . The prize : one year of graduate study at any university in the U.S. or Canada . No small change , the award carries a $1,500 stipend , family allowances and the full cost of tuition . <P> Farmers &; Flyers . Last week the foundation announced a rich crop of 1,259 winners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved that potential professors can spring from almost any source . Indiana University 's Ernest Lockridge , 21 , son of the late novelist Ross ( Raintree County ) Lockridge Jr. , will teach English after studying at Yale or Harvard . Ontario 's Waterloo University College produced Robert Hett , 32 , who quit work in a rubber company to study history , and will now go to Cornell . Shelby Faye Lewis , 19 , of Louisiana 's Southern University , is a pretty Negro coed and one of seven children of a barber in Plain Dealing , La. ( pop . 1,321 ) . She will study political science at the University of Illinois , hopes to " improve our people 's knowledge of their country . " And there are hundreds more , from a former Hungarian freedom fighter at Illinois ' Monmouth College , who could barely speak English three years ago , to a onetime Louisiana truck farmer , now studying advanced history at the University of North Carolina . <P> Launched in 1945 by Whitney J. Gates , chairman of classical studies at Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who might not have become college teachers at all . One of them was Robert F. Goheen , a Princeton man and recently discharged Army light colonel , who aimed at a State Department career . He became a classicist instead , and wound up after eleven years as president of Princeton . The 1946 Fellows were diverted just as neatly from other careers . Frank Wadsworth , a wartime test pilot who wanted to go on flying , is now a Shakespearean scholar at the University of California . And William M. Meredith , poet and English professor at Connecticut College , was won away from his prewar reporting job on the New York Times . <P> Seller 's Market . What put the show on the road was a $24.5 million grant from the Ford Foundation in 1957 . The operation is still based at Princeton , under President Sir Hugh Taylor , dean emeritus of Princeton 's graduate school . But its recruiting setup now spans the nation ; 3,000 of the 4,000 fellowships given so far have been awarded since the Ford grant .
