Rare indeed is the surgeon who would knowingly transplant a malignant cancer from one patient to another , and rarer still the patient who would willingly accept it . In Buffalo last week , two surgeons made two such transplants between patients who not only accepted but demanded the surgery . For both , it was the last slender hope for reprieve from a rapidly fatal disease . <P> Robert F. Allen , 29 , a varsity football guard at Illinois in 1956-58 and now a Tucson insurance salesman , felt last fall as though he had pulled a muscle in his left leg . X rays showed something far worse : osteogenic sarcoma , an uncommon cancer of the bone . In September , Mayo Clinic surgeons amputated the leg . But the fast-spreading cancer soon colonized Allen 's spine and lungs . He was given only a few months to live . <P> Allen had read about Dr. Sigmond H. Nadler , of Buffalo 's Roswell Park Memorial Institute , and his bold technique of crossover transplants . Dr. Nadler 's theory : although cancer cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells , so his body does not develop antibodies to destroy them . Since one person develops antibodies against another 's cells , why not , Nadler reasoned , transplant cancer tissue from Patient A to Patient B , let B develop the antibody , and then transfuse some of B 's white blood cells ( which carry antibodies ) back to A , where they might kill the cancer cells ? Since B would also be a cancer patient , he would get A 's white cells after a two-way transplant . <P> Dr. Nadler told Allen he would do the operation if Allen could find a fellow sufferer with the same disease and blood type . Relentless telephoning put Allen in touch with Harry T. Griffith , 63 , of Flourtown , Pa. , sometime professional ball player , whose left collarbone had been removed in December because of osteogenic sarcoma . In Buffalo the men met and were bloodmatched . <P> Surgeons opened Allen 's right chest wall and removed a in. cube of tumor tissue . Other surgeons implanted this just under the skin of Griffith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of similar size from Griffith 's collarbone region . The surgeons then implanted this in Allen 's thigh . Both men are expected to develop antibody against each other 's cancer cells within a week or two . Then small daily crossover transfusions of white blood cells will be made in hopes of checking their disease .
