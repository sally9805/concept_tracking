Dear Customer : <P> As a public service , we here at Uptight feel compelled to warn our clients about the subversive , scandalous and salacious advertising campaign currently being conducted by some of our competitors . I am referring specifically to ads in the local press that show two attractive young ladies coquettishly cavorting in what is variously described as a " linear jumpsuit " and a " turtle sock , " but might more accurately be called an " allover nothing . " <P> The garment in question is a stretch-nylon body stocking that covers everything but the head and hands of the wearer and sells for $9 to $14 . " Covers " is an exaggeration , as the ads make clear : " No interruptions to mar the lovely line of you , " and " Reveals what it covers . " The obvious suggestion is that the wearer need not , indeed should not burden her body with such conventional and " confining " undergarments as brassieres , girdles , panties and hosiery . <P> In a dangerous age , when hippies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our campuses and even our country , such a suggestion is inflammatory and unpatriotic . Burning draft cards and U.S. flags is bad enough ; now these subversives want to burn bras and briefs too . Is there no limit past which the enemies of law and order will not go ? As a proud American and president of a company that for four generations has dedicated itself to supporting the U.S. 's posture in the world , I say enough is enough . America needs to regroup and to rebuild on a firm foundation . <P> Yours for shaping up , I. M. Garment , President Uptight Underwear , Inc . <P> No such company , of course , is conducting any such campaign . If it were , the campaign would obviously fail . In the two weeks since Manhattan 's B. Altman &; Co. first advertised its version of the peekaboo " linear jumpsuit , " the store has been selling them so fast that it already has ordered 1,200 more . Other retailers report similarly spectacular sales . Customer comments range from the predictable ( " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 70s " ) to the profane ( the garments fit so tightly that getting into one is a chore ) . Women who feel that the sheer suit is too revealing can always camouflage strategic spots with tunics or miniskirts . Or they can wear opaque woolen body stockings that show no more than a tight-fitting glove and can be worn even outdoors with impunity-or with body jewelry .
