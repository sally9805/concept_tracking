Where , at the peak of winter , when most thoughts point toward snowy slopes or southern sands , does a man go when he wants to swing a shotgun at a covey rise ? Why , he goes to Texas , of course , where the quail are plentiful , where the open season is three and a half months long and where the bag is an abundant 12 birds a day . And where else but in Texas would he find not just ordinary bobwhite quail but the cocky , canny , chestnut-bellied scaled quail ( Callipepla squamata castanogastris ) as well ? The scaled quail thrives throughout the south Texas brush country , and it is by far the most ornery , the most frustrating and the most maddeningly challenging bird any quail hunter could ever hope to hit . Last month , with the scaled-quail season in full swing , there were plenty of birds that were not being hit all along the Rio Grande from Brownsville to Eagle Pass . // Missing shots now and then is not exactly a unique experience for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the rule rather than the exception . Even a knowing scaled-quail shooter is outwitted , outrun and outraged at every bush and bramble . He is tantalized by birds that are there one instant and gone the next . He is tortured by thorns , stickers , burrs and barbs , and he is driven to wild and foolish tactics which seldom work but invariably make him bristle in frustration and blush in memory . // Considering the violent emotions evoked by the scaled quail in even the calmest of hunters , it is probably a good thing that castanogastris is found only in the southern counties of Texas and nowhere else in the U.S. There are , however , two other species of scaled quail , all so named because of the scalelike pattern on their breast feathers . Callipepla squamata pallida , popularly known as the Arizona scaled quail , ranges from north-central Mexico through all of west Texas , most of Arizona and into the southeast corners of New Mexico and Colorado . The third species , Callipepla squamata squamata , is found only in Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but neither is quite as handsome or as exasperating to hunt . // All three species are the same size  --  they stand about 10 inches high . Males average about 6.6 ounces , females slightly less , but both give the impression of weighing about one-third more than they actually do because of the density and length of their feathers . The sexes are so similar in appearance that only a scaled quail can be sure of the difference at first glance . // The back and wing plumage of all scaled quail is predominantly blue-gray , but in the two more common varieties these bluish feathers dull into a drab , smoky buff on the breast and abdomen , giving the birds the incongruous look of somber little morticians wearing party hats . In contrast , the southern Texas bird sports a pearl-white bib and brilliant , burnished-copper breast and belly . It has the jaunty air of a dandy decked out in a dinner jacket . // Even the bird 's fashionable finery is misleading . For a bird turned out so elegantly , the chestnut-bellied scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the most rugged in Texas  --  barren , sparsely inhabited terrain , subjected to periodic droughts and temperatures that soar as high as 110 in summer and , on occasion , dip to bitter lows of around zero in winter . It is a land of mesquite and catclaw , blue thorn and huisache , cactus and prickly pear , where every bush seems covered with thorns and every limb thrusts sharp , savage spines to the sky . It is a vast , flat , beautiful land , where the honey-sweet smell of white brush hangs in the air and the horizon looks at least a week away . // Centuries of evolution have adapted the various creatures that inhabit this country to its idiosyncrasies , and this explains , at least in part , some of the habits of the scaled quail . For one thing , unlike most conventional quail , this one would rather run than fly and , except for the ostrich and the roadrunner , there is probably no bird that runs faster . // Its favorite gambit is to dart from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then giving the hunter a maddening , momentary glimpse . With its stiff-jointed legs moving in staccato rhythm and its garish topknot bobbing , it looks like a street-vendor 's goose-stepping wind-up toy . // About the only thing more damaging to the psyche than trying to run down one of these fast-fleeing singles is the effort to run down an entire covey . Scaled quail are very social creatures . When feeding and foraging in the mornings and afternoons , or just dozing , dusting and picking at parasites during other times of day , they gather in groups of 20 to 50 or more birds . The safety-in-numbers concept does not seem to make them any more eager to fly in a group than when they are alone , but it certainly makes for more confusion when an entire covey takes off on foot . The birds scatter in every direction , scooting back and forth across sandy channels in the brush , diving into islands of prickly pear , always appearing  --  fiendishly  --  just at the periphery of the hunters vision . // A normal hunter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush at least a few of the birds by running them down  --  a disastrous approach at best . Even a professional trackman would be hard pressed to keep up with the birds ' 15-mph ground speed . Throw in half a dozen birds going in half a dozen directions at the same time and a hip-high sea of brush , which the quail effortlessly slip beneath but which the hunter must go around , through and over , and the true hopelessness of the situation begins to be apparent . // This is the point at which some hunters simply give up , unload and go home to a stiff drink . Others go berserk , dashing into thorn bushes and cactus plants , chasing blindly after one bird and then another until finally they collapse in a tattered , bleeding heap . A few hunters will even shoot the birds on the ground , but this , aside from being a sorry breach of sportsmanship , is also an outright admission of defeat . No scaled-quail hunter worthy of the name gives up that easily . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // No hunters are more skilled at doing so than the brothers Burnham of Marble Falls . Over the years , Murray and Winston Burnham probably have outwitted more scaled quail than anyone else in Texas . They have learned how to stalk a covey with the stealth and cunning of a coyote , sneaking up so close before springing that the startled birds take wing in sheer surprise . The brothers know how to imitate the chop-chuck , chop-chuck call of a single bird when it is trying to join a scattered covey . They also know how to anticipate escape routes and cut the quail off and then run them into cul-de-sacs from which they are forced to fly . The brothers have countered the tricks of psychological warfare that are the scaled quail 's strongest defense with some of their own  --  freezing beside a bush in which a bird has taken cover and waiting , motionless , until the unnerved quail , deciding it has been discovered , makes a desperate flight for freedom . // The Burnhams lease hunting rights along with a small cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laredo . This is in the center of some of the finest scaled-quail country in the state . Although most of the land in this area and throughout the bird 's range is privately owned , hunting rights are generally sold each year either to individuals like the Burnhams or to commercial operators , who then sublease them on a daily , weekend or weekly basis . // When I hunted there recently , almost every gas station and shop on the road from Cotulla to the Mexican border had a sign in the window beckoning hunters , and the classified columns of the local papers were filled with ads touting day hunting at $10 to $15 a gun , complete with guide , transportation and sometimes even lunch thrown in . In fact , about the only thing not included in the bargain price was a pair of tweezers . These and a sense of humor , I discovered after being tricked into a patch of prickly pear by a bird that was not there , are definitely essential equipment on a Texas scaled-quail hunt .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
