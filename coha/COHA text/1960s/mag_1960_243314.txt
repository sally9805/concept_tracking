Nearly everyone wants to know how life on earth began , says Biochemist Sidney W. Fox of Florida State University , but most scientists who conjecture about it merely theorize . They do not test their ideas by actual experiments . Dr. Fox and a few others have been experimenting , and in Science Dr. Fox tells what luck they have had so far in charting the secret paths followed by nature in the creation of life . <P> Gases to Protein . Astronomers believe that the atmosphere of the early , lifeless earth had no free oxygen in it , but was made of gases like methane , hydrogen and ammonia . Scientists have also proved that when this gaseous mixture is put in a flask with a little water in the bottom , and an electric discharge is passed through it , the chemical reaction produces an accumulation of amino acids in the water . Since amino acids are the building blocks out of which proteins are made , and proteins are the chemical framework of all life on earth , the first chemical step toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushed by lightning flashes or perhaps cosmic rays . <P> Nature 's next step toward life must have been to make proteins out of accumulated amino acids . Reasoning that parts of the primitive earth 's surface may have been fairly hot , Dr. Fox mixed together the 18 amino acids common to the proteins of all living organisms and heated them gently . He got " proteinoids " that behave very much like proteins found in nature . They are digested by natural enzymes and eaten by bacteria . If polyphosphoric acid is added to the mix , the reaction takes place at only 160 F. , well below the boiling point of water . <P> Protein to Cells . The next step in the life-creating process , according to one theory , is the organizing of protein molecules into cells that grow by absorbing smaller molecules in the water around them and multiply by dividing . How did nature make cells , with their permeable walls and juicy insides , out of assorted protein molecules ? Dr. Fox does not think this is difficult ; he has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water some of the proteinoids that he made by heating amino acids . When he cooled the solution , billions of microspheres appeared , about the size of cocci ( round bacteria ) and looking very much like them . They shrink when salt is added , and this suggests that they are hollow and that their walls are slightly permeable like the cell walls of bacteria .
