Gold-and the U.S. 's steady loss of it-has been the prime preoccupation of the free world 's financial strategists since John F. Kennedy declared repeatedly in Europe last month that " unless we master our gold problems , they will master us . " Last week , under pressure from European financial leaders who fear that the continuing gold drain could start a worldwide deflationary cycle by further undermining the dollar , the U.S. took three actions . It set higher interest rates on short-term borrowing , put indirect controls on longer-term exports of U.S. money , and surprisingly indicated a readiness to borrow from the International Monetary Fund , which the U.S. originally helped to set up at Bretton Woods in 1944 to bail out poorer foreign countries . <P> Limit for Freedom . The three moves were quite a change from Washington 's earlier attempts to nibble at the problem by reducing tourists , duty-free imports and inducing allies to prepay their postwar debts . As the U.S. Treasury reported that U.S. gold stocks have dropped $100 million so far this month , to a 24-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Kennedy conceded that " our old program had become an obvious failure . " Washington hopes that its new program will cut the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit-which rose to an annual rate of $3.2 billion in the first quarter and is growing worse-by $2 billion in the next 18 months . It now predicts a payments surplus by 1967 or 1968 . But despite the new moves , two of the biggest drains on gold-U.S. foreign aid and military spending abroad-remain unaffected . <P> For the first time in 30 years , foreign rather than domestic considerations prompted the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates . Lifting its discount rate to member banks to 31% from 3% , where it had stood for three years , the Fed said that its move was designed to discourage foreign borrowers , who raised well over $1 billion in the abundant U.S. capital market last year . Though the U.S. earns interest on these foreign loans and stands to get them back in the future , the exported dollars flow into foreign central banks and are often swapped for U.S. gold . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That boast shrank somewhat when President Ken nedy last week ordered an indirect control called an " interest equalization tax . " If Congress approves , as expected , U.S. purchases of most new foreign stocks and bonds will be dampened by a tax on American buyers of up to 15% of face value . The purchaser of a 20-year , $1,000 foreign bond , for example , will be taxed 12.25% , which would raise his overall costs to $1,122.50 . The U.S. hopes that purchases of such securities - now running to $1.8 billion a year-will be slashed to the $500 million-$600 million rate of the late 1950s . This means that for foreign governments and companies , money in U.S. markets will be much harder to come by .
