Federal research money is flowing into U.S. universities and university-related laboratories at the rate of about $1 billion a year-roughly one-quarter of their total income . One beneficial result is the " new life " stirring in university laboratories , says Harvard 's President Nathan M. Pusey in the Harvard Alumni Bulletin . What worries Pusey ( and other educators ) is the danger of federal interference . Government agencies , warns Harvard 's chief , show " an increasing desire to say how things are to be done in laboratories , and who may or may not appear in them . " <P> A prickly instance is the " disclaimer affidavit " -a negative loyalty oath-that students must sign to get federal loans under the National Defense Education Act . Worse is the 15% ceiling on " indirect costs " incurred by universities conducting research under Government grants . In doing research for the National Institutes of Health , says Pusey , Harvard 's indirect costs are about 28.5% of direct costs . Last year it spent an extra $1,000,000 out of its own pocket . Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . <P> Is the answer more federal money ? Says Pusey : " We at Harvard do not want the Federal Government to take over financial responsibility for us . Far from it ! Rather we are working as hard as we can to maintain our financial independence as the basic requirement for maintaining any independence at all . " <P> Harvard by no means wants to quit working for the Government , but , says Pusey. " we move into the relationship , on guard and wary , filled with suspicion , ready to be helpful when we can , but at the same time eager to concede nothing to our more powerful partner . We fear that at some future time our new associate may begin to make demands upon us inconsistent with the true character of an independent university . When that time comes-perhaps we should anticipate , when those repeated times come-we wish to be able , and we firmly intend , to say no. "
