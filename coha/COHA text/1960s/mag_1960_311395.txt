I would not like to drive a racing car unless there was an element of danger involved , any more than I would like to fight a bull without horns . And when I take a corner perfectly , it 's like a painter who has been sweating at a portrait and ca n't quite capture a smile and then makes it with one stroke of the brush . <P> Danger is Stirling Moss 's obsession . In his long companionship with peril he has driven a racing car with one leg in a plaster cast . He has sped around curves while nearly blinded by glass fragments in his eyes . His crash helmet has been dented by a rival 's car hurtling just over his head . And it is mostly because of his fascination with danger that Britain 's Moss , 30 , is by common consent the world 's fastest driver . <P> Moss 's record is his own monument . He has won most of the world 's great motor races , many of them several times . He has been Britain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledges : " When I pass Moss , I wonder what is wrong with his car . " Says his fellow British driver , Tony Brooks : " Driving over 200 miles on each of the world 's circuits , Stirling would turn out quite a bit better than anyone else . " Says Australia 's skilled Jack Brabham : " He 's the toughest competitor anybody can have . All he lives for is driving . Just about all he thinks of is driving . " <P> Last week Stirling Moss and California 's Dan Gurney drove a Maserati to victory in a grueling , 620-mile sports car race in Nurburgring , Germany . This week , as Europe 's Grand Prix season opens at Monaco , Stirling Moss is as always the driver to beat . But despite his great success , Moss is a restless , unhappy man-for in his twelve years of professional driving , he has never yet won motor racing 's highest honor , the Grand Prix driving championship . <P> Sliding &; Slipstreaming . Moss 's own perfectionism is his greatest handicap , argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to exact more from a car , because he makes it go faster , than possibly anyone we have known in the past . " His demands have resulted in a long history of mechanical breakdowns and kept the Grand Prix championship beyond his reach . But Stirling Moss insists he can drive no other way . <P> The son of a London dentist , Moss has been driving autos since he was ten . Muscular but small-he weighs 154 lbs . and stands 5 ft. 8 in. " with my thick socks on " - he is ideally built to withstand the hours of high-speed driving in a racer 's tiny cockpit . His experience has taught him every trick of handling the 250-h.p . Grand Prix cars . He can swing a car into a slide to kill speed , use a bank bordering on a turn , as a buffer to keep his rear wheels on the road . He won last year 's Italian Grand Prix by " slipstreaming " - tailing a Ferrari so closely that the rival car acted as a windbreak , letting Moss conserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at his best in the tire-tearing duels on the corners , where drivers must rapidly downshift from speeds of 160 m.p.h. to 60 m.p.h. and below , then shift up again . Says Moss : " The thing to remember is that it is the speed with which you come out of the corner that matters . If you come out of a corner five miles an hour faster than any other man , you 've got a big advantage going into the straight . "
