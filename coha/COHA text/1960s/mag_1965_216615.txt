In Bogalusa , La. , a paper-mill town of 23,000 near the Mississippi border , gun-toting white and Negro toughs seemed ready to throw themselves into pitched battle against each other . That they had not actually begun open warfare was almost entirely because of the efforts of Louisiana 's Democratic Governor John McKeithen-and , as so often happens to the peacemaker , McKeithen himself was under fire from both sides . <P> In an act that required considerable courage for a Southern Governor , McKeithen flew to Bogalusa to plead with Negro leaders for a 30-day cooling-off period . When he got there , an angry white man demanded : " Why do n't you take the state police out of here ? " Replied McKeithen : " We would-but about 500 or 600 people would be killed if we did . " <P> <P> The Deacons . He may not have exaggerated . For six months , Bogalusa has been the scene of a civil rights drive by the Congress of Racial Equality and its local affiliate , the Bogalusa Civic and Voters League . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the town 's Negro neighborhoods . They have also won a few promises , including a pledge to take on two Negro policemen - if they can pass an examination . But for the most part , the demands of civil rights advocates have been thwarted by the Ku Klux Klan . Although Klan rolls are secret , it has been estimated that in Bogalusa and the surrounding countryside there are probably more Klansmen per capita than anywhere else in the South . <P> Against the Klan , some Negroes have formed the " Deacons for Defense and Justice " ; its members , many of them troublemakers long before Bogalusa 's civil rights crisis occurred , openly sport pistols and rifles . For months , Deacons have exchanged shots and punches with white roughnecks . In June night riders murdered one Negro deputy sheriff and seriously wounded another . Two weeks ago , a Deacon shot and critically wounded a white heckler during a civil rights demonstration . <P> White extremists demanded revenge ; the Deacons replied that they were ready for anything . McKeithen sent in troopers with rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of additional combatants . The troopers also gave effective protection to both white and Negro demonstrations , except in one case when security broke down and three civil rights workers were beaten . McKeithen ordered his troopers to confiscate every weapon they saw . He readily admitted that he was bending Louisiana law , which permits the carrying of firearms as long as they are unconcealed . Said the Governor : " When the Supreme Court orders us to give them back , we 'll give them back . " <P> " I 'm Gon na Move In . " Limited disarmament was only a stopgap . McKeithen wanted civil rights demonstrations-which had been specifically sanctioned by federal court order-ended for 30 days so that a durable settlement could be sought . From the state capital at Baton Rouge , he sent his personal plane to Bogalusa to fetch A. Z. Young and Robert Hicks , Voters League president and vice president . " If we do n't find the answers in 30 days , you can start demonstrating again , " McKeithen told them . He vowed to rid Bogalusa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have them out of town within six hours after you agree to a cooling-off period . "
