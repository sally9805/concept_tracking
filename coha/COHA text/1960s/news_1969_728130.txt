txt Faced with the prospect of mas ; sive antiwar demonstrations next week , President Nixon received today an endorsement of his basic approach to peace from former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey . Mr. Humphrey met at breakfast with the President 's nary tional security adviser , Hen A. Kissinger , and conferred later with Mr. Nixon . Mr. Humphrey emerged to tell newsmen that the man who beat him in November by a narrow margin was " proceeding along the right path " in Vietnam . Mr. Humphrey also concurred in Mr. Nixon 's expressed view that public support is essential to the search for peace in Southeast Asia . " We only have one President at a time , " ! Mr .. Humphrey said , " and I think the worst thing we can do is try to undermine the ' efforts of the President . " Honest Differences ' The former Vice President conceded that there were and would continue to be " honest differences " over Vietnam and that " the American people are not going to be hushed " by n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody can hush those differences , " he went on , " but I believe that we have to give the President time to carry out his proposals , to carry out his plan and his policies . " The element of time is crucial to what is understood here to be Mr. Nixon 's strategy of persuading the enemy that , despite periodic withdrawals , the United States is prepared to maintain a sufficient presence in Vietnam until such time as the enemy is prepared to negotiate or the South Vietnamese are prepared to support the conflict on their own . Earlier , Congressional sources told newsmen that Mr. Humphrey had written to Mr. Nixon agreeing to support him if Mr. Nixon would consent to a systematic schedule of troop withdrawals . While Mr. Humphrey apparehtly dropped the idea ? of writing a letter , he stressed the word " systematic " in his remarks to newsmen this morning and strongly implied that he thought troop withdrawals should be carried out on a regular , planned basis . There was also a hint in his remarks that in private conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specific conditions than he was willing to announce publicly . " The President knows my views , and I am not going to try to spread them out on the public record , " he said . " I think there are some things between the President and someone who wanted to be President that we ought to kind of keep between ourselves . I am ging to respect that confidence . " He would not reveal his views in any greater detail , and the , net impact of his remarks was to endorse at least the broad outlines of the President 's strategy . Backs Nixon 's Actions " I think what he has done has been good , " Mr. Humphrey said . " He hopes he can do more . I hope he can , too . I believe that no man in this country is more desirous of bringing about an acceptable and workable settlement in Vietnam than the President of the United States . " Mr. Nixon , he stressed , did not expect any of his critics to be " yes men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about Mr. Nixon 's policies he would " oppose " them , but that at the present time he believed that " the country ought to recognize we are making some progress . " " Casualty lists are down , " he noted . " Troops have been withdrawn . I hope that more will be withdrawn . " It was difficult to predict whether Mr. Humphrey 's comments would help the President obtain the public patience and the time he feels he needs to carry through his efforts to persuade the enemy to negotiate . White House Delighted But the White House was clearly delighted and went to some lengths to publicize the visit and provide newsmen who had missed the briefing with transcripts of Mr. Humphrey 's remarks . Transcripts are not customarily provided when a visitor appears informally before the press in the lobby of the West Wing , as Mr. Humphrey did today . There was no clear way to determine whether Mr. Humphrey 's statements would serve to dampen the ardor of the thousands of students and faculty members who will mobilize Oct. 15 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own views on the moratorium , Mr. Humphrey disclosed that he would be teaching at the University of Minnesota Oct. 15 , that he would hold his class as scheduled and that his students had voted to attend the class . Mr. Humphrey stressed that the entire session would be devoted to a discussion on peace and the means of achieving it , in Vietnam and in the Middle East and through arms control . Campaign Recalled Mr. Humphrey 's endorsement was doubly welcome at the White House in view of the fact that Mr. Nixon once treated the former Vice ' President rather roughly for his support of the war . During the campaign , Mr. Nixon repeatedly accused his opponent of being " locked into the policies of the past , " by which he meant President Johnson 's approach to the war . Mr. Nixon has made several major tactical adjustments in the Johnson approach since assuming office Jan. 20 and has withdrawn troops for the first time . But many observers here , particularly critics of the war , believe Mr. Nixon 's ultimate objective ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Vietnamese  --  is the same as Mr. Johnson 's . Therefore , they believe Mr. Nixon 's requirements ? chiefly the public support necessary to sustain lengthy negotiations ? are also much the same . Accordingly , the White House made no secret of the fact that Mr. Humphrey had readily agreed to do what he could to assure public support , despite the past differences between the two men . Bunker Confers Mr. Humphrey 's visit coincided with a rush of other developments on Vietnam . The President conferred yesterday with Ellsworth Bunker , Ambassador to Saigon . He will confer tomorrow morning with Gen. Earle G. Wheeler , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and early next week with his negotiating team , Henry Cabot Lodge and Philip Habib , whom he has summoned back from the peace talks in Paris for consultations and " instructions . " White House aides have been attempting to iremove some of ? the sting from Mr. Nixon 's statement at a news conference Oct. 3 that under no circumstances would he be affected by the student protests . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division in the country over the war , that he has no objection to legitimate protest and that he meant to say only that he believed his course to be cot- ? rect and would stick to it until proved wrong .
