The Madame 's Power <P> Sir : I have argued with you , disagreed with you , and threatened to cancel my subscription ( which I might yet do ) , but I have always read you . <P> As of now I am extremely proud of you . <P> You seem to have been the first in the entire country to have recognized the awful power of Mme. Nhu . <P> RICHARD J. WETHERN <P> Palo Alto , Calif . <P> Sir : Mme. Nhu in your cover story of Aug. 9 is mistakenly termed a " queen bee . " A far more appropriate term would be a black widow . <P> In my opinion she makes the Diem government seemingly and literally weak and indecisive . An impulsive , violent and radical person should not have the authority to shape the destiny of a country over which she has no legal powers . <P> Mme. Nhu was the ramrod in the ban on jazz and dancing in Saigon some time ago . A person this prudent on the one hand while on the other clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems highly unstable . If the U.S. is going to pump millions of dollars and hundreds of men into South ' Viet Nam it would be better not to have such a paradox in a governing position . <P> GRANT KEENE <P> Alto , Ga . <P> Sir : I was very surprised to be casually mentioned as " Mme. Nhu 's father , who violently disapproves of her- : and only partly because the government expropriated his vast property seven years ago . " <P> Indeed an inaccurate allegation has been made which may impugn my motives . The truth is that the Ngo Dinh Diem government did not expropriate any property of mine by application of its land reform of 1956 . By that time most of the land I had in excess of the allowed 247 acres had been abandoned by me and even by the peasants because of insecurity in that area of the province of Rach-Gia during the long Indo-Chinese war of 1946-54 . This can be checked at the Department of Land Reform in Saigon and will give an idea of the fables that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land is still abandoned . <P> The Ho Chi Minh government did requisition my house and my law office in Hanoi in September 1945 , immediately after the Viet Minh revolution in North Viet Nam , but that was only an effect , not the cause of my disapproval of Communism . <P> TRAN VAN CHUONG Former Ambassador <P> Embassy of Viet Nam Washington . D.C. <P> <P> - The length of time Hong Kong Bureau Chief Charles Mohr talked to Chuong 's daughter . <P> <P> Russian Rules <P> Sir : I do n't see how Nikita could have beaten Dean at badminton Aug. 16 with the horrible form displayed in the picture - unless , of course , playing without a net allowed him to improvise rules as the game progressed . <P> WADLEIGH W. WOODS <P> Portsmouth , N.H. <P> <P> The Bard 's Petard <P> Sir : It seems to me that instead of using a " curious choice of words , " Senator Morton Aug. 16 was making an apt allusion to a well-known Shakespearean quotation from Hamlet : <P> For ' t is sport to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' t shall go hard , <P> But I will delve one yard below their mines <P> And blow them at the moon ! <P> I think the Senator sees us and the world at large dependent upon our own explosive , hard-to-control invention . <P> WILLIS G. WALDO <P> West Palm Beach , Fla.
