The Constitution provides that in case of removal of the President from office , by death or otherwise , the office shall devolve on the Vice President . That is the end of the self-executing provision . For the rest , the Constitution says that the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal of both the President and Vice President , " declaring what Officer shall then act as President . " When the Presidency devolved on Vice President Truman , the Statute then on the books ran the line of succession through the Cabinet , in the usual order of seniority , which is the order in which the offices were first established , namely , State , Treasury , War ( De ? fense ) , and so on . In 1947 , at Mr. Truman 's instance , the new Statute changed the succession , so that now the Speaker of the House is first in line , followed by the President pro-tern of the Senate . These officers are , respectively , John McCormack and Carl Hayden . Ac ? cordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Cormack current on certain security affairs . It is not known whether the President has also made with Mr. McCormack the sort of arrangements that were made both with him and with Vice Presi ? dent Nixon for assuming Presidential duties temporarily in the event of Presidential disability . These latter arrangements are not governed by Statutes , but are subject to Presidential discretion . Speaker McCormack is 71 . Senator Hayden is 86 . It signifies no disrespect to either man to say that not in the wildest dreams of anyone - including themselves - would they he deemed Presidential timbre . Their age alone precludes . Clearly , therefore , until a new Vice President qualifies in January , 1965 , the country finds itself in a precarious position . The problem is delicate , and there is no sure-fire solution to it - the Constitutional provision has itself proved im ? perfect , as some tenants of the Vice Presidential office have demon ? strated . We have been lucky , but in this most solemn matter , it is not prudent to push one 's luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1947 was no better than what we have now . Actually , on paper , the present system is an improvement . Cabinet officers often are and often ought to be technicians , specialists , rather than national political personalities . They hold office by appointment and relatively automatic confirma ? tion in the Senate . They are not as Cabinet members subjected to the electoral process , and many of them ( Secretaries Rusk , Dillon and McNamara , for example ) have never faced an election or been familiar with the inside of a political clubhouse . They may come from foundations , universities , banks , and places like the Ford Motor Company , and be as innocent of political experience and a wide range of domestic and foreign problems as it is possible for a high officer to be . The President carries all of that for them . It would be too fundamental a contradiction of democratic theory and practice to elevate such a man to the Presi ? dency , and it would be a contradiction that would seri ? ously weaken such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-tem of the Senate , by contrast , are elected in their own con ? stituencies , of course , and what is more important , they are the choices of their colleagues , expressed in formal votes , for the headship of each of the two Houses . Indirectly , but realistically enough , they represent in their own persons national constituencies . Unfortunate ? ly , however , that is a paper reality only . Memory can not recall a time when the President pro-tern of the Senate was elected on any basis other than that he was simply the Senior Senator in point of service on the Majority side . The Speakership is not always the automatic reward of longevity ; but all too often it is , or comes near to being , and in the case of Speaker McCormack , it rather was . The upshot then is that Congress disables itself by its sluggish , self-regarding , in a word , irresponsible reliance on seniority from performing a high function of state , that of filling from its rank a place in the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession wo n't do on principle . And Congress , ideally suited on prin ? ciple , will not do in practice . Perhaps there is some slight ground for hoping that this grave demonstration of the inexcusable deficiencies in Congress ' way of or ? ganizing itself will serve to spur Congressional reform , which is overdue for a thousand additional reasons as well . But we are talking about the moving of mountains . In the meantime , the nation faces a clear and present danger , and we dare not fail to consider alternatives . One possibility would be a Statute requiring Con ? congress , within a specified time following the succession of a Vice President as Chief Executive or the death in office of a Vice President , to elect a new Vice President . Members of the Congress should not be disqualified as candidates , even though the risk here is that the legis ? lature might simply paint itself back into the same seniority corner . One must assume that in the sober circumstances of such an election . Congress would be less clubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without much thought to the Presidential succession . In any event , the man elected should resign whatever public office he might be holding , and be ineligible for any other , since , ob ? viously , difficulties of precedence and the like would be faced if he remained , say , in the Senate or the Cabinet . Rather , he should assume the duties of Vice President . The election ought to be by Congress as a whole , and it ought not to be by the antiquated and haphazard method of voting by states , each state casting an equal single vote . Perhaps the election might be by the concurrent vote of both chambers , each vot ? ing separately , as they do when they enact legislation . And perhaps the sitting President might be given a veto , which Presidential nominees after all have in the selection of a Vice Presidential candidate . Other suggestions are conceivable , and this solution is itself not addressed to the risk of a catastrophe that disables both President and Vice President . It is essen ? tial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in a successor to the Presidency from whom the line runs , albeit indirectly , to a national constituency ; otherwise he would lack adequate , self-reliant and self-starting strength to act in that most awesome of all offices . And it is essential that the selection be delib ? erate and have regard for the quality of the man , rather than being the kind of relatively automatic method by which Congress selects its own officers . It is finally to be noted that the office of President is made to " devolve " on the Constitutional Vice Presi ? dent . As to a successor to a former Vice President , Congress is empowered only to declare that he shall " act as President .. until the disability of the Presi ? dent be removed , or a President shall be elected . " It would seem open to Congress , therefore , to provide for a special Presidential election at some time after the succession , although it is not open to the Congress to so provide in the case of the succession of a Constitu ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to office , and relied heavily on Franklin Roosevelt 's ad ? visers ; yet continuity eluded him . History began to flow in new channels . Prosperity came more easily ; the specter of depression faded . Wartime enemies became important allies ; friendship with the USSR came to seem impossible . Today , change is again in the air . Problems of the domestic welfare not identical with those of the 3 o 's ? again move to the forefront . An explanation has to be Found for the recent paradox of persistent high unemployment and a low growth rate , alongside an ever-rising stock market , The press of population on overstrained public services , the squalor of cities , the rapid shift in demand from the unskilled and the farm laborer to the trained factory or service industry employee , the ravaging of the American land ? scape by commerce , the triviality of much mass edu ? cation and mass culture ? all these require study and new remedial efforts . Likewise , a detente of some sort between the US and USSR again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have so shaped US postwar diplomacy are in transition . These are long-term problems with which Presi ? dent Johnson may not have to grapple immediately . But even in the short run the promise of continuity may prove illusory . The President may make use of many of the same advisers as President Kennedy did : it was Theodore Sorensen who was enlisted to help draft Mr. Johnson 's first message to the Congress ; McGeorge Bundy who , from the first hours of the John ? son Administration has been the President 's key aide on security matters ; and it is reported that Secretary Rusk moves these days with a new air of self-assurance . But on the other hand , one of the late President 's lieuten ? ants , Ralph Dungan , is no longer in his White House office . Change is inevitable . No two Presidents have the same taste in people ; nor are their problems the same . What are the critical choices that may have to be made in the next year ? Domestically , the most highly charged controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long haul these , like so much else , are linked to the achievement of full employment . The late President and his brother recognized that the nation had to move toward multiracialism , and they accepted the necessity of federal intervention in the South to assist the process . But their attention was concentrated on the conspicuous problem : assuring equality for the Negro before the law and in his dealings with the state . This has already been largely secured in the North , and yet many Negroes see little difference be ? tween North and South . A genuine reconciliation of the races requires basic changes in private attitudes and actions . This was , of course , the area in which Vice President Johnson made a contribution through his chairmanship of the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities ; and it may be here , in the winning of consent , in one community after another , that the na ? tional leadership will find its greatest future challenge . The new President does not have at hand a program for full employment . This may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cut will , if enacted , prob ? ably suffice to stave off recession for a time . Yet even the most enthusiastic sponsors of the tax cut doubt that it will increase the growth rate enough to soak up all the young people entering the job market in this decade and the next . What the new President inherits is not an employment policy but a debate . Some of his economic experts ( many in the Labor Department ) will tell him that the nation is afflicted with " structural unemployment " : too many workers with the wrong skills or no skills at all , and too many workers in the wrong places . The cure , according to this school , is more vocational and technical training , more general education , more adult literacy programs , more money for redevelopment , subsidies to help workers move from depressed areas , a revamped US Employment Service , and so forth . Other economists ( in the Council of Economic Advisers and some in the Treasury ) will tell him that " structural unemployment " is largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " insufficient de ? mand . " If only consumers had more money to spend , more people would be able to make a living providing them with goods and services . If there were enough jobs , the argument runs , most of the unemployed would in time relocate and retrain themselves . Like his predecessor , President Johnson will prob ? ably deal with this debate by agreeing with each group and urging Congress to adopt programs both for upgrading the labor force and increasing demand . Looking beyond the borders of the US , one can not chart precisely what Mr. Kennedy 's foreign policy actually was , or what Mr. Johnson means when he pledges continuity . The great unknown is what accom ? modation with the Russians is possible . In a broad sense Mr. Johnson shares Mr. Kennedy 's hopes for peace and coexistence , and the new President very promptly made this clear in his message to Mr. Khrushchev . But on what terms will Mr. Johnson coexist with the Commu ? nists in Germany ? In Cuba ? In Vietnam ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us little . In Vietnam the United States was initially com ? mitted to defeating the Viet Cong even if this meant American casualties and long-term subsidy of an un ? popular and repressive regime . That commitment has changed somewhat in recent months . The war does not appear to be going better than in the past , but troops are now slowly being withdrawn ? a policy already re ? affirmed by President Johnson . The way is being paved for disengagement . Disengagement has , however , been premised on the assumption that the new government in Saigon will eventually be able to survive without mas ? sive US support and a US military presence . If that pre ? mise proves wrong , what then ? Nobody knows whether President Kennedy would in the end have been willing to let the Saigon government fall to the Viet Cong , or whether he would have begun to probe the possibility of a broad neutral belt in Southeast Asia , of which South Vietnam would be a part ? a proposal often ad ? vanced by Cambodia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind too . Similar uncertainties surround President Johnson 's policies vis ri vis Cuba . Present policy is based on the hope that if the hemisphere unites against Castro and harasses him economically , he will eventually be deposed . That expectation has not been given up , but it seems increasingly wishful . And if hope for a " spon ? taneous " change inside Cuba fades , Mr. Johnson may have to choose between overthrowing Castro ( surely covertly ) or de facto coexistence and the abatement of rancor on both sides . The decisive arena of Soviet-American confrontation , however , is still Germany . On the question of Berlin , there is little room for give . President Johnson , like President Kennedy would fight to preserve access to Berlin , in all probability using the full range of terrible weapons at his command . But that is not likely to be demanded of him . Rather , the question is how to pre ? serve a trusting relationship with West Germany while encouraging East-West contacts and a thaw within East Germany . The new President inherits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving Bonn almost a veto over US policy in Germany , yet on the other hand disagreed privately with Bonn about the best military strategy for NATO and the best diplo ? matic strategy for eventual German reunification . Even within the Kennedy Administration there was disagreement , for example , on whether to give first priority to a Soviet-American detente ; or whether , as Adenauer so long urged , to make reunification a pre ? condition of any relaxation of tensions . Similarly , there is a continuing debate between those who believe , with the Germans , that it is dangerous to consider the pos ? sibility of defending Western Europe without using nuclear weapons , and those who believe , with Secretary McNamara , that it might be possible and that it is essential to have " options . " Mr. Johnson at some point will have to throw his weight behind one approach or the other . Or perhaps , like his predecessor , he will per ? sist in supporting a multilateral nuclear force in Europe , which no European government really wants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Communications Commission is under statutory mandate to see that the " public interest , con ? venience and necessity " are served by broadcasters . It is the FCC 's duty to protect the public 's right to receive , over radio and TV , a reasonable amount of reliable information , as well as entertainment that is , from time to time , above the level of most situation comedies . It is obliged also to keep the air free of obscenity and of an endless chain of commercials that leaves little time for programs . Senator Peter Dominick ( R , Colo. ) a conservative freshman , believes , however , that the modest and ten ? tative proposals of the FCC to limit the proportion of broadcasting time that a licensee may sell for paid ads is a violation of " the freedom of speech we hold so dear in this country . " The Senator is mistaken in that he confuses broad ? casting with the printed press , the only kind of commu ? nication ( other than word of mouth ) that was known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media are private enterprise ; they supply all their own facilities and take their own risks . Radio and TV stations are licensed custodians of limited channels of communication . In the interest of preventing the over ? lapping of signals , the federal government took over the electro-magnetic spectrum available for broadcast ? ing nearly 4o years ago . Every person and corporation that now uses that spectrum uses public facilities by specific license . They are charged no rent for these fre ? quencies ; the holders of licenses to broadcast sight and sound are freeloaders . Yet by now , these frequencies are worth many billions of dollars to their lucky hold ? ers . TV stations regularly sell for very large amounts of money ; their physical assets are worth relatively little compared to the value of the indispensable fed ? eral license originally given For nothing , and which can not be rescinded save for the grossest misconduct of the licensee . Actually , the restrictions on commercial time that have been tentatively suggested by the FCC are no more stringent than those adopted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its member stations . If Senator Dominick is concerned about freedom in broadcasting , he might turn his attention to the harass ? ment of three small non-commercial FM radio stations run by the Pacifica Foundation ? WBAI , New York ; KBFA , Berkeley , San Francisco ; and KBFK , Los An ? geles . The New York station has been waiting three ? and-a-half years for a decision on renewal of its license . All three are still under FCC investigation ; all of them are under fire because of complaints their programs are " slanted to the Left " or because of alleged Communist association of members of the Foundation board . None of this has been proved . All that is proved is that they present sharply dissenting opinions on the air ? every ? iling from John Birchers to Communists ; they even permitted a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to criticize J. Edgar Hoover . Anybody who wants to regulate the sale of firearms in this country has to deal first with the National Rifle Association , an organization of 600,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can produce overnight loo , 000 letters in opposition to any proposed gun regulations . The NRA believes that Americans should be left , indeed encouraged , to arm themselves , both for personal protection and for such pursuits as hunting and target practice . It also feels that a basic deterrent to Communism ? or other forms of subversion ? is an armed populace . Nevertheless , Senator Dodd ( D , Conn. ) has gotten the association to go along with a bill which would make it difficult for children and criminals to buy pistols from mail-order firms . No such legislation is on the books at present . ( The NRA may even back an amendment to include rifles . ) Mired in the Senate Commerce Commit tee until November 22 , the bill has suddenly come to life . One of its objectives is to cut down crimes of violence . It also would result in protecting domestic manufacturers from a dilution of their market by the mail-order com ? panies whose products usually are inexpensive imports , cast off by European countries who have undergoneweapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of marksmanship and national de ? fense , the NRA and the government are partners them ? selves in a large mail-order business . The federal gov ? ernment makes available to Association members sur ? plus supplies of .45 caliber pistols and M i carbines at low cost . A " .45 " sells for $17.50 ; a carbine fetches $20 . The government at the moment is selling 150,000 car ? bines . All one need do to take advantage of this op ? portunity is to become a member of the NRA which requires that you be recommended by another member or some well-known and reputable citizen , payment of $5 , a statement that you are over i8 and have not been convicted of a major crime . This information is accepted at face value . Just how the NRA expects its members to handle their weapons is indicated in one statement to its mem ? bership arguing against gun regulation : One is forever being told , ? You do n't need to protect yourself , that 's the job for the police . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we becoming a nation of defeatists ; devoid of personal pride and content to rely entirely on our police for protection ? Are we ready to deny to ourselves and to our children their American heritage ? the right of personal protection and the pleasure of shooting and hunting for recreation ? " The truth , of course , is that it is not so . " Certainly guns are used for criminal purposes ? some sort of weapon always has been ? but anyone knows that boys have played with toy guns , swords , spears or what-have-you ever since the world began/ In spite of over-emphasis on ' juvenile delinquency ' we have today more and better youngsters than ever be ? fore . Certainly , circumstances alter cases and there are times when a prudent man does not attempt to ' out ? draw ' a determined criminal . But many competent police officers agree that fewer crimes of violence would take place if more honest citizens had guns and knew how to use them . " The House has compounded the boll-weevil-like evils of the cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to be added to the subsidies already provided for foreign mills and , of course , for US cotton farmers . All have been voted in the name of helping the small Southeastern cotton farmer , who despite the subsidies remains about as poor as he has always been . The disappointing and costly experience with cotton shows the impracticality of trying to use farm price supports as a welfare stipend . Cotton price supports are at the unreasonably high level of 321/2 cents a pound because Southern Members of Congress have insisted that supports be set at a level that would take care of the small farmers who are their constituents . These farmers raise an average of 35o pounds of cotton to the acre . In the West and Southwest , efficient pro ? ducers using modern machines can grow more than three times that amount on an irrigated acre made more fertile by the injection of ammonia gas . They can prof ? itably sell their cotton at a price one-third below the 32 ' /2-cent figure . The high support level all but froze American cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , half the domestic cotton is exported . That is because in 1955 Congress approved a new subsidy which would make it possible for American cotton to be sold abroad at the world market price , which is now 24 cents a pound . This subsidy is paid to cotton brokers , but the benefits go to foreign mills . What this new House bill means is that the domestic textile industry , which sup ? ported the foreign subsidy program , is within reach of getting the same kind of subsidy for its own mills , at a cost of at least $283 million a year , which when piled on the existing subsidies brings the annual federal cost of the cotton program to $750 million . The Senate , however , may not go along . There is growing sentiment for legislation being pushed by Senziftor Talmadge ( D , Ga. ) to pay farmers the differ ? ence between what cotton brings in a free market and what Congress considers a fair price . This is essentially the plan , with which Secretary Freeman is sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was Secretary of Agriculture under Harry Truman . The direct-payment approach is sensible ? at least for that transition period during which efforts are made to help the less efficient farmer get out of cotton and into something else . It would keep low the prices mills would have to pay for cotton while assuring farmers a fair return . It would get the government out of the **28;1925;TOOLONG business , as well as out of a triple-subsidy program . As a Congressman , Mr. Johnson learned very early to treat with care the antique furniture of the House , of which Judge Howard Worth Smith , chairman of the Rules Committee , is an especially charming piece ? a stopped grandfather clock , the more valuable , by Congressional aesthetic standards , for being so useless . But , as President , Mr. Johnson seems to have begun shaking and bumping Judge Smith with an urge to torture those ancient works into operation that appears entirely disdainful of the Judge 's frame and polish . The Judiciary Committee 's Civil Rights Bill needs the approval of the Rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for debate and passage . Judge Smith is a gentle Virginian who would certainly have manumitted his slaves if there had never been an Emancipation Proclamation but is not otherwise disposed to see matters proceed further . The Rules Committee is the only body in the House which has no regular meeting date and is traditionally subject to call only at the pleasure of its chairman . Judge Smith began the second full week of the Johnson Administra ? tion by announcing that he could not say with assur ? ance when he could call the committee on the Civil Rights Bill ; he later allowed there might be hearings " reasonably soon in January " ? and lasting no longer than indefinitely . In the end , the Republicans on Rules would give the bill the votes it needs for clearance . But in the mean ? while Rep. Clarence Brown of Ohio , their doyen who cherishes Judge Smith for his person and his past serv ? ices , could be trusted to respect the chairman 's policy of deliberation . Judge Smith was in no hurry and aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the bill would not come to the Senate until April . Then Senator Russell could mount his resistance with the confidence that , depleted and weary though the South may be , there would only be a short time to hold out before the conventions dictated adjournment . Then Congressman Bolling of Missouri , a Rules Committee Democrat , announced that he and Chair ? man Celler of Judiciary would lay before the House a petition to discharge the bill from Judge Smith 's cus ? tody . A discharge petition needs the signature of 218 Congressmen ; under ideal conditions , it could be signed and the bill brought up for debate by December 23 . But a discharge petition never seems ideal to Congress ? men who are , in the majority , members of the Society for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities and under ? stand that a discharge petition which rescues a bill they want from Judge Smith 's clutches could produce a precedent which some day might let loose from the Rules Committee a bill which they very much do n't want but have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petition , Speaker McCormack extended one of those left-handed blessings which indicated ap ? proval without his personal signature . Bolling , on his own , could hope for 15o Democratic signatures ; the Republicans , if their leadership hung neutral . might produce 6o . Then Congressman Mc ? Culloch , the Republican who is the Civil Rights Bill 's true author , declared that , as a former speaker of the Ohio House , he would be violating his parliamentary principles if he signed anything so irregular as a dis ? charge petition . Charles Halleck , Minority Leader of the House , echoed those sentiments ; the Republican Party prospect thereupon dwindled to no more than 3o signatures . But then Speaker McCormack returned from a con ? ference at the White House to announce that he would sign the discharge petition . Mr. Johnson seemed plainly to have put his weight behind Bolling ; there were re ? ports that the White House 's Larry O'Brien had been instructed to display what muscle the Executive Branch can employ . Bolling could hardly have begun expecting to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules by petition . His tactic had been to gather enough signatures to unsettle Judge Smith and force him to compromise earlier than he had been resigned to . But now , if President Johnson really meant his apparent commitment to force , Bolling could be almost sure of 16o Democrats and there would begin Republican de ? fections which could bring the petition dangerously close to 218 signatures . Bolling 's gun had seemed symbolic when it was lifted early in the week ; by the middle there was a real chance that it might go off . Still it seems unlikely that Johnson , for all the dispatch with which he had acted , could be quite this insensitive to the teachings of his youth in a Congress to which Judge Smith 's prerogatives had so long been consequential . The Judge would still then have to be considered . But he was being painfully jostled on the way to the train . It was reported that Clarence Brown had suggested to Bolling that , between them , they offer the Judge a schedule of hearings to wind up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clout in this case would be the threat that Brown , Bolling and six other Rules Committee members might join in serving upon the chairman a demand that he call a meeting of Rules to consider the Civil Rights Bill . This device , procedurally proper though it is , would be an affront to Judge Smith 's traditional authority almost as unthinkable as discharge by petition and almost as dangerous a prece ? dent for putting the Rules Committee under the con ? trol of its members rather than its chairman . Under such peril , Judge Smith would certainly be glad to accept even a January 3oth deadline ; his trouble was that , by intervening as he had , Mr. Johnson had created a situation where January 3oth , which Bolling 's group might have been glad to accept a few days ago , now had become an unnecessarily distant target date . The old Judge would then be deserted , and out ? numbered ; he could preserve the show of his power and the face of his dignity only by accepting a compromise early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill to a petition of the House or loss of control of his committee to its members . Both of these defeats would be single and temporary ; still the memory of either would be terribly damaging to Judge Smith 's ancientspell . But the conditions would seem still to dictate some small deference to his feelings ; the Civil Rights Bill is more likely to come to the House by consent of Judge Smith as chairman of the Rules Committee than to be discharged by petition and thus it probably will not be passed before February . But the real burden of resistance has now been laid upon the Senate Southerners , and the bill 's chance of passage by this Congress is immeasurably improved . A former Con ? gressman Johnson this tough on the Rules Committee is unlikely to be a former Senator Johnson undisposed to push for cloture in the Senate . Mr. Johnson then would appear on this performance to have begun by remembering most of the devices and wiping from his mind most of the traditions he learned as a Congressional Democrat . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiarly formidable enemy for some dear old friends left behind . * it does not seem likely that President Johnson will want to precipitate an encounter right now with the Soviet Union by taking up Mr. Betancourt 's demands for a blockade of Cuba . The Johnson Administration is young and anxious to find its own firm footing , and in any case , this is a rash instance to choose since the particular source of Betancourt 's ire is a cache of small arms found buried on a desolate stretch of Venezuelan beach . Betancourt says it came from Cuba and was destined for the boo Communist terrorists who are for ? ever shooting up Caracas . Castro denies the arms came from him and even holds out some possibility of co ? operating with a team of OAS investigators dispatched to look into the business of alleged arms shipments from Cuba to Venezuela . Betancourt 's task is complex . He must placate the Army generals who are calling for severe action against terrorists who kill their men . Betancourt has a history of playing a game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to keep it from putting over a coup and just easy enough to keep liberal civilian elements from turning further to the Left . The dexterity is not inherited by Mr. Leoni , his successor , and the chance of a coup during Mr. Leoni 's first year in office can not be minimized . John F. Kennedy in his last major speech on the Alliance for Progress ? a few days before his death ? pledged the US to come to the aid of any country whose government was threatened by a take over whose elements were aligned to foreign Commu ? nism . If the OAS establishes that the weapons found on the beach were in fact of Cuban origin , the case for OAS intervention ? with , of course , US participation ? in Venezuela will have a solid foundation . Such a pros ? pect would appease , even please the Venezuelan armed forces , and perhaps deter the Castroite insurrectionists for a time . This would give Leoni some time to establish himself . His coalition government may have easier going than Betancourt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists from politics , therefore en ? suring that the Venezuelan Congress will be free of those members who were so obstreperous in the past . Relieved of their presence , the Congress may be able to move ahead with administrative streamlining and the institution of a new criminal code . KENYA : Independence * Kenya will become the 35th independent African state on December 12 . Tribal enmity is still great ; even more divisive is the lack of party disciplinc common to both the governing National Union ( KANU ) and the opposition Democratic Union ( KADU ) . Headed by Mr. Kenyatta , the Prime Minister , KANU is centralist ; KADU , led by Mr. Ngala , fights hard for local govern ? ment and threatens secession unless it gets its way . There may be intertribal violence , arson , rustling and white-baiting in certain bush areas ? particularly the Rift Valley , the Kinangop and the Aberdares where there are large sedentary migrant populations of Ki ? kuyu , the country 's largest and most aggressive ethnic group . Increasing tension is apparent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sandy pastures with Somalia , which wants them . So far Kenya is adamant about not giving up the stretch of desert and semi-desert , but if Somalia were willing to pay for the land , an agreement might be worked out . Meanwhile , Somalia radio continues to threaten imminent war in this Northern frontier dis ? trict , and Kenyan troops are engaged sporadically in ambush raids . It is widely thought that Prime Minister Kenyatta will resort to authoritarian means to deal with these problems . Should there be any wide-scale violence in the bush , Kenya 's two major industries ? tourism and farming ? would be hurt . Internal strife would further unsettle the white community of some 6o,000 , which has stuck by Kenya throughout and is particularly im ? portant at the present time as a lure for foreign invest ? ment . The new nation needs new forms of economic activity since her prime commodity exports , including coffee , are declining in price . There has been a prolonged discussion of the cur ? rent constitution . Partly to appease KADU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic rights which need almost unanimous action by the legislature to change . However , this document will go out of exist ? ence in about a year 's time when Kenya becomes a republic instead of ? as Britain insists for the time being ? a Canada-like dominion ruled in theory by Queen Elizabeth of Kenya . Economic union between Kenya , Uganda , Tangan ? yika and Zanzibar , linked as are the 14 French-speak ? ing states of the Afro-Malagasy Union but also in ? cluding a common market with uniform custom tariffs ? will be inherited from the British administration . There had been talk of topping this structure with a political federal system , but the idea began to look more and more like the Central African Federation , with Kenya in the favored role of Southern Rhodesia , so it has been shelved . ASIA : Change in the White House * Peking , carrying on as usual its bitter polemic with Moscow , offers the most simplistic interpretation of the changeover in the White House : " There 's no dif ? ference " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? graphical commentary in the official Peoples Daily on November 24 . Both men were millionaires ; both faced a world in which " an East wind was prevailing over a West wind " ; both were desperately trying to prevent the inevitable triumph of Communism . Hanoi , capital of Communist North Vietnam , has noted that Lyndon Johnson proposes to continue his predecessor 's policies of military and economic aid to South Vietnam in its fight against Communist guer ? rillas . And carrying the ball for Peking , Hanoi scoffs at " revisionists Khrushchev who expressed sorrow at the loss of the bellicose ringleader of imperialism . " Non-Communist capitals , however , do sense a dif ? ference between Kennedy and Johnson and their hopes and fears are conditioned by the degree of difference they think they see . In Tokyo , where Kennedy 's attempts to achieve a detente with Moscow were most popular , there is con ? cern that Johnson may show less willingness to try new approaches on the obstacle-strewn path of peaceful co ? existence . Kennedy himself , Tokyo commentators say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after winning a second term next year .. Can Johnson commit the prestige of the American Presidency to opening up new coexistence avenues when he has so many domes ? tic tasks clamoring for attention in an election year ? In Taipei , conversely , there is a feeling that Johnson may be more sympathetic to Chinese Nationalist pre ? tensions than his predecessor . This feeling may be mis ? taken , but it arises from Johnson 's 1961 trip to the Far East and on around the world , during which he visited Taiwan , South Vietnam , the Philippines and Thailand in an effort to convince these allies they were n't being abandoned , despite Washington receptivity to neutral ? ity for Laos and other thaw-promoting projects . John son , it appears , succeeded only too well . In Taiwan he praised the aging Generalissimo to the skies and in South Vietnam he compared Ngo Dinh Diem to Wins ? ton Churchill . These extravagances were understand ? able , given the nature of Johnson 's mission , but they helped to form the Far East 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very different role to play as leader of the entire Western alliance . The crude fact to emerge from the high intrigue in Iraq last month is that the Ba'ath Socialist Party has been overthrown by an Army junta ? conservative , consciously Muslim and nationalist in temper . To call it a right-wing coup is an oversimplification but there is no doubt that moderate , traditional forces have re ? asserted themselves to stem the headlong " progressive " current of the past year . President Aref 's new regime has pledged its fidelity to the stillborn April 17 charter whereby Egypt , Iraq and Syria agreed to federate ; but this may safely be dismissed as a routine profession of faith in Arab unity which has little immediate relevance . The coup in Baghdad on November 18 shattered the dream of a bilateral Syrian-Iraqi union under Ba'athist direction . It has not eased the way for any new form of union . The present state of play in the Arab world is that Ba'athist Syria and Nasserist Egypt remain at daggers drawn and will stop at nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one or other regime is for the moment possible . Baghdad , freed from Ba'ath control , is now poised uneasily be ? tween the two . President Aref and his junta are aware that their best chance of survival lies in maintaining this equilibrium . If they tilt the balance in Cairo 's favor by undue hostility toward Syria , this might allow Nas ? ser to overthrow the Ba'athists there . Iraq would then have to face alone a powerful Syrian-Egyptian com ? bination . The Iraqi officers also realize that they need the Ba'ath at home to keep the Communists in check . The exigencies of this intricate trapeze act ? both in ? ternal and external ? explain the presence of a number of Ba'athists in Aref 's cabinet and the tolerably friendly relations which he hopes to maintain with Damascus . Needless to say , the Syrian Ba'athists need Iraq 's friendship as much and more . They are putting a braveface on their setback in Iraq and , by conciliatory ges ? tures toward Aref , are desperately attempting to sal ? vage what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Any ganging up of Baghdad and Cairo could be fatal to them . President Nasser has already drawn handsome divi ? dends from the upheaval in Iraq . His policy objectives may at this stage be summed up as follows : ( 1 ) to destroy the Ba'ath , still his main Arab rival ; ( 2 ) to prevent at all costs a union of Syria and Iraq ? this is a constant of Egyptian policy which since the Middle Ages has opposed the rise of a power in Arab Asia strong enough to threaten her security or outweigh her influence in the Eastern Mediterranean ; ( 3 ) to re ? cover control of Syria ? the linchpin of the Middle East power system . As may now be seen , the first part of this program is already well under way , due largely to the Ba'ath 's own folly . The change of regime in Iraq may be said to have been precipitated by two related schisms : the first be ? tween the Army and the Ba'ath which brought General Kassem down last February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party itself . The Army 's quarrel with the party came to focus on the existence of the Ba'athist paramilitary National Guard . A regular force could not easily tolerate an ir ? regular militia throwing its weight about and generally encroaching on preserves the Army thought its own . More politically conscious than either the Army or the police , the National Guard had played a valuable role in the early days of the February revolution , rooting out and crushing Communist paramilitary forces . But with a return to more normal conditions , its arbitrary strong-arm methods gave offense . Conceived as a high-minded instrument of Ba'athist revolution , it seemed too often like a gang of paid thugs . Opinion veered
