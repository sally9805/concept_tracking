And among medical supplies they found a roll of gauze wrapped in a page of the July 28 issue of TIME . It was a page from Books , with part of a review of Wyndham Lewis ' memoirs and part of one of a novel by William Burroughs . Checking further to see what might have been of special interest to the Viet Cong in that issue , we found it contained a story on the supposed martyr , Nguyen Van Be , who had been eulogized in the North for his heroic exploits before suddenly turning up in the South as a live defector , to the embarrassment of Hanoi . <P> Thus inspired to imagine guerrillas huddled in a candlelit cave pondering the pages of TIME , we got to reflecting on the effects of stories in the magazine , and decided to pass on a few cases in point .

The agency went to work and ultimately our Auckland stringer , Bob Gilmore , joined in . The Hepworths found a place in Auckland . When we did our Gemini rendezvous cover at the end of 1965 , NASA 's Director of Flight Operations , Chris Kraft , found the cover diagram of the maneuver by Cartographer Robert M. Chapin Jr . so exact that he asked us for copies of the original work . He has since been using them to explain the historic mission to NASA 's own staff and to aerospace contractors . In our cover story on " French Chef " Julia Child ( Nov. 25 , 1966 ) we used a picture of her butcher , Jack Savenor , of Cambridge , Mass . A Swift &; Co. wholesaler in Illinois read the story , made an arrangement to supply the butcher with meat at a substantial discount so the dealer could put a sign on his plant saying " We supply Julia Child .
