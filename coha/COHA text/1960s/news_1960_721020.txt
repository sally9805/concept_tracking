C. , 21 miles before the crash , civil aeronautics board officials said Thursday . With guarded talk of a planned explosion , the officials took the almost unprecedented action of reporting their findings in an air crash before their investigation has been completed in testimony before the Senate corlmerce aviation subcommittee . Believes Bomb Cause Sen. A. S. Mike Mouroney D. , 0k1a. , subcommittee chairman , said after hearing the story : " I am convinced that a bomb of some sort was the cause of this disaster . It seems pretty pat that this I bomb was carried into the washroom in the plane , and set off deliberately . " The evidence is very strong that it was a case of suicide by bonibing . " Find Bag Shredded One of the major mysteries of the investigation is a small blue cloth bag of the type presented to passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped aboard the plane in New York City was 20 pounds . The bag was found near the body , but it was empty . It had been torn to shreds and its bottom was almostgone . Oscar Bakke , CAB safety director , identified the lawyer as Julian Andrew Frank , 32 .

That the 34 persons who lost their lives In the disaster knew they were doomed was indicated by Bakke 's report that seven had donned life preservers . The last leg of the flight was to be over the ocean , he said , but he told the subcommittee , headed by Monroney , it would be unusual for that many to put on life belts because of an ocean hop unless they expected a water landing . While BELklee and his superior , CAR Chairman James R. Durfee , were cautious in their language , Bakke left little dollbt that the absence of an explosion would be easily established . " Rumors of an explosion , " he said , " have got to the press . So it is useful to give some indication of our success in locating causes and origins of explosions from the use of lethal machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it ? will be discovered and the cause precisely established . " " People do n't normally fall " out of planes flying at 18,000 feet unless something propels them , " said Sen. Clair Engle D. , Cal . . " That 's right , " Bakke replied . The importance the government attaches to the investisatIon was indicated by Bakke 's disclosure that a number of government agencies are cooperating in it . Find Fuselage Pieces Without linking his account to an explosion , Bakke said that near Kure Beach were found pieces of fuselage from the right side of the plane - near the wing . Marks on these fragments indicated , Bakke said , that they had been bat-tered by the propeller of the right inboard engine . Near the place where Frank 's body was found were discovered parts of the plane 's interior , hat racks , a three-unit seat , coats and pillows .

The engine and the propeller were found intact in the wreckage . Whether conditions in the plane were so desperate that the crew could not radio a distress message , or the radio was damaged in the trouble over Kure Beach , was not known . When the plane was found , the radio was useless . Bakke said ' that Frank bought all his insurance within the last nine months . Last April he bought $100,000 worth of accident insurance . last November $500,000 worth of life insurance , later in the same month $100,000 more of accident insurance , and in December he purchased three $62,500 accident policies .
