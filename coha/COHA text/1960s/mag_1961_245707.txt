To fight the gold war , President Kennedy this week put forth a program aimed at a reduction of U.S. spending abroad and an increase in foreign spending and investment in the U.S. Key proposals : <P> Cut the amount of duty-free foreign goods that U.S. tourists can bring back , from $500 to $100 . <P> Reduce U.S. defense procurement abroad and spend more at home " even though this will lead to some extra cost . " <P> Tighten the loopholes through which U.S. companies can channel profits into foreign " tax havens . " <P> Set up a double standard of interest rates , so that foreign governments that bank their funds in the U.S. would get higher interest than U.S. institutions do . <P> Expand the credits to U.S. exporters through the Export-Import Bank . <P> But the President opposed higher tariffs . The solution lay in making U.S. goods and services more competitive in world markets . Through his new Labor and Management Policy Advisory Group , chaired by Labor Secretary Arthur Goldberg , the President would seek to " encourage productivity gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price stability . " <P> Because the economies of free nations are becoming more interdependent every day , the Western nations should look toward the day when they can cooperate more closely on fiscal policies , said Kennedy . He recommended a study to determine whether a new global financial agency should be founded to smooth out the cycles of boom-and-bust , surplus-and-deficit , by helping to regulate interest rates , money movements and fiscal policies throughout the non-Communist world . To create and join such a bank would require some sacrifice of economic sovereignty , but Jack Kennedy asked the Treasury to consider the idea .
