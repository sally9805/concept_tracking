txt therefore correct on the projection is the standard parallel ; its distance from the apex of the cone will be R ( radius of reduced globe ) x cotangent of latitude angle ( Fig. 23 ) , and this will be the radius upon which the standard parallel is drawn on the projection . Its length will be 2 -R x cosine of latitude angle ( Fig. 24 ) and this will give the subdivisions through which the meridians can be joined to the apex . The remaining parallels are drawn concentrically at the true distance away from the standard parallel ( Fig. 25 ) . Since the cone touches the globe only at one parallel , all the others will be too long on the projection ; and its usefulness is clearly limited to one hemisphere , since parallels south of the Equator , if shown , would be longer than the equator itself . The simple conical can be improved by using two standard parallels . An approximate graphical method of arriving at the centre upon which to describe them is given in Fig. 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true distance apart , // this projection is not a secant conical ( Fig. 27 ) . The meridians are straight lines through the true subdivisions of the two standard parallels ( Fig. 28 ) . The polyconic is a further development of the conical principle ; a separate cone is tangent at each latitude line , so that each parallel on the projection has its own centre and the eccen-tric curves are the correct distance apart only along the one straight central meridian . All the parallels are truly divided to give the curved meridians ( Fig. 29 ) . None of these conicals has any specific quality beyond the correctness of scale already described , though the errors of area and shape are small in the simple conical with two standard parallels , if these are well chosen , or in the one stand-ard parallel form if the extent of latitude is small . This latter can be made equal area and is then generally known as Bonne 's projection . The central meridian , the one standard parallel and then the other parallels are drawn as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( say 27rR x3c6os lat. for 10 ? intervals ) and the curved meridians drawn through the dividing points . Since all parallels are the true distance apart and truly divided , areas are true ; but the intersections of meridians and parallels depart more and more from a right angle away from the central straight meridian ( Fig. 30 ) . It will be seen that in the other simple conicals , the Pole if shown will appear as the arc of a small circle ; in Bonne 's the parallels across the Equator can be truly shown , though shapes will suffer . // There remain several very useful projections that do not fall in one of the groups above . Mercator 's projection , sometimes called the cylindrical orthomorphic , begins with the cylindrical idea and balances the necessary exaggeration along the parallels with a corresponding increase of scale along the meridians , so that at any intersection , the north ? south and the east ? west scales are the same ( Fig. 31 ) . Thus for example the parallel of 60 ? N. should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 60 ? is a half ( see Fig. 24 ) ; but since it is equal to the Equator , the meridional scale at 60 ? is to 43 be double that at the Equator . The construction of a map-net embodying this readily understandable principle requires the use of tables and Mercator can not be arrived at by any graphical method ; do not confuse it for example with a cylindrical stereographic , which would resemble it somewhat in having a poleward increase of scale . Since at any point the scale is the same in all directions from that point , a straight line will intersect all parallels and meridians at the correct angle ; the navigator therefore has the great advantage that a straight course or route of constant bearing in any direction is a straight line on the map . If you try to plot a rhumb line on any other world map , you will quickly find the difference . But for the geographer the gross exaggeration of scale polewards is a severe disadvantage and Mercator is much less found nowadays in atlases . Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a long way round on this projection . Sanson-Flamsteed 's sinusoidal projection is a straightforward application of the equal-area principle to a world map-net ; in a sense it is Bonne 's with the Equator as the standard parallel ; or a cylindrical to which the method of Bonne has been applied . All parallels are straight , truly divided and the true distances apart ; the resulting meridians badly distort the shape near the edges ( Fig. 32 ) . p 44 Mollweide 's projection is another world net on which areas are true , with rather less distortion of shape . A central circle has an area equal to a hemisphere on the reduced globe , that is a radius ( r ) of v ' 2 x the radius of the globe ( R ) ( since the area of a hemisphere is 27rr2 and the projection circle 7rr2 ) ; an ellipse is drawn having twice the diameter and area of the circle ( Fig. 33 ) . The position of the parallels is obtained by drawing the angles such as on the projection so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since for a given projection-angle the latitude angle 0 can be found from the formula 7r sin 0 = 20+sin 20 , a graph of these values is required from which the value of the projection angle may be read for a given latitude angle B. The resulting parallels become closer together towards the Pole . Either Sanson-Flamsteed or Mollweide may be interrupted ' , that is it may be divided into segments or half-segments each with its own straight meridian or p 45 half-meridian ( Fig. 34 ) . Within each segment , distortion is reduced and thus the shape of the continents or of the oceans improved ; but the choice of straight meridians to improve the first necessarily divides the second into discontinuous parts ; to show the ocean currents on a Mollweide interrupted in the oceans is not unknown but hardly commendable . Perhaps you have found this geographical excursion into the mathematical world somewhat heavy going ; even if that is the case , you must bear in mind that we have not gone at all fully into the mathematics of map projections and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can not satisfactorily choose or properly use our maps unless we have some understanding of their qualities and this depends upon some knowledge of their method of construction . We have considered the construction of some important projections graphically , but in actual practice the cartographer does not shine lights or wield cylinders , nor does he use the geometrical methods described . He calculates mathematically the coordinates of the intersections of the chosen meridians and parallels . Fortunately we do not have to draw our atlases , we have only to use them intelligently . BOOKS There are plenty of books on this subject ; indeed there has been almost a spate of them in recent years . Steers , An Introduction to the Study of Map Projections , 12 an early and well-known book , is still among the best . Two short and useful books on the subject are // Hinckley 's Map Projections by Practical Construction , 13 which deals with the geometrical construction of some of the most common projections , and Bowyer and German , A Guide to Map Projections.I4 Mainwaring 's book15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the actual continents are shown ; and , like Steers ' and Kellaway's16 books , is written for the geographer . There are also chapters on map projections in such books as Bygott , Garnier and Raisz , referred to in the last chapter . CHOICE OF PROJECTION The choice of a projection for a given map involves a careful consideration of the purpose and nature of the map and of the size and position on the globe of the area to be covered . Thus distribution maps may be best served by an equal area projection , whereas for polar exploration the polar case of the zenithal equidistant would be preferable . Countries may often best be mapped by a compromise type of projection such as a simple conical ; separate continents or oceans may well use an appropriate part of a projection suitable for the whole globe . Special choices have to be made for special pur-poses ; consider for example a map of the Trans-Siberian railway . Make a critical study of the choice of projections in your own atlas and keep a look-out for some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes intersect at whatever spot on the globe the writer of the article happens to be writing up as the world 's natural ' focus of air routes . The continual reminder that every flat map is a snare and a delusion should drive us back to the round globe , on which alone we can get a true idea of all the interrelation-ships of position and size upon this sphere which is our ( intellectual ) sphere . Consider too , as an alternative to the expensive and breakable globe , some of the flat-sided near-globes ' now obtainable and read if you can Professor Taylor 's plea for globe-mindedness in her pamphlet , The Geography of an Air Age.17 p 48 // CARTOGRAPHY B. TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPS On scales a good deal larger than those generally used in atlases , a map can become really descriptive and thus qualifies for the term topographical ' . Our well-known One-Inch to One Mile ' is a good example . Maps on larger scales still such as six inches to a mile and twenty-five inches to a mile , the Ordnance Survey prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as cadastral ' but strictly the term implies a map of property boundaries and such maps are usually only in manuscript ; property boundaries often do not coincide exactly with the hedges and fences which the twenty-fiveinch map marks . Let us sort out some of the problems arising in the making of topographical maps by looking at a sheet of the Ordnance Survey 's Seventh Series of the One-Inch ; you will certainly either possess such a sheet or have ready access to one . If you have sheets of both the Sixth ( ' New Popular ' ) and Seventh editions , it is valuable to examine the differences between them . SCALE In choosing the scale , the purpose of the map is fundamental . What sort of people are going to use it and what sort of information do they want ? It is not much use buying a Six-Inch map for a cycle tour , or on the other hand a One-Inch for a crop survey . The scale will determine how much topographical detail can be shown , what area can appear on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plottable . It may be desirable to relate the scale to that of other maps of the country , or to a metric system . The scale is expressed on this map in three different ways : in words ; by three scale lines ; and by a representative fraction . This last ( the ' R.F. ' ) allows a comparison with other scales based on a different unit , notably of our British system with the metric . The R.F. may be written 1:63,360 or 1/63,360 but is frowned upon . The scale lines , in miles , yards and kilometres , have black and white sections in the centre for accuracy with the dividers . The subdivisions of the larger units are on the left of the 0 and these read to the left ; with one 48 // point of the dividers on the appropriate whole unit , the position of the other point will give a direct reading of the smaller divisions ( Fig. 35 ) . GRID The National Grid is fully described on the map and its covers and we need add little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of kilometres instead of miles or yards as the unit of the grid . Note that the essence of a grid is that it forms a reference system for a whole series of sheets ; so that the two-mile squares lettered A , B . . . and numbered 1 , 2 , 3 . . . which were used on the first O.S. Popular One-Inch ( fourth edition of the One-Inch ) did not form a grid but simply a reference system peculiar to each sheet . The parallel north-south lines of the grid give the direction known as Grid North , and there is a statement at the foot of your sheet giving the difference between this and true north . The directions of the meridians are those of true north and these depend upon the pro-jection . Notice that the map shows latitude and longitude round the margin and by small intersections on the face of the map . It is illuminating to sketch in the parallels and meridians on your sheet by joining up the intersections . You will find that the meridians converge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the margins of the series . Such divergence will vary according to the choice of projection* and therefore the grid reference of a point will vary according to the projection . The grid reference of a point is therefore not a quality of the point on the ground but only on the map . The position of the point on the sphere can be fixed Footnote // only by its latitude and longitude . Further , it follows that the grid co-ordinates of a point do not necessarily give its true distance from the origin of the grid . There are two further kinds of north ' . Magnetic north is given by arrows on either side or at the foot of the sheet . It is not the same throughout the sheet , since the meridians converge , nor is it constant in deviation from true north . Sheet north , the direction of the sides of the sheet , on this series is the same as grid north . On the Second War Revision O.S. One-Inch the heavy purple grid diverged appreciably from the sheet lines . CONVENTIONAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the references at the foot of the sheet . This is the shorthand of cartography . We are so used to some of these that we almost forget that they are arbitrary and conventional ? the blue for water , green for woods , black for railways and red for first-class roads , for example . But these choices might well have been different ; there could be little fundamental objection to having red railways and black main roads . Actually , we take many of our signs for granted simply because there is such wide agreement upon them ; and this is one of their great advantages , since the more people there are who can readily read a given map , the better . Originality in these matters is therefore at a discount . What is the test of a good conventional sign ? It must be as small as possible , so as to obscure other details as little as may be ; and as large as possible for clarity and ease of reading . The best is therefore somewhere between these two . Make a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing different editions , and on other maps ; include the varieties and the size of letterpress in your consideration . Calculate exactly the exaggeration of some important signs , such as roads , and find out how many yards ' width on the map the different roads occupy . There follows from this exaggeration a limitation of the map which often confuses the less experienced . Suppose a road of an actual width of 15 yards to be shown on the One-Inch map by a width of 316 inch , that is 59 yards ( nearly ) on the map . It is easily possible for a 15-yard road to make a slight double bend so that , walking along the road , we should not be able to see round the bends , and yet for these sinuosities to be entirely absorbed within the map 's 59-yard-wide conventional road ( Fig. 36 ) . The cartographer may be able to show slight bends even with his too-wide sign ; but he is not always able to do so . A high-hedged road may easily seem more winding as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smaller the scale of the map , the // greater the necessary exaggeration of conventional signs , so that a smaller total amount of information can be given . Conversely , on the Six-Inch map , roads and buildings are true to scale , and field boundaries are shown ; and on the Twenty-five-Inch map the pavements can be shown as well . FIG. 36 . Comparison of conventional 1st class road and actual width of road ( scale greatly enlarged ) RELIEF Outstandingly important among conventional signs are the methods of representing relief . The earliest , on those old maps where cherubs adorn the margin and Neptune rules the sea , were pictorial peaks and ranges . It is rather curious that as late as the nineteen-forties and fifties , some American geography books , such as Preston James 's Latin America , ' used a method known as the physiographic diagram ' in which relief was shown by a much elaborated but still essentially pictorial system . Somewhat pictorial in method are hachures , the system used in the early O.S. One-Inch and still employed on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original O.S. One-Inch will be found in Fig. 101 below , p. 150 . Hachures allow a good deal of finesse by variations of length , thickness and closeness , and are capable of picking up small details of relief which contours can easily miss . But they can not give actual heights or allow the calculation of gradients , and they tend to obscure underlying topographical detail . The marking and numbering of spot heights can only partly overcome the first defect . Somewhat akin to hachu ring is hill-shading , a system of tinting or stippling steep slopes so as to make them appear such . So called vertical hill-shading tints all slopes of similar steepness equally ; more common is oblique hillshading , imagining say a north-west lighting casting southern and south-eastern slopes more heavily into shadow . Some wall maps employ this method to great effect . The contour you are already familiar with . We take our contoured maps for granted but should really count ourselves fortunate , by comparison with many countries , to have accurately surveyed contours . Where the use of contours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the survey , broken lines called form-lines may be used . On the One-Inch some contours , 150 feet , 250 feet and the succeeding intermediate fifties , // are interpolated , that is they are not surveyed in the field but drawn in later . Spot heights and trigonometrical points help the accuracy of depicting relief considerably when they are used in conjunction with contours . If you estimate the thickness of the contours on your sheet and the width on the ground they occupy , you will find that they will touch one another when their distance apart horizontally is about the same as their vertical difference ; in other words , the contour system on this scale and for this V.I . breaks down when slopes are much steeper than about 1:1 . Though on a diagram this does not look precipitous , to the walker it soon becomes a hands-andknees affair ; and the substitution of black cliff-drawing for contours appears not unreasonable . Like hachuring , cliff-drawing is an art in itself highly developed by Swiss cartographers , whom much practice has made nearly perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved by the addition of layer colours . The choice of the colour scale needs care but is quite conventional ; the youthful geographer 's assumption that the green shows grassland is understandable . When two colours are used , it is generally suitable to invert the order of density in the second colour ; say , to use the order : dark green , light green , light brown , dark brown . A combination of two or more methods of representing relief may be effective . You can see examples of this in the O.S. One-Inch Tourist Series , which was restarted in 1958 . The maps , covering areas such as the Peak District , the North York Moors and the Lake District were produced to test public reaction to the technique of hill-shading used in conjunction with contours , spot heights , trig. points and layer tinting . The mapping was considerably simplified by the use of air photographs . Examine one of these maps and try to decide for yourself how successful is this technique , remembering the purpose of this particular series . An interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief maps in plastic material with modelled relief features . On the Oxford University Press map of the Oxford district , 2 on a scale of 1:25,000 , even the most subdued features are clearly represented , such as the gravel terraces on which the city of Oxford is sited . BOOKS A. H. Meux , in Reading Topographical Maps , 3 deals more fully with the subject matter of the first part of this chapter , with reference to the O.S. maps on the 1-Inch , 22-Inch and 6-Inch scales . Hink 's Maps and Survey4 has a short account of the principal continental topographical series . An exhaustive ( American ) treatment of the // subject is by Raisz5 ; a recent American book is by Robinson.6 Monkhouse and Wilkinson ' deal fully and well with the preparation of maps and diagrams of all kinds . This is a practical book for the geographer . Other books already referred to , notably Birch , have useful chapters . But no amount of reading could be as valuable as the continual study and use of as wide a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to a few of these . SOME PARTICULAR MAP SERIES THE INTERNATIONAL MAP This map , now commonly known as the I.M.W. , is on the scale of one-in-a-million ( often written 1/M ) ( compare Fig. 120 below , p. 182 ) . The map was originally proposed by Albrecht Penck at the 5th International Geographical Congress , 1891 . It took many years before sufficiently wide agreement on a uniform system was reached and sheets began to be published . You can imagine some of the difficulties , political and otherwise , which had to be overcome ; almost every aspect of the cartography ? scale , projection , sheet size , contour interval , conventional signs ? would be bound to cause discussion and often controversy . In 1909 , the British Government invited delegates to a conference in London , where detailed specifications were made ; and in Paris , in 1913 , certain amendments were agreed upon , and the Central Bureau of the Map of the World was set up to co-ordinate the publishing of the map in various countries . The sheets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longitude ; polewards from 60 ? , 12 ? of longitude was allowed . A modified form of the polyconic projection was to be used , each sheet being projected separately . On this projection , the top and bottom parallels have their centres on the central meridian produced , and , as in the polyconic , are not parallel ; but they are drawn their true distance apart , not along the central meridian , but along the meridians 2 ? E. and 2 ? W. of it ( Fig. 37 ) . These and all other meridians are straight lines ( not curved as in the true polyconic ) joining the subdivisions of the bounding parallels . Then the immediately adjacent sheets , north and south , east and west , will fit exactly ; and a further four sheets will fit with very little discrepancy ( Fig. 38 ) . In 1955 , the functions of the Central Bureau were transferred to the United Nations Secretariat ; and in 1962 a Technical Conference on the LM.W. was held in Bonn.8 The specifications were revised , and the delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for planning purposes , and to provide the basis for sets of thematic maps on population , soil , geoloy , vegetation , administrative units and so on . Under the new specifications , the standard projection is still the modified polyconic , but between 84 ? N. and 80 ? S. it may be replaced by the Lambert Conformal Conic , and in polar regions by the Polar Stereographic . Relief is shown by principal contours ' in thicker brown lines at 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 , 1,500 , 2,000 , 2,500 , 3,000 , 4,000 and 6,000 metres , and supplemented by layer tinting between these heights . In appropriate areas , rock symbols and hachures may be employed . Five classes of roads are mapped in red , water in blue and railways black . Before 1955 , progress on the I/M series was very uneven . Not all sheets conformed to the agreed conventions . In addition there were unofficial sheets conforming sufficiently to the plan to be listed in the Reports , 9 which have been published in countries other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own Geographical Section of the General Staff produced sheets for parts of Asia and Africa . Private Societies also contributed ; the Royal Geographical Society compiled about a hundred sheets during the First World War , and the American Geographical Society completed its series of sheets covering South America , though some sheets had already been published by the countries concerned . // By 1962 , most of the world was covered , but a few sheets were missing in South Africa , while North America and the polar regions had large unmapped areas . The Ordnance Survey published Sheet NW 30 covering England and Wales and NO 30 covering Scotland in 1965. rUE NATIONAL ATLAS OF GREAT BRITAIN The series of maps sometimes given this title is on a scale of 1/625,000 , which approximates to that of the earlier Ten-Mile map . The maps cover Great Britain in respect of a wide variety of geographical facts , such as rainfall , vegetation , land use , types of farming , coal and iron mining and population distribution , in two sheets in each case . All are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by the map department of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government ( formerly of Town and Country Planning ' ) From data collected from many sources by that Ministry , and then printed by the Ordnance Survey . The 10-kilometre grid allows comparison with O.S. maps on other scales . It is instructive to consider the purpose of a National Atlas and the subjects you would wish it to include . Form your own opinion , too , about suitable scale and sheet size . Then look at as many sheets of this series as you can and recognise what a mine of geographical information they form , even if you may wish to criticise some of the details of their cartography . In a period of planning you can hardly fail to accept the necessity for such an over-all series . ERE ORDNANCE SURVEY Large-scale surveying developed in Britain during the eighteenth century and before the end of the century some fairly accurate private surveys , such as Rocque 's map of Surrey , showed fields and to some extent land use . Official mapping began in 1745 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1783 on Hounslow Heath the base-line for the triangulation was surveyed ; in 1791 two officers were appointed by the Master General of Ordnance to carry on the survey and to this day our national maps are still made by a War Office department , the Ordnance Survey . The first four One-Inch sheets appeared in 1801 . In 1825 the Six-Inch survey of Ireland was begun ; in 1840 , the Six-Inch of Great Britain and in 1854 the Twenty-five-Inch ( strictly speaking 1/2,500 ) . As in many other things in the last century , Britain was ahead of others ; and no other country has maps comparable to our 1/10,560 and 1/2,500 series . The first edition of the One-Inch and its earlier revisions up to 1870 , which included the insertion of the new railways , were engraved in // black and white only . A key to the limited number of conventional signs used was not given on each sheet . Before the commencement of the third edition of the One-Inch near the turn of the century , colour had been experimented with and contours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed in black and white but with brown hachures and with the addition of black contours . On the third , whose contours were in red , a key to some twenty-four signs , including types of roads and railways , was now at the foot of each sheet . Only the surveyed contours were shown ; with the retaining of hachures , still in brown , the representation of relief in fairly open country was very effective . With the fourth edition from 1919 the O.S. for the first time began to take a serious interest in the sale of its maps , as the name Popular indicates . The conventional signs were further elaborated , intermediate contours interpolated and hachures omitted . To supplement the ordinary sheets , the O.S. also published Special District maps in the same style where sheet lines fell awkwardly across large towns or other special districts ; and Tourist Maps of specially visited areas . The latter were layer coloured and in some cases had additional methods of showing relief . A few years before the war , the O.S. began to publish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Popular and the other called the relief edition . In the latter , an elaborate combination of methods was used to bring out the relief ; but only parts of Southern England were covered in this style . The most obvious change in the fifth was the introduction of a new letterpress , which seems to give a cleaner appearance to the whole map . For the first time , a true grid , at 5,000 yards , was introduced ; and further conventional signs such as the neat glasshouses ' sign were added . The sheetlines were slightly altered to give in many cases larger maps with some overlapping with adjacent sheets ; but the numbering remained the same . During the Second World War , the Ordnance Survey at Southampton suffered badly , losing a great part of its material , so that such things as the Tourist Maps became unobtainable . We had to be content with a first War Revision ' , about which the less said the better ; and then a Second War Revision , with a limited use of colour and a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was replaced by the New Popular ( Sixth ) edition whose sheet lines , shown on the back cover were quite different from those of the fourth and fifth editions , whose greater dimension was east ? west instead of north ? south as now . The sheet numbering system was also entirely new . The latest ( Seventh ) series follows the same sheet lines as the sixth , and shows further improvements in printing and cartographic technique . Built-up areas , for example , are now shown in // transparent grey colouring , so that contours in towns can easily be distinguished . The most recent series based on the One-Inch maps is the Tourist Series discussed on p. 52 . In addition to these maps , the O.S. has a layer-coloured quarter-inch to a mile which can give the geographer a valuable regional picture of relief . The earlier layer-coloured Half-Inch series is no longer obtainable . You can see examples of these and other types in the O.S. booklet on their small-scale maps . " Finally , you should make a close examination of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series . The sheets , which are 10 kilometres square , occupy one square of the grid on the 1/625,000 , which forms a reference sheet for the new series . These maps seem to some of us the answer to the geographer 's prayer : field boundaries , 25-foot con-tours , water in blue ( contrast the Six- , Inch ) , a map for field work and yet on a scale suitable for the study of an area if field work is not possible . When you have used the 21-Inch in the field you will more fully appreciate the value of these new maps . Perhaps you will find its scale disadvantageous after being accustomed to the One-Inch ; but in other ways this intermediate scale fills a real need , The medium-scale maps , Six-Inch and 1/25,000 are described in a useful booklet , " where you will find also a key to the signs used , which is not fully given on the sheets themselves . A third booklet deals with the large-scale maps , the Twenty-five-Inch , ( 1/2,500 ) and the town plans on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is profitable to compare our British maps with foreign ones on comparable scales . On a suitable sheet of the Swiss 1/50,000 , for example , there is to be seen the skilful treatment of special problems such as snowfi.elds , glaciers and pre-cipitous slopes . If you can compare other examples of foreign maps , it will help still further your appreciation of the main problems of cartography. // CARTOGRAPHY C. MAPS FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES THE LAND UTILISATION SURVEYS OF GREAT BRITAIN Great Britain has led the world in the preparation and publication of surveys of land use on a national scale . The first of these surveys , recognised as a unique contribution to the study of geography , was inaugurated and directed by the late Sir Dudley Stamp , and was originally carried out on the six-inch scale by a variety of volunteers  --  schools , teachers , students ? and to a great extent checked or revised by more experienced workers before reduction to the oneinch scale for publication . The survey was not a Government affair and relied upon a great deal of voluntary work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets . The manuscript maps were reduced to a scale of 1/63,360 , and the following categories of land use were distinguished : Forest and woodland  --  dark green Arable ? brown Permanent grass ? light green Rough grazing ? yellow Houses with gardens ? purple Orchards , nurseries  --  purple lined Land agriculturally unproductive ? red . Most of England was available on the one-inch scale ; some areas of Britain were summarised on smaller scales and some of the least important areas agriculturally were covered only by the generalised ten-miles-to-the-inch maps and the Land Use Map in the National Atlas series . As well as the maps , the Survey published a series of County Reports under the general title of The Land of Britain.1 In each case , the strictly geographical task of relating the land use , farming and other human aspects to the natural environment of the county was carried out by a geographer with a particular knowledge of the county in question . The maps and reports have been of value in many ways : for example , in the work of the Scott commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping to form the basis for National Atlas maps such as those showing land use , types of farming and land classification . Stamp has summarised the findings 59 // of the survey in The Land of Britain : Its Use and Misuse.3 He also described some of the post-war changes in Britain . In a sense the first L.U.S. maps are an historical document , for the survey was carried out in the early and middle thirties , when British farming was in a depressed state ; wartime ploughing in the early nineteen-forties affected much former grassland . The maps provide an important body of information about the landscape of Britain at this significant period in her history , and will be invaluable in comparison with the maps of the new series . The Second Land Use Survey was begun in 1960 , and is organised by Miss Alice Coleman , of King 's College , London . In an interesting article in the April 1964 number of the Geographical Magazine , 4 Miss Coleman describes how 60% of the country had been mapped in the field , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent remained unmapped , waiting for volunteers , for the second survey , even after the experience of the first , has been undertaken by voluntary workers willing to buy their own copy of the Land Use Handbooks and their own set of base maps . The maps of the second survey are published at a scale of 1/25,000 , and are more detailed than the earlier One-Inch ' maps . Eleven colours are used , together with symbols , shading and cross-hatching , so that subdivisions of the main land use categories are possible . Thus the main colour of arable land is brown , but six types of arable land are distinguished ; viz. cereals , ley legumes , roots , green fodder , industrial crops and fallow . Other main categories of land use , such as market gardening , orchards , woodland , marsh , industry , transport and rough land are subdivided in a similar way . A wide random sample of twenty-eight maps was published in 1964,6 and you should examine one of these and consider whether in your opinion , the amount of detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too complex . Whatever your view on this point , you will probably agree that the maps are beautifully produced , and that they will form an invaluable basis for the geographical study of a region . It is possible , if not probable , that the future geography of Britain will be a planned geography , the result of discussion , deliberation and action on both a national and a local scale . Information such as that provided by the land use surveys of Britain is clearly of paramount importance in planning for the future . LAND USE MAPPING FROM AIR PHOTOGRAPHS One of the most important contributions which aerial photographs can make to the study of geography is in providing information about // land utilisation in a relatively easily available form . This of course depends to a large extent upon the coverage of an area by air photographs and the date of the photographs , but it is clearly a far less painful method for the surveyor than that of a field by field survey with maps , pencils and boots . Indeed , in some relatively inaccessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of Miss Coleman 's is out of the question , the use of aerial photographs is imperative . You can read about the methods used in this type of mapping in an article by R. R. Rawson and K. R. Sealy in Geography , 7 which describes work on land utilisation in Cyprus , but the best way to discover some of the advantages and some of the problems involved is to attempt a piece of simple mapping yourself . Fig. 39 has been drawn from the aerial photograph of part of the Forest Ridges of the Weald of Sussex ( Fig. 97 , p. 143 ) , and if you compare the map with the photograph , you will see that in this relatively simple area , the main types of land use are easily recognised . Garnier's8 and Birch 's ? books both give detailed instructions on how to recognise features on aerial photographs , and Gamier also shows how they are valuable in providing information on relief and settlement . POPULATION MAPS To a great degree , the distribution of population epitomises the geography of an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution . The task presents various problems of which there is no simple solution , a fact that was recognised as early as 1935 , as you will see from the valuable discussion published in the GeographicalJournall0 of that year . You can map either the numbers or the density of population . The degree of accurate detail possible will depend on the smallest areas for which statistics are available ? in Britain , parishes , or wards in boroughs ? and on the scale of the map . NUMERICAL DISTRIBUTION Let us suppose that we wish to map actual numbers for a small area under study , on what is for a population map the large scale of 1/63,360 . A carefully chosen number of people will be represented by a dot on the map . Two problems arise . First , the placing of the dots : we have a few dots to mark in a certain parish whose total population is our only statistical basis ; whereabouts are the dots to be placed ? On the one-inch scale , the actual distribution of buildings may help , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dots may be placed on the nucleus ; if , on the other hand , settlement is well scattered , the location of the dots will be difficult and may be 3* // misleading . Note that a dot map of actual buildings , say traced from the One-Inch , can give a good picture of the geographical distri-bution of settlement but can not give the statistical distribution of population . On smaller scales , one dot may have to represent more people than there are living in one thinly populated parish and the problem of placing is therefore complicated by the occurrence of two or more nuclei of settlement to be shown by a single dot . It will also be necessary to balance up irregular totals per parish against a round figure total per dot . Second , the towns : it may happen on our one-inch scale , and will certainly happen on smaller scales , that the choice of number of people per dot suitable to the rural areas will give us more dots to put in for a large town than can be shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On scales suitable for whole counties , it generally becomes necessary to abandon the dot system for towns and use either a series of symbols ( see Fig. 40 ) , or a circle or pseudo-sphere of variable radius . The former method has the disadvantage that no exact relationship exists between the symbol and the number of people , since all towns whose populations fall within given limits must be shown by the same symbol : 51,000 and 99,000 might appear the same and 101,000 equally more imposing than either of them . The use of a direct arithmetical relationship between the radius of a circle and the number of people is often unsuccessful ; for if the scale is large enough for the small towns to stand out , the large towns become far too big . This was overcome by the National Atlas map of 194511 by making the areas of the circles directly proportional to the numbers . Other devices have been the use of the logarithm or square- or cube-root of the number to give the radius of the circle . There still remains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in or not , that is of balancing the visual impression it gives against that of the rural dots . Bear in mind that anything but a direct relationship between the circle and the number weakens the visual impression of the facts which it is the purpose of the map to convey ; and that it is practically impossible to gain a visual appreciation of the relative numbers shown by the dots compared with the proportional circles as in Fig. 41 . Dots and proportional circles , used either together or separately , may be employed for mapping information other than population , and you should consult the books listed at the end of this chapter to find out about the wide variety of possible uses . Dickinson 's book is particularly valuable since it deals with the different effects made possible simply by enlarging or reducing the size of the dots.12 DENSITY OF POPULATION Censuses generally tell us where the people sleep ? not necessarily their most significant occupation geographically . It has often been remarked that we should like a census of the City of London at noon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must remember that people are not spread over the land like jam on bread ; they are dotted about , they are discrete units . Could one truly speak of the density of currants in a railway bun ? assuming you get a bun with a currant in it ? Equally , density of population is an arithmetical and not really a geographical fact . The ratio between the area of a parish and the number of people living in it will give the population per unit area , and a scale of colours or shadings may then be drawn up . This method , sometimes called the choropleth method , has its limitations , because as with the town symbols two densities , say 251 and 499 per square kilometre , may appear the same colour , while two others much nearer numerically , say 499 and 501 , may appear different ? a quite unavoidable limitation . Ordinarily each census area will be shaded throughout with the appropriate density , giving a mosaic appearance to the map and suggesting visually that the population is evenly spread throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is given in Fig. 42 . The mosaic appearance may be smoothed out by generalising the colour boundaries across the parishes , in the fashion of relief layers ; you can see this attempted in Wallis 's paper in the Geographical Journal.13 Better , the density areas may be particularised , if the scale of the map is large enough , by excluding the colour or shading from areas such as parks or heaths , known to be empty , and raising the density of the remainder of the parish accordingly ; you can see a beautiful example of this in O'Dell 's map of Greater London.14 In Fig. 42 , shading by lines and dots is used . The latter is not to be confused with the use of dots to show actual number ; but for whichever purpose dots are used , the correctness of the visual impression given by them . can not be taken for granted . The impression given by a certain number of dots within a certain area appears to vary according to the arrangment of the dots and the relation between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point by referring to Winterbotham 's paper , Dots and Distributions ' , 15 and comparing his remarks and those of O'Dell in the discussion published in the Geographical Journal.16 Draw up a dot density scale yourself and try it out in the sort of way O'Dell did if you can . Winterbotham and O'Dell discussed these problems some thirty years ago , and their main points are still valid to-day , and are elaborated in some of the more complex texts mentioned in the list of references for this chapter . A third method of showing density is the drawing of isopleths or density contours ' . A spot-density is assumed to occur at the centre of an area of calculated density ; these spot-densities are plotted on a map and isopleths drawn between them as one might draw submarine contours between soundings of the sea-depths . Isopleths would appear to have two advantages over colouring or shading : they allow the densities of more than one group to be shown on one map , as in Wallis 's maps of the distribution of nationalities in Hungary " ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without greatly obscuring it . But the isopleth seems to be a further abstraction based on the original abstraction of density , and to assume that population grades like sloping land , from one height to another ; whereas in fact man and all his works may end abruptly , as they do at the empty jungle upon which open the back doors of Manaos . An example of an isopleth map is given in Fig. 43 . But despite the problems involved in making a population map , the result may be of real value , especially if we allow for the limitations of whatever method is used . The chief danger , as in so many geographical matters , is over-simplification . We must remember the geographical significance of the arrangement of the population , the kinds of sites of the buildings or villages themselves . DISTRIBUTION MAPS Problems and methods of mapping other distributions are clearly similar to those involved in mapping population . It is really best for you to sort these out for yourself , by a critical examination of distribution maps wherever you meet them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few points may be made regarding agricultural distributions and occupational data . In this country , a farmer makes a return to the Ministry of Agriculture of the extent of his cultivated land and its crops or use , and of his numbers of livestock on a given date each summer . The totals of these by counties are published ; and by parishes , are available to research students . Reasonably satisfactory maps on small scales can be made from these , as in the Agricultural Atlas of England and Walesl7 ; but on larger scales , the problem of position of crop or animals within the parish arises , for it is well known that many parishes run across several different types of land , as do the farms themselves . We are driven back once more to field work a crop survey or a land-use survey or at least the L.U.S. map ? if we are making a large-scale study of a small area . Remember also the variation in crop and use of land by livestock according to season . Agricultural data may be represented on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : we may show the yield of crop per acre , the actual yield in bushels , and acreage itself , the percentage of the total area or of the cultivated area or of the arable area occupied by a given crop . Imagine a series of maps on these lines for wheat in Canada compared with wheat in Europe . Similarly with livestock we may show the actual numbers or the numbers per acre and so on . The variety of visual material it is possible to provide indicates the importance of considering in each case how far the proposed map or diagram really contributes to the study in hand . In this country , statistics of occupations are available in the Census reports for boroughs and urban and rural districts , but not for smaller areas . It would be possible to make a county map , say , on the quarter-inch or half-inch scale , showing the administrative boundaries in question , and carrying diagrams of the main occupation groups . Each diagram , whether a column or a square or a circle , would show ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be subdivided to show ( h ) the proportions of this number in certain main occupations , together with a remaining proportion of ' others ' . A problem we have met already will arise : a large diagram may be needed for a town of small area on the map and a small one for a relatively large rural area . Where a circle is chosen , some device such as has been employed for the population map may be used to overcome this ; perhaps the most satisfactory is the constant-plusvariant ' method illustrated in Fig. 44 and used elsewhere by H. C. K. Henderson.18 A minimum radius suitable for the later subdivision of the circle is chosen and made to represent a round figure close to the smallest number of persons to be shown by any circle ; a maximum radius suitable for showing the largest number involved by a circle not too large to be plotted conveniently on the map , is similarly made to represent a round number near that of the largest group . These perpendiculars ( Fig. 44 ) are set up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivision , and joined . The radii of the intermediate circles are then read off as perpendiculars on the graph . The method has the advantage that the cartographer sets his own limits and scale appropriate to the particular map he is making . MOVEMENT MAPS Sometimes it is necessary to represent both quantities and routes on one map . For this purpose flow-line maps are drawn , an example of which is given in Fig. 45 , which shows the exports of Australia in ? A millions , and gives a general indication of the routes taken by these exports . More detailed maps on a larger scale may show very full information about the routes . On a map showing frequency of bus or rail traffic into a large city , for instance , the actual lines of communication may be plotted . Very often in preparing a map of this nature a very large number of figures are available , and the problem of scale presents itself . In this case , a dispersal graph , a very simple device , may be employed to sort out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersal graphs in Dickinson 's book.12 DIAGRAMS Columns and squares and circles are not confined to maps ; you will come across them in all sorts of connections , geographical and otherwise . A favourite of the nineteen-fifties was the Isotype , a method which is not so widely used at the present time , in which rows and rows of little men with an odd half man at the end show the number of people in a country whose total population we could far more readily appreciate by being given its number ; or in which the rows of little graves stand for the babies whose mothers did not immunise them against something or other , Perhaps you are one of those who prefer half a page covered with sacks of wheat to being given the wheat production of Canada as so many million bushels ; in any case , you may be told at the foot that each sack represents so many bushels and then you can count the number of sacks and work it out for yourself . But it is worth remembering that a diagram , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more space in a book than the figures it represents ; so that it deserves inclusion only if it does something more than the figures would do . Often the visual impression is more readily grasped or retained , comparisons more readily made and so on . We are concerned however , with the intelligent reader of intelligent geography books , not with posters for the Great British Public ; and in an intelligent publication everything must justify itself . Test each diagram you see and each diagram you make by these criteria : does it convey the facts better than the figures would do ? Does it give the correct visual impression of the facts ? " One or two points may help your own efforts in this connection . A line graph seems logical where change or progression is involved ; to show say the fluctuating yield of wheat per acre or the increasing population of a country over a period of years . On the other hand , to show successive years ' acreages of a crop as sectors of one large circle seems unreasonable , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled-in diagram ? column , square , circle seems called for , and these may be subdivided , as we have seen . Do not show one category within the column of another unless the one really is a subdivision of the other and is in the same unit . It is generally unsuitable to have more than one scale applicable to a single diagram . Numbers of cows in Denmark as a column , yes ; but not gallons of milk inside the same column with the gallons scale on the other side ; it is not the kind of position in which the milk is much use anyway . Subdivision of a square is not easy ; one tends to get irregular-shaped areas which can not readily be compared with one another in size . But squares within one another are very suitable for the increasing acreage of a given crop over a period of years , that is for change involving quantity , provided there is no temporary decrease . BOOKS The books by Birch , 9 Dickinson , 12 and Garnier , s which have already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mapping , but a very useful and comprehensive book is Monkhouse and Wilkinson 's Maps and Diagrams.20 Reference may also be made to Robinson.21 Four books containing valuable air photographs for various purposes are Egli and Muller , Europe from the Air , 22 Monkhouse 's Landscape from the Air , 23 Hardy and Monkhouse , The Physical Landscape in Pictures , 24 and the Aerofilms Book of Aerial Photographs.25 SLOPE AND ( ' ROSS-SECTION There are various graphical methods , which can be used to assist the interpretation of contour maps or to obtain special types of information from them , which we should consider before turning to the wider matter of the interpretation of a topographical map in all its aspects . One of the commonest methods , no doubt familiar to you already , is the use of the cross-section or profile . In almost all cross-sections , the horizontal scale is that of the map and is smaller than the vertical scale , which is generally chosen to form a simple relationship between the contour interval and the vertical distance between the horizontal lines on the graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus plotted on - , - o- inch squared paper would have an horizontal scale of 1/63,360 and a vertical scale of 1/6,000 inch = 50 feet ) . The vertical exaggeration would thus be approximately ten times . Whatever else the section may show , it will not show slope truly . We are so used to these exaggerated slopes in diagrams that we subconsciously accept them as correct ; and we seem to confirm this error in our experience , for a road rising at 1 in 5 looks like the roof of a house to the approaching cyclist , and feels steeper still as he pushes up it . But plot a gradient of 1 : 5 , bearing in mind that the 5 is the base of the triangle ( which is the distance the map will give ) and not the hypotenuse , and you will see what the slope is really like . It is worth while forcing yourself to draw the north ? south section of the South Downs , using the same vertical scale as horizontal , to see what they are really like ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of scarpland relief . Or take a good U-shaped glaciated valley from a North . Wales One-Inch and see , by eliminating vertical exaggeration , what sort of a U really occurs . It is still true that a cross-section from a map may be useful to illustrate varieties of relief , to bring out a physical subdivision , to point a comparison ; but we should apply to it the tests applicable to any other diagram , so long as it uses any vertical exaggeration . There is one further point which may be overlooked : a section only does its job well if it runs at right angles to the contours it crosses . While in general we may arrange for this 72 to be the case , a line of some length is almost bound to cut some contours more obliquely and where it does so , the slope will appear more gentle . The slope is in fact more gentle along the section line ; but the general form of the ground may be no less steep than elsewhere along the section . The two valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross-section . I IN ILSR V 1JIDIL11 I AND DEAD GROUND A well-known practical use of the cross-section , whether vertically exaggerated or not , is to determine whether one place can be seen from another . This could be particularly useful when preparing for a piece of field work , in order to ensure that the elevated spots chosen as viewpoints for an area are really likely to be satisfactory . It could save a considerable amount of time and energy to check previously from the map that the area for which the viewpoint is required will in fact be visible from it . A profile drawn of the convex slope of a hill will readily show why you can not see the top of the hill as you walk up it ( Fig. 47 ) . Where a ridge obscures the view of a more distant slope , a cross-section can show the level at which the slope becomes visible ( Fig. 48 ) . But clearly we need not draw the whole section to discover this ; in fact , we need not draw a section at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain the principle . In Fig. 48 the observer at A ( 500 feet ) is looking across a ridge whose highest point B is 550 feet and is a mile away from him . His line of sight beyond the ridge therefore rises at the rate of 50 feet in a mile or 5 feet in every tenth of an inch on the map whose scale is 1 inch to 1 mile . A mile beyond the ridge he can see ground at 600 feet , if there is any at that distance and at that height ; a mile and a tenth , ground at 605 feet , a mile and two-tenths at 610 feet and so on . When the height of the line of sight coincides with the height shown by the contours , then the slope above that is visible . If you will place a ruler on the diagram and test this out first along ABC and then in the direction AD , working in o inches ( rather than miles and yards ) you will see how the method works . It is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arithmetic is not likely to be so simple . An elaboration of the method would enable us to shade the dead ground ' , that is the area hidden from the observer by the whole ridge , though the detailed and accurate delimitation of it is likely to be of more use to the gunner than the geographer . The nearer edge of the dead ground will be the crest of the ridge ( Fig. 49 ) . Where this intersects each contour on the ridge and perhaps at one or two other points as well , lines of sight will be drawn and the positions at which they meet the far slope marked in . The line joining these points on the far slope will be the far edge of the dead ground . If you try the method out , for example , on the map in Fig. 55 below ( p. 82 ) , it is a good idea to do so on tracing paper over the map , as the drawing does not improve the map itself . BLOCK DIAGRAMS Block diagrams are based again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally suffer from considerable vertical exaggeration , which can be the more misleading because there is an air of verisimilitude about a well-shaded block diagram . Many of the block diagrams used in books on physical geography are not actually drawn from contoured maps ; but it is not difficult to construct such a block which shall represent accurately the features shown by the contours , except for the vertical exaggeration , if any . The base of the block may be either a rectangle or more commonly a parallelogram ( Fig. 50 ) , giving an oblique view of the area . The rectangle on the map to be shown is ruled with a number of equidistant lines parallel to the base of the rectangle ( Fig. 51 ) , and lines corresponding to these are drawn on the base of the block , but more closely together . The side of an oblique block may be made equal to the side of the rectangle and the lines will then necessarily be closer than on the map ; or a further foreshortening may be arbitrarily introduced.The cross-section for each line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the block as its base . The curve joining the tops of the end verticals of each line will form the side of the block . When the complete framework has been arrived at , there follows the more difficult task of shading the slopes to give that appearance of solidity which good block diagrams have ( Fig. 52 ) . It is best to try all this out on tracing paper , best of all on squared tracing paper ; or draw the framework on squared paper and then attempt the last stage of the work on tracing paper over it , so that you can have several shots at it . THE PROJECTED PROFILE This is a rather special development of the cross-section , which is sometimes valuable in bringing out an accordance of summit levels or the occurrence of plateaux remnants at more than one level . ' Imagine yourself able to look from the sea inland for many miles over rising and hilly country , say into northern Wales : then one behind the other would rise successively the various heights in so far as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single focus of the eye or the camera sees a short but large-scale foreground and many miles of more distant hills on a smaller scale ; it takes in a sector . The projected profile covers a rectangle and deals with similar lengths of foreground and background on a uniform scale , as does the block diagram . The rectangle is divided into narrow belts or strips running parallel with the base of the rectangle . First , a profile is drawn for the nearest belt by joining the heights of the highest points encountered in moving across it . In an area of rising ground , this will usually be a section along the inner edge of the belt , except where higher points occur within the belt . Instead of a simple section along a line , we have therefore the summits and slopes we should see if we could cut off all the land behind the inner edge of the belt . The process is repeated for each belt in turn , except that the profile is marked in only in so far as it is above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same base . The result is as in Fig. 53 which has been drawn from an O.S. One-inch of the Lake District . SLOPE SCALES You may remember that in the section on slope in Chapter 2 ( p. 30 ) , we found that very roughly and within certain limits , the horizontal interval between contours in yards = the V.I . of the map in feet x 20 , divided by the angle of slope in degrees . For a given V.I. , it is therefore possible to calculate the distance between contours which correspond to slopes of 1 ? , 2 ? , 3 ? and so on . On a OneInch map with V.I . of 50 feet , these would be : It would then be possible to mark off these distances along a scale line on the scale of the map , namely 1/63,360 or ilk inch = 176 yards , and mark the divisions not with the distances but with the degrees of slope to which these distances between contours correspond ( Fig. 54 ) . We could add the corresponding gradients , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 1 in 30 and so on . Given the slope scale , we can then take off from the map the distance between two contours and by placing it against the scale , obtain the slope in degrees or as a gradient . But short of a slope scale , it is worth remembering that if the contours on our One-Inch ( V.I . 50 feet ) are - , lp inch apart , the gradient is 50 feet : - , , inch on the map = 50 feet : 528 feet = very roughly 1 in 10. inch = 176 yards , whereas a gradient of 5 ? or by our slope formula 200 yards or accurately , 191 yards ( see p. 30 ) . By using slope scales similar to this it is possible to build up maps showing average angles of slope and break of slope ; a technique which helps to divide an area into its physiographic regions.2 CONTOUR SKETCH-MAPS The surest way to find out whether you are really competent to read a contour map is to try to draw one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good for you to have to draw contoured sketch-maps of well-known types of relief , or of an area whose relief is described . One may perhaps give just a little advice . You must first of all decide upon your scale and your V.I . State these on the sketch and bear them in mind all the time . You will probably find it better to use a larger V.I . on your sketch than would be used on a printed map on the same scale ; for example , on a one-inch scale , work with a contour interval of 100 feet , at any rate to begin with . It is generally best to sketch your surface drainage first ; it saves having to make those horrible notches in the contours afterwards when you add the streams and find they have no valleys . Then the contours must bear a sound relationship to the kind of gradients to be expected in the type of country you are sketching . It is no use drawing a neat set of contours for a chalk scarp and discovering afterwards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarp face has a slope of about 1:10 ? or 1:1 . You must decide upon the kind of gradients you want to show and thus get a fair idea of the number of contours you will have to draw between various pairs of points . The gradients of streams will also need careful consideration . Just what the suitable gradients are you must learn from your continual examination of the landscape and of pictures and maps of varied landforms . MORPHOLOGICAL MAPPING A much more advanced method of mapping is that described by R. S. Waters in Geography in 1958.3 These morphological maps go beyond the simple mapping of relief , for they claim to record the actual landforms . They show , in the main , angles of slope and changes of slope , and are produced only as the result of thorough field work . Land form maps may have considerable value when compared with maps showing the distribution of other geographical features . Bridges and Doornkamp , for example , have compared the land form map of an area near Sheffield with a soil map of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical techniques of the interpretation of contour maps and of other kinds of maps are described in more detail , is Professor Austin Miller 's setting down of the two-year course in practical geography at Reading University , under the title the Skin of the Earth.5 Reference may again be made to Monkhouse and Wilkinson.6 Balchin and Richards deal more particularly with the construction of models. ? Other books on maps and practical geography previously referred to have chapters on these matters . But the most important thing is for you to choose and use suitable techniques as part of large-scale studies which you make yourself . THE INTERPRETATION OF TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPS Now that we have cleared away the technical aspects of maps , we can turn to their geographical interpretation . To begin with , it is essential to be able to visualise the form of the land from the contours on the map , to see in the mind 's eye the shape of a valley and the slope of a hill . In the best of all possible worlds , we should now firmly close this book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should walk up across the Golf Course behind Caburn , and then on the top of Saxon Down we should spread out our OneInch , and the Weald would lie before us ; the curves of the hill would fall into place with the curves of the contours . We should drop down into Glynde and this time the Trevor Gardens would make a pot of tea ; and we should cross the gap and climb the scarp , and as we sat on the top of Beddingham Hill we should feel we knew all about gradients . Then we should look towards the sea and the smooth dry valleys would fit the contours like a glove , and spur would fall behind spur in orderly succession . But this is not the best of all possible worlds and maybe we can not raise the train fare to Lewes anyway , so we shall have to do what we can at home . SOME PRACTICAL WORK The best way to make use of the pairs of pictures and maps listed below and included in later chapters is first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see in the picture , and no more . Set aside any knowledge you may have already of the area and any preconceived ideas about its physical or human geography . Then turn to the map and make its information fall into place , as you would do if you stood with the photographer and turned your map until it was set in the direction in which his camera was pointing . One example will be sufficient ; you must do the rest yourself , referring subsequently to the remarks made in the text at the points where the illustrations occur . The picture in Fig. 56 is taken from the slope of a hill looking across a vale of gentle relief , perhaps a mile or so in width , to a range of hills . The crest of the hills is smooth and nearly level and appears to be rounded . The scarp of the hills 81 which faces the observer is cut into by a number of steep-headed valleys , which do not breach the crest of the hills and between which smooth and rounded spurs stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or turn away from the viewer close to the left of the picture . The slope of the spurs and of the scarp as a whole is concave , except for the rounded convex crest , so that the upper part of the scarp is steep , while a broad and moderate slope forms the further side of the vale . ' So much for relief ; note too any human features , ' The slope of the hill on which the observer stands is covered with rough pasture ; at the foot of the hill is a fairly large farm with arable land adjoining it on the lower slope of the hill . The vale has a little woodland but is largely cultivated ; much of it appears to be pasture land . A small village lies in the vale , near the right of the picture . Much arable land can be seen on the farther slope along the foot of the scarp and there is some indication of farms in this belt . The scarp itself appears to be uncultivated , with patches of what may be gorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for one large wood in a scarp-face valley on the left . It is possible to distinguish a road traversing the nearer side of the vale and crossing a railway running at the foot of the foreground slope . ' Now turn to the map ( Fig. 57 ) and make it fit the picture , detail by detail . You will notice of course that the map can tell you more than the picture ; but it is worth while observing carefully just what the picture shows that the map can not , in other words how much extra you as a geographer can gain by going and looking instead of staying at home . Note how a belt of trees can obscure a road which looks so plain on the map ; how little the railway shows up in the photograph . The gain from direct observation is chiefly on the human side rather than the physical ; but until you can really see the relief from the contours , the gain is on the physical side as well . It is suggested that you should now turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , and attempt written descriptions along the lines of the example given . Unless otherwise stated , the maps accompanying the pictures are on the One-inch scale and have a contour interval of 50 feet , since you will ordinarily use in field-work and walking generally the Ordnance Survey One-Inch whose contours are at 50-foot intervals . How far can we learn the geography of an area from maps alone ? Let us allow that the expert map-reader can go far to visualise the landscape from a good map and , as we observed very early in this book , that the map does begin to do the geographer 's job for him , by setting out the place relationship between natural and human features . Then two main qualifications must be made . First , everything depends on the quality of the map itself , its accuracy and the amount of information which is on it and the skill with which that information has been shown . A Six-Inch will give details a One-Inch can not give ; but it is unlikely to give a general picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest-scale map of any value for the detailed study of an area ; but the QuarterInch will more readily give a general view of the physiography of a region of some size . We have already seen how fortunate we are in this country in the accuracy , cartographic excellence and varied scales of the maps available to us . Second , there are many geographical facts which no topographical map , however good , will show . Many of these can be discovered only by fieldwork ; most of the economic aspects of an area require direct observation and some of the natural aspects too ? soil and vegetation for example . There will still be some factors which can not be directly observed : the geological map is likely to be a lot more reliable than the ordinary geographer 's investigation ; for climatic data , the Meteorological Office and its publications are safer than a personal estimate of the weather ; features of historical significance may be seen , but historical factors can not usually be assessed in the field ; some economic facts , especially of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maps can tell you a great deal ; direct observation is better still ; but for a full geographical study , you will need to widen your scope still further . You will have to undertake some such study of a small area in order to appreciate fully much of what has been said here and indeed in order to realise fully the basic nature of our subject and the kind of research on which it is based . Choose quite a small area ? a parish , a Six-Inch sheet perhaps ? preferably with some variety of soil and relief within it . Your work will fall into three main parts : preliminary study of the area from maps and published sources ; the actual fieldwork ; and the working up of the data that you have collected into an account , with illustrations and maps which are really presentable . You will learn more than any textbook can teach you and you will enjoy yourself in the process , which is the best of reasons for giving field work a prominent place in your studies . You should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boards and University Departments both regard original held work as an integral part of a course of study . BOOKS Beyond the more simple stages , which you have already passed , there is a sense in which it is true to say that you can not be taught out of a hook to interpret a topographical map ; you can only accumulate experience of map-reading and of geographical study from maps and in the field . You will already have used one or another of the simpler books on map-reading and others which deal partly with the topic have already been mentioned . Meux'si book is particularly valuable , and another reasonably simple work is Speak and Carter , Map Reading and Interpretation . ' There is a good full-size and advanced book on the subject of this chapter by Alice Garnett3 and another by Dury4 ; the studies in Landforms and Life5 are also very useful . You should examine the studies of selected regions in the series British Landscapes through Maps , published by the Geographical Association.6 These are detailed studies of certain single sheets of the O.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of local geography . Some of the more useful are listed in the references to this chapter . 7 THE PROBLEM OF TERMINOLOGY One important point remains : is our account of the landforms of an area , whether based upon an interpretation of a topographical map or upon a fuller study , to be empirical or explanatory ? Is the geographer to describe relief in simple empirical terms hill , valley , steep , gentle ? or is he to give an explanatory description , weaving into one account the geological structure and the degree of erosion by various means which result in the present landforms ? You will notice that the description earlier in this chapter ( p. 81 ) is purely empirical ( unless some take exception to the word scarp ) ; and since it was based on the picture only , could hardly be otherwise . But a fuller study of the region might allow one to speak of an erosion scarp ' and a subsequent vale ' and a youthful dry valley ' : terms which imply a relationship of relief to structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should understand the causes of the relief he describes and thus give the explanatory type of description is widely accepted in this country , in America and elsewhere . In Germany , on the other hand , the school of thought headed by Passarge relies upon the empirical description of relief , based upon a highly organised system of landscape terminology.8 The interpretative or explanatory study of relief owes a great deal to the American geographer W. M. Davis , whose work extended over the period 1880-1934 . The study may be said to have become a subject in its own right , under the name of geomorphology , and it is one to which both geographers and geologists continue to contribute . It is clear that if we are to accept the explanatory point of view and attempt to interpret our maps and our areas of geographical study , we must begin with some systematic investigation of the factors at work . From maps we therefore turn now to the physical landscape itself . THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH **26;411;TOOLONG Some readers may feel that the section of the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied to geology than to geography . If this is your feeling , you would do well at this stage to consider what is involved in the study of geomorphology . B. W. Sparks , in his book Geomorphology , ) has said that it is essentially the study of the evolution of landforms ' . This surely is a geographical form of study if we consider geography to be the study of the earth . Landforms include all the features of the physical landscape , which , at least if you hold the view of the landscape geographers , is one of the two main branches of study , the other being the cultural landscape ( see pp. 11 , 12 ) . Perhaps geographers would emphasise what is missing in Spark 's definition ; that is that description of landforms is a necessary first step in geographical synthesis . G. H. Dury states what is probably the most reasonable view in the introduction to his book The Face of the Earth.2 He suggests that geographers study man in relation to his environment , while , as specialists , geomorphologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man at all ' . It is clear , however , that the results of geomorphological study may be of great value to the geographer , and in some instances , work has been done to show the relationship between the two disciplines in a single study . A. J. Stevens , for example , in a study called Surfaces , Soils and Land Use in N. E. Hampshire ' , 3 attempts to link a geomorphological survey of erosion surfaces with a geological summary of land use . The study of landforms is made so much more interesting by the controversies and differences of opinion which have arisen and continue to arise about the interpretation of landforms , and in particular about the processes of erosion involved . In the course of this section we shall try to point out some of the major controversies , and the student may follow these up and form his own judgements . A second characteristic of the study is the increase over the last twenty-five years , and particularly the last fifteen , in the amount of scientific already pointed out how Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 ) , and you can read more about these developments in Haggett and Chorley , Frontiers in Geographical Teaching.4 Chorley suggests that geomorphologists , helped by better mapping and by air photographs , are now concerned with present dynamic forces in the formation of landforms ; in other words the present method of erosion or deposition is studied by means of statistical analysis ; and that this makes the work more geographical . Statistical work is also more objective than earlier studies in which the subjective theories of the geomorphologists were unsubstantiated by anything but simple observations . In the following chapters we shall point out the main fields of study being qualified by statistical research at the present time . A. STRUCTURE GENERAL PRINCIPLES Landscape ' , said W. M. Davis , writing at the turn of the century , ' is a function of structure , process and stage ' ; that is to say , landforms are the net result of the interaction of the build and character of the rocks , of the processes modifying these and of the degree of modification which they have undergone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the term , this covers two distinct ideas , namely the build of an area of the earth 's crust and the varying nature of the rocks themselves . It would seem clear that we should be aware of the main types of structure , in the first and narrower sense of the word ; but the causes of these structural forms would lead us into rather deep waters , in which we might easily lose our depth . To pursue the fascinating problems of the nature of the earth 's interior , of drifting continents and the causes of uplift or upfolding of parts of the earth 's crust at certain periods in its history , would certainly turn us towards side issues rather than the core of our subject . It is true that some wellknown geographers as well as geologists have given consideration to these problems , as you will find in Wooldridge and Morgan , An Outline of Geomorphology.s If you wish to go into these problems , you may begin with that book or with Holmes 's Principles of Physical Geology.6 Some of the specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of this chapter. ? It is proposed here to make only brief reference to these matters and consider chiefly the structural forms which , while manifesting the instability of the earth 's crust , have a vital bearing on the relief of the continents . Since both the igneous rocks ( those originally molten ) and the sedimentary rocks ( those deposited in layers or strata as sediments ) mostly originated below sea-level and rarely far above it , it follows that the relief and the very existence of the continents must depend upon uplift . The succession of sedimentary rocks , too ? for instance , limestones formed in deep water , sandstones generally in shallow ? forces one to imagine many downward as well as upward movements of large areas relative to sea-level , as well as the more violent but less frequent crumpling of these beds into great folds and their dislocation by fractures or faults . Truly this is the unstable earth ' . But bear in mind that the time scale involved in the sedimentation , igneous activity , folding and faulting which together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of years , though earthquake and volcanic eruption are short-lived and sudden . Further the heights and thicknesses involved in even the greatest mountain folding are only a minute percentage of the earth 's diameter ? compare Everest 's less than six miles of height with the earth 's diameter of nearly 8,000 miles . STRUCTURAL CHANGES FOLDING The main types of folds are best shown diagrammatically ( Fig. 58 ) . The warping of the strata in south-eastern England mostly involves the tilting of beds only a few degrees out of the horizontal . The vertical exaggeration common in , say , our textbook crosssections of the Weald , carries with it great exaggeration of the slopes of the strata . On such inclined beds , the dip is the direction of the maximum slope of the bed and is at right angles to the strike , which is the direction of a horizontal line on the bedding plane or original surface of sedimentation ( Fig. 59 ) . Nearer the area of most intense crumpling of the crust , the gentle warping will give way to steeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synclines ) , as it the Jura . More intense pressure may give closely-packed concertina ( isoclinal ) folds , where small folds occur within a much greater upfolded or downfolded complex ( anticlinorium or synclinorium ) The Southern Uplands are an example of the former . Where pressure has been particularly from one side , the folds will be inclined and may become recumbent , involving repetition and reversal of the order of the beds . Intense pressure of this type will cause overthrusting and in its extreme form , as in the Alps , the overthrust fold may be pushed forward as a nappe , becoming finally detached from its roots as further nappes are forced forward behind it . You will find a fascinating account of the Alpine folding in The Unstable Earth . 8 JOINTS AND FAULTS When the stresses to which a rock is subjected exceed the strength of the rock , the rock will give way in a manner corresponding to its nature and temperature . Thus a molten rock can flow , whereas a rock near the surface is generally brittle and will therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic flow , the movements being facilitated by microscopic fractures and/ or recrystallisation ' .9 Folding essentially involves flowage but it is clear that fracturing will also occur , especially nearer the surface . Fractures or planes of discontinuity along which there has been no alteration of the position of the rock on either side , are called joints ; they occur not only as a result of folding but also in unfolded sedimentary rocks and in igneous rocks as a result of cooling and contraction . You have probably seen pictures of the hexagonal columns of basalt which make the Giant 's Causeway so distinctive . Joints are generally at right angles to the bedding and often in two sets , one parallel to the strike and the other parallel to the dip ; a stone quarry will usually give you a vivid impression of this . In granite a third , roughly horizontal , set of joints occurs , as can be seen in many a Dartmoor tor . Fractures involving displacement of the rocks on either side are called faults ; their chief types and terminology are shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an earthquake and the major structural features resulting from faulting , such as the great rift valleys , must be thought of in terms of a series of great earthquakes dislocating the rocks along close parallel planes in a fault zone and often giving rise to much broken material called fault breccia . These vertical displacements , such as the sinking of a rift valley floor or the uplift of a faulted block ( a horst ) such as the Harz mountains , tend to perplex the more simple-minded among us , who enquire what happens underneath ' . Again , our diagrams are misleading ; try drawing to scale a rift such as that of the middle Rhine , twenty miles wide and with a vertical displacement of no more than a mile in a crustal thickness of about thirty miles . Allow for the increase of temperature and therefore of fluidity with depth . Further , envisage the lighter crustal rocks ( the sial ) floating in a layer of heavier rocks ( the sima ) close below the ocean floors , in which the higher parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased thickness of slat below them . It is only fair to say that this is a gross oversimplification of these complicated matters , as Wooldridge and Morgan 's third chapter will show you . However , the theory of isostasy , that just as the part of an iceberg above the water line bears a constant proportion to the greater part below , so the height of a continent above the ocean floor is in equilibrium with its depth below it , is generally accepted . Imagine the sima in which the continents float to be at any rate less rigid than the crustal continents , and one may accept the likelihood of continual changes of the relative level of land and sea and not find it difficult to imagine how dislocations at the surface are absorbed by the underlying materials . But to return from this excursion towards the periphery of geography , let us remind ourselves that whatever the scale and the explanation of these structural changes in relation to the earth as a whole , their effect upon the surface relief is great and of continual significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OCCURRENCE OF IGNEOUS ROCKS Volcanic rocks are extrusive , that is they have been forced out through other rocks to the surface and have subsequently cooled quickly , thus being very fine-grained or glassy ( e.g. basalt ) . Since they give rise to a rather special group of landforms , they will receive further attention later . Other igneous rocks are intrusive , that is they have forced their way in between or below other rocks . Those large masses which cooled slowly within the crust are called plutonic ( Pluto , god of the underworld ; or as has been ambiguously remarked , the Old Man ' down below ) ; they are coarse-grained ( e.g. granite ) . Hypabyssal rocks of intermediate depths and cooling at intermediate rates are fine-grained ( e.g. porphyry ) and generally related to smaller intrusions . There are further details of these and other rock types in a good geological textbook , such as Lake and Rastall , l ? or in Holmes.11 The chief modes of occurrence of igneous intrusions are shown in Fig. 62 . On the largest scale are bathyliths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never seen . Long denudation of a folded region , for example Brittany , may expose such plutonic masses elongated in the direction of the axes of the folds and helping to retain the grain ' of the now heavily-denuded folded area . Stocks and bosses are similar in origin but much smaller , On the other hand laccoliths ( or laccolites ) , phacolites and lopoliths are intrusions between other beds ; the first of these particularly causes the arching up of the strata above it , and all are usually related to folding . On a smaller scale still are discordant or transgressive intrusions called dykes which cut across the bedding planes , and concordant intrusions called sills parallel with the bedding . According to their hardness relative to that of adjacent rocks , these intrusions will stand out as positive relief or will fall below the surrounding surface . In northern England the great Whin Sill is a wellknown positive feature , giving among other things the waterfall on the upper Tees called High Force . METAMORPHIC ROCKS Since the earth is reckoned to have been originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks depend on the erosion of existing rocks or on organic activity . Both these types of rock may be subjected to heat or pressure sufficient to alter their original character , a process called metamorphism ; and provided they are not liquefied in the process ( which would give rise to new igneous rocks ) , the newly formed rocks are called metamorphic . Heating of limestone ( thermal metamorphism ) will form marble ; the common metamorphic equivalent of sand , which is mainly quartz , is quartzite . Around an igneous intrusion such as a bathylith , a zone or aureole of contact metamorphism is likely to occur . Crystalline schists resulting from heat and pressure have a leafy or flaky structure called foliation , often dominated by one mineral such as mica . In the study of the structure of the Alps , certain schists involved in the folding have been very important in helping to unravel the complexities of these intensely folded mountains . Where pressure rather than heat is involved , dynamic metamorphism will impose a new grain on the rock ; slate is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along close parallel planes , a structure called cleavage ; the planes are not parallel to the bedding since this rock results from intense lateral pressure , on a shale or clay for example . Gneiss is another fairly common metamorphic rock ? perhaps you have come across the name in accounts of the Canadian Shield ? and in character may be described as between schist and granite . SEDIMENTARY ROCKS In a general way you may think of the sedimentary rocks in terms of the variation of material to be seen from beach outwards to deep water . The pebbles if cemented together will be a conglomerate ; in shallow water are formed sandstones , while the finer material washed further out will become shale , mudstone or clay . Shale is distinguished by having a structure called lamination , which is like stratification on a minute scale , so that the rock splits easily along planes parallel to the bedding . Usually in deeper water are formed the limestones , accumulations of the remains of marine organisms or formed by the deposition of calcium carbonate from sea water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition which applies to the coral limestone forming in warm oceans at the present time . Not all sedimentaries are of marine origin ; the Weald Clay for instance was formed in a great lake , and one thinks also of windblown or aeolian deposits , of alluvium , a river-deposited , or fluvial , material , of peat and coal from decayed vegetation . But you will have come across other labels for sedimentary rocks besides these : Jurassic and Carboniferous , Tertiary and Primary . Such terms as these are so common in geography textbooks that we must at least be clear as to their meaning , though we may go on to discuss their usefulness in such a connection . To a considerable degree , the geologist is an historian of the earth 's crust ; he deals with chronology . The relation between geology and geomorphology , the one dealing with the past , the other concerned to explain the present , may be compared with that between history and geography ; though geology is explanatory as well as historical and geomorphology is bound to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the Geological Survey Memoir of your region , and you will find much of it taken up with accounts of fossils ; for these records in the rocks of past life are the means by which the ages of the strata are related to one another . Simplifying the matter , one may say that the geologist discovered the order of the changing forms of past life by the position of different fossils in strata one above another , the most recent being on top , unless severe folding had occurred ; and that he now uses this known order to place a given stratum in its chronological order . Clearly this can only be done for the sedimentary rocks ( since igneous rocks will have no fossils and metamorphic rocks at most the crushed remains of some ) and for those sedimentaries laid down since the time of the earliest fossils . For all other rocks indirect and generally less certain methods must be used . In such a chronology , years are useless and the geologist 's time scale is therefore a list of periods , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 with the oldest ages at the bottom , since this will ordinarily be the position of those beds . The whole succession , or even a large part of it , is unlikely to occur in any one area . Where a period of denudation intervenes before the deposition of later sediments , an unconformity occurs ( Fig. 64 ) . The successive geographies of say the British Isles , which account for the extent of the various strata , are hardly relevant here , but there are interesting accounts of them , for example by Stamp , 12 and in Lake and Rastall . " The Cambrian is the earliest period from which abundant fossils remain and earlier ages , though immense in time , are generally described simply as pre-Cambrian . The next two periods also take their names from Wales and here and in other old parts of Britain , such as the Lake District and the Southern Uplands , representatives of them occur . About the end of the Silurian period , the Caledonian orogenesis or mountain building occurred , whose north-east ? southwest grain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exmoor is a well-known representative of the Devonian period . The chief subdivisions of the Carboniferous are scenically and geographically significant : the massive Mountain Limestone of the // Derbyshire Peak and the northern Pennines ; the Millstone Grit of the central Pennines , reaching over 2,000 feet in the Kinder Scout plateau with its black precipitous edge ; uppermost and on the flanks , the Coal Measures , shales and other rocks interbedded with the precious black seams . At the end of the Carboniferous occurred the Hercynian or Armorican orogenesis , with an east-west grain in the British Isles , shown in the South Wales coal basin , in the south-western peninsula and in south-western Ireland as well as in Armorica ( north-western France ) . The Permian is represented in north-eastern England by a magnesian or dolomitic limestone whose low west-facing scarp marks the eastward boundary of the outcrop of the Coal Measures . The name Triassic implies a threefold division : Bunter sandstone , shelly limestone and Keuper marls ; but the middle series is unimportant in Britain . The Bunter gives the fine red cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desert ; the angular desert-worn pebbles may easily be dislodged from some of these cliffs . With the Jurassic , we come to the strata which form the scarplands of England ( and of France ) , of which a fuller succession is given in Fig. 65 . The Lias sands and clays provide some of our iron ore and the Inferior Oolite contains our greatest source , the Northampton Sands ' . The Great Oolite gives rise to the lovely stone ' country of the Cotswolds . The Corallian limestone is thin , but little interrupting the undulating Oxford Clay vale . The subdivisions of the Cretaceous provide the well-known lineaments of the Weald . The Lower Greensand varies from a single narrow outcrop in East Sussex to a fourfold series ? Atherfield Clay ( lowest ) , Hythe Sandstone , Sandgate Clays and Folkestone Sands ( highest ) in West Sussex . The chief event of the Tertiary was the Alpine mountain building , approximately contemporaneous with the other // great new ' folds such as the Himalayas , the Rockies , the Andes and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice sheet greatly modified the scenery and soils of Britain and other northern parts of the continents . The last retreat was a mere 25,000 years ago , so that we should expect its resulting effects still to be clearly visible , as indeed they are . From a geographical point of view , it must be borne in mind that even the subdivisions of the geological succession do not necessarily give a guide to the physical character of the rocks concerned . There may be subdivisions more detailed than the usual phrase or the small-scale geological map will show ; the Lower Greensand men-tioned earlier is a case in point ; Jurassic ' , or even Liassic ' , will tell you little about the physical nature of the rock in a given small area . Even the Coal Measures ' may contain no workable coal in a particular district . It is unfair to criticise the geologist for this ; his succession claims simply to be a time-scale . Should we not rather criticise ourselves for expecting it to tell us something different , something about the geographical significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general the older rocks are more resistant to weather-ing and may be expected to give less fertile soils than the newer rocks , which are usually softer ; but the variations within say the Cretaceous are so wide that some of its beds are certainly more resistant than some of the strata belonging to much earlier periods . While the major division of igneous , sedimentary and metamorphic is open to the same disadvantage , we are likely to get more help from the simple names ? sandstone , clay , granite , slate and given these , may then gain more from the time-scale adjective . But before we can be sure what we want to know about the rock of an area in order to assess its affect on landforms and other geographical matters , we must gain a closer idea of process ' , the second heading in Davis ' dictum with which this chapter began . It is customary in dealing with the processes of denudation to consider the climatic conditions of the temperate , or warm , and humid regions as normal ' . Whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be arguable , but it is clear that the processes occurring under arid and glacial conditions climatic accidents ' , Davis called them ? and those of marine erosion must be treated separately . It is significant that in Cotton 's Landscape , ' an important book devoted to the subject of normal ' erosion , the first chapter deals with the mass movement of waste . We all know that rivers cut valleys ; but after all , the running water affects only the floor of the V and by itself would produce a vertical-sided gorge , whereas a far greater amount of material has been removed to cause the valley shape . One is sometimes asked , Did this little stream cut all this " large " valley ? ' ( as it seems to the questioner ) , and one replies , Yes . ' But it is only partly true , in that the work of the stream was partly indirect , in causing the occurrence of slopes by cutting the floor of the valley , and in carrying away the waste material from the slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water in erosion , transportation and deposition is Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology.2 This is an advanced text , but if you are interested in how geomorphology is developing , this book will indicate the use of experimental and quantitative techniques developed in the laboratory and in the field . WEATHERING Solid rock is turned into waste material capable of moving downhill , by the process called weathering . Chemical processes , in which rain water ( which contains very small proportions of carbonic acid ) plays an important part , cause the rotting ' or crumbling of rocks . Mechanical weathering may occur when the outer surfaces of the rocks are heated , making them expand and peel or flake off ( exfoliation ) ( Fig. 66 ) ; disintegration may be accelerated by the differential expansion of the particles in a coarse-grained heterogeneous rock like granite . Water expanding on freezing in the joints of a rock may widen the cracks and eventually break up the rock . Animals and the roots of plants may help the disintegration of a rock . The actual impact of raindrops is effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing effect on an exposed surface , a process by no means confined to deserts ( Fig. 67 ) . By such methods , a cover of relatively loose material is formed , in which vegetation can grow , on which soil can develop and which is capable of moving downhill . ( Further consideration is given to weathering in relation to the formation of soil below , Chapter 22 , p. 305 . ) MASS MOVEMENT OF WASTE The transportation of this material is effected by various means . In areas of strong relief , gravity alone is important , as witness the falls of rock and the accumulation of screes of loose rock below steep slopes ( Fig. 68 ) . Where frost is particularly important , broken material of this type may move forward in rather the manner of a glacier and has been sometimes termed a rock glacier ' . Again , landslides may have a striking influence on relief . A kind of rotational shearing movement along a concave surface may give a slumping effect , with a steep slope above a platform of slipped material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements , sub-surface water has an important lubricating effect . Less striking but far more common is the very gradual process of soil creep , in which gravity carries downhill the uppermost particles of soil ; the surface is gradually lowered and the extension of weathering downwards continually replaces the waste material . Surface wash by water before it has run together into streams has a similar effect . Soil creep is promoted by frost action , though it is not dependent upon it . Perhaps this account of the mass movement of waste seems very theoretical ; you must convince yourself of its validity by a close examination in the field of some fairly steep slopes , preferably bare or tree-covered , rather than grass-covered ; for a realisation of the way in which the downcutting by a stream is bound to be accompanied by the opening out of the sides of the valley is most important.3 The whole matter of the mass movement of waste is so fundamental to the development of valleys that it is worth considering the illustrations in Figs. 71 and 72 carefully . The sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no vegetation cover has established itself over much of them . These Skiddaw Slates weather readily and move downhill to choke the upper parts of the bed of the little stream whose source is near the group of figures shown . But except soon after rain , the source ' is an area of slate debris devoid of water at the surface . Fig. 72 shows part of the neighbouring Applethwaite Gill . Typical slate fragments are to be seen in the left foreground ; but in general a vegetation cover has developed . The whole of this , however , is on the move , together with the soil and subsoil below it . Notice how in the foreground the turf overhangs the stream bed , soon to fall ; some which has recently fallen lies in the stream bed still . This discussion of mass movement brings us on to the consideration of slopes , a topic which B. W. Sparks has called an extremely difficult branch of geomorphology ' .4 This is another branch of the subject to which statistical methods have been applied , and geomorphologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes is essential before any really comprehensive conclusions can be made . The basis of this interest in slopes is that in actual observations , particularly in Africa , the slopes are in fact as shown in Fig. 73(a) , rather than the smooth profile envisaged in Davis 's theory ( Fig. 73(b) ) . Walther Penck , a German geologist , was the first person to stimulate investigations into these matters , and his ideas , which have been considerably modified by later studies , differ from those of Davis in that the main cause of the slope profile is thought to be wearing back , or parallel retreat of the slopes , while in Davis 's view wearing down was the important factor . This is one of the great controversies in the study of landforms , and you can follow it up in the books mentioned in the list given at the end of Chapter 10 . The discussion in Dury 's The Face of the Earths is interesting and easy to follow . Most of the landforms of normal ' erosion are the work , directly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of eroding its bed , of transporting material and of depositing that material elsewhere . Which of these three processes is dominant depends on Davis 's third factor . STAGE If we postulate a newly uplifted area , we can imagine its relief passing through a series of stages , commonly called Youth , Maturity and Old Age , which together would form a succession recognisable at some stage or another under similar circumstances elsewhere . This succession is the cycle of erosion ( geographical cycle , Davis called it ) , though it is not cyclic , i.e. repetitive , unless fresh uplift takes place ; and its concept of stage is applicable to a river and its valley , or to the whole landscape . These do not necessarily reach the same stage at the same time and indeed Cotton deals with them separately.6 A river chiefly works by the abrasive power of the material it carries , a process called corrasion . Solution is particularly effective over limestones but otherwise the denuding power of the water itself is small . Apart from the material a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in suspension and partly rolled along its bed , the latter being its traction ' load . The amount of material a river can carry increases many times with an increase of speed and the derived power of corrasion increases roughly as the square of its velocity ; a river whose speed is doubled carries an enormous amount more material twice as quickly over a given spot . In practice therefore the dominating influence of a river occurs when it is in flood , as you must be able to confirm from your own experience on a small scale or from films and the like . B. W. Sparks gives some striking examples of the catastrophic destructive and constructive action of rivers in flood in his book Geomorphology. ? DEVELOPMENT OF LONG PROFILE Consider first vertical corrasion only . Close to the source , the stream 's cutting power is small , since its volume and the load it can carry are small . As it gains size , it cuts more strongly . In its upper and very vigorous stages , it does not wear its bed smoothly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardness are picked out by the swirling water and by the pebbles and grit it carries , and accentuated till pots ' are formed , a foot or more across , cylindrical in shape ( Fig. 74 ) . The enlargement and coalescence of these add up to a rapid deepening of the river bed . As the river 's load increases and is added to by that received from its tributaries , a point will be reached where the river has all it can carry and therefore in so far as it wears away additional material , it must deposit a corresponding amount ; in other words , vertical corrasion has ceased . The exact position of this point may vary with the varying volume of the river . Below it , the river may be said to have passed from youth into maturity . Lower still , the main work of the river may be the deposition of its load either in the form of braiding or by depositing material on the inside bends of meanders . It used to be thought that the obvious explanation of strong erosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deposition in the lower course was a result of differences in the speed of flow in that the river flowed quickly in the upper and middle courses , and slowed down in the lower .

Dury has described how measurements of speed of flow in recent years have shown that at bank full stage , speed in fact increases in the lower course of rivers , since the larger channels formed by the addition of water from tributary streams are less subject to friction from the banks and bed of the channel.8 A young river is mainly engaged in degradation ( downcutting ) and an old river mainly in aggradation ( upbuilding ) . When it can be shown that neither of these is in progress , a river is said to be graded , that is to have reached its profile of equilibrium , a delicate condition of balanced adjustment between its volume and load at all points , probably rarely fully attained . There have in fact been many definitions of grade , a concept often described in terms as delicately balanced as the idea itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river valleys.9 If you can imagine a smooth slope cut into by a river , you will see that the degradation of its upper course will give it a concave profile , steeper near its source and flatter near its mouth . Aggradation of its lower course will further flatten the curve and if a delta is built outwards , this aggradation may extend a long distance upstream ( Fig. 75 ) . The development towards a graded profile necessarily involves the headward erosion of the source . This idea , which appears to mean that a stream flowing downhill will cut back uphill , may be difficult to accept but is quite fundamental ( Fig. 76 ) . Imagine a spring at the head of a fairly steep valley : the water flows out of some sort of a hole , probably overhung with rock or subsoil and vegetation . As the stream lower down cuts down its bed , the slope immediately below the lip of the spring is bound to steepen and the more it does so the faster the water will flow over it . It follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carries little or no load , it will yet wear away the lip of the spring and the hole out of which the spring flows will be enlarged . This enlargement will eventually be such that the rock or turf or whatever it is above the hole will fall down and be carried away by the stream . Note the result : the position of the spring is now further back , though not higher than before ( Fig. 77 ) . Link up your imagining of these changes with slow mass movement of waste down the slopes around and above the spring . A common feature of the youthful profile of a river is the occurrence of irregularities , that is of rapids and waterfalls , which are gradually eliminated as vertical corrasion causes the gradual achievement of a graded profile . A waterfall recedes upstream chiefly on account of the undercutting of the hard rock which causes it . ( While a hard outcrop is the common cause of waterfalls , other factors such as faulting , glaciation and marine erosion may also cause them . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed gives rise to a gorge below the waterfall which represents the successive positions from which the fall has receded ( Fig. 78 ) . Von Engeln has a good chapter on waterfall sites . ' ? The profile of a graded river or profile of equilibrium is almost invariably shown somewhat as in Fig. 79 , which has been taken from Cotton . " But in fact the actual profile of any sizeable river , even if only partly graded , bears practically no resemblance to this . Consider one of the little rivers of the Weald , whose upper courses are still very youthful . The overall length of the river is say 20 miles , its source perhaps 500 feet above sea-level . Its average gradient is therefore very roughly 1:200 . In other words , on a drawing of the profile 4 inches in length , the greatest height would be s ' ? inch or about the thickness of a pencil line if you have not sharpened the point lately . And for a continental river , 200 miles would be a more likely length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common diagram shows therefore is the concavity of the profile and its downstream flattening ; it does not show the slope of a graded profile at all . What in fact are the slopes we shall meet in practice ? A stream whose valley is youthful in cross-section generally has a gradient steeper than 1 : 100 , though active downcutting , the cessation of which is regarded as marking the change from youth to maturity , may not cease before the slope is 1:200 or 300 . In maturity the gradient is one in several hundreds , in old age it is in the thousands . Changes in base-level in the past also affect the long profile ( see pp. 137-8 ) . If the base-level is lowered by a rising of the land relative to the sea , the river begins to cut down to the new level , and the profile is interrupted . But it is the kind of activity occurring which distinguishes the stages , as far as the long profile is concerned , not the numerical slope . DEVELOPMENT OF VALLEY CROSS-SECTION A mountain torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later stages of youth the stream may become more winding , giving the interlocking spurs which characterise this stage ( Fig. 80 ) . You will have observed that the faster current of a river swings towards the outside of a bend and the slacker water lies on the inside , so the side of the valley on the outside of a bend will be the steeper , since that side is tending to be undercut , giving an asymmetrical crosssection . As vertical corrasion becomes unimportant , lateral cutting takes its place , so that although in total the work of the river is now chiefly that of transport , in detail the river is cutting away the outside of each bend and building up the inside . It is this process which gives rise to well-marked river cliffs on the sides of spurs . These swinging bends develop in some streams into the meanders of maturity and the flood plain . Little is known of the reasons why a river begins to meander , but laboratory experiments and field observations are beginning to shed some light on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note that the swing of the current will cause the meanders to migrate downstream as well as outwards , so that the spur will be reduced to a cusp and finally eliminated . Fig. 81 should make the process clear . The photograph in Fig. 82 shows the partial reduction of a spur , on the nearer side of which is a degraded river cliff , the meander shown having not long since moved away to the right . After the spurs have gone , the meanders may continue to migrate across the flood plain which has been formed , redistributing the alluvial material in the process . It is important to realise that the flat plain is composed of material deposited in this way and not primarily of material laid down by the flooding of the whole plain , though this may contribute occasionally . As the river sinks into old age , its meanders no longer migrate across the whole plain . The deposition of sediment on the river bed raises it above its plain and it flows between high banks above the land on either side . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes dominant . Unfortunately we have no separate phrase for the flat plain formed by the swing of the meanders , the development of which is a feature of maturity ; nor indeed would it be possible fully to distinguish it from the plain of flood deposition , since flooding occurs occasionally wherever flat land has been developed by a river . THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PENEPLAIN Concurrently with the development of its valleys , the whole landscape is regarded as developing towards an undulating lowland , to which Davis gave the name peneplain . If once more we can postulate a newly uplifted surface , we shall see that the narrow steep valleys of early youth will leave between them interfluves of the original surface . One of the more powerful of the original streams may deepen and therefore widen its valley so much more quickly than its weaker neighbours that it absorbs them and receives their headwaters as tributaries , a process called stream abstraction . When the valleys have reached their maximum depth and the crest of the interfluves still remains at the original height , the landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending . At the beginning of maturity , relief is steep and the ridges are sharp crested ; thenceforward a rounding and subduing of relief takes place . The whole landscape is gradually lowered by a combination of the cutting of its valleys , the headward erosion of its streams , and the wasting of its major and inter-stream divides by the mass movement of waste which we have already seen is vital to the whole process . As the relief weakens . so the process slows down ; by the time the main rivers have reached old age , the slopes between them may be expected to be already gentle , so that an immense length of time is likely to be needed to reduce the area to one of uniformly low relief , compared with the length of time covered in youth and maturity . Indeed it has been suggested that the Davisian peneplain is unrealisable ; it commonly happens that the new uplift occurs before it is reached . Generally , supporters of the peneplain concept point to remnants of old peneplains now existing as the smooth surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the accordance of summit levels in areas of ancient rocks which are regarded as having undergone this process ; or to the planes of unconformity underlying newer rocks . However , Davis himself recorded an undisturbed peneplain near the Irtish River in Siberia.13 You can readily follow up the subject of peneplanation in any of the important books on geomorphology . Note that stage ' is not a measure of time . Although Davis chose the words youth ' , maturity ' , old age ' , these are to be understood as a succession and not as in any way indicating length of time . No one has ever attempted to suggest the actual length of time taken for a river to reach maturity , because that time will clearly depend upon the circumstances of the case , notably upon the type of rocks which are involved . When a geomorphic feature . . . is said to be in a certain stage , it is meant to indicate that its development by process has proceeded to a given one of the characteristic points in a series of changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( von Engeln ) .14 It is only fair to point out that the whole Davisian scheme , though very widely accepted , has been attacked by a German school of thought , in which Walther Penck , developing earlier work by his father Albrecht , was the leading protagonist . Walther died at the early age of thirty-five and his work was published posthumously by his father.15 Davis 's postulate of an initially uplifted and smooth surface upon which the cycle should begin is of course strictly speaking impossible , since erosion would commence while uplift was taking place . Provided , however , relatively rapid uplift occurs // and is followed by a long period of stability , the cycle may be expected to follow the theoretical course . While these circumstances are generally regarded as common , they were looked upon by Penck as exceptional . The Germans regarded slow uplift as common and related the form of valleys primarily to the rate of uplift and not the age of the valley . Davis allowed for the modification of his cycle by slow uplift but looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further in von Engeln if you wish.16 There have also been recent criticisms of the work of Davis ; indeed , since his death in 1934 , criticism has intensified . To summarise the main points : the accusations are that he took an eminently scientific subject , and treated it in a subjective and theoretical manner ; that his work was too much concerned with landform history , and too little with the geographical significance of landforms ; that he emphasised the features of erosion at the expense of depositional features ; that he made no precise measurements , and so on . Some references to the writers of these comments are given in the list at the end of the chapter.17 Sparks on the other hand , while recognising the limitations of Davis 's theories , suggests that his work should be properly seen in its historical perspective.18 It should be noticed that Penck , too , has not been without his critics , as the article by Simons in the Transactions and Papers of the Institute of British Geographers indicated in 1962.19 Let us bring our attention back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country is well known . The processes at work are comparatively uniform throughout this island . Are the varieties of landforms then due simply to stage ' ? We know from our own experience that the variety of rocks which occurs is responsible for many striking variations of scenery ; we ordinarily speak of chalk hills ' or a granite moorland ' or a clay vale ' , and these phrases bring to the mind 's eye pictures as clear as , or perhaps clearer than , the phrases a landscape entering maturity ' or a maturely dissected plateau ' . As we have already recognised , rock differences affect the stage reached by a section of a river , or by a landscape as a whole . But rock differences are effective for similar stages , at any rate the earlier ones . For example , a youthful valley in granite has a different appearance from one in chalk or sandstone or limestone . Again , it is obvious that build affects the development of the cycle of erosion . In other words , we must return to structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by relating it to process and stage , arrive at the explanation of some characteristic landforms . It will be more suitable to refer to further reading when this has been done , at the end of the next chapter . THE INFLUENCE OF ROCK-TYPE ON LANDFORMS Rocks vary greatly in their powers of resistance to weathering , and a variety of landscape features therefore results from differential weathering . These features range from peaks which remain high while less resistant material around has been denuded , to small details of relief such as the buttresses and hoodoos ' ( puppet-like pillars ) which are well exemplified in the National Parks of southwest U.S.A. The juxtaposition of hard and soft rocks is likely to give steep-sided ridges called hogsbacks if the hard bed is vertical or steeply inclined ; dyke ridges are special examples of these . An old volcanic plug such as the well-known Castle Rock at Edinburgh will often remain steeply above its surroundings . If the hard bed is horizontal or slightly dipping , a weathering escarpment tends to develop ; for example , a resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a precipitous upper edge , below which outcrop the rather less steep slopes of an underlying weaker bed . Large table-like forms of this kind are mesas ; they are reduced in size by dissection and by the erosion of their escarpments , until their breadth is no greater than their height , when they are known as buttes ? the equivalent of the South African kopje . A very small-scale version of this same principle is the earth pyramid and the pedestal rock , where a hard capping rock protects a tall pillar of much weaker material . A HARD LIMESTONE Let us turn now from the effects of differential weathering to the examination of a few examples of landforms relating to certain very characteristic rocks . The kind of scenery photographed in Fig. 83 relates to a hard limestone ; it has many of the features of the true karst ' scenery of Dalmatia , and is similar to the Causses ' of the French Massif Central . Valleys are generally very steep-sided , often with sections of bare cliff'ing , and many of them are dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 122 to reappear lower down the valley or where a different rock outcrops ( Fig. 84 ) . A generally level plateau surface is pitted by small hollows and deep fissures or dry swallow-holes ( sometimes popularly and confusingly called potholes ) . If you join the valiant army of speleologists and get yourself lowered into one such ( though it is really simpler to pay your half-crown at Cheddar ) , you may explore a subterranean world of caves and streams , with the stalagmites and stalactites produced by the precipitation of the limestone out of solution as the water drips through the rock . For most of the unusual features of this scenery result from the solubility of limestone in rain-water , together with the resistant nature of the rock . You must go into this more fully from say Wooldridge and Morgans or a similar book . CHALK COUNTRY Chalk is also limestone but newer and less resistant than that of the Carboniferous period . Look at the country shown in Figs. 56 and 82 ( pp. 83 and 117 ) . The generally smooth and rounded surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower parts of which streams may regularly or intermittently flow . Rain readily sinks into the porous rock but moves through it chiefly along lines of weakness which become underground streams , though without the great caverns of the harder limestone . Chalk can hold a great deal of water in its pores ; but it is not particularly pervious , that is to say water does not rapidly move through the rock as a whole . The discussions and theories about the dry valleys of the chalk areas give a good example of the sort of controversy which can develop in the study of landforms . One of the early theories was that the chalk areas were situated on the periglacial fringe , and that permanently frozen subsoil once formed an impervious surface on which the drainage system developed . During this same period it is possible that nivation deepened the scarp slope coombes in these tundra conditions . The process known as spring-sapping is now thought to have been largely responsible for the formation of coombes . A second theory about the dry valleys suggests that they were cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base-level of the water-table in the Chalk ( Fig. 85 ) . G. H. Dury describes how recent work in the Chilterns has cast doubt on this theory , and he suggests that the most likely explanation is that the valleys were cut during an early period of climatic change when wetter conditions prevailed . This idea he backs up by pointing out that in particularly wet years these valleys may still contain streams.2 SANDSTONE Sandstone country is less distinctive in its actual landforms , though its natural vegetation often makes it stand out . Sandstone often lacks homogeneity and its steeper slopes are therefore irregular , vertical outcrops of stone alternating with less steep slopes . Fig. 70 ( above , p. 107 ) illustrates the Mam Tor sandstone which overlies softer shales ( see also Fig. 99 ( a ) , below , p. 147 ) . In the High Weald , the hilly country illustrated in Fig. 96 ( below , p. 142 ) is composed of sandstone . A scarp such as that of Leith Hill brings out well the contrast with the chalk : much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream erosion cutting back into the scarp as well as the dip slope ; the higher surface often littered with fragments of stone as well as finer particles ; streams occupying all the valleys . Most of the regions one thinks of as typically sandstone ? the Blackdowns , much of south-east Devon , Exmoor , Cannock Chase ? are very hilly , with steep-sided valleys ; but we must recognise that these features are in the process of obliteration . Indeed you can probably best appreciate the instability of steep slopes by looking at an example in coarse sandstone . 5* GRANITE Now look at the granite country shown in Fig. 86 . The smoothly rounded slopes are often capped by tors , remnant blocks of the hard rock left by the erosion of the surrounding surface . The characteristic exfoliation of granite tends to leave rounded domes such as Rio 's Sugar Loaf mountain . Dartmoor 's slopes are strewn with boulders split off by weathering , especially frost , and later rounded by rain and by exfoliation . In the high valleys the coarse particles washed down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and bogs therefore occur . Lower down , the larger streams have cut more deeply and run swiftly over their boulder-strewn beds . The One-Inch map ( Fig. 86 ( a ) ) will help you to follow up these points . CLAY By contrast with these relatively hard rocks , a soft clay is associated with gentle relief . You are probably well acquainted with an example of the gently undulating clay vale or plain . Steep slopes are virtually absent , streams are many and rivers and their immediately associated features form the most noticeable landforms . It is worth bearing in mind that not only is clay a weak rock , but that also its impervious nature retains on the surface most of the rain that falls on it , so that the effect of running water is at a maximum . Granite too is relatively impervious but its strength is vastly different from that of clay . THE LAKE DISTRICT The old rocks exposed in the Lake District dome provide striking illustrations of the influence of rock upon scenery : in the north the Skiddaw Slates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine-grained , and in the south the Silurian grits and shales forming milder country . Compare Fig. 87 showing Skiddaw , with Fig. 88 showing the central area ( Figs. 71 , 72 and 80 also illustrate the Slates and Figs. 68 and 123 the Borrowdales ) . The slate is more easily shattered and weathers into smoother outlines , whereas the varied , hard and craggy rocks derived from ancient vulcanism give a knobbly appearance both in detail and in the distant skyline . Needless to say all the famous climbs of the Lakes are in the latter area . A GEOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS Towards the end of Chapter 8 we discussed the value of the geologist 's classification of rocks to the geographer . Are we not now in a much better position to find a geographical classification of rocks , in other words to decide what it is the geographer wants to know about the rocks of a region ? Since we have not yet discussed the influence of rock on soil or vegetation , we can not deal with all the geographical factors ; but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of view of landforms . The vital factor appears to be rock strength , the aspects of which are admirably sorted out by von Engeln as follows3 : ( a ) Massiveness . A massive rock is one which is homogeneous in texture over large uninterrupted masses and such rocks generally tend to be strong . ( b ) Consolidation . A shale coheres only by compaction and is therefore weak . Other rocks cohere by cementation or in the case of igneous and metamorphic rocks , by fusion and interlocking of crystals and are therefore stronger . ( c ) Composition . Chemical weathering affects different rocks to varying degrees and in particular the solubility of limestone , as we have seen , gives it a particular form of weakness and causes it to develop special features . ( d ) Minute perviousness . Weathering and therefore the production of readily movable rock waste is greatly facilitated by the ready penetration of water into the rock . ( e ) Gross perviousness . All consolidated rocks are to some degree jointed ; the extent to which this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly a rock will be more readily disintegrated if the joints are well marked and closely spaced than if the opposite is the case . The occurrence of fault planes similarly accelerates weathering . It may be along some lines such as these that the student of landforms would wish to classify his rocks . THE EFFECT OF BUILD ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RIVER SYSTEMS Clearly the pattern of drainage of an area will be much affected by its structure : a dome will tend to have radiating streams , a uniformly tilted slope a series of sub-parallel consequents ( that is streams consequent upon the original uplift ) . If the uplift is considerable and the rocks uniform , each consequent will tend to develop a branching pattern of tributaries , called dendritic or oak-tree-like ( Fig. 89 ) . The development of the pattern is from the simplicity of the original consequents to greater complexity as the development of valley slopes gives rise to more and more tributaries ; and then back to greater simplicity once more as in the later stages of the landscape cycle the valleys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . One of the tasks of the student of physical geography may be to ascertain what is called the degree of dissection ' or drainage texture ' in the area of study . In the past rather subjective judgments were given under a series of headings such as fine-texture ' , open-texture ' and so on , to show the number of streams draining an area . You can read in Dury4 how a simple statistical technique devised by Horton5 eliminates any subjective error of judgment in this matter . The method , as summarised by Dury , is that to calculate drainage density , the total length of the streams is divided by the area drained by those streams . This is a good example of how simple statistical techniques can help to make descriptive geomorphology more objective . DEVELOPMENT OF SCARPLAND RELIEF Where varied rocks form the uplifted slope , a very characteristic rectangular pattern of drainage develops ( Fig. 90 ) often called trellised or espalier or Wealden . With this stream pattern is associated scarpland relief , as for example in south-east and eastern England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concave profile of the youthful consequents to the slope and thickness of the strata of varying resistance ( Fig. 91 ) . Supposing a resistant bed to be uppermost , the vital point is that the concavity of profile exposes the underlying weaker bed along a central section , giving an elliptical inlier , the narrow axis of which is picked out by subsequent tributaries which tend to run in at right angles to the consequent and which rapidly develop their valleys owing to the weakness of the bed upon which they are working . A valley running parallel to the strike of a dipping bed , as these subsequents are , tends to migrate in the direction of dip and by thus cutting more strongly against the dip-ward side of its valley , to develop an asymmetrical cross-section , steeper on the dip side and gentler on the side which is parallel with the dip of the strata ( Fig. 92 ) . The whole valley moves in the direction of dip in a process called uniclinal or homoclinal shifting . Thus while the consequent streams are developing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or subsequent streams give rise to erosion scarps along the upper edges of the hard bed and cause the retreat of the escarpments in the direction of dip . The upper parts of the hard bed may be expected rapidly to disappear owing to their greater height and the greater steepness of the streams attacking them . As in the English scarplands , the alternation of several strong and weak beds will give rise to more than one escarpment ; tributaries of the subsequents will then tend to develop down the dip slopes of the underlying hard bed ( resequent or subconsequent ) , and also down the scarp face in an anti-dip direction ( obsequent ) . The northwardflowing streams in Fig. 90 are of this type . The dipward retreat of the erosion scarps will necessarily decrease their height , so that the upland blocks or cuestas between the consequents will eventually be lowered and finally disappear when the whole area has been reduced to a lowland in which the alternating strong and weak beds will form parallel belts . The development of the scarpland landscape of south-eastern England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the school of denudation chronology . It is Structure , Surface and Drainage in South-Eastern England , by Wooldridge and Linton.6 STRONGLY FOLDED STRATA So far we have considered a single slope only ; if we turn to a series of close parallel folds , we shall find that two types of original consequents will occur , namely those longitudinally along the troughs of the synclines and in the direction of the pitch of the folds , and those transversely down the limbs of the anticlines . Subsequent tributaries to the latter , in the direction of strike , will occur on the slopes of the anticlines and develop in the manner of scarpland relief ; but the most vital factor is the opening up of strike valleys on the crests of the anticlines . This is a feature hard to accept perhaps ; but examples can so readily be found that you will have to try to visualise how this can happen . The anticlinal vale is generally canoeshaped , having scarped edges overlooking it from all sides , breached only where the transverse consequent drains the pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe ( Fig. 93 ) . The greater height of the anticlines above the local base-level of erosion would naturally lead to their destruction being more rapid than that of the lower synclines ; and headward erosion of the transverse consequents may be expected to open up an underlying weaker bed upon which the subsequent strike streams can act rapidly . The lowering of the anticlinal vales , helped presumably by the relative structural weakness of the upfolds compared with the downfolds , will eventually direct the main drainage to them and they will be lowered and widened until the synclines become the ridges ( Fig. 94 ) . This is inversion of relief ' ; and inverted relief , as for example in the Appalachians , is in practice much more common than what may seem the more normal relation of upfolds to ridges and downfolds to vales , as in the Jura . Carter gives a good example of a canoe ' , which is an eastward continuation of the anticline marked by the Vale of Pewsey.7 A further consideration of some examples of the relation of structure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATTERNS A drainage pattern may persist longer than the rocks whose build gave rise to it ; that is , it may be superimposed upon rocks whose structure is not in accordance with the pattern . The radial drainage of the Lake District is superimposed from the earlier dome of newer and now eroded rocks , on to older rocks whose anticlinal axis and outcrops trend north-east ? south-west . The youthful streams of South Wales across the now exposed east ? west syncline of the coal measures , and the Clifton Gorge section of the Bristol Avon are other examples of superimposition . You can follow these up in Wooldridge and Morgans Certain rivers , on the other hand , have courses which are older than the build of the region they traverse ; if local uplift occurs across a strong river 's course and the river succeeds in maintaining its course , the drainage is antecedent . Generally , the part of the valley concerned will be gorge-like , as in the case of the Columbia through the Cascade Mountains . RIVER CAPTURE The drainage pattern of a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is by the diversion of part of one drainage system to another more powerful system . Divides , which become increasingly well defined as maturity is approached , tend to migrate owing to the different rates at which neighbouring streams are corrading their beds . The stronger of two main rivers , by degrading its bed more rapidly , will lower the base-levels of its tributaries more rapidly than those of the tributaries of the adjoining river are lowered . The steeper profile of these tributaries of the stronger stream will cause more rapid degradation along their beds and thus more headward erosion . The last is a vital point , for it is by means of this headward erosion that the valley of an adjoining tributary of the weaker stream is encroached upon ; and finally the upper part of the weaker system is diverted via the captured tributary to the drainage basin of the stronger main stream . There are at least three corollaries to this process : the beheaded stream probably becomes a misfit , a stream in a valley too large for it ; a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious stream ; and a dry or nearly dry gap occurs between the diverted headwaters and the beheaded river . Do not jump to the conclusion that any apparent elbow ' in drainage pattern shown on a map is sufficient evidence of river capture ; corroboration in the field by other evidence is essential . Dury has emphasised the importance of field work in the examination and description of examples of river capture , since errors of judgment have been made in the past through too much reliance on maps.9 A classic ( and true ) example is the Meuse-Moselle capture , with its elbow at Tout and rail and canal using the gap once followed by the upper Meuse , now diverted to the Moselle.i ? Scarpland relief such as this often shows examples of capture , but capture is liable to occur wherever main streams of markedly different powers of degradation adjoin one another . An example is given in Fig. 95 of the beheading of the Pierce How Beck by the Yewdale Beck , a swifter and more powerful stream which has captured the Tilberthwaite Gill . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter1I ) or the Feshie ( in Garnetti 2 ) . CHANGES OF BASE-LEVEL Relative changes of sea-level ( whether the land or the sea has altered its level is immaterial for the moment ) have a marked effect on valley development . The drowning of the lower parts of a river valley , giving the estuaries and rias so common around our coasts , is often followed by the silting up of the lower part of the drowned valley , as in the case of the lower flood plains of rivers such as the Teign and the Otter in south-east Devon , or the Sussex Ouse . A relative rise of the land , that is a lowering of the river 's base level , steepens the river 's profile , a change called rejuvenation ; and a new graded profile must be developed from the mouth headwards , though parts of the previous and perhaps graded profile may remain for a while in the upper course of the river or of its tributaries . Sufficiently rapid uplift will allow the meanders of the old river to be ' incised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingrown ' if more slowly uplifted so that some opening-up of the valley cross-section can take place at the same time . We shall follow an example of this in the next chapter . The effect of a relative lowering of sea-level upon a river which has already developed a flood plain will be that the swing of the meanders at the new lower level will gradually destroy the old flood plain ; but before this process is complete , remnants of the old flood plain will remain as river terraces above the newly developing flood plain . The lower Thames valley , for example , has two clearly distinguishable terrace levels , the 50-foot or Taplow terrace , and the 100-foot , or Boyn Hill terrace.13 But you must visualise these in plan as discontinuous remnants , not as continuous parallel belts on either side ; for in many places the swing of the river at the new level has completely destroyed the old plain . River terraces frequently have much geographical significance , for they provide fertile alluvial material safely above the flood level . There are really many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple one ; Cotton " will soon convince you of this . We have taken some account of the influence of variety of rock and of build upon the development of landforms ; but we must allow that , in the end , process asserts its supremacy over structure when the final stage , the peneplain , is reached . TYPES OF RELIEF We are now perhaps in a position to conclude this systematic and very generalised survey of normal ' landscape by considering methods of classifying the many kinds of relief which we have met . First , a warning : the geographer who seeks a classification of say mountains or plains , should not really start with a theoretical division of them based on some system of geology or geomorphology , and then try to find examples to fit his scheme ; he should collect the examples from his knowledge of the continents and then attempt to sort them out . In doing so , one might suggest that the famous Davisian dictum may form a useful guide , in view of what we have seen already of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , stage interact to determine the landforms . It will be profitable now for you to set to work on some such group as mountains or plains and arrive at your own classification . As a starting point for discussion , here is a summary of von Engeln 's classification15 of what he calls GEOMORPHIC UNITS I. Simple structures A. Weak sediments , generally horizontal and layered : 1 . Coastal plains ( marine sediments ) ; 2 . Piedmont plains ( subaerial deposition ) ; // 3 . Tundra plain ; 4 .

BOOKS There are a few books , one or more of which must be your standby for reference in the study of landforms . Wooldridge and Morgan 's An Outline of Geomorphology16 is written rather more from the geographical point of view than Holmes 's Principles of Physical Geology17 ; both are very well done and the latter particularly lavishly illustrated . Cotton has a Geomorphology18 which was originally Part 1 of a work on New Zealand , of which the first part was systematic and general and the second was to have been regional . It has been reprinted and covers the whole field of the subject . His Landscape19 on the other hand deals only with ' normal ' erosion , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wind erosion ) and Volcanoes2l ; the three books are very detailed and may be regarded as authoritative , bearing in mind the new ideas and research published since they were written . They are not easy reading . Professor Steers has edited a revised and enlarged version of an early and widely used textbook , by Lake.22 Two comprehensive textbooks , rather less detailed than Holmes , or Wooldridge and Morgan , are by Horrocks , 23 and by Monkhouse , 24 while two recent books , containing some indication of the latest developments in geomorphology , and particularly of the results of quantitative study , are those by Sparks25 and Dury.26 There are several American hooks27 of which von Engeln is in many ways very refreshing , and Strahler up to date . An advanced book on methods of study is Techniques in Geomorphology , 28 by Cuchlaine A. M. King , which deals with field , laboratory and statistical techniques . Any of these books will give you further references if you want them . All the time , however , one is conscious of the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject and of the need for seeing the landscape whole , human aspects as well as physical . In other words , you must keep returning to examples of the way in which these landform factors we have dealt with react upon the rest of the geographical complex in specific regions . The next chapter attempts a few examples which you must supplement yourself . The Hastings Beds which form the central hilly area of the Weald between Horsham and Hastings consist of the Tunbridge Wells Sand , the Wadhurst Clay and the Ashdown Sand , the last being the oldest of the series . Although generally anticlinal in structure , these beds are much faulted and show many minor flexures ; there is in fact no single central anticlinal axis in the Weald . Streams are closely adjusted to structure but the complex details of geology have little effect upon relief , the variety of which is to a great extent the expression of stage . The highest part of these Forest Ridges ' are plateau-like , flattish or gently rounded country 500 feet to over 700 feet in height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of youthful valleys , known locally as gills ' ; narrow , steep-sided and with a steep long profile which flattens sharply lower down . The interfluves are rounded or flattish and much wider than the valleys . it is with this relief type that we are here concerned ( Fig. 96 ) . It may be worth noting that below this zone , on both flanks of the Ridges , the valleys are in early maturity , being broader but still with fairly steep slopes ; while lower still , the Hastings Beds relate to a zone of more subdued relief , well on in maturity , with a general absence of steep slopes , though by comparison with the Weald Clay vales adjoining it , appearing moderately hilly . The contours of Fig. 96 will show you the youthfulness of the valleys in the area with which we are dealing , though one must add that their slopes are often irregular , with rock masses outcropping in small vertical sections and a steep and generally loose surface between these . Such slopes are obviously useless to the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they therefore retain their natural woodland or its planted successor . On the other hand , the higher slopes and spur-crests are cultivable , though their sandy soils are not highly attractive . At its best therefore this higher land is under mixed corn and fodder crops , with dairy cattle on most farms and a few bullocks on some ; at its worst , the little steep fields , before the war , were used only for poultry or were falling back into scrub and thence forest through sheer undercultivation . The farmer avoids the youthful valleys ; so therefore do the villages and the roads ; only an occasional water-mill forms an exception . We have therefore the relatively high villages of Ardingly and Balcombe and a general ridge pattern to the roads . The railway is a different matter ; but the really youthful valleys are of little use to either , and it avoids this type of country as far as possible . ( See also Fig. 39 , p. 62. ) 2 . FLOOD PLAIN AND INVERTED RELIEF : THE SUSSEX OUSE AND CABURN Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district , which we spoke of earlier in Chapter 7 ( Fig. 55 above , p. 82 ) . The isolation of the Caburn mass is unique in the South Down region and forms a small example of inverted relief . An anticlinal flexure whose axis lies roughly east ? west through Kingston brought the soft Gault clay high enough to be reached by the Ouse , thus giving rise to the abnormally broad vale of The Brooks ' and to the Glynde Reach gap ; while the Caburn mass to the north is synclinal in structure ( Fig. 98 ) .1 The whole Ouse plain was drowned by the sea to above Lewes , and subsequently refilled by the alluvium now forming the surface in the flat area with its many straight drainage channels . The inversion of relief in relation to these flexures therefore accounts for the unusual arrangement of hill and plain in this particular watergap through the chalk hills . You will readily see the influence of this upon human affairs . Lewes commands the narrowest crossing of the Ouse flood plain , naturally approached by roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spur on which the Castle stands falls steeply on the north and east to the Ouse plain and on the south to the Winterbourne valley ; it was vulnerable only from the northwest , where on the chalk slopes the battle took place in 1264 . From Domesday till now , the land use of this area has reflected the physical variety : the Down , rough grazing ; the scarpfoot slope of chalk , good arable land ; the flat plain , damp pasture . The line of nucleated villages along the west flank of the broad plain marks the arable land once ploughed in open-field strips around each manor , and still yielding good crops of corn to-day . At Glynde , where John Ellman bred the now famous Southdown sheep , the pattern of land use he employed in the 1780s held until recent years : the sheep up on the Down by day , folded on the arable of the lower slopes by night . But the alluvial grazings are now drained and these scarp-foot farms now have dairy cattle as one of their main interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverted relief upon communications is obvious from the map ; the roads chose lower slopes , where the cultivable soils determined that the villages should be sited , while the railway preferred the flat plain . You will find further details of these two areas of Sussex in the County report2 of the Land Utilisation Survey ; and in making studies of your own you will always find the appropriate Report valuable . 3 . LIMESTONE AND GRIT MOORLANDS IN NORTH DERBYSHIRE The area covered by the map in Fig. 99 and shown in Fig. 99 ( a ) illustrates the influence of rock strength ( including chemical composition ) upon landscape . Three chief types of country occur . In the north , the resistant millstone grit caps the softer shales and gives a very flat-topped plateau surface reaching over 2,000 feet , the edge of which is always very steep and in many places precipitous . The top is a maze of black peat hollows and bilberry moor , poorly drained by numbers of small streams ( Fig. 67 , above , p. 105 ) which join to precipitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys called cloughs . The slopes to the Vales are very unstable , strewn with boulders and loose rock waste , carrying bracken and grass on the lower parts . The second type of country , the Vales of Edale and Hope ( or Castleton ) and their slopes , relates to the weaker shales , shale-grits and limestone shales which occur below the grit . The influence of these rocks upon relief is obvious from the map ; notice how the opening up of the two vales is destroying the Mam Tor ? Lose Hill ridge , composed of shale-grit ( see Fig. 99 ( a ) , and Fig. 70 , above , p. 107 ) . South of a line running ENE. by N. through Giant 's Hole , the resistant grey-white limestone gives rise to a plateau reaching over 1,500 feet , which falls very steeply and in places precipitously to the Hope Vale . Contrast this upland with the Kinder Scout ( grit ) plateau in the north : the resistant but soluble limestone has an almost complete absence of surface water , save for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above , p. 124 ) , and many dry valleys , their sides marked by outcrops of the grey-white rock . Steep-sided gorges such as the Winnats notch the steep northern edge . This rounded plateau has some of the finest upland grass in Britain and has also been useful for its mineral veins , in both respects contrasting strongly with the grit moors . The Derbyshire Report3 gives a summary of the land-use of this area by means of the Section in Fig. 100 ( which has been re-drawn ) , to which the following is a key : A. Northern Moors : sheep runs and grouse . Heather , bilberry and cotton grass moor and some rough pasture . B. Vale of Edale . Hay and oats , sheep and stock farms , some dairying . Siliceous grass land , little arable , nardus pasture and moor on slopes . C. Rough pasture and sheep runs . Poor siliceous grassland and moor . D. Vale of Hope . Hay and oats , sheep and stock farms and dairying , wheat occasionally in lowest parts of valley . Hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uthfacing slopes ? well drained . E. and F. The limestone uplands . E. Sheep and stock runs . Limestone grassland , some ash but few trees . F. Lead mines and quarries . Limestone moor and grazing scrub . Obviously settlement is attracted to the vales . The grit moors are uninhabited ; scattered high farms and small villages occur on the limestone upland , the narrow dry gorges being unattractive to settlement . The roads of the limestone also tend to be high and straight . Compare the main road and the railway routes east-west across the upland . The cotton-mill site in the Vale of Edale is also worth noticing . ( The mill closed down in 1934. ) 4 . THE ENTRENCHED MEANDERS OF THE HEREFORDSHIRE WYE How would you carry out a physiographic study of a river basin ? The problem involves the application of field-study and cartographic methods to the general ideas about landforms which we have already covered . A. A. Miller 's paper of the above title in the Geographical Journal4 may be taken as a model study of this type and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than to summarise its contents , that we may look at it here . Study it in greater detail if you can . Part of the area is shown in Figs. 101 and 102 . Briefly , the Wye cuts through the 600-700-foot Forest of Dean plateau in a series of meanders acquired during an earlier senile stage in the river 's evolution , preserved deeply entrenched in the rejuvenated river valley 's The study falls under these headings : 1 . Geological structure . The greatly varying resistance of the rocks fails to account for certain relief features , which are therefore explicable only by their erosional history . 2 . Description of the relief of the Forest of Dean plateau and of the Wye valley , illustrated by photos and by maps on a scale a little smaller than i inch to 1 mile . Summit levels around 900 feet , a plateau surface at 600-700 feet O.D. ( 500 feet above the river ) and remnants of a lower plateau at 350-450 feet O.D. ( 250 feet above the river ) into which the present river is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meander courses , one of which can be seen in the south-east part of the map in Fig. 101. 3 . Study of tributary valleys , with construction of their long profiles. 4 . Study of coastal plateau , with the help of a reconstructed contour map of the former extension of marine platforms , made by interpolating contours between summit heights of the present plateau treated as spot heights ; and a projected profile of the north shore of the Severn estuary ( see above , Fig. 53 , p. 77 ) . 5 . Explanation of the observed features in terms of the evolution of the relief through four stages : ( a ) possible original meander plane : the 900-foot stage ; ( b ) rejuvenation and planation at the Forest of Dean plateau level : 500-foot stage ; ( c ) rejuvenation to present level interrupted at the 250-foot stage ; ( d ) final entrenchment to present base-level . This evolution is confirmed with the help of the tributary stream profiles and a series of cross-sections of the Wye valley itself . 6 . Correlation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other areas . You should compare this study with that of the North Tyne by Peel6 in which essentially similar methods are applied to quite different circumstances . Better still , attempt something of the sort in a simpler fashion yourself . At any rate , it is to be hoped that these few studies will have helped you to develop a sound geographical attitude to the study of landforms , and will have encouraged you to try to put it into practice in a study of your own . The admirable cartography of the Swiss 1/50,000 map enables us , even from the simplified version which forms Fig. 103 , to gain a good idea of many glacial features . The snow which falls on the high steep peaks and ridges slips down to accumulate in snow-fields or neves , of which examples can be seen in the north-west corner of the map . Here the snow begins to be compacted by its own weight into glacial ice , which differs , rather as a snowball does , from ordinary ice . It is slightly flexible rather than brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather remarkable bluish-green in colour . The neve is generally separated from its headwall by a major crevasse , snow-filled in winter , called the bergschrund ; where a sufficient thickness of snow , perhaps 200 feet , has accumulated , a glacier capable of flowing ' downhill is formed . Strictly speaking the ice moves by means of the melting of the ice crystals and the recrystallisation in new positions , in relation to variations of pressure between the grains . Shearing or cracking followed by re-freezing may also help to account for the movement of ice. , Whereas the neve is concave at the surface , a large glacier is generally irregularly convex ; confirm this by reference to the ice contours ( shown in blue on the original map ) . This tongue of ice , as you will see in the case of the Mittelaletschgletscher , does not melt when it reaches the lower limit of permanent snow , but just as the compressed snowball outlives the thaw , so the glacier flows on to a lower level . You should bring in here some details from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination of glaciers , noting particularly any relation of these to aspect and differences in precipitation totals . New Zealand will give you a good start in this . Data about speed are more difficult to find ; the Tasman glacier ( N.Z. ) moves rapidly at 2 feet per day in the centre and a few inches per day at the sides.2 You will see from the map that the surface of the glacier carries trails of rock waste which have fallen on to it from frost-riven slopes or peaks past which the ice has moved . Lateral moraines lie next to the rock wall ; where two glaciers converge , the inner lateral morains coalesce to form a medial moraine , as in the case of the 153 clear lines of rock waste on the Great Aletsch glacier in the centre . Such medial moraines , however , may also originate from isolated peaks protruding through the neve or the glacier . Irregularities of slope and movement cause a glacier to crack , giving the crevasses which on the Swiss map are shown in blue . A steep break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of a series of pinnacles or seracs . A small example of this can be seen where the Mittelaletsch glacier joins the Great Aletsch ; there is naturally a large accumulation of morainic debris here , since the medial and lateral moraines of the smaller glacier are dumped on to the lateral moraine of the larger . The ice begins to melt long before the termination or snout ' of the glacier is reached , so that the ice tongue becomes thinner and narrower . A sizeable stream flows out of the ice-cave at the foot of the snout . Fig. 104 should help you to visualise the surface features of an Alpine glacier . Even from the limited area shown in our map , you will see that there is a great variety in the size of mountain glaciers ; everything between the snowpatch , via the small hanging valley or corrie glacier to the major glacier many miles in length is to be found . All these valley glaciers ( or mountain glaciers ) are to be distinguished from the ice-sheets , exemplified in Greenland or Antarctica on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers in Iceland and Spitzbergen . The new maps of parts of the Antarctic on a scale of 1 : 25,000 , produced by the Falkland Islands Dependency Survey , and published by the Directorate of Overseas Survey , show the main surface features of an area covered by a sheet of ice , and will repay study . The whole land mass , or all except a few great peaks , is ice-covered . Ice-sheets of this type invaded northern Europe and most of Britain during the four glaciations of the Quaternary Ice Age . The piedmont glacier , formed by the fanning out and coalescence of valley glaciers as they emerge from confining mountain walls , is an intermediate type exemplified in the Alaskan Malaspina glacier . The influence of glacial ice on the landscape is thus active over considerable areas at the present time and has in the past been effective over much larger areas . Let us consider the results . GLACIAL EROSION This paragraph heading itself raises a controversy , or at least the echo of one , for at one time the protagonists of glacial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erosion . Neither denied that a glacier modified the valley which it occupied ; the real point at issue was the relative effectiveness of ice compared with running water in deepening a pre-existing valley . While each side has contributed something to present views on the subject , the erosionists certainly carry most weight to-day : Cotton in Climatic Accidents and the American geomorphologists generally are firmly erosionist , though the discussion in Wooldridge and Morgan3 is less conclusive . You may follow up the controversy with the help of some of the references at the end of the chapter.4 The erosionists would regard the erosive power of ice as increasing with its thickness ; and thus a thin glacier or still more a body of dead ' ice will be relatively protective to the area it covers , compared with the power of river erosion , a point which meets some of the protectionist claims . On the other hand , the depth of some lake rock basins , as for example in the Lake District , where the bottom of Wastwater is 50 feet below sea-level , seems a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , the effects of glacial erosion are to be seen in mountains and those of glacial deposition in plains , though both effects occur to some degree in both areas . Although the scratching and wearing action of rocks gripped in the ice has some effect , the principal erosive power of a glacier appears to depend upon a kind of plucking action ; in this , alternate freezing and thawing , occurring where the ice is in contact with the rock over or beside which it is moving , causes rock fragments to break off and be carried away by the glacier . The principal results of the past glaciation of a mountainous area are these ( the photograph in Fig. 105 will bear close examination in this connection ) : ( a ) Cirques or Corries . The valley head occupied by the neve is transformed by the sapping of the headwall into a sort of armchair shape , steep at back and sides , with a flattish or hollowed floor ( compare Fig. 123 , below , p. 193 ) . The way in which cirques are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early theories was that the headward cutting and steepening of the back of the cirque was due to freeze-thaw plucking in the lower parts of the bergschrund , but it has been shown that these crevasses do not always reach to the base of the cirque , and that differences in temperature vary at the present time only between 30 ? and 32 ? F ( ? 1 ? and 0 ? C ) . It is now more generally accepted that plucking , even without accompanying freeze-thaw , may take place over a large area of the back wall of the cirque , and not necessarily dominantly at the base of the bergschrund . You can follow this up in Sparks , 5 who also gives references for the main viewpoints . Where only a cirque glacier existed , a steep valley headwall of stream erosion occurs below the cirque ( Fig. 106 ) . The convergence of several neves to form a large valley glacier commonly leads to a steep trough headwall , below the cirques , where the much greater thickness of ice has cut more deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountain with cirques on all sides , the peak will clearly be eaten back into , so that a very steep horn of the Matterhorn type results , with shoulders reduced to knife-edge ridges called aretes ( Fig. 107 ) . ( c ) U-shaped valleys . The major steep-sided , broad- and roundedfloored valley is universally regarded as the product of a large valley glacier . It would appear that the transformation of a stream . valley into a U-shaped trough involves some down-cutting by the oncoming ice ( Fig. 108 ) ; and in any case it seems unlikely that a glacier would have the power to erode the sides of its valley , where the ice-pressure is less , and not the floor of its valley , where the pressure must be so much greater . The glacial trough tends to be much straighter than a youthful stream valley and often shows truncated spurs , on the bare rock of some of which the striae ' or scratches made by rock held in the moving ice may sometimes be seen . The long-profile of the trough is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string of paternoster ' lakes results . This stepped profile and the occurrence of rock bars across the valley formed a strong part of the protectionist case , since it appeared possible to relate the steps to the successive glaciations and the stream erosion of the interglacial periods of the Quaternary Ice Age in the Alps . Any general theory seems to meet difficulty in accounting for these features and it may well be that the variety of possible factors involved , such as differences of rock hardness , confluence of tributary glaciers , variations in width of valley and thus in thickness of ice , makes it necessary to take each valley separately rather than to expect any generalisation to cover all cases . Not all glacial troughs were formed in pre-glacial river valleys . D. L. Linton has recognised four main types of trough in a classification which he devised according to pre-glacial topography.6 These are summarised below : // Alpine Glaciers modified pre-glacial valleys . Neve fields were always overlooked by higher peaks , e.g. the Ullswater valley and its tributaries . Icelandic Ice accumulated on high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys dissecting the plateau . Examples quoted in Norway and Scotland . Composite Where there were no suitably orientated pre-glacial valleys , the ice created new troughs sometimes following parts of earlier valleys . Example given in the Cairngorms . Intrusive Where troughs were made by lobes of ice being thrust against high land . Examples given in Scotland . You should study Linton 's paper , and follow up the examples he gives , referring to topographical maps of the areas . Hanging valleys . Tributary valleys often hang ' discordantly above the main trough ; according to the erosionist , because of the greater thickness of ice in the main valley ; according to the pro-tectionist because they retained ( protective ) glaciers while stream erosion was at work on the lower ice-free main valley . Roches moutonnees . These rounded rock masses , smoother and gentler on the onset side , rougher and steeper on the leeside , and elongated in the direction of ice-advance , are a common product of differential glacial erosion ( Fig. 109 ) . Their occurrence can not always be related to differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pressure of the ice.7 Alps . An Alpine valley commonly has somewhat the shape shown in Fig. 110 . The U-shaped trough is thus separated from the peaks which protruded as nunataks ' above the Quarternary ice-sheet by a gently sloping shelf ' called the alp or alb . It may well be that the maximum glaciation caused the great U-shape of which the alp is a remnant and that the present glacial trough represents the modification of a stream valley cut into the larger trough.8 One may regard the effect of an ice-sheet upon mountain valleys as being similar to that of valley glaciers , since the ice-thickness would be greater in the valleys ; an ice-sheet would smooth and round the whole surface it covered , whereas valley glaciers by them-selves would leave intervening ridges and peaks of sharp , frost-eroded relief . ( a ) Terminal moraine . Material which has fallen on to or been worn away by the glacier and which has been carried to its snout will clearly be dumped in front of this position . In the case of a valley glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of an ice-sheet , it will form a long moraine belt . The material is coarse and irregular in size and shape and , in the case of a terminal moraine still in process of active deposition , gives the appearance of a belt untidily littered with rock-debris ( Fig. 111 ) . Relatively small fluctuations in the position of the ice-margin will cause the ice alternately to fall behind and to override its own terminal moraine , // which thus may increase in width and gain a height much greater than that of the ice-front . The irregular knob-and-kettle ' topography of a large moraine belt relates also to the inclusion in the moraine of blocks of dead ice which subsequently melt , leaving kettle-holes which may become lakes ( Fig. 112 ) . ( b ) Ground moraine consists of fine material eroded at the ice-base and partly extruded beneath the ice-front , partly plastered on the ground below the ice behind the front , and forming at any rate part of the glacial drift left behind by retreating ice . This material also contains rock fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , and is thus called boulder-clay . A common form of its deposition is the drumlin , a long low whale-back of a hill , steeper at the onset end and tapering to a low narrow point at the lee end . Drumlins often occur in extensive fields composed of a great number of similarly aligned units . Isolated masses of resistant rock may protrude through glacial drift and protect the accumulation of boulder clay in their lee ; this crag-and-tail ' feature is common in Central Scotland . Boulder clay , the commonest result of the past // glaciation of a lowland area , is variable in character in relation to the kind of rocks from which it originated , and is also commonly intercalated with gravels and sands deposited in water . Both the streams of inter- and post-glacial times , and the melt water of the ice itself , play an important part in determining the character of what may be called ( c ) Fluvio-glacial deposits . A sizeable stream , milky with the fine material it already carries , flows out from the ice-cave at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal moraine , forming a gap which is widened by the post-glacial stream . Sandy material is continually washed out from the terminal moraine , forming an outwash fan ( in the case of a valley glacier ) or sheet . These outwash sands may be rather coarse and infertile . Since the glacier begins to melt far above its final terminus , the melt water flows in or below the ice for some distance . Moreover , the water may be under pressure and able to move somewhat uphill as well as down . A subglacial channel of this type is liable to become choked with sandy waste and leaves its mark on the post-glacial lowland in the form of an esker , a sinuous sandy ridge often unrelated to the other relief features and drainage . A heavily-loaded stream on emerging from the ice-front is likely to deposit a quantity of water-sorted material as a kame , somewhat in the form of a piled-up delta with a steep front next to the ice . A long esker may terminate in a kame ; or a kame moraine may largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciation of an area has frequently resulted in local diversions of pre-glacial drainage , due to such factors as the blocking of valleys by drift or the cutting of new channels where ice lobes filled the former valley . A particularly important form of drainage modification is the occurrence of lakes impounded between the ice margin and neighbouring upland . The effect of these upon the postglacial relief constitutes the evidence from which the existence of these lakes may be deduced ; the chief types of evidence adduced by Kendall in his classic paper on north-east Yorkshire9 are as follows : 1 . Beaches . The shore-line of an ancient lake may be clearly distinguishable , as for example in the case of Lake Bonneville , of which the Great Salt Lake of Utah is a remnant , or in the parallel roads ' of Glen Roy . 2 . Deltas relating to the inflow of a former channel into the proglacial lake . 3 . Floor-deposits . Such lacustrine deposits are generally fertile , as in the case of the bed of the ancient Lake Agassiz which forms the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These deposits may be distinguished from river alluvium by the unevenness of the surfaces on which they lie . 4 . Abandoned overflow channels . These Kendall subdivides : ( a ) direct overflows across a main watershed ; ( b ) severed spurs , where the drainage of minor valleys has been carried across spurs of the main watershed'lo ; ( c ) marginal overflows , channels or gorges cut in the hillside , often in aligned sequence across several spurs , or in parallel sequence at several levels on the same spur or spurs ; ( d ) in-and-out channels , crescentic valleys excavated in the face of a hill by water flowing round a projecting lobe of ice ' .11 Kendall of course follows up these generalisations by a long and fascinating consideration of the details of his area , illustrated by photos , maps and cross-sections . You will find a full summary of his work in Wooldridge and Morgan ' 2 ; much subsequent work on proglacial lakes in England has also been done . NI V ATION You will realise that when the Quaternary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have experienced tundra conditions . Such a point can not be left out of account in considering the features of the area and it is evident that the hilly areas must have had much snow for a great deal of the year , which would provide large quantities of melt water during a short summer . The freeze and thaw process we have met in connection with cirque formation may be expected to have been at work in areas of snow accumulation , and indeed has been thus observed in areas of persistent but not permanent snow accumulation at the present time . Moreover , the summer thaw would allow the downhill sludging of vast masses of lossened rock waste lubricated by snow and melt water . The Coombe rock of many South Down valleys undoubtedly originates in this way . The steepheaded , deeply cut coombs themselves have been affected by this same process , to which the term nivation is given . This compressed account of glaciation is badly short of reference to actual examples . You must fill the gap by working on some specific areas and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have made . An easy start would be on the One-Inch of Snowdonia or the Lake District , or the Cairngorms sheet published by the Geographical Association.13 The features of glacial deposition are much less susceptible to analysis on a topographical map and you will need to find some details of an area such as one of the drift-covered lowlands of eastern England ; the appropriate County Report of the Land Utilisation Survey is probably the best beginning . Let us conclude by looking briefly at the geography of two areas greatly affected by past glaciation. 1 . TRANSHUMANCE IN THE VAL DE RECHY14 ( VALAIS , SWITZERLAND ) The general pattern of Swiss Alpine farming , conditioned by the character of the glaciated landscape , is well known : the cultivated valley floor , the forested steep slopes , the summer pasture of the alp below the rock slopes or permanent snow . The seasonal movement of animals and men to the pastures which are snow-free only in summer ( the alpages ' ) is transhumance ' ( Fig. 113 ) . This normal pattern of physical background and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'Herens on the south side of the Rhone trench in the Valais ; between these two valleys lies the Val de Rechy , whose physical character is such that its utilisation is quite exceptional ; it is devoted entirely to the summer migration and is uninhabited in winter . You can follow a detailed example of more normal transhumance in Unstead 's paper on the Lotschental15 ; and since you are probably already familiar with this general system , it may be of greater interest here to follow the effect of less common conditions , which nevertheless result from past glaciation and thus serve to illustrate its influence upon human geography . The Val de Rechy is about seven miles long and some two miles across , from crest to crest ; it faces north . Its upper part is shut in by high and steep cirque walls , below which rocky slopes lead down to summer grass on the gentler slopes and cirque floors . Its lower half has no steep crest and its steep slopes are largely wooded ; but grassland occurs on rounded shoulders and gentler slopes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as water disappears into the pebbly or boulder-strewn slopes ; indeed it is necessary to divert water from the Reche via irrigation canals to supply the cultivated fields of the Rhone valley sides , for precipitation here is low . Steepness and lack of soil prevent the cultivation of the lower part of the Val de Rechy : but also the narrowness and northerly aspect of the whole valley greatly reduce the hours of sun and increase the length of the winter . The valley thus becomes simply summer pasture belonging to the three communes of Chalais , Grone and Nax ( Fig. 114 ) . The annual migration is in stages : in May , to the mayens ' ( May pastures ) at about 1,500 metres ; towards the end of June , to the lower alpages ' and shortly on to the highest pastures at the beginning of July . The return begins in August and by the second half of September the mayens ' are reached again and by the end of the month the Val de Redly is snow covered and uninhabited once more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of a glaciated valley , with its convergent cirques and stepped profile ; these summer pastures belong to Nax , whose cattle reach them by a col at 2,528 metres between Mont Gautier and Mont Noble . Nax itself lies on the lower slopes of the neighbouring Val d'Herens , with its cultivated fields around it . Grone has the middle slopes of the valley , while the summer pastures of Chalais lie across the north-eastern shoulder . Both Grone and Chalais and their cultivated lands lie in the Rhone valley ; each of these two communes also has small ( permanent ) villages on terraces above the valley , as you may see on the sketch map ( Fig. 114 ) . Itravers mill forms the highest permanent habitation in the Val de Rechy at about 930 metres ; but the Swiss 1/50,000 will mark a number of buildings in this and other valleys , which are used in summer only . 2 . GLACIAL DRIFT IN NORTH-EAST YORKSHIRE This provides us with examples of the effect of both the glaciation of a lowland and the occurrence of pro-glacial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ( Fig. 115 ) includes that of Kendall 's famous study mentioned above ( p. 164 ) ; the account which follows is based on this and upon the North Riding County Report by S. W. Wooldridge.16 The area , whose chief physical regions are shown in Fig. 115 , was invaded by ice from the Pennines , from the north and from the North Sea . The effect of the northern ice was to impound melt water and drainage from the high moors ( which were not ice-covered ) between the ice-front and the hills , thus forming a series of pro-glacial lakes in the Eskdale region . Since ice blocked their outlet to the sea , they overflowed across the moors , cutting the Newton Dale , into the Vale of Pickering . The natural outlet of this structural vale eastwards being blocked by ice and the fault trough between the Hambleton and Howardian Hills being similarly sealed , the Vale became a lake whose outlet cut what we now call the Kirkham Abbey gorge . Although these facts are well established , they represent only the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its glacial history is actually very complex . Ground moraine ( boulder clay ) covers the areas north and east of the moors and flanks both sides of the Vale of York . Stages in the retreat of the Vale of York ice have left a lake-plain behind , i.e. north of the York moraine , and a central area of moraines and outwash sands north of this ( Fig. 116 ) . The effect of these varieties of drift upon present land-use is by no means clear-cut ; the boulder clays are more sandy than those of East Anglia and striking contrasts between the land-use of the chief types of drift do not occur . Nevertheless soils of glacial origin form the physical basis of farming in this area and give rise to variations which may be summarised ( and necessarily simplified ) as follows : You will see that the influence of glaciation on the physical and human geography of this area is strong . While the contrasts between the land use of the different types of drift are not complete , yet it is clear that the boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the lacustrine and sandy soils , together with the corallian limestone slopes , have more arable . A limited contrast of this kind illustrates geographical conditions which are probably more common than those which provide a very striking contrast . It remains to notice that the details of the pro-glacial drainage have strongly influenced the communications of the area . From Eskdale to the Vale of Pickering the railway follows closely the deeply-cut overflow channel of which Newton Dale is part and which forms the only low through-route across the Moors ( except next to the coast ) . Where the glacial stream debouched into Lake Pickering it formed a gravelly delta on which the town of Pickering is sited . Again on the south side of the Vale , the railway closely follows the Kirkham Abbey gorge cut by the Pickering overflow . Both road and rail encircle the Vale itself , at the foot of the hills , above the wetter centre of the old lake bed and serving the villages whose sites we have already noticed . The area we have analysed is thus one in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineamentation has been the work , directly and indirectly , of the Quaternary glaciation . The effect of structure on land use and settlement is seen negatively in the Moors and positively in the corallian dipslopes . The varieties of drift have tipped the balance one way or the other between grassland and arable , in areas of essentially mixed farming ; but human influences have reversed this locally , in the high farming of the Cleveland Plain clays and in the failure to drain sufficiently well the otherwise favourable warp of the central part of the Vale of Pickering . Communications in general relate strongly to the whole build of the region and locally and in detail to the indirect effects of glaciation and to the other human aspects of the area . Notice finally that this study has taken no account of the Middlesbrough district or the coastal resorts . BOOKS The book which deals most exhaustively with glaciation as a whole is Cotton 's Climatic Accidents.17 A shorter and simpler book is Gresswell 's Glaciers and Glaciation.18 Apart from these any of the general geomorphology books mentioned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your reading on the subject . The results of much detailed work have been published in the Geographical Journal and other periodicals and there is now a British Glaciological Society with its headquarters at Cambridge . Some of the most important articles appear in the Transactions and Papers of the Institute of British Geographers , but you are not likely to need to consult these detailed papers much beyond those in the references to this chapter . There is a stronger case for your making a study of a glaciated region on the lines of the two in this chapter ; your regional work should suggest possible areas . Davis 's second climatic accident ' , namely arid conditions , affects a very large part of the globe ( estimated by de Martonne as 30% ) for at least part of the year . Yet desert conditions are very remote from our own experience , much more so than glacial conditions , with the results of which at any rate we can readily become familiar . Arid landscapes have been little studied by comparison with those of humid erosion , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is worth turning aside for a moment to look at the question : What is a desert ? There is the climatic definition : less than so many inches of rain per annum or an excess of evaporation over precipitation ; but rainfall is very variable and the average isohyets are an unreliable guide . Shall we say moreover that the cultivated strip beside the Nile is a desert because it has practically no rainfall ? Or we may use vegetation as a defining factor : a desert has no vegetation . This would give us comparatively small deserts ' and leave wide semi-arid areas which have a little vegetation but over which arid erosion is predominant . If on the other hand we regard a discontinuous vegetation cover as indicative of a desert , then our deserts will be large and include areas more usually regarded as scrub or grassland . Moreover , an area such as the poor savana has very little vegetation in the dry season but a great deal more in the wet . Or we may turn to a human definition : a desert is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the Amazon basin and Antarctica are as much deserts as the Sahara . A physical definition which at first appears straightforward would describe a desert as an area in which arid erosion is dominant ; but when looked at more closely , this presents difficulties , for paradoxically water is one of the most important agents of landscape formation in a desert . What criteria are to be used to discover whether arid erosion is dominant in an area ? An attempt has been made to give a physiographic definition of deserts as areas of interior drainage . l This involves regarding rivers such as the Nile and the Indus as exceptions and a closer 174 examination of the world 's deserts indicates that such exceptions are rather too numerous for the definition to be altogether satisfactory . But all such rivers originate outside the deserts through which they pass and may , perhaps , legitimately be regarded as abnormal features , which may be expected to cause variations in the normal course of arid erosion . In general the drainage systems of desert areas are intermittent and consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean as base-level and this characteristic of interior drainage may probably be regarded as typical of areas where arid erosion is dominant . It is useful to distinguish between intermontane desert basins , where the aridity which would in any case result from their continental position is intensified by the rain-shadow effect of the surrounding mountains , and the planetary ' deserts which lie on the west of the land masses , and across the two Tropics . Climatic and vegetation transition zones are wide in the latter case , much more abrupt in the former . The distinction does not quite exhaust all cases : Patagonia , for example , if accepted as a desert , does not fall into either category . You must pursue such points as these and reach your own conclusion ( the climate and vegetation maps in a good atlas will help ) ; we must return to our theme , which will safely exclude the Amazon selvas and the polar ice-caps , namely the effect of arid conditions on the development of landforms . Mechanical weathering of the bare rock surfaces provides large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rapid heating and cooling of the outer layers of rock in a climate notable for its high daily range of temperature . Experiments have shown that this process of disintegration of rock surfaces is most effective where the humidity of the air is high , so that chemical weathering works in combination with mechanical.2 Wind makes use of the finer particles thus provided to abrade the rock surfaces . Upstanding objects are undercut and differences of hardness picked out by the sand-blast , as you will perhaps have seen in photographs of the Sphinx . The abrasive power of the wind is lessened close to the ground by friction , and reaches a maximum a few feet above it ; higher up , the particles which the wind carries are smaller and therefore weaker , The pebbles which litter the surface are abraded also and since in the planetary deserts the wind is relatively constant in direction , they tend to become angular , with flattened surfaces and a three-cornered shape ( ' dreikanter ' ) . Differential wind erosion gives rise in some areas to narrow steep-sided rock ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow wind-swept corridors . Wind is clearly an important transporting agent , but only the finer particles of dust are actually exported from the desert area . Deposition of wind-blown sand provides the dunes which are popularly associated with deserts but which in fact cover only a part of the surface ; the Sahara , for example , is said to have only one-ninth of its area covered by the erg ' or sand dunes.3 Where the individual dunes are continually on the move , as is generally the case ( though the dune area as a whole remains in a relatively constant position ) , the dunes are said to be live ' ; static dunes are generally fixed by some slight growth of vegetation . The crescentic dune or barchan is common , for example , in the Peruvian desert and Turkestan ; it lies at right angles to the prevailing wind , which continually overrolls it forwards . If its tips become fixed by vegetation , its centre may be blown through and the wings transformed into longitudinal dunes lying parallel with the wind , Longitudinal dunes do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any upstanding object . In dune complexes , aligned blow-outs ' sometimes give rise to long sand-free corridors , which are much more common routes than the high dunes across the tops of which Hollywood is so fond of galloping its yelling extras ' . Much of the fine dust blown beyond the desert margins must fall into the sea , but some is deposited on neighbouring land areas , forming the material called loess . In north China ( Fig. 119 ) this reaches thicknessses of several hundred feet , obliterating the former relief and forming a low plateau of buff-coloured , unconsolidated and highly porous deposits , in which the streams and rivers cut deep gorges . The dust originates from the deserts of the Asiatic interior to the west . The term loess is not always used in as narrow a sense as this but is taken by some to cover any deposits in which windblown material is included . Lobeck for example has a world ma showing very extensive areas of loess . Where fluvial action is combined with aeolian ( wind-borne ) deposition and the deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brickearth ' of the lower Thames valley and the Sussex coastal plain is of this type ? it may be difficult to establish aeolian origin . Certain areas in North America regarded by some as Loess ' are not accepted by other students as aeolian at all . It seems clear that wind-blown deposits may be expected to occur to some degree in many semi-arid areas ; but if the rate of deposition is slow , they will form only one constituent of the soils and superficial deposits of the area . It is therefore important for you to visualise these areas of loess ' soil quite differently from the striking topography of the Hwang-ho basin . A rather special case arises in the aeolian deposits of the Rhine valley ( where the term loess was first applied ) and the southern margins of the North European Plain . Here the deposits relate to the southward transport of dust from the bare surfaces of drift exposed between and immediately after the Quaternary glaciations . In other areas , such as parts of the North American plains , similar deposits occur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great thickness , do not suffer from lack of available moisture , as do great areas of the Chinese loess . WATER But let us return to our deserts . Humanly speaking , rain is rare ; but it does occur in heavy and localised downpours . Imagine the surface on which this water falls , a surface littered with loose rock debris of all sizes . The water at first rushes down steep slopes as a sheet flood , carrying with it loose material which eventually chokes its path and into which that part of it which has not evaporated quickly disappears . Similarly streams which at first carve channels in the loose material soon fill these same beds with a pasty mass of material which quickly dries out once more . The desert surface , at any rate outside the dune areas , has many dry channels of this sort , called wadis ' in the Sahara . Since they carry water only briefly and intermittently , they are disconnected and patternless . A wadi gives shelter from the sand-blast but since a sudden rainstorm may turn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems clear that features of this sort were formed in many desert areas during a past climatic period when rainfall was heavier than it is to-day . While it is clear that water is a very important factor in an arid area , its effect in semi-arid lands may be even more striking . In the absence of a continuous vegetation cover , an intense and minute dissection of the surface may occur . The result is badlands ' where innumerable steep-sided gullies and valleys make transportation very difficult and agricultural utilisation impossible . Processes which we have considered separately ? mechanical and chemical weathering , wind erosion and transport , and sheet-flood erosion ? combine to reduce any upstanding rock masses in desert . areas and to give rise to wide expanses of lower and very level rock surface , called in the Sahara hamada ' . At the foot of a fault scarp of such a mass , as for example in the Great Salt Basin , there is often developed a desert pediment , a smooth rock plain thinly covered with gravel . It appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with sheet-flood erosion of waste material ; the break of slope at the upper edge of the gently inclined pediment is very pronounced ( compare Fig. 118 ) . The high and isolated mass continually being reduced in this way will become a convex dome . Some of the semi-arid landscapes of southern Africa are characterised by steep-sided and rounded domes known as inselbergs ' , upon whose origin there is not general agreement . INFLUENCE OF STRUCTURE The numerous features erg and hamada , wadi and pediment ? resulting from erosion and transport by wind and water under arid conditions are geographically disposed in relation to the structure of the area concerned , and certain features bear a close relationship to particular structural patterns . The Sahara is largely plateau-like , with major high areas centrally placed . Let us consider on the other hand an inter-montane basin such as the Turfan basin which Huntington visited.5 The surrounding slopes will be scored by stream
