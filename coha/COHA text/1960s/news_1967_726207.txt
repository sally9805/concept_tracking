txt LONDON , March 19- " Forget for a moment that Svetlana is Stalin 's daughter . " Look upon her instead as a woman who , after a series . of personal disasters , reached 40 ' before she found happiness . " Then , after just two short years , the gentle man who had brought her this happiness died , quite suddenly . He was well off , perhaps even wealthy , and his money went to her . Desire to Get Away " It would be only natural for her , deeply upset , to seek a change in her surroundings , to go someplace completely new , even abroad maybe , with no real plans , only a driving desire to get away . " This was the picture of Svetlana drawn today by friends of her late husband , Brijesh Singh , an Indian who was a prince by birth and a Communist all his adult life .

No one can envy the woman born in the Kremlin in 1925 . Her father , then 46 , had for three years been general secretary of the Communist party . As a young man , son of a Georgian cobbler , Stalin had married in 1903 a peasant girl in Tiflis . He was in prison as a revolutionary when their son , Yasha , was born in 1905 . Two years later Stalin 's wife died . Stalin went in and out of czarist prisons until the revolution in 1917 . In 1919 Stalin went back home to Tiflis a big man . He called on an old neighbor , a locksmith.The neighbor 's daughter , Nedezhda , whom Stalin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 . Stalin took her to Moscow as his wife . They set up house in a three room Kremlin apartment . A son , Vassily , was born in 1921 . Svetlana came four years later . By 1932 Stalin was master of Russia , but the cruelty of his rule appalled his young wife . Suddenly she died . Peritonitis , the official report said . But there were rumors she publicly upbraided Stalin one night and either Stalin killed her in anger or she killed herself in remorse . Vassily was sent to board- , ing school in Leningrad but 1 Svetlana , 7 , remained in the Kremlin with her father . She went to public school No. 25 and learned to play the piano at home . When she said she would like to learn French , her father brought in a tutor . Svetlana was 17 when love struck . She met a war correspondent , Alexei Kapler . He was 28 , married , had a reputation as a philanderer . Svetlana did not tell her father . When Alexei went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reports headed , " Letters to Svetlana .

Then father found out and Alexei was sent to a.Siberim labor camp as an enemy of the people . He stayed there for 12 years , until Stalin 's death . A British friend saw him in Moscow last year . He was making newsreels and film documentaries . Svetlana 's tears on Alexei 's disappearance can easily be imagined . But the Ger man army was pressing on Moscow and the government moved eastward to Kuybyshev . Svetlana went , too . Vassily was already a pilot . By 1945 Svetlana was back in Moscow studying at the university . She met a Jewish student , Grigory Marozov . She told her father they wanted to marry .

One account has Stalin ordering Marozov to Siberia where he disappeared . Another account says Marozov is now professor of law at Moscow university . Has Unhappy Marriage In 1949 Svetlana married the son of Stalin 's heir apparent , Andrei Zhdanov . The marriage was unhappy . Ekaterina may be a daughter of that short union , altho there is an account of another marriage in 1951 to the son of Lazar Kaganovich , commissar for industry . Stalin himself is sometimes said to have married Kaganovich 's sister Rosa . The 1950s brought new sorrow for Svetlana . Stalin died . " Mother suffered much after his tdeath , " young Josef said in Moscow the other day . " She loved him just as anybody loves their father .

Vassily disappeared soon after Stalin 's death , was reported in a sanitorium , and died in 1956 . He had two children . His disintegration troubled Svetiana .
