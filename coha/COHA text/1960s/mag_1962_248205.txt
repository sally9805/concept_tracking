When he turned on the TV set to catch the latest Cuba bulletins before breakfast one morning last week , John Ernst Steinbeck had no inkling that he had won this year 's Nobel Prize for Literature while he slept . At a press conference a few hours later , ruddy-faced , jug-eared and bearded , John Steinbeck muttered that he " got splintered this morning " and still felt " wrapped and shellacked . " Later , with tongue in cheek , he explained that wrapping and shellacking is the standard formula for repairing a cracked goldfish bowl . <P> The award took another kind of shellacking from critics the world over , who have long since written off John Steinbeck 's flawed talent . The author himself confessed that he was unable to explain his reasons for writing novels " because it is so long since I have wondered why . " Steinbeck added : " I guess it 's become like a nervous tic . " <P> People as Pets . Born 60 years ago in northern California 's lush , lettuce-growing Salinas valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , where even the local Snopeses are kind to small animals . At times , the Salinas corn has been as high , if not as dry , as William Saroyan 's young eye ; at others , the view from Steinbeck 's wayward literary bus has resembled Henry Miller 's sex-sodden Tropics , minus the belly laughs . <P> His best-known work , The Grapes of Wrath ( 1939 ) , the bitter saga of the Okies , was powerful as a tract but limited as fiction , scarcely able to survive its time and place . Even in less dated novels . Steinbeck 's characters are not , as Edmund Wilson once wrote , " really quite human beings : they are cunning little living dolls that amuse us as we might be amused by pet guinea pigs , squirrels or rabbits . " <P> The Nobel committee , which pronounced that the chronicler of Cannery Row " more than holds his own " with the " masters of modern American literature , " * cited Steinbeck 's " humor and social perception , " his sympathy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagging powers " in Steinbeck , explained the Swedish Academy 's secretary , Dr. Anders Osterling , his 1961 novel , The Winter of Our Discontent , was a return to " his towering standards . " <P> Trito Travelogue . To U.S. critics , Winter , an allegory of the affluent society , seemed only a thin , high-pitched echo of the early and genuine social protest that filled The Grapes of Wrath . The judges ' decision was also reportedly influenced by Steinbeck 's latest , bestselling Travels with Charley , which manages to recapture the banality , mawkish sentiment and pseudo philosophy that have marked Steinbeck at his worst . <P> One possible reason for crowning Steinbeck was widespread criticism that the prize in recent years has often gone to authors little known outside their own lands . No such charge could be leveled against John Steinbeck , whose books have been translated into 33 foreign languages . Just possibly he reads better in some of them , but Dr. Uno Willers. secretary of the Nobel committee , admitted that criticism of the award had been even heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he thought he deserved the award , shrugged : " Frankly , no .
