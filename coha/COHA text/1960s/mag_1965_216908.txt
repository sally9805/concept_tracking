To purchase , assemble and operate a first-class hi-fi set , a man once had to have the patience of Job , the funds of Croesus and the genius of Edison . In order to find just the right amplifier ( power unit ) , preamplifier ( the one with all those knobs ) , turntable ( where the records spin ) , tuner ( hifi for FM radio ) and speakers , he had to compare the wares of a large range of component part companies , shell out as much as $1,500 , and spend as long as a week hooking all the parts together . The only alternative was a cheap portable phonograph that sounded as tinny with two stereo speakers as it used to with one , or a medium-priced console that was long on looks but short on fidelity . Now , however , great music is coming in more manageable packages . <P> No Sour Notes . At last week 's annual High Fidelity Music Show at Manhattan 's Trade Show Building , there was a raft of compact all-in-one hi-fi units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sour note . With two bookshelf-sized stereo speakers and one compact changer-amplifier unit , the new small-fi 's can fit almost anywhere , be operated by the wife and the kids , and still give Dad the kind of sound that he yearns for . <P> The trend began three years ago when Boston 's KLH , long a big name in hi-fi speakers , put out a $200 portable unit . It could not reach down to pick up the very lowest notes on the organ , but it did reach a market of music lovers who were willing to forgo a few notes to save hundreds of dollars and considerable bother . <P> KLH 's sales immediately doubled , and other hi-fi companies began to follow suit . Shure , EMI-Scope , Fisher and others put out " solid-state " ( transistorized ) portables that looked like luggage when closed , sounded almost like full symphonies when open . Harman-Kardon added an AM-FM radio , managed to cram everything into one chassis to the tune of $399 . KLH 's latest model , the Twenty-Plus , converts both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by placing them on pedestals , covering them with an assortment of fabrics ( $525 ) . <P> The Big Sound . At first , purists cried that hi-fi manufacturers were defying their own philosophy-that turntables had to be separated from speakers and amplifiers so that the tone arm was not shaken from its groove , that amplifiers had to be placed far away from everything because they generated so much heat , and that speakers had to be behemoths to produce a faithful bass . Recent technological developments have changed all that . Good record changers have so many springs and shock absorbers that they are virtually unaffected by vibration . By using transistors instead of tubes , manufacturers can cram the same amount of equipment into half the space and eliminate the heat problem altogether . Lastly , the music makers have now come up with small speakers that can reproduce the Big Sound . <P> " In time , the complete units will make the separate-component-part hi-fi obsolete , " claims KLH President Kloss . Perhaps he is overly optimistic , but at least the small-fi has placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
