txt Letters to The Times Letters to The Times To THE Earn or THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial suggestion of June 29 that the Kennedy Administration revise its negative policy toward France 's request for aid in her development of a strategic nuclear capability does not rest on as sound a case as your editorial asserted . Taking your arguments one by one , there is no evidence that Britain 's entry into the European Economic Community would make de Gaulle mdve away from his concept of an " independently operated " national nuclear force . Whatever degree of cooperation the French might agree to will be superficial in view of de Gaulle 's central conviction that his striking force has to be a national French force , available to support French policy whenever this differs from the policy of the allies . Furthermore , and obviously , there can be no such thing as a little indivisibility . Future Government View There is no indication that the French program for independent nuclear weapons development has attracted widespread support in France . Nevertheless , the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive de Gaulle . But it would probably be pursued with far more doubt and much less vigor ; and a post-de Gaulle Government might be more amenable to any proposals for integrating the French effort into a community program . French security may have improved as far as the protection of security is concerned . You ignore , however , the far more important security problem of preventing unauthorized use of nuclear weapons . Surely an army which has displayed so shocking a degree of disobedience to , and rebellion against , its Government is an exceedingly poor risk as a custodian of nuclear weapons . If the French have not recently asked the United States for vital assistance in nuclear technology , this is because they anticipated refusal . They certainly would request such aid if the Kennedy Administration took your advice . Finally , General de Gaulle has a legendary confidence in the wisdom of his vision , and an extraordinary talent for intransigence to boot . He is unlikely to become a more " cooperative " ally if we give in to his demands because we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Princeton , N. J. , July 3 , 1962 . Children and TV Violence To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I make a brief comment on the " Report on Mayhem " by your excellent TV critic Jack Gould published July 3 . He cites the Pilkington report : " That children are resilient and can quickly recover from the effects of the portrayal of violence is generally accepted . " It is unfortunately true that the idea that children are virtually immune to seduction by the screen is widespread . The main reason for this is that if TV as a cause is denied in the first place , later long-range effects are not likely to be recognized . In my psychiatric opinion , many children  --  whom we can not identify beforehand  --  do not get over the education for brutality and violence with which we now so plentifully supply them . FREDRIC WERTHAM , M. D. New York , July 5 , 1962 . Faulk Libel Verdict Hailed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The New York Chapter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times and its reporter , John Sibley , for the thorough and complete coverage with which The Times handled the trial in the libel suit of John Henry Faulk . By consistently reporting on the day-byday developments during this twomonth-long trial , The Times performed a valuable service to its readers and the general public . The A. C. T. U. was heartened by the trial and the verdict reached by a jury of twelve citizens . It brought to public attention in a most dramatic way the existence of blacklisting practices in the radio and television industry , hitherto shrouded in a pervasive fog of secrecy . We are pleased to note that the judgment reached by the jury , after consideration of abundant evidence , confirmed the position that was taken by this association in July , 1955 . In a resolution adopted by our national convention that year , at the height of the blacklisting controversy , we stated : " Be it resolved that the A. C. T. U. specifically condemns the unjustifiable blacklisting that has been practiced by Aware , Inc. , as destructive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorting for its own purposes the ends which it professes to pursue . " As Catholics who are members of unions in many different fields we firmly believe that blacklisting of employes , particularly when undertaken to punish an employe 's use of his right to engage in union activities ( as was the case in the Faulk matter ) , is a reprehensible practice .

Expressway Housing in Lower Manhattan Area Seen Easing Dislocation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The hue and cry about relocation which has been used to kill so many worth-while projects in the past seems ready to claim another victim . This time it may be the Lower Manhattan Expressway . This much-needed . project would be built at a cost of $100 million and financed by the Federal and State Governments . It would ? primarily benefit the city of New York . The argument advanced against the project is the " insurmountable " problem of rehousing 1,772 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city , the state and Federal Governments , are in the process of constructing the Gompers , Columbia , Simkhovitch and Rutgers housing developments . Two of these projects will be for low-income families and two for middle-income families ; they will contain a total of 3,080 apartments . It seems to me there is a very simple and obvious solution to the relocation involved in building the expressway : Use these projects to rehouse the families involved . From experience , we know that a great many of the 1,772 families involved will relocate themselves . The task of relocation is not as difficult as it is made out to be by those with an interest ' in retarding progress . However , I would give all of these families priority for immediate occupancy in the four new developments as they are completed . The agencies concerned could simplify the problem by eliminating red tape and accepting all families on a temporary basis for three years . At the end of that period , those who are qualified and wish to remain could do so , the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the argument that relocation uproots families from established neighborhoods . This argument could not be used in this case . The four housing developments now being built are in the immediate neighborhood of the expressway . The solution should appeal to our political friends who have been expressing such concern for the welfare of their constituents . ABRAHAM E. KAZAN , President , United Housing Foundation . New York , July 9 , 1962 . Tribute to John Martin To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The announcement in your July 4 issue that John Martin has retired from The Times after thirty-five years as dance critic will , I feel certain , be noted around the world . Perhaps more than any other inrdividual Mr. Martin has cultivated the seeds and'encouraged the flowering of American dance during his tenure . What 's more , he has been a vital force in pointing out to us the variety , richness and delight in dance that have come to us from other lands . The fact that dance today enjoys a two-way passage , as it were , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versa , may well be due to Mr. Martin 's salutary influence in raising public taste , interest and enthusiasm . As everyone admits today , dance speaks an international language , and John Martin has been a prime factor in heightening this understanding . One might wish that the United States Government made use of his world knowledge of the field as a cultural ambassador , expert and adviser . It was once written that no statue has ever been erected to a critic . However , a Broadway theatre has since been named in honor of Brooks Atkinson , former drama critic of The New York Times . It would indeed be pleasant to see this custom continued . Perhaps one on:he new dance theatres rising at Lincoln Center might bear the name of John Martin . ARTHUR TODD . New York , July 5 , 1962 . Against Medical Cafe Id State Senate 's Public Health Committee Head Gives His Vielrm . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Timgi : It is encouraging to note from current press reports the emergence of a new spirit of compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged . The disci Vsions between Senators Anderson , Democrat of ? New Mexico , and Javits , Republican of New yori , may well presage glad tidings for those who have strenuously objected to certain provisions in the KingAnderson medical program .. One can hope that while ? exchanging views on such . ) as coverage and the selection or art appropriate insurance carrier they ? can also take a long look at 10 , folly of placing the total financ structure on such a narrow foulidat tion as the Social Security tax . There are impressive reasons for devising a plan which will place chief reliance on general revenues in prefer ence to the payroll tax . First , the Social Security tax will fall with greatest weight on the very people it is designed to help  --  the poor . This is because the tax is only chargeable under King-Anderson on salaries up to $5,200 a year . At pre ent , those who earn less than $5,00Q annually contribute 53 per cent Of the Social Security revenues , but only 26 per cent of the general revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary with the illness of the individual , they are fundamentally a risk to which everyone should contribute on the basis of his ability to pay . It is therefore unfair for those who earn less to carry the burden for those who earn more . Moreover , this imbalance will grow rather than decline over the yea ) ? $ ; . It is inevitable that medical p.1 ) , 4 surgical care will one day be added to the Federal program . And the certain continuum of new benefits , as Congress enriches the program , will continue the retrogression . Second , if the health insurance programs of other nations . with years of valuable experience in prcividing medical care , can be used a guide , the United States should avoid underwriting the major cost of hospitalization and nursing home care with Social Security revenue . - It is true that Great Britain , Denmark , Sweden and Norway all use the payroll tax to support their ; medical care programs . But their programs are extensive , not confined to hospitalization and nursing home care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , ? which are , therefore , not a charge against payroll deductions , imposed on employer and ernploy alike . Indeed , the trend towarii greater contributions out of general revenues is increasing . For Congres$ to embark on a unilateral course , despite this knowledge , is as unwis ? , as it is unjustified . Pension Estimates Estimates already compiled by the Department of Health , Education and Welfare show that this year 's pension cost will double by 1970 and quadruple before 1980 . King-Anderson proposes to place the entire cost of medical care for the aged on top of that . For the worker in the large union , collective bargaining may offset the imposition of the additional burden . For the employe in the small firm , without the protection of a union contract , there is no one to relieve his mounting tax . Yet he is the one most in need of governmental sup= port . It is the writer 's contention that a far more equitable Pan of financing medical care for the aged can be devised than one which places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate conferees are in a mood for revision , one cnn hope that this glaring deficiency will receive their thoughtful consideration .

Parallels to Goan Action To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES I I am interested in the letter by Ray H. , former associate lecturer in Maciurai , South India , which you published on July 7 . It seems that Mr. is in favor of the military action by which India took over Goa , axi area which was Portuguese long before the United States was a nation . I wonder if Mr. , and those who share his viewpoint would equally favor a take-over b3i , Canada of Alaska , Or at least of the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon .
