Like a Pharaoh 's tomb , the stage is stocked with the relics of a bygone life : a clutter of armoires and grandfather clocks , quaint archaic radios and phonographs , fringed lampshades and a golden harp . A man in a policeman 's uniform slowly enters the attic room and sniffs the dust of decades . He walks over to the harp and plucks at a string . It is slack , jangled and flat-an omen of the theatrical evening to come . <P> Arthur Miller in The Price has written a museum piece of a play to match the set . In form , substance and attitude , his newest drama is vintage 1930s . Always inclined to use the theater as a preacher 's pulpit , Miller sermonizes on his favorite themes : guilt , responsibility , and the way a man 's identity is forged or warped by society 's image of what he is or what he should be .

During the Depression , one son , Vic ( Pat Hingle ) , elected to stay and help support the old man by joining the police force , thus sacrificing his ambitions , his college degree and a potentially promising scientific career . The other son , Walter ( Arthur Kennedy ) , left home and became an eminent surgeon . Estranged for all that time , the two brothers have not seen or spoken to each other for 16 years . Now the cop has summoned the surgeon so that they can make a mutual disposal of their old household belongings . <P> Before Vic and Walter confront each other , a Jewish-dialect comedian totters onto the premises in the form of an 89-year-old furniture appraiser . Gregory Solomon , a kind of pickle-barrel philosopher , is as welcome for comic relief as he is dramatically irrelevant . As he haggles over the value of the furniture , Solomon ( Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marriage , his business competitors , serving as a kind of one-man Yiddish Greek chorus . <P> Haggling turns to fencing when the two brothers begin to run hot words through each other in recrimination over the past . " You had a responsibility here and you walked out on it , " charges Vic . " There was nothing here to betray , " counters Walter , revealing that their supposedly broke father had $4,000 stashed away . In effect he accuses Vic of submitting to their father 's exploitation , and tacitly suggests that the desire for self-sacrifice can be equally as corrupting as the yearning for success . <P> The ideas are certainly challenging enough , but Miller has failed to give them enough dramatic substance , substituting instead a logjam of self-justifying tirades . The lives of Vic and Walter , and the price they paid for their choices , are merely described , not dramatized . By contrast , Willy Loman 's fate had an anguishing impact because of the subtly manipulated flashbacks in Death of a Salesman , which brought key moments of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
