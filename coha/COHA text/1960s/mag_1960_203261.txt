The horsepower race , which Detroit likes to pretend does not exist in standard cars , is off to a fast start in the compacts . Chevrolet first offered an optional power pack , boosting the horsepower of the Corvair from 80 to 95 . Last week Ford disclosed that it will offer an optional 100-h.p. engine for the 90-h.p. now in the Falcon . Chrysler will do even better . It will offer a 148-h.p. engine for its Valiant which is now the most powerful compact ( 101-h.p. ) among the Big Three .
