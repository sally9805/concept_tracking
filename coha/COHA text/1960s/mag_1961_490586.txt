Notes and Comment AS rhetoric has become an increas- ingly dispensable member of the liberal am , people have abandoned the idea , held so firmly by the ancient Greeks and Romans , that eloquence is indispensable to politics . Perhaps President Kennedy 's achievements in both spheres will revive a taste for good oratory  --  a taste that has been alternately frustrated by inarticulateness and dulled by bombast . There have been a few notable orators in our day must recently , Adlai Stevenson  --  but they have been the exceptions , and it has taken Mr. Kennedy 's success as a politician to suggest that the power to " enchant souls through words " ( Socrates ) may soon he at a premium once more . Whatever the impact of the Inaugural Address on contemporary New Frontiersmen , we find it hard to believe that an Athenian or Roman citizen could have listened to it unmoved , or that Cicero , however jealous of his own reputation , would have found reason to object to it . We are all familiar by now with the generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but before the responsibility for a final judgment is yielded to Time it would he a shame not to seek the opinion of : t couple of true professionalS . Both Aristotle and Cicero , the one a theorist and the other a theorizing orator , believed that rhetoric could be an art to the extent that the orator was , first , a logician and , second , a psychologist with an appreciation and understanding of words . Cicero Felt , further , that the ideal orator was the thoroughly educated man . ( He would be pleased by Mr. Kennedy 's background , with its strong emphasis on affairs of state ; the **27;2172;TOOLONG . ) Of the three types of oratory defined by the ancients  --  political , forensic , and display ( in which audience participation was limited to a judgment of style ) ? the political was esteemed most highly , because it dealt with the loftiest of issues ; namely , the fate of peoples , rather than of individuals . ( " Now the trumpet summons us again ... against the common enemies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he one in which three kinds of persuasion were used by the speaker : logical , to present the facts of the case and construct an argument based on them ; emotional , to reach the audience psychologically ; and " ethical , " to appeal to the audience by establishing one 's own integrity and sincerity . The Inaugural Address , being a variation on the single theme of man 's rights and obligations , is not primarily logical , although it contains no illogic ; it is an appeal to men 's souls rather than to their minds . During the Presidential campaign , Mr. Kennedy tested and patented an exercise in American psychology that proved to be all the emotional appeal he required for the inaugural speech : " And so , my fellow-Americans , ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country . " His ethical persuasion , or indication of his personal probity , consisted of an extension of that appeal : " ... ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ( good ) style , while Cicero thought that there were three styles  --  the plain , the middle , and the grand . To Aristotle , who considered it sufficient for a style to he clear and appropriate , avoiding undue elevation ( whence bombast ) and excessive lowliness , it would have seemed that Mr. Kennedy had achieved the Golden Mean . The formality of the Inaugural Address ( " To that world assembly of sovereign states , the United Nations . . " ) is appropriate to the subject ; the language ( " In your hands , my fellow-citizens , more than mine , will rest the final success or failure of our course " ) is clear and direct . Cicero 's ideal orator was able to speak in all three styles , in accordance with the demands of his subject , and in that respect Mr. Kennedy filled the role by speaking plainly on the practical ( " All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days " ) , by speaking formally but directly on the purpose of national defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt can we he certain beyond doubt that they will never he employed " ) , and by speaking grandly on the potential accomplishments of the movement toward the New Frontier ( " The energy , the faith , the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it  --  and the glow from that fire can truly light the world " ) . The address , however , is largely in the grand style , which is characterized by Cicero as the ultimate source of emotional persuasion , through figures of speech and a certain degree of dignified periodic rhythm , not iambic ( " The world is very different now . For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty , and all forms of human life " ) . The oration is so rich in figures of speech  --  the many metaphors include a torch , a beachhead , jungles , a trumpet , a tiger  --  that we can imagine students of the future studying it for examples of antithesis ( " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , it can not save the few who arc rich " ) , personification ( " . ? . the hand of mankind 's final war " ) , and anaphora ( " Not as a call to hear arms , though arms we need ; not as a call to battle , though embattled we are . . . " ) . " Battle " and qwq after our ears had thawed sufficiently . " Next summer , " another answered . Gloomily , we sought out Dr. Thomas P. Malone , president of the Society , and put the same question to him . " Ca n't say , " he replied , his face falling like the barometer . " It sometimes happens that wind currents get stuck in abnormal patterns , and when they do , you just have to wait for them to get un stuck . Last week , Alaska had the weather we should hove been having here ; they suffered a fifty-degree heat wave . " Dr. Malone went on to tell us that in his non-presidential moments he directs research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with Dr. H. E. Landsberg , director of the Office of Climatology , United States Weather Bureau , kVashington , D.C. , whom we asked about a theory , expounded at the meeting the day before , that we are in a cold cycle that began in 1940 . " I do n't know , " said Dr. Landsherg , cloudy in gray tweeds . " I thought we were still in a warm cycle that began in 1885 . The national records are kept in Asheville , North Carolina . I have four hundred million punch cards there . As soon as I can run them through the computers , we 'll know . " Dr. W. O. Roberts , director of the High Altitude Observatory , at Boulder , Colorado , was equally baffled by talk of a cold cycle . " I thought the world was generally hotter than it had been , " he said , between sips at a cocktail . " Theoretically , carbon dioxide from cars and factories has blanketed the earth , like an enormous gas chamber , keeping the heat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler , it would knock that theory into a cocked hat , would n't it ? " We agreed . Dr. Roberts put down his glass and said he did n't believe in cycles anyway  --  ups and downs , certainly , but not cycles that could he tied to predictable causes . Soon we were face to face with a thickset and cheerful meteorologist , Mr. C. G. Knudsen , soon to be meteorologist in charge of the United States Weather Bureau office in New York . Cycles or no , he said , we 've hem having most remarkable weather , beginning last autumn with Hurricane Donna and continuing through December 's twenty-inch snowfall ( a record ) , the Inaugural Snowstorm ( as January 20th 's has come to be called ) , and the current cold wave . " The January temperatures are much below normal here in New York , even though we have n't had many record-breaking days , " he went on , with the concern of a doctor for a wayward patient . " There has been a continuous blanket of snow since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trough in the upper atmosphere is siphoning cold air from Canada . If we could move it a few hundred miles to the west , we would he all right  --  only then , of course , the central states would get it . " We moved off to intercept Mr. E. J. Christie , retiring meteorologist in charge of the New York office of the United States Weather Bureau , but were beaten to it by a young meteorologist from California , who wanted to know if the weather would unfreeze sufficiently for him to drive to Idlewild the next day . " Ask Mr. Knud sen , " said Mr. Christie , whisking a flurry of crumbs from his sleeve . " I only work in the good-weather department . " Leaving Mr. Christie , we ran into Mr. D. Ludlum , who described himself as a free-lance weatherman from Princeton . Mr. Ludlum told us that he ran a **25;2201;TOOLONG business on the side , and he readily admitted that the dirty weather was good for it . Being in an optimistic frame of mind , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past ; the 1888 blizzard aside , there had been more snow up to this time in 1899 and 1947 , and perhaps , with a benevolent turn in the troposphere , 1961 would n't even go down as a record year . We joined a group of young weathermen near a window , who were twitting a meteorologist from Toronto on the ground that he hailed from the same place as the cold air . " It does n't come from Canada , " he said defensively . " It comes from the Arctic , and merely passes through Canada on its way to you . " A cold wave in Toronto could usually be expected in New York a day later , he went on , and as the mercury was mighty low in Toronto right now , New York could count on at least another couple of days of cold . " Looks as if we were in for some precipitated tabular crystals of frozen water right now , " he concluded , pressing his nose to the window . Dress Optional AN acquaintance of ours who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dining room of that establishment the other day and was refused service because he was wearing a tieless sports shirt . Being a man of some ingenuity , he quickly figured out a way to get a meal . He simply went to the club 's Bath Department , took off his clothes , and summoned a waiter . Presently , in the buff , he enjoyed some excellent roast beef . Vero THE Italian tenor Franco Corelli made his American debut at the Metropolitan last Friday in " Il Trovatore , " and the critics described him as " another luminous exponent of the Italian repertoire " and his work as having " greatly excited the audience , pro and con . " Though hitherto little known in this country , Corelli has made a formidable name for himself in Italy ; he is famous there not only for his voice but for his fiery temperament and his appeal to teen-agers , who in Italy , as here , do n't ordinarily frequent the opera . Teen-agers dote on Corelli partly because he is one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to play . He is a lithe , handsome man of thirty-six , with wavy black hair and large brown eyes ; his height , of which he is boyishly proud , is an inch over six feet , and he increases it onstage by wearing shoes with two-inch heels . At the moment , Corelli 's only rival oil his home grounds is the tenor Mario Del Monaco , of whom he says simply that Del Monaco is ten years older and has a darker voice . Corelli and his wife are paying their first visit to the States , and since he speaks no English and she speaks only a little , they are enjoying all the usual terrors and bewilderments of trayTHE NEW YORKER ellers in a foreign land . When , accompanied by an Italian-speaking friend , we- called on them a few days before Corelli made his &but,; we found the great man staring in shocked siknee at a TV screen on which a comic version of " Madame Butterfly " was being shown . It took our friend some time to explain that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pleasure in some circles . Steering the conversation off " Butterfly " and onto Corelli , we learned that he is a native of the town of Ancona ( pop . 89,000 ) , on the Adriatic coast , that he was a first-year engineering student at the University of Bologna when he first realized that his voice was worth cultivating , and that , two voice teachers having proved unsuccessful , he taught himself to sing . His teaching method consisted largely of listening to records made by various distinguished tenors , imitating their renditions on a tape recorder , and tirelessly improving these imitations . The tenors Corelli admires the most and learned the most from are Caruso , Gigli , LauriVolpi , and Pertile . His professional career got under way when he won a vu-cal competition at Spoleto in 1952 , and since then he has sung in all the important opera houses in Italy and in many of the major opera houses of Europe . Mrs. Corelli mentioned with pride that her husband has twenty-seven operas in his repertory and is currently gutting up two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Today , while he is still young , Franco is using his very high range , " she said , in Italian . " Later , he will do other roles , which require the darker , slightly lower voice . Most tenors have a range of about two octaves , but Franco has a range of three . " Her husband shook his head , forbidding her to eaaggerate . " Two and a half , " she amended . " In the last year or so , he has lengthened his voice by adding three tones at the top and not losing a single bottom note in the process . For a while , everyone thought Franco might he turning into a baritone ; now lie is a true tenure ( lento . His contract with the Metropolitan calls for three months in New York and two months on the road . We are anxious to see what American audiences are like . In Italy , the audiences are alway s severe and rather rigid . They sit with raised guns waiting for you to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applaud everything . The English , on the other hand , do n't applaud until the end of the act , so you never know where you are . But the most difficult audience is the Spanish . They remember all the old singers and constantly make comparisons between a modern singer and someone they heard twenty-five , or even fifty , years ago . " " Vero , " said Corelli , looking as if he found that challenge great but not too great . " We collect old opera records and new cars , " continued Mrs. Corelli , who is plainly the family spokesman . " Right now , we have a beige-and-turquoise Lincoln Continental , a gray jaguar , and a white Alfa Romeo Giulietta . We 're going to have to sell the Lincoln , though , because the heater gives off some sort of vapor that bothers Franco 's throat . I want to replace it with a Thunderbird , but I fear that Franco will insist on a Cadillac . Franco loves spurts  --  rowing , swimming , tennis , and Rugby . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I say merely that he is very sensitive . The newspapers reported last year that he stopped in the middle of a performance in Naples to strike a member of the audience . The truth is this : The opera was ' Trovatore , ' and the lady who was singing the mother had apparently been a little afraid of Franco 's popularity and had given out a certain number of tickets to Neapolitan students . At the end of the first scene of the second act , when Franco and the lady came nut to take their bows , one of the students stood up in a box in the third tier and yelled Solo ! Saar  --  meaning ' Let her take her bow alone . ' Then Ile yelled ' Vet via ! ' to Franco . That is a great insult in Italian , because it is how you tell a dog to go away . It was too much for Franco 's sensitivities . He rushed backstage , ran up three flights of stairs to the boy , found the door of the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . He was just about to hit the student when a couple of stage managers hurried in behind him and dragged him back to his dressing room . He was so upset that he completely lost his voice ; he could n't even talk for twenty minutes . After a terrible interval , he went back onstage and sang the greatest Tim ' of his entire career . " " Vero , " said Corelli.
