Slowly , silently and in single file , 500 New York taxis with " Off Duty " signs aglow last week made the 15-mile trip from a Bronx funeral parlor to Kennedy Airport . In a hearse at the front was the body of Carlos Quilly , who had been fatally shot in the back while driving his taxi , and was being flown back to Puerto Rico for burial . The cortege was a moving protest by the drivers against their biggest occupational hazard : violent crime . Reported holdups of New York cab drivers number more than 600 a year , and 14 cabbies have been murdered in the last seven years . Says Joe Paradise , an official of the local cab drivers ' union : " We are sick and tired because we are the forgotten men . Cabbies get killed , mugged , beaten up , but there is no action-it 's like he do n't belong to nobody . " <P> While cab drivers are frequent victims of crime , they are also frequent heroes-tipping off police to fights and robberies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two months ago , while honoring 75 of them for heroism , Police Commissioner Howard Leary called them " the city 's second police force . " <P> Growing Shortage . With cab crime on the front page day after day , New Yorkers have begun to think anew about taxis . Complaints that drivers are rude , ignore hails and refuse to take Negroes to Harlem are familiar : the police department gets 500 of them per month . What New Yorkers really wonder about , as they try in vain to get a cab during rush hour or rainstorm , is whether or not cabs are becoming scarcer . <P> Astoundingly , the answer is yes . In 1929 , New York City had close to 29,000 taxis . But the Depression put many of them out of business , and competition for passengers among those remaining led to such ferociovis cab wars - with arson and shooting-that the city in 1937 severely limited the number to prevent even more violence . New York now has only 11,772 licensed taxis to serve almost 1,000,000 passengers a day . Similar hold-downs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . <P> There is also a growing shortage of drivers . In Los Angeles , the 900-cab Yellow fleet has a 60% annual turnover of drivers . The two biggest cab companies in Memphis man only 200 of their 300 taxis . Philadelphia 's Yellow Cab Co. pays employees a $25 bounty for recruiting new drivers who stay on the job at least 90 days . So serious is the shortage that companies which employed 75% full-time drivers to 25% part-timers ten years ago , find the proportions rapidly reversing . Nowadays the man up front is quite possibly a moonlighting actor , minister , artist , teacher or student . Or a woman . Boston has 63 licensed women cab drivers , New York City 200 , Washington 400.
