They hoped that Peking would be so busy coping at home that it would have little time or energy for troublemaking abroad . For a while that proved to be the case-but no longer . Last week Peking was quarreling with no fewer than eight of its neighbors , many of whom have been shaken in recent weeks by Maoist riots , threats and demonstrations-plus retaliatory action by their own citizens . Whether Peking consciously intended it or not , the contagion of the Cultural Revolution has lately spilled over China 's borders , infecting overseas Chinese and inflaming their non-Chinese neighbors . <P> Russia remains , of course , the chief target on China 's periphery .
