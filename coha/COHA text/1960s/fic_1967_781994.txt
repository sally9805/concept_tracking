 | To the north lies the territory of Galilee and the Sea of Galilee . In this area I have lived and worked during the past thirty years . Lying below me and to the west are the cities of Jericho , Bethlehem , Emmaus , and Arimathea . On a clear day such as today , Jerusalem , the city of David , with Bethany , its beautiful suburban village clinging to the east side , can be seen from this elevated spot on Mt . Nebo . Also directly below me is the Wilderness of Judea . It is as ugly and barren as the Jordan valley is beautiful and fertile . This forbidding wasteland , which is bounded on the west by the wilderness and on the east by the Dead Sea , is the homeland of the Essenes , a sect of the Jews that has become stricter in the way of the Law than the Pharisees . I was baptized at the hands of John , he who has recently become known throughout all Judea as " the Baptizer . " John is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother , are kinswomen . He is six months older than I. When we were children we visited in each other 's homes and played together . As we grew older , we discussed many things , including the glory and the suffering of Israel . John is a much larger man than I. He is tall , with wide shoulders and a thick neck . His black eyebrows are heavy and his beard is long and bushy . He gives the appearance of being a menacing figure . However , some of us who have been close to him through the years know that he is less fierce than he looks . There is a gentleness about him , a sensitivity toward people ,  | especially those who endure the pain and suffering of this world . For some reason John attempts to hide these deep , sympathetic feelings behind a harsh exterior . ' Today is the first time I had seen him in several years . I lc was dressed in camel 's hair , and about his loins he had tied a heavy leather girdle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and in a loud voice he ailed the people to repentance . Those who responded to his call , he baptized in the Jordan . When I reached the Jordan where John was proi laiming his message , throngs of people had gathered to hear him . Some were returning to their homes beyond the Jordan after the Festival of Pentecost . When John saw the Pharisees and Sadducees who had come horn Jerusalem to get a first-hand sample of his ministry , he turned his fierce gaze upon them and for their benefit shouted : " You sons of snakes , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? Bring forth fruit worthy of a repented life and say not to yourselves Abraham is our father ' ! Now the axe is laid at the root of the tree . Every tree that brings forth corrupt fruit is cut down , cast into the fire , and burned . " John attributed the low level of life in Israel not so much to Roman conquerors as to the rulers of the people , the religious leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For greed and profit , recognition and power , they had sold themselves and their people . In years gone by , persecution and suffering tended to purify the ways of Israel . During such periods there were men of God who not only challenged the people but interpreted the ways of God to them . Now , how-  | ever , the leaders of the Temple and the rulers of the people conform to the ways of the world . In this manner their success , security , and acclaim are inevitable . The ox knows its owner and the ass his master 's crib , but Israel does not know the Lord her God . She has been seduced by the men she trusted . The people are taxed far beyond their ability to pay , not alone by Rome but by religious authorities . Everywhere there is poverty , hunger , disease , and death , but no prophet or priest in Israel appears to care . The spirit of the people has been crushed . Persecution and exploitation have not purified ; they have only embittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with us in abundance . Once it was believed that within Israel a Savior would come and through Israel all the families of the earth would be blessed . This faith is now considered sour humor . Israel can not save herself , much less save anyone else . In the light of prevailing conditions , John 's harsh words to the Sadducees and the Pharisees can better be understood . In his disgust with the hypocrisy of the rulers , John several years ago retired hermit-like to the Wilderness of Judea , near the Dead Sea . Here he identified himself with the very strict sect known as the Essenes . These people , who preach and practice isolation from the world , respect the Law in much the same way as do the Pharisees , but there is one important difference between the two groups . The Pharisees preach and teach the importance of the Law but only pretend to practice it . They would bind the Law upon the backs of the people , but they have no intention of applying it to  | - I- c- nselves . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beyond any sect ever to appear in Judah they practice it to the last jot and tittle . The Essenes have separated themselves not only from - I- e world of the Gentiles but from all segments in Israel . They proclaim themselves the one , the only , the true Israel . They say they are the elect of God , the saving remnant . Their faithfulness is demonstrated by the way they fast , bathe , pray , and revere the Law in all points . They hold their possessions in common . They look for the end of the world when their views will be I  --  Ily vindicated . There is among them a great sense of oneness . They are held together by the Law . The Eswiles are supreme legalists . The way a person washes his hands or observes fasts , and the number of steps he takes on the Sabbath are to them the important elements of spiritual life . The slightest departure from the least of these requirements can mean expulsion from the group . To these people John turned . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their communities were known for cleanliness and order . He approached them , studied them , and identified himself with them . With them he believes that the Law once again must be central in the faith of the people and that isolation from sinful humanity is the only way to escape worldly contamination . The Essenes claim to be God 's saving remnant . From John 's point of view their style of life is in keeping with their faith . But John 's commitment to the ways of the Essenes has not been quite so easy and so simple as he hoped .  | During the years when he and I were living in close relation to each other , John became convinced that God would send a servant who would be the incarnation of his own love . As God had given the people the Law , he believed , so one day in a personal way he would give them mercy , grace , and love . Between Law and Love there is a great gulf , but in God 's plan there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , and one is not equal to the other . By God 's law men will be guided , but by his love they will be saved from themselves . As I walked along the banks of the Jordan this afternoon , I was curious , but I was also disturbed . Would John recognize and accept me for what I am ? Before all the people , would he identify himself with me and the kingdom of God which has come in me ? Or would he preach only that which he has learned from his wilderness friends ? I approached the place where he proclaimed his message of judgment and condemnation . He saw me at a distance . Our eyes met . In that moment John made his decision , the most important decision of his life . He could not  --  he would not  --  tell these anxious , guilt-ridden seekers that their salvation was to be found in the wilderness with the people who fasted , who observed the Sabbath strictly , and who prided themselves on keeping the Law of Moses in all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Then in his bellowing voice he cried , " I indeed baptize you with water ;  | but here comes one mightier than I , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose . Behold , the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world ! This is none other than the son of God . He shall baptize you with the holy Spirit . " In this manner John the Baptizer with one stroke cast his lot on the side of Love rather than Law . Yeshua of Nazareth became for him the Christ of God . The crowd standing by heard John 's words and were astonished by them , but they were even more astonished when I requested him to baptize me even as he had baptized the repentant sinners . John was as surprised as the people at my request . He drew back and refused . With considerable feeling he said , " I have need to be baptized of you . " There are three reasons why I deem it important that I be baptized . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision that has long been in my mind , namely to leave the secure surroundings of Galilee and take up the ministry for which I was sent into this world . In accepting baptism at John 's hands I outwardly confirmed an inward commitment . There would be no turning back from this day forward , regardless of cost to life or limb . My ministry , as of this day , has been launched . Second , I submitted to baptism because I prefer to identify myself with the needy and the sinful of this world . I have come not to separate myself from the world but to live in it . I am now one with the thieves , grafters , extortioners , and harlots who have been baptized in Jordan 's muddy waters  --  at least in faith I am  | identified with them . I have forever broken with the rulers of Israel and the arrogant spirit which they represent . With John the Baptizer I have not come to call the self-righteous to the kingdom  --  for they can not be saved  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Third , I wanted a sign by which my followers will be known , a symbol which will set forth the power , love , and forgiveness of God . Baptism will be that sign and symbol . This mark will be my brand upon my people .  | t OE WILDERNESS OF JUDEA , west of the Dead Sea Late at night , written in the home of Mary , Martha , and Lazarus I t has been more than forty days since I last put pen to leather . During these days of testing , I thought it wise not to attempt to describe the events which occurred or my feelings which accompanied these events . I am now resting and recuperating in the home of Mary , Martha , and Lazarus , in Bethany . The experiences through which I have recently passed are vividly written across my mind . I will write them in the order in which they occurred . The day following my baptism I came down from Mt . Nebo and retraced my steps to the Jordan where john was again proclaiming his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining what I felt I must do before proceeding further with my ministry . In the process of becoming a man , I have relinquished certain  | aspects of deity , such as being able to foresee in detail the future . However , I have retained the power over life and death . Unlimited power over the natural forces of this world is in my hand . The agreement which I have made with myself is this : Under no circumstances will I ever use God 's mighty power to ease the burden of human living for myself . I shall hold this power as a trust , but I shall use it only for others . This is the agreement I have made  --  but when the pressure is applied , when the pain of being a human being is greater than the spirit can bear , will I resort to supernatural force to escape the pressure and ease the pain ? I explained to John what I had in mind . Then I asked him , " Where do you suggest I go to carry out the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west across the Jordan to the Wilderness of Judea . " One place beyond all others , " he said . " If you can survive there , you can survive anywhere . " The Wilderness of Judea it would be . John was right . Beyond the caves of Qumran I walked deep into the Wilderness . Such emptiness and desolation I had never known . This vast wasteland is more desert than wilderness . Trees are bare and sickly . Scrubby plants and dwarfed shrubs struggle for life . The days are unbearably hot ; nights are freezing cold . Rocks of every conceivable size and shape cover the sandy soil . As far as the eye can see , there are rocks , rocks , and more rocks . How long could I endure life amid such isolated surroundings without food ? Twenty days ? Thirty days ? I decided on a forty-day test .  | Deep in the interior of the wilderness I found a tiny stream . Its waters were muddy and tasted faintly of salt . Once a day I drank from the stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Locusts and wild honey , John 's desert food , were available , but I did not eat even these . A scrawny pomegranate tree , about four feet tall , grew near the stream . It was heavy with dried fruit . Though the pomegranate is among my favorite foods , I decided to look but not eat . At least for now . Before many days passed , my strength ebbed so much that I could hardly stand . Off and on I lost consciousness . Sometimes I dreamed . Once I saw the inviting table set by Mary and Martha , and on it were figs , olives , grapes , and charcoal-broiled fish . Hunger gave way to listlessness . Fatigue possessed me . During the lowest period in the entire test , one of the clearest visions I had concerned a visit from Satan . He came , he said , seeking only my welfare and happiness . He who had rebelled against his Creator , throwing heaven into turmoil by his demonic ambition to take the place of God , came to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt of lightning . He now feeds on his own lust and hatred , and his sole purpose of existence is to thwart the Father 's design for all the created order . His power over human beings , though often influential , is severely restricted . He can not veto even the simplest act of the human will . He can only suggest and persuade . He would transform men into his own image and likeness . Where there is laughter , he would sow tears ; where there is peace , discord ; where there is hope ,  | despair ; where there is joy , misery ; where there is doubt , mistrust ; where there is love , hatred ; where there is light , darkness . He spreads his poison and claims this world for himself . It was late afternoon . The sun was about to go down . I marked on a stone the passage of another day . Near the little stream , under the pomegranate tree , I rested my head on a mound of sand . Satan on the wings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do not look very much like the son of God , " he jeered . In this he was correct . My tunic was ripped across the back , my beard was shaggy , and my eyes , burning from the heat and sand , were bloodshot . I had lost many pounds of weight , and with my height of six feet I looked more like a shepherd 's rod than a man . He continued , " If you are the son of God , show your power by turning these rocks into bread . " He pointed to the acres of rocks that lay around me . Every rock now reminded me of a tasty morsel . I had said to myself many times , " If ever I turn rocks into bread , it will be to satisfy the hunger of Galilee 's multitudes . It will not be to relieve my own need . " Shifting my position , I replied , " Man shall not live by bread alone . During these days , I shall eat only food from heaven . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Satan painted a new and exciting picture . I saw the kingdoms of this world . " They shall be yours for the asking , " he said enticingly . " Give me your support and loyalty , and these kingdoms and all they contain will be yours . "  | This simple suggestion sounded innocent enough . In exchange for compromising with Satan just a little I would achieve peace , prosperity , and worldly acclaim . Instead of fighting the world , why not accept it ? Instead of criticizing the world , why not praise it ? Instead of attempting to change the world , why not strive to make it more like itself ? But I knew the answer I must give . " God , and God alone , is to be worshiped and served , " I replied . The vision was extended yet another dimension . Suddenly I was taken to Jerusalem and carried bodily to the highest ledge of the Temple . Satan spoke a third time : " If you are really the son of God , throw yourself down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look after you , and they will bear you up before your body is dashed against the stones . People seeing such a miracle will turn and believe in you . It will be that simple and that easy . You can have their faith by a stroke of miracle-power . Caiaphas and all your enemies will be routed . There will be no need for suffering , rejection , and death . " I turned on my back and again I rested my head on the mound of sand . The vision of the Temple , with me standing on the highest ledge , was clearly before me . The multitudes , gathered for one of the great festivals , congregated in the streets below . One man cried , " It is Yeshua of Nazareth ! If he jumps , he will be killed ! " Another said , " He claims to be the son of God . If he throws himself from the Temple , God 's mighty power will save him before his body is dashed against the stones . When this happens , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chant : " I , too , shall believe in him ! I , too , shall believe in him ! " It was a vivid and moving scene . One gesture of resignation on my part , one lift of the hand toward Satan , one feeble attempt to escape rejection and death in easy fashion is all that would have been needed to make a mockery of the mission for which I was sent into the world . Again I knew what I must say . At last I replied . " God , with his almighty power , shall not be tempted . There can be no easy way to demonstrate the love of God . Performing a magician 's miracle is not the answer . If people believe in me , it must be for some better reason . " The vision ended . Satan was gone . I languished in the wilderness until the forty-day period ended . The ordeal was over . I emerged with a sense of confidence in my own person and destiny , the like of which I have never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither do I fear the limitless power entrusted to this earthly life . Like one who is drunk with wine I staggered past the caves of Qumran . The people who fasted , bathed , and said their prayers by the sun looked at me but offered me no food or drink . I was noticed by a praying priest . He turned his head . To him I was another filthy beggar , perhaps a leper groping my way out of the wilderness . Along the way I ate figs and olives , and my strength gradually returned . Three days later I reached Bethany , outside of Jerusalem .  | Four miles north of my home town , Nazareth , lies the village of Cana . This is one of my favorite spots in all of Galilee . Set down amid rolling hills and fertile valleys , the countryside there provides a sharp contrast to Judea 's rock and wasteland . Rainfall is heavy in this area , and the land is further enriched by waters which flow from the springs of Mt . Hermon , many miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildly sloping hillsides offer unlimited opportunities to both shepherds and farmers . Grains , olives , and nuts of all kinds are grown in abundance . Beyond everything else produced in the region of Cana , the natives are most proud of their grapes . How well I remember my boyhood years when I often walked the pleasant , winding road from Nazareth  | to Cana . In midsummer the days were warm but never unbearably hot . Along the road great clusters of Cana 's famous purple-red grapes hung from arbors , trees , and fences . I would eat my fill of this delicious fruit and then put some in my lunch basket to take home as a gift for my mother . When my brothers and sisters accompanied me , we brought home grapes by the gallon . My mother made preserves with some of the grapes , and wine with the remainder . The wine was her specialty . It was mild with a soft tang of bittersweet . The day I arrived home in Nazareth from Bethany , I was reminded of the approaching wedding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Deborah , his bride , a delightful girl of great charm , is eighteen . Both of the families concerned are among the faithful in Israel . Though wedding practices in Israel have changed since the days of David , many ancient customs have been retained . Among strict families it is still the custom for a friend or relative of the bridegroom to make all necessary arrangements for the wedding . He handles the initial negotiations such as announcing to the girl 's parents the marital intentions of his friend . If there is a dowry , this is discussed at that time . With the exchange of gifts , including wedding rings , the betrothal period begins . It is customary for the bridal pair to wait a full year before the marriage is consummated . ( Except in the case of a widow . Here the betrothal period is only one month . ) At the end of the betrothal year and on a fixed date , the groom dresses himself in his finest clothes  | and , accompanied by the friend who has made the arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bride has bathed and put on white robes , perhaps richly embroidered . She has adorned herself with whatever jewels the family has been able to afford . She covers herself with a veil and places a garland on her head . Her intended husband has come for her . She is now ready to accompany him to his house , her new home . But she does not accompany him alone . Musicians , singers , parents , brothers , sisters , friends , and neighbors join the couple in a gala procession . If the wedding procession is at night , great torches are carried . Upon arriving at the groom 's home , a notable feast is begun . Though there are no prayers or readings from the Scriptures , the whole joyful event is a religious service . There is considerable merrymaking , eating , drinking , dancing , and singing . This is an occasion of unrestrained happiness . The long year of betrothal is over . During this year of separation and discipline there has been little communication between groom and bride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is worthy of joyous celebration . Joining the wedding procession at the home of Deborah 's parents , I walked with the happy , singing crowd to Micah 's home , a beautiful country place midway between Nazareth and Cana . There I delighted in the feast with the other guests . The food was excellent and the wine was among Cana 's best . At midnight on these occasions a colorful ceremony occurs . The bride is escorted to the groom 's bedroom by her father . She releases her arm from his and enters  | the room where the marriage is to be consummated . Sufficient time elapses while she prepares herself for the approach of her husband . The groom is then escorted to the bridal chamber by the same friend who has made all the betrothal arrangements . Friends and relatives quietly depart , leaving the couple alone for the night . However , the wedding procedures do not end with this event . On the morrow the festivities are resumed with more eating , drinking , singing , and dancing . In years gone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , however , the period of one week is more customary . Each day a new set of guests arrives . Obviously , such a festival requires considerable planning , many servants , and an inexhaustible supply of food and wine . My mother considers Micah as one of her own boys . His parents are among her intimate friends . She has spent the entire week in Cana helping in every possible way . On the last day of the wedding festival I made a second visit to Micah 's house . This time I went not so much to enjoy the festivities as to escort my mother home . When she met me in the garden I knew at once by her worried look that something was wrong . Drawing me aside , she whispered : " I am glad you are here . A dreadful thing has occurred . We have entertained far more guests than we expected , and we are without wine . If you can prevent it , let nothing mar the beginning of this happy marriage . " From her manner I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's power to save Micah from an embarrassing situation . Yet such an action would be directly opposed to the decision that I had made in the Wilderness . My first impulse was to be impatient with her . I said sharply , " What have you and I to do with it ? This is not our responsibility . The hour has not come when I should use the power God has placed in my hands for such purposes . " The moment I spoke in such fashion , I regretted it . I called the servants and told them to fill six stone pots with water . Then I instructed them to draw some of the water and take it to the friend of the bridegroom , the presiding steward of the feast . Instantly the water became wine . Tasting it , the steward went to Micah and exclaimed , " Most people serve their choice wine ( luring the early days of the feast and keep the weaker wine to the last , but by Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , you have kept the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor any of the guests knew that I had anything to do with the wine . My mother knew , however , and she pondered the meaning of this in her heart . The servants who drew the water also knew , but they held their tongues . Once again the question of when and how to use divine power has been raised in my mind . Am I to be bothered by this question throughout my life ? When am I and when am I not to call forth the power which lies in my hand ? In the Wilderness of Judea I settled once and for all the matter of using God 's power to relieve my own suffering or to get me out of a dangerous spot . I shall never  | do so . But there must be restrictions other than these . Certainly I must not use this power in any destructive way . There no doubt will be times when I look upon the ugliness of evil and I will be tempted to call down lightning from heaven . When I see at close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who arrogantly abuse the helpless , the widows and orphans , I shall be moved to unleash the mighty power that God has given me . But this I must not do . Also , I must not use this power as a means of making disciples . People who are converted to me and my Way because they have seen a miracle are less likely to remain committed . To see a miracle and to exclaim " Here is God ! " is to approach discipleship the wrong way . But to stand in the invisible , silent presence of God , amid the darkness and tragedy of this world , and say , " I believe ! " is to enter the kingdom by sheer faith . Once a man believes in God , miracles become commonplace . A miracle may confirm faith . It should never initiate it . Futhermore I must not use this power in any silly or frivolous manner . To do so would degrade my ministry and make me one with magicians and soothsayers . Already there are false stories circulating about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when I was a child I touched clay pigeons and gave them life . A more recent story , which is also false , claims that I sent a friend to the sea to catch a certain fish in whose mouth a coin would be found , sufficient to pay my Temple tax for a year . A still later version of this story says that the fish 's mouth contained a small flute . If the latter version were true , it would take another miracle to make the  | water-soaked flute usable . I have always paid my Temple tax , but I have not resorted to pulling coins and flutes out of the mouths of fish to do so . I have paid the tax out of the money I earned in my Nazareth shop . The incident at Cana bothers me . In turning the water into wine did I use divine power in a trivial or frivolous manner ? I can not answer this question to my own satisfaction . I can only say that I shall not so use it again . Henceforth God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor , to feed the hungry , and to heal the sick .  |  | When I envision the great happiness awaiting a young couple like Micah and Deborah , I am filled with mixed emotions . I rejoice with them , but I am also saddened because I am sternly reminded that I shall never know such happiness . Marriage is clean and good . It is an honorable estate given by God himself . When contracted in love and with the blessing of God , there is no other human relation that can bring such joy and meaning to life . Marriage is not meant simply for reproduction . It is designed for the purpose of welding two lives into one . But I shall never marry . There are two reasons that have led me to this conclusion . First , the bitterness of Israel 's religious leaders toward me has already begun to be manifest . Though I have not referred to this cir-  | cumstance in speaking with my family or friends , such bitterness can lead to only one thing : an early end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plight of widows is a desperate one . Neither Rome nor Israel offers any protection to these unfortunate women . They are left to shift for themselves , or they become dependent upon families that do not want them . Often they become prey to lecherous men . I would not deliberately doom any young woman to such a life . Second , I think it unwise that I beget children . Not that there is anything unclean in the process of begetting children . Quite the contrary is true . When two healthy bodies are joined together in conjugal love , when each gives himself and herself to the other in joyful abandon , God is present to hallow such a union , and through it to mediate his grace . ( When such a union is not blessed of God , it becomes a thing deformed like an arm without a hand , or an eye without sight . ) But I shall never know a woman in holy marriage . I shall never have children of my own . If I were to become the father of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin . Such children , by virtue of being my children , would be worshiped by many who believe me to be the son of God . There will develop from my ministry a dynasty , but it will be a dynasty of faith and faithfulness , not of flesh and blood . It will be a succession of people equal in the sight of God . There shall be no preferential treatment , no special privileges , no first-class or second-class membership in my kingdom . I shall never marry , and I shall never beget children , though I would like very much  | to do both . My sons and daughters shall be those who in faith do the will of God . On the way back from Cana last night my mother and I discussed the details involved in moving the entire family to Capernaum next week . Capernaum-by-the-Sea is a delightful city , fresh and clean . It is larger than Nazareth and more attractive in every way . We have leased a house directly on the beach and facing the Sea of Galilee . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow-capped peaks of Mt . Hermon can he seen in the distance . Joseph , my mother 's husband , passed away several years ago . He was a remarkable man , and to me he was more than a father . He taught me the skill of his hands , and since I am the oldest of the children , he passed on to me the shopwork which he had carefuly built up across the years . My four brothers  --  James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas  --  and my three sisters  --  Rachel , Rebekah , and Miriam  --  will make the move with us . The boys are now in their early twenties and are grown men . They are capable of taking over their father 's business . They will do better in Capernaum than in Nazareth . The girls , who are twelve , fourteen , and sixteen , are of considerable help to my mother . Nazareth , unlike its neighbor town of Cana , is dirty and ill kept . The synagogue and its school are in a pitiable , run-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people take little interest in their houses , most of which are flat one- and two-room structures made of mud-brick . There is a high rate of sickness and disease . For years Nazareth has been domi-  | nated by cautious and narrow-minded religious and political leaders who live only in the past , in the days of Solomon and David . To these blinded souls the only evil is change and the only good is keeping things as they were in yesteryear . Because of an unpleasant incident which occurred today , our family will be moving to Capernaum sooner than we had planned . For the past three months I have been teaching in various synagogues throughout Galilee . The word reached here that my ministry has been well received . Therefore , when I attended the Sabbath service in the Nazareth synagogue , the presiding elder invited me to read the lesson . I read from the prophet Isaiah : The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor . He has sent me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blind , to set at liberty those who are oppressed , to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord . I closed the book , handed it to the elder , and sat down . As if they expected an unprecedented announcement , all present fastened their eyes on me . I did not disappoint them . I declared : " Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears . " At first there was a general murmur of acceptance of what I said . An old man in Israel cried , " What wondrous words of grace proceed from his mouth ! "  | However , the implications in the statement I had made were clear to the rulers of the synagogue . Sarcastically they shouted , " Who is this that claims to be the fulfillment of Scripture ? Is not this the carpenter 's son ? Is not his mother called Mary , and his brothers James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas ? And his sisters , are they not all with us ? " Several of the leaders , obviously filled with indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . I halted them and said to the congregation , " It is difficult for a prophet to find honor in his own country and among his own people . " With that I passed through the midst of those gathered about me . My mother and the children were embarrassed by what had happened . I explained to them the issues involved , and I also told them that this is only the beginning . The wrath directed toward me by those in the Nazareth synagogue will not subside until it has consumed all of Galilee and Judea.  |  | We have now made the move to Capernaum . I shall never visit Nazareth again . Not because I am embittered by the hostility of my townsmen , but because of the sadness I feel when I look upon the city of my childhood being strangled by a small group of ruthless men . Nazareth is likely to become in Israel a symbol of decay and stagnation . The house to which we have moved beside the sea is a large structure made of white poplar logs and containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities of Tiberias and Bethsaida Julias . To the north lie Chorazin and Cxsarea Philippi , thriving cities of commerce and trade . We have been here a full month . As soon as we were settled , I lost no time in concentrating on the mission  | that is before me . I shall describe in a condensed form in this diary those experiences which seem to me most important . Four fishermen become disciples This is the way it happened : Early one morning I walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee not very far from our house . I saw four fishermen in two boats , straightening and cleaning their nets . Catching and selling fish is their trade . Though they have worked the waters of the Great Sea , the Sea of Galilee is their principal source of livelihood . The men had worked all night and caught nothing . This was unusual both because they were familiar with these waters and because they were using large nets which could be lowered to a great depth . I recognized the men as Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of years . Though we have long been acquainted , primarily in a business way , it has been only in recent months that they have achieved an understanding of who I am and what I have come into the world to do . If it had not been for the preaching of John the Baptizer , their minds would yet be darkened . But John they believed . I have become to them the Christ of God , long promised but now sent . The boats were dragged up on the beach . I climbed into one of them  --  Simon 's , I believe  --  and suggested that they row the boat once again to deep waters and let down the nets for another try . Wearily , Simon replied , It ,  | " We worked all night and caught nothing . . . but if you say it , we will let down the nets again . " They did as I suggested and , to my delight and their amazement , they hauled in so many fish that their nets began to stretch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hurried to the scene with a second boat . However , the haul of fish was so great that both boats began to sink , and great numbers of the fish had to be thrown back into the sea . The men could not believe what they had seen . They immediately interpreted the experience in miraculous terms , although actually it was nothing more than the capricious way of fish in water that had caused the great haul . Simon , overcome by the emotion he felt , approached me , fell on his knees , and cried , " Do not touch me , Lord . I am a doubting , sinful man . " Though the other men were less demonstrative , they too were impressed by what had happened . I said to them , " This is a small thing . In the ministry that shall be ours together , you shall literally see the lost saved , the dead brought back to life , and angels - , descending and ascending to heaven . " " When shall this be ? " Simon asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave your nets and follow me , you shall see the things for which Israel has been waiting these many years . The kingdom of God is at hand and you shall be instrumental not in catching fish but in bringing men into the kingdom . " These are my first disciples . They are hardly more than twenty years of age . Simon is the only one who is married . Though there is nothing sacred about the  | number , I eventually would like to have twelve disciples . Hundreds of other teachers and their disciples have arisen in Israel and can be seen walking the city streets and the country roads begging for food and proclaiming their message . Though I shall not beg for food , at least in one way I shall be like them . I , too , shall have twelve disciples . In the synagogue There are several synagogues in Capernaum , including one for Greek-speaking Jews . Most of the time , however , I attend the synagogue where the traditional language of Israel is spoken . On a Sabbath not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . The service was interrupted by a man who appeared to be crazed . He staggered into Capernaum from the cave area south of the sea . Fetters and chains were hanging loose about his hands and feet . This was the man that I had heard our neighbors describe as the wild man of the Gadarenes who every night could be heard screaming among the caves . He had cut himself until his body was red with his own blood . As the man approached me , the people in the synagogue drew back in fear . He knelt before me and in the midst of his demonic condition yelled , " Yeshua , son of Almighty God , heal me if you will , but do not torture me . " I stooped by his side and asked him to lie flat on his back . A straw kneeling-cushion was placed under his  | head . His eyes twitched and his mouth dripped with spittle . In a low voice , I said , " Look into my eyes and be still . You shall-be demon-possessed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be whole and clean . " Softly and slowly , I repeated , " Listen to me . You shall be whole and clean . You shall know your name , and you shall return strong and well to your own country . " Within a matter of minutes , the crazed man 's muscles ceased twitching , and he controlled the spittle that dripped from his mouth . He arose , brushed himself with a borrowed handkerchief , and wiped the blood from his wrists and chest . In his gratitude he asked , " May I stay here and serve you with my life ? " But I knew there was a more effective way in which he could witness . I replied , " Go home to your on people and let them see what God has done for you . " The crazed man , now made whole , left and began to spread throughout the ten neighboring cities the story of what I had done for him . There was no more lesson in the synagogue on that Sabbath . The people who were astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more astonished at the healing of the man who was demon-possessed . A large number of people from other cities were present . When they returned home , they reported these things to the rulers of their synagogues . As a consequence I received many invitations to visit towns and cities throughout Galilee . The truth I learned from my encounter with the demon-possessed man is this : " Sanity "  | and " insanity " are relative in terms . All human life on this earth , at times , seems to be life in one vast asylum . In Simon 's house As I left the Capernaum synagogue I was told of the critical illness of Simon 's mother-in-law , who lives in the house with him and his wife . We found the old lady stricken with a high fever . I took her by the hand and lifted her to her feet . The fever left her . In her gratitude she kissed my cheek and immediately began to prepare supper for all of us . The word about my healing power spread rapidly throughout the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sick and afflicted in many ways , walked or were carried to Simon 's house to receive my touch . With gladness of heart I healed everyone who came . All through the night they came . Simon and Andrew , James and John remained with me , assisting in many needful ways . For them and for me it was a memorable , never-to-be-forgotten night . When dawn finally came , I slipped outside the city to a secluded spot where I could be alone and pray in private . However , the multitudes from the city streets came in search of me . They found the place where I rested and prayed , and in great earnestness implored me to stay in Capernaum and minister to them exclusively . In kindness but in firmness I said to them , " I must bring the glad tidings of the kingdom to all the cities of Galilee . For this purpose I was sent . "  | Accompanied by my four disciples , I started a mission to the ten cities surrounding the Sea of Galilee . The welcome we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to be healed . Officers and rulers in the synagogues were less enthusiastic in their acceptance , but still they were not hostile . The faith of Israel was being revived . Attendance at religious services was dramatically increasing and the prestige of teachers , priests , and presiding superintendents was being lifted to a new level . The noncommital attitude of the rulers of the people in the cities we visited was determined by the simple proposition : " Thus far he has helped us more than hurt us . " No one knew better than I that when the tide turned and the teacher from Nazareth became a threat to purse or entrenched power , the attitude of the leaders would quickly change to organized antagonism . Toward the end of this mission I touched a leper for the first time in my life . In all of Israel there is no more destitute person . Because his disease is considered to be the judgment of God for personal wickedness , the leper is excluded from family , friends , synagogue , and all of society . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in caves . There are far more of these unfortunate creatures now than when I was a boy . But few people seem to care . Some say , " This is God 's punishment for wrongdoing . " Others wag their heads piously and preach , " This is the will of God . " I met this particular man , torn and bleeding , on a  | lonely road south of the Sea of Galilee near a place called Gadara . His face was bloated . From cavern-like holes in his cheeks , a thick and foul pus was oozing . Kneeling , he reached his spotted hands toward me . " Lord , " he cried , " make me clean , make me clean ! " I stretched forth my hand and touched him . His body quivered from head to foot . I said simply , " Be clean . " Once again the power of God was demonstrated to be superior to the powers of this world . At this point I told the leper something which I have not deemed necessary to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that he might be reinstated in the community and with his family  --  I insisted that he keep to himself the details of his healing at my hands . Since I began this mission of healing , a development has taken place which gives me cause for concern . I am gradually becoming known and accepted as the healer of men 's bodies rather than the savior of men 's lives . My problem in ministering to the needs of the whole man rather than merely to his physical needs will increase . The flesh often assumes the dominant role in the affairs of men . A tooth when it aches is more demanding than the desire for God . The leper could not contain his joy . Instead of keeping to himself the details of his healing , he published the news from one end of Galilee to another , with the result that whenever I enter a city the multitudes gather . There is excitement , congestion , and sometimes panic . When the pressure becomes unbearable , I seek a secluded spot either in the wastelands beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back home This afternoon I returned to our comfortable house by the sea . My mother is well , the girls are lively and happy , and the boys , having assumed the full responsibility of our cabinetmaking business , are doing as well without me as with me . In addition to constructing houses and , refinishing furniture , they have ventured into the boat building business . Capernaum is one of the most thriving cities on the Sea of Galilee . Unless an unexpected business recession occurs , they should do well . After the evening meal , but before the setting of the sun , a crowd gathered outside our front door and asked me to speak to them . Standing in the doorway , I taught the people that the hopes , prayers , and yearnings of Israel had at last been realized . That which was to come has come . The kingdom with its power and glory is here . No longer need the children of men sit in darkness and wait for the promise of God . The kingdom has broken through from heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what he is . The power of sin and death is at last shattered . Though all men may know of the wondrous act of God , not all will in faith receive it . The farmer scatters his seed . Some of it falls by the roadside and the birds devour it . Some seed falls on stony patches where there is too little soil . Plants spring up quickly , but the sun scorches them , and they wither because they have no root . Some seed falls among thorn bushes and the thorns grow up and choke the life out of them . But other seed falls on good and re-  | ceptive soil , roots take hold , and a bounteous crop is produced . The seed sown on the stony patches is illustrative of the man who hears the message and eagerly accepts it . But it has not taken root in him . When trouble or persecution arises , the message has lost its purpose and meaning . To such a man the kingdom has come to earth only to prevent him from knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protection . The seed sown among the thorns illustrates the man who hears and accepts the kingdom but then permits the deceptive pleasures of wealth to choke out every resemblance of life . Truly , it is harder for a man who has piled wealth upon wealth to enter the kingdom than it is for a camel to go through the eye of a needle . A man 's heart is where his treasure is . But the seed sown on receptive soil where roots grow deep is illustrative of people who hear , believe , and live the message . The kingdom of God has meaning to them . To possess it , or to be possessed by it , is a treasure of more value than all of the offerings of this world . It is the pearl of great price . While I was speaking in this manner , there was a commotion among the crowd . Four men bearing a stretcher carried a man sick of the palsy . They lifted him through the large window at the rear of the house . Now they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To my surprise I learned that they had borne the man all the way from Jerusalem , a journey of five days . But what was even more remarkable , they had been followed every mile of the way by a delegation  | from Jerusalem . These prominent men were scribes and Pharisees , members of a special committee appointed by Caiaphas the high priest and duly approved by the Sanhedrin . They had come to Capernaum to interview witnesses , to hear personally what I have to say , and to observe my ministry at close hand . The information which they collect will of course be properly prepared in report form and turned over to the Sanhedrin for whatever action is necessary . The man lying on the stretcher before me was a sick man , but he was also a man caught in the web of sin . From my point of view , though palsy is serious enough , it is not so serious as entering eternity with the soul alienated from God who gave it life . What shall it profit a man to achieve physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharisees pressed closer to where the man lay . I spoke to him : " Son , be of good cheer ! Your sins are forgiven . " The palsied man 's face relaxed . A burden greater than an afflicted body was lifted from him . He knew the blessing of forgiveness . He was now prepared to live or die . His four companions who had carried him on the long journey were openly disappointed that I spoke to the man about his sins rather than about his illness . The crowd did not know whether to be astonished or disappointed . One of the Pharisees , however , gasped for breath when I said to the man , " Your sins are forgiven . " He managed to say to his fellow committee members , " Who is this man that speaks such blasphemy ? It is serious  | business to play God . No man can forgive sins . This is something that only God can do . " When he had so spoken , I lifted my voice and asked , " Which is easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk ' ? " No one uttered a word . In the quietness of the dying day , I could hear the sick man 's heavy breathing . Looking directly at him I declared : " That you may know that I have power on earth to forgive sins , I say to you , Arise , take up your bed and walk . ' " Instantly he arose . His sick body had been made whole . He was a happy , grateful man . He left with the praise of God on his lips and in his heart . The people were hushed . This day they had heard the word of God with their own ears . And they had seen a demonstration of the power of God both to forgive sins and to overcome sickness . Someone in the crowd whispered , " We have seen strange things this day . " The scribes and Pharisees were silenced . And they were confused . False prophets , phony healers , and teachers who would rather beg for a living than to work were to them a familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among this growing horde of itinerant evangelists , they did not doubt . But now they were puzzled . They had to make some kind of report to the officials in Jerusalem . What could they say ? I had the feeling that in the days ahead I would see more of these men .  | The word " blasphemer " in Israel is a scare word . To my knowledge there is none stronger . On the day following the incident with the palsied man , the members of the committee appointed by Caiaphas offered their version of what had happened . This man , they said , had never been sick at all , but had been carried all the way from Jerusalem for dramatic effect only . In order to advance my own cause and prestige , they charged , he had collaborated in a staged production , while actually as healthy as anyone present . All the time he was a secret disciple of mine , they asserted  --  a completely untrue statement if I ever heard one . However , it was the word " blasphemer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest . To the pious believer there is no person more degraded than  | one who blasphemes the name of God . The logic of the committee 's argument proceeded in this manner : First , only God can forgive sins ; second , Yeshua of Nazareth is a man of flesh who claims to forgive sins ( all present had heard the absolution I offered the man ) ; third , therefore , Yeshua of Nazareth is a blasphemer , for he usurps the place and power accorded only to God . ( The people hesitated to accept this logical conclusion , but the seed of doubt had been planted in their minds . ) The time for the Festival of the Passover was drawing near and , as is my custom , I planned to make the pilgrimage . I hoped it would be possible for my disciples to accompany me . This would be my first Passover since the beginning of my ministry ten months ago . In addition to Simon ( who is now called Peter ) , his brother Andrew , and James and John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nathanael ( sometimes called Bartholomew ) , and a worldly man of Capernaum known as Matthew the tax collector . The night before we left for Jerusalem , Matthew gave a great banquet in my honor to which he invited the disciples and a large number of his fellow tax collectors . It was an elaborate affair , held in the garden of Matthew 's country estate . It has been difficult for the other disciples to accept this man . They hold two things against him : He is the hated chief tax collector of the city of Capernaum , a man who for profit has joined hands with Rome in exploiting his own people . The other thing concerns Matthew 's wealth ( which he is on the verge of giving away ) . The other disciples are not paupers , but they are poor , hard-working fishermen and  | they are accustomed to limited , crude ways of living . To them a two-room house is a luxury . What they know best is a one-room , mud-brick house , lived in by mother and father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a king could maintain both a home in the city and one in the country . Thus Matthew , with his privileged ways of living , has introduced some real problems to our small group . Nevertheless , by the time we had gathered in the fragrant garden and started partaking of the delicious food , the disciples ' awkwardness disappeared . They enjoyed the evening almost as much as I did . From an unidentified source Matthew had learned what my favorite foods are and these had been bountifully prepared . On the table were charcoal-broiled trout , quail , pigeon 's breast , roast lamb , and stuffed pheasant . There were cucumbers , string beans , olives , figs , grapes , and ( of course ) my favorite pomegranates . For dessert we ate domestic honey and small sweet cakes with almond centers . Both sweet and sour wines were served . Before the evening passed , the flaming word spread throughout Capernaum that the new teacher from Nazareth had gotten drunk at a wild party given for him by Matthew , the contemptible tax collector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had included not only the teacher 's disciples but some of Capernaum 's most notorious publicans and sinners . The rulers of the synagogues , who had been disturbed by the " blasphemy " charge of the committee from Jerusalem , were now ready to admit that Yeshua of Nazareth was a bad influence . They shook their heads , sucked  | their tongues , and clicked their teeth . " For shame , " they said , " he eats with publicans and sinners and he is a winebibber ! " So to add to blasphemer , there is another word that I shall not soon live down . The word is " winebibber . " One repercussion from Matthew 's great feast , I had not expected . A group of men , disciples of John the Baptizer , came to see me . They arrived as we were about to leave for Jerusalem . These men had been baptized by John and were now living in Capernaum . In approaching me these disciples were courteous but cool . " What is the correct version of what happened last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Though I did not feel obligated to offer a defense or apology , I recounted for them precisely what took place . I replied , " You must not put new wine into old wineskins . " A more unfortunate metaphor I could not have chosen , since neither John nor his disciples permit wine to touch their lips . But the metaphor said what I wanted it to say . Something new and exciting has come to Israel . The joy of knowing personally the Father 's love can not be poured into the legalistic ways of Moses or the Essenes . A more acceptable analogy would have been : No man tears a piece from a new garment and sews it to an old garment , else he will tear both the old and the new . The piece from the new will not agree with the old and the garment will look worse than before . John 's disciples were on their way to Jerusalem , but  | they refused to walk with us . They were in a hurry to attend the Festival of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was their plan to visit John , who was still preaching by the Jordan not far from the caves of Qumran . Realizing that the members of the Sanhedrin committee had by now made their report , I decided not to give the rulers of the people in Jerusalem undue cause to create a disturbance . To enter into controversy for the sake of being controversial is cheap play-acting . But I was caught unawares . Before the Passover had ended , I discovered the amazing degree to which these religious leaders can be enraged by a trivial matter . I passed by the large pool which lies near the sheep gate in the great wall encircling Jerusalem . During an important religious festival , large numbers of sick and afflicted people are brought to the city not only to worship God but to enter the magic waters of this particular pool in the hope of finding health and wholeness . If this act does not produce the desired results , hawkers by the dozen are on hand to sell charms , gems , amulets , and phylacteries of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caiaphas , the high priest , who receives a percentage from every sale . I stopped in front of a crippled man who had not been helped either by Caiaphas ' phylacteries or by the pool 's magic waters . Later I learned that he had been in this crippled condition for thirty-eight years . Everyone about the pool was so intent upon his own misery that the old man lay on the stone walk unhelped and  | unnoticed . I stopped and looked at him . Confidently , but without lifting my voice , I spoke : " Arise , take up your bed and walk ! " Confidence rose to meet confidence . Trust met trust . Faith leaped to meet faith . The crippled man was instantly made whole . He took up his bed and walked . His family and friends rejoiced with him . It never occurred to me that the scribes and the Pharisees could capitalize on this act of love . I could not have been more mistaken , for the healing had taken place on the Sabbath . To these men who reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sabbath  --  notwithstanding the fact that a sick man was made whole  --  had been grossly violated . That the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath can not be grasped by minds steeped in legalism . Simon Peter slipped up to me and whispered , " Lord , you have stirred the wrath of the Pharisees . Violation of the Sabbath is added to the charges made by the committee that visited Capernaum . They now plot to kill you . " I knew that the threat was neither idle nor exaggerated . Outside the Temple I explained to a small group of people that I am no enemy of Moses . I have come to fulfill and to make meaningful the Law . To the Pharisees I said with directness , " I will not make accusation against you before God . There is one who accuses you , even Moses himself , he upon whom you have set your hope . If you really believed Moses , you would trust me , for Moses wrote of me . " On the way home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Andrew plucked several ears of corn and prepared them for an evening meal . This , too , occurred on the Sabbath . A group of Pharisees returning to Capernaum observed this act and voiced their indignation . " Healing on the Sabbath we might accept , " one of them said , " but plucking corn on the Sabbath , never . Is it not against the Law to do such a thing ? " Sickened by this type of petty criticism , I had no mind to quarrel with them . However , I chose an episode out of the life of David the King and reminded them of it . I asked , " Did you never read what David did when he hungered and could not get other food ? He , and those with him , entered the house of God and ate the shewbread , the sacred food , which is not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat . " The Capernaum Pharisees muttered something about my not being a spiritual man and walked away . The first Sabbath following our return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By now the attitude of many of the people has grown almost as cool toward me as that of their rulers . My mother tells me that several of her neighbors have ceased speaking to her . Her son is a blasphemer , a winebibber , and a breaker of the Sabbath , they say . Like any mother she is disturbed and upset by such statements . It was especially difficult for her when one of the older women said , " It is a pity your son , who tries to help everyone else , is deranged and can not help himself . " Before we attended yesterday 's service at the synagogue , my mother prayed at the morning meal that nothing would happen to mar the occasion . But she  | was to be disappointed by an unexpected development . As the service started , I was approached by a man with a withered hand . He came near but said not a word . He looked at me with an imploring look of helplessness . Instantly the scribes and Pharisees were on their feet . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes snapped . The disciples stood by in awed silence . My mother sobbed . All present waited to see whether or not I dared heal the man in the synagogue on the Sabbath . I felt the evil presence of him who had visited me in the Wilderness of Judea . And I told myself that I could do as much for this cripple tomorrow as I could do today . By waiting one day beyond the Sabbath , I could save my mother from embarrassment and avoid an open clash with the officials of the Capernaum synagogue , most of whom have made an effort to accept their strange neighbors from Nazareth . But I hesitated only a moment . The issue must be faced . Is it unlawful to do good on the Sabbath ? This was the question , and the answer was obvious . Healing this man was a good and joyful thing to do  --  Sabbath or no Sabbath ! Without further delay I said to the man , " Stretch forth your hand ! " In faith he did so , and the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at his nets , no longer hindered by a withered hand . Life among men is serious and deadly enough without religious restrictions making it worse . From now on , I shall not hesitate even for one moment to do everything in my power to lift the heavy yoke which the rulers have laid on the people .  | I spent last night from sundown to sunup in uninterrupted prayer . The peak to which I climbed is the beauty spot of all Galilee . It is on Mount Tabor , four miles from the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee . Though by no means the tallest peak in the area , it is the most luxuriant . The grass is heavy and green , the foliage thick and wild . Around the marshes the lilies grow white and fresh . Beyond the cleared area ( which has become to me something of a temple ) there is a brilliant display of colors . Amid the olive green branches grow the wild flowers most often associated with the beauty of Galilee . In wondrous arrangement are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and oleander . The sky forms the temple 's vaulted ceiling . On the east side of this  | shrub-enclosed peak there is a small opening no larger than a lamb 's head . Through it the Sea of Galilee , now calm and peaceful , now restless and turbulent , can be seen in the distance . When I am surrounded in such fashion by the beauties and wonders of nature , it is easy for me to understand how it happens that certain people fall into the error of worshiping nature rather than nature 's God . One can easily forget that there are areas in nature which need redemption just as desperately as does man himself . Like man , nature was created in majestic perfection , but also like man , nature has been infected with a demonic poison . Thus it is nature 's way that the mighty lion feeds on the helpless fawn . Embedded in the heart of nature are the seeds of leprosy and bodily decay . These ugly spots are as much a part of nature as are the lilies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the redemption which only the God of power and love can bring to it . During the long night of prayer I had one specific object in mind . The time has come for me to complete the circle of my disciples . This I have done today . The following men will forever be associated with me and my earthly ministry . The circle now complete includes : SIMON PETER . He is as tall and husky as John the Baptizer , but there the resemblance stops . John is fierce in countenance ; Simon radiates kindness and joviality . Simon is the oldest of the group . He talks incessantly , and whereas some people keep their thoughts to themselves , Simon reveals his to the whole world as he speaks . He laughs naturally and often . Though loud and bois-  | terous , his mirth is never offensive . He is sensitive to what other people think and say , and he can be easily influenced . ANDREW . Simon 's brother but as different from him as silk is from sackcloth . Andrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older brother take the lead in everything . He is dull but solid . In spite of his slowness it was he among all the disciples who first became convinced that Yeshua of Nazareth was more than a carpenter  --  that he was , in fact , the one for whom Israel had waited and prayed . JAMES . He is the son of Zebedee and Salome , lifelong friends of my mother . Like Simon and Andrew he has given up his fishing business , and he has done so with the blessing of his parents . James has a violent temper which can be exploded by the tiniest incident . His traditional prejudices are deep and jealously guarded . Chief among his objects of contempt are the Samaritans . JOHN . Brother of James and his partner in the small fishing business . The two men often pass for twins . Actually their age is less than a year apart . The most distinctive thing about their appearance is their short , powerful build . John , like his brother , burns with ambition . Until he joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the largest fishing business on the Sea of Galilee . He and James worked longer and harder than any of their competitors . Their disregard for the needs and feelings of other people put them ahead , but it also made them the most disliked fishermen in all of Galilee . PHILIP . A native of Bethsaida , a city in Galilee just  | north of Capernaum . The house in which he lived from childhood was a stone 's throw from that of Simon and Andrew . A limited man without education , Philip possesses an insatiable curiosity about things beyond this world . Like most of the disciples he was strongly influenced by the preaching of John the Baptizer . However , he intuitively knew that there was something lacking in John 's message . Philip has long been convinced that there is a value beyond the Law . The God of love he wants to see , know , and serve . NATHANAEL . This man is often called Bartholomew ? why , I do not know . It is a much more difficult name to pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic standing is far below that of Micah and Deborah ( whose Cana wedding festival I recently attended ) , he was accepted by them as a friend . He is frank to the point of bluntness . When he was told by Philip that I  --  and not John the Baptizer  --  was the Christ , and that I was from Nazareth , he laughed . Like most natives of Cana , he despises Nazareth . He is ashamed that this city , so near Cana , is a part of Galilee . He once remarked , " It belongs in Judea or better still in the heart of Samaria . With its filth and smell , it does not belong in Galilee . " He and Philip are close friends . Misunderstood by the other disciples , nevertheless they understand each other . But their greatest need at the present time is to be less concerned about each other and more concerned about the total group . MATTHEW . He is better educated than any of the other disciples , and has prospered to a greater degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | taxes for the Roman government . Like most tax collectors he has laid aside considerable money . He is lonely and isolated . I have waited to see which of the disciples would be the first to take him as a friend , but thus far none has made the move in his direction . All his life Matthew has been a great spender . By the giving of many gifts he has tried to win friends . It turned out , however , that the people who accepted his gifts , ate his food , and drank his wine disliked him all the more . The man really thought that money could do anything . He has learned the hard way that it can not buy friendship . I would not be surprised if he gave away everything he owns . THOMAS . What a complex person this one is ! Stubborn and mulish , he thinks he knows far more than any of the other disciples . His vocabulary abounds in trite statements : " Seeing is believing " ; " A fish in the hand is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap " ; and so forth . He is cautious and conservative and ignorant . There is hardly anything sadder than an ignorant man who does not know that he is ignorant . Thomas will expound at length on almost any subject , and when he is finished he has convinced no one . He has only revealed his own inner emptiness . But I am attracted to the man , stubborn and ignorant as he is . What if one day this stubbornness is transformed into loyalty ? What if this ignorance is made into the very wisdom of God ? SIMON THE ZEALOT . Next to Simon Peter this man is my favorite disciple , but he will not let me get close to him . He is a rebel at heart , a revolutionist who believes  | in the violent overthrow of the government . He is impatient with men like Nathanael who dislike the harmless Samaritans . It is Rome he hates . For a number of years he has been an active member of an underground party called the Zealots . He is a harsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believes that any methods , however violent , are good if they help to achieve their purpose . David the King is his hero . Simon thinks not so highly of David 's poetry as he does of the King 's power and might . Murder , seduction , lying , treachery , and violence all marked the reign of David . These were right , Simon contends , because they were the surest means of achieving desired results . Yet Simon the Zealot is beginning to doubt his first and most cherished beliefs relating to violence . He agonizes over every conviction in his patriotic faith . Giving up any point ( such as the belief that the assassination of Roman soldiers and rulers is right ) convulses him as deeply as standing before an open grave and watching the earth gradually cover the body of one 's own child . By day and by night , I suffer with Simon the Zealot . I wish I could help him more , but there are some things he must work out by himself . JAMES THE LESS . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . I have known him since childhood . It is fortunate that he is pleasant and good-natured , for he is often the object of the disciples ' gibes and jokes . He is not quite five feet tall . His body is thin and birdlike . The most prominent thing about him is his nose . With its great hump in the middle , it dominates all other facial features . Even were he a giant  | of a man , James ' nose would be the first noticeable thing about him . He and Simon Peter often walk together , and the contrast in their appearances attracts many amused glances . James could have one and only one nickname . So the disciples affectionately call him " Shorty . " JUDAS , sometimes called Thaddaeus . He is brother to James the Less . And , as is the case with James , I have known him since childhood . In a large crowd of people Judas would be the last noticed . As far as I can tell , he has no distinctive features . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reserved but can talk when questioned . He has no skills or abilities that I have been able to observe . Judas Thaddaeus is a symbol of the " average " man . Not quite good , he is also not quite bad . He has manifested some interest but no excitement in the work which I have described . Yet his place in the circle is assured . He is representative of more people on this earth than all the other disciples put together . JUDAS ISCARIOT . The other eleven disciples were born and reared in Galilee , but Judas is from a little town in Judea called Kerioth . He is shifty and eager . As Matthew wants people to like him and will do anything to achieve their goodwill , Judas desires nothing more in life than to feel important . That which Matthew is considering throwing away  --  town house , country house , horses and chariots , hanging gardens , and rare furnishings from Babylon and Egypt  --  Judas Iscariot would give his soul to possess . He pretends to the other disciples that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been ) he was an important man . His brother , a prominent official who mediates all disputes between Rome and Israel , is married to a beautiful girl of great wealth who has borne him many sons . In Kerioth , Judas ' brother is the man most envied . Judas himself has more ability than any of the other disciples . There is hardly anything he can not do . He writes convincingly , he speaks persuasively . He is a clever promoter and organizer . He is a man of many talents . His gift to the world could be great . The work to which I have called the disciples is strange . That it is also dangerous they as yet do not know . For several days I have planned to take the entire group aside  --  perhaps up to the top of Mt . Tabor ? and review with them some of the ideas I have been pondering . However , before I made the suggestion that we go apart , Simon Peter approached me in unbounded eagerness and said , " Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give us the rules for living the good life ? If the commandments of Moses are like an old piece of garment , worn and tattered , we want a new set of commandments . We want something simple and practical . " I have many things to say to these men , but what I shall say will often not be simple and neither will my suggestions seem practical . It is not practical to return hate with love , and in like manner it is not practical for a man to love God more than he loves his possessions . I can not give my disciples a list of rules to live by . To do so would be to substitute one form of legalism  | for another . Obviously there are certain ultimate references , yardsticks by which a man may judge his actions . However , deeds which are done to fulfill the requirements of a set of rules  --  those of Moses or of myself ? are but weeds . Actions empowered by love  --  love of God and love of one 's neighbor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disciples apart and describe for them " the absolutes " by which all human actions may be measured . What shall I say that they be not confused but rather filled with understanding ? Random thoughts come to my mind even as I write these words for the diary . I shall jot them down . After sleeping on them I may change a point here and there , but for the most part , here are some of the things I shall tell them : ? The good life awaits the humble , the meek , and the pure , rather than the proud and haughty . ? Makers of peace are the sons of God . ? Persecution for supporting the right is inevitable . ? Legalistic righteousness must be excelled by righteousness prompted by faith and love . People whose actions are empowered by love are the salt of the earth , the light of the world . ? Murder violates the Law , but murder has its roots in angry passion . Thus passion that prompts murder is also judged . ? Lust for the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the thought and the desire which precede the act . Carnality is self-destructive.  | ? Swearing of oaths by heaven or by the Law is an empty gesture . If a man is honest , if his deed is as good as his word , swearing by that which is sacred has no value . His word of " yes " or " no " is sufficient . ? The " eye for an eye " way of life may express justice , but it does not fulfill the law of love . Negative justice is often cruel and harsh , but love is kind and long-suffering . ? The good life is the life that turns the other cheek , that gives away both tunic and cloak to those in greater need ; it is going the second mile . It is more : it is loving those who hate you . The heathen who know not God love those of their kind and those who do them well , but the good life insists that those not our kind and those who do us ill are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He who in pretense parades his spirituality is an offense to the kingdom . To give alms , to pray , to fast in order to be seen of men , or in order to persuade God , is hypocrisy . God is to be worshiped and served because he is God and for no other reason . - Piling wealth upon wealth can not be justified . A man 's heart is where his treasure is . On the other hand , it is possible in this life to produce treasures in the life to come and these are not subject to the ravages of moth , rust , thieves , or of time itself . Anxiety about food and drink , chariots and beautiful clothes is evil . " Living for tomorrow " is the severest form of deception . Take each day  --  with its good and bad  --  as it comes . Let each day be lived as if it were the beginning and the end of life .  | ? Irresponsible criticism of others tells the whole world that something is wrong in the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , is not simply a privilege to be enjoyed by a creature made in the image of God ; it is a sacred responsibility . ) ? Ultimate references such as I have written here always suggest a narrow gate and a straight road . This conception can not be avoided . The master musician is slave to a limited number of notes . The builder of a mighty tower can not do with bricks and stones as he desires . He , like the musician , must work within limits . The jarring notes of a flute are harsh to the ears , and a tower that leans and crumbles is a menace to all who seek its shelter . ? The good life is the life of faith and obedience to God . He who accepts these values is like a man who constructs his house on solid rock . Neither wind nor rain nor flood can destroy that which is so built . Tomorrow , I must say something about prayer . How shall I put it ? Discussing one 's personal habits in prayer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be as helpful as possible . ? Learn to call God " Father . " The believer must know that God is approachable , but he must never become familiar with God . God is Father , but he is also King . Men are children , but they are also subjects . It is wise to take off shoes , bow the head , and kneel before God . It is easy for the creature to forget that he is a creature . Adoration is the heart of prayer and worship . Pray for the kingdom which has now come on  | earth that it may be fully and finally realized . Pray for bread and the necessities of life . Pray to be delivered from temptation ; if not delivered , strengthened in the presence of temptation . Pray for the forgiveness of your sins and believe that God is more eager to forgive than you are to receive . ? Ask and it shall be given you , Seek and you shall find , Knock and it shall be open to you . ? Everyone that asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that knocks , the door is opened . ? No man among you will give his son who has asked for bread , a stone . Neither will he give him a serpent if he asks for a fish . If you then , being evil and limited , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more does God know how to give good gifts to his children who ask in faith ! Find a closetroom , and when you have shut the door pray to God your Father , and he who is unseen will hear , and according to his wisdom and love he will answer . What important days these have been ! I have set the standards by which human activity is to be measured and I have called my disciples . What manner of men are these ? In all of Israel could twelve more unpromising men be found ? For the most part they are uneducated . Only three of them  --  Simon Peter , Matthew , and Judas Iscariot  --  can read and write . They are vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight among themselves . They grudgingly hold all of Israel 's deep-seated prejudices . Like their ancestors of old , they are hearty , lusty men of the flesh . My disciples are now chosen . The wise and the mighty have not been called . There is little to commend these men , my new disciples . Yet there is everything to commend them ! My choosing has been careful and deliberate . Each one possesses all that is required of a disciple . Goodness is not required , because no man is good . Prestige is not required . This often becomes an instrument of pride . Skills and talents are not required ; the world is to be saved not by human cleverness but by the power of God . What , then , do these men possess which commends them to the task that shall make them survive in the lives of generations yet unborn ? Two things they possess : they are teachable and they believe in me as a child believes in his father . They do not understand me but they trust me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power of God , they shall be reborn . The molding and making of these lives will take time , but where faith is , God 's salvation knows no bounds .  |  | My disciples have been chosen , and I am satisfied with the group as it is . However , I would be less than frank if I did not say that I hoped there would be at least one Pharisee among them . He would be a man brilliant and capable , yet teachable and full of faith . Thus far no Pharisee in Israel has shown an inclination to cast his lot with Yeshua of Nazareth , but the time will come when God will raise up such a man who will speak to Israel and Gentile alike . I shall continue my search for such a man . I am a teacher . Among other things , therefore , I am committed to the proposition that the truth  --  specifically the truth about God  --  will set a man free . But how is truth to be imparted or conveyed ? Certainly the spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But are they exhaustive ? Can the spoken and written word convey all the truth ? I think not . The majority of my disciples are unlearned men . They can not read the written word . And they often can not understand the spoken word . With all the skill I possess I teach them . I impart to them the truth , but only in snatches and fragments do they grasp the meaning of what I say . Therefore , there must be  --  there is ? an additional form through which the truth of God is conveyed and appropriated . This is through the life that is lived , the grace that is given , the love that is experienced . This form of truth is not discovered or logically proved . It is given by God , and it is appropriated by faith . The lives of the disciples will be more drastically changed by their encounter with the life of God than by the words which I speak or write . The longer I am in the flesh , the more restless I become with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid judgment is that men deserve far more credit than is generally given them for participating in the life of this world . To be a dying member of dying humanity  --  and to know that this is the case  --  is weight enough to bear . The city of Nain lies south of Nazareth about four miles , the distance that Cana is to the north . It is a day 's journey from Capernaum . Here is the home of Thomas , my most cautious disciple . Here also lives Thomas ' widowed sister , a dear lady who has had more than her share of ill fortune . Several years ago her husband and three sons were killed in a violent windstorm . Since then she has assumed full responsibility for her  | house and her young son , her only surviving child . A few days ago Thomas received word that this remaining child , the love of his sister 's life , has been critically ill and lies , near death . " Lord , " he pleaded , half believing and half not believing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Thomas and several of the other disciples , I walked the pleasant road that leads from Capernaum to Nain . As we approached the city gate in the late afternoon , we were met by a large gathering of people . It was a funeral procession , a common sight throughout the land . Walking in front of the casket and receiving comfort from a priest and a teacher , a faithful lady in Israel , now broken and aged beyond her years , sobbed quietly . Yet there were no tears in her sobbing , for life had wrung from her all the tears she was capable of shedding . As the open casket was borne nearer to us , Thomas cried , " Look , it 's my sister ! Her son has been taken . ' We are too late . " One look at the woman 's tragic face moved me to compassion . I approached her , put my hand on her shoulder , and said , " Your son shall live . " Then while the pallbearers , the priest , the teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open casket and called , " Young man , wake up ! Arise ! " This is the first time that I have so encountered death . It will not be the last . The life of God is lord over death . This principle must be made explicit both to myself and to my disciples . If ever I needed reassurance  | at this point , it came in abundance as the young man 's cold dead flesh took on new life . He sat up and in a natural manner began to talk . Taking him by the hand , I helped him out of the casket . The sense of joy and triumph was mine as I saw death , scared and impotent , flee before the life of God . Everyone present was awestruck by what happened . Some were confused , and some believed that another drama had been staged to further my ministry . Others , however , exclaimed : " God has turned his face toward Israel ! A prophet has arisen among us ! " It is now midnight . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night except myself . I must bring this section of the diary up to date . Within a few days I shall take the entire group of disciples on the most extended tour we have yet attempted . The trip will include Tyre and Sidon , Mt . Lebanon , Caesarea Philippi , and possibly Mt . Hermon . When I am traveling in this fashion , the process of writing becomes more difficult . The best I can do is to take down pertinent notes and at a later date transcribe them . Soon after the evening meal , when the prayers for the day had been offered , three men came to the house and requested to see me in private . They were disciples of John the Baptizer from the ancient city of Machaerus . Unlike the delegation of John 's Capernaum disciples who had come to protest my disregard for certain aspects of the Law , these men came about a matter of crucial importance . Not finding me in Capernaum , they set out this morning for Nain . They caught up with our group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew . Preserving their anonymity , they found a room in a local inn , bathed and ate , and then sought my company . John had sent them to get a clear answer to a direct question . John is now being held prisoner in the great castle of Machaerus where Herod Antipas spends the winter months . His imprisonment resulted from his having openly denounced Herod for taking to bed the wife of his own brother , still living . Herodias , the king 's unlawful wife , is Jezebel come to life . Herod is fearful that John 's preaching will stir the people to revolt . Martyrdom for John appears inevitable . Trivial complaints like those of John 's Capernaum disciples try my patience to the breaking point . But the three men sitting before me , tired and worn after their seven days journey , had come with no such trivia . The word had reached John that I not only drink wine ( the term " winebibber " has stuck ) but disregard the Sabbath and number among my friends certain people of questionable character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burns in his mind by day and night : " Is Yeshua of Nazareth really the Christ , the son of God , who takes away the sins of the world , the fulfillment of Israel 's hopes and prayers ? " One of the men voiced it this way : " Are you he that we hoped would come to bring salvation to Israel or must we look for another ? " No more serious question can be raised . If I am not what I claim to be , I am a fraud . There can be no other alternative . To be known simply as " a great teacher , " " a noble man , " " a courageous prophet " is to confuse the issue . My claim before the world is that I  | am sent by God , that God 's nature dwells uniquely within me , and that I am the fulfillment of time and history . If this claim is false , I am not a great teacher , for I have violated the truth . I am not a noble man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a courageous prophet but only a deluded one . I hope I do not sound insane , pompous , or both , but am I to deny that to which God has called me ? The leader of the group that submitted the crucial question to me is a disciple of John but he is also an Essene . He did most of the talking . He described in glowing detail the ministry of a man known as the Teacher of Righteousness who had come to the Essenes , the supreme remnant in Israel . This teacher was wise and he was spiritual . He knew the Law , and he observed it in all points , and he demanded that his followers do the same . Some day , he said , Israel will again achieve the glory which was hers during the days of David the King , and this will come to pass because of the faithfulness of this holy remnant now living the separated life in the caves of Qumran . I do not share such hopes for Israel or for any other nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever again achieve Davidic glory . What is important is that Israel become an instrument in the hand of God , a new community which will bring to all people the good news of God 's grace and love . God has visited his people in the flesh . He loves them with everlasting love . The visitors from Machaerus demanded a clear answer to their direct question . They had witnessed the  | raising of the widow 's son . Therefore I replied : " Return to John and tell him what you have seen with your eyes and heard with your ears . The blind receive their sight , the lame are made to walk , lepers are cleansed , the deaf are made to hear , the poor and needy have the good news proclaimed to them , and the dead are raised up . After the men left , I awakened the disciples and told them about the discussion which had taken place . I reminded them that in the midst of John 's sternness there is a reverence for truth , a love for righteousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to life , John the Baptizer is Elijah . This led me to an observation about the frailty and the fickleness of the men of this generation . They are like children who play in the marketplace . They cry to each other : " We played the pipe for you and you would not dance , we wailed and mourned but you would not weep . " John the Baptizer came eating no bread nor drinking wine , and the people of this generation said , " Ile has a devil . " On the other hand , I have come both eating and drinking and the people cry , " Behold , a glutton , a winebibber , and a friend of publicans and sinners . "  |  | Must all of living be a dog-eat-dog existence ? Can not men live together without competing against each other for the necessities of life ? My younger brothers have a knack for business . Cabinetmaking in Capernaum has done well , but boatbuilding has developed into an even larger enterprise . These men have worked long hours every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospered . But , in achieving a modest degree of prosperity , they have had to take business from some of their neighbors . The result has been greater animosity between the natives of Capernaum and the newcomers from Nazareth . Even more serious , my brothers have jeopardized the very existence of other hard-working men , some with large families to feed ! Thus a vicious cycle has been instituted and unless  | a more sensible way to live together can be found , the situation will grow worse rather than better . To keep from begging on the streets as do many of Israel 's teachers , I have retained a share of the family business . My income from it is small but sufficient to care for my daily needs and to keep a little something in the common purse . As I witnessed a Capernaum boatman lose his business because of my brothers ' greater success , I was abruptly reminded of how complex are the ways of justice and evil . I do not want to be a party to injuring anybody , yet I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally make the boats and underbid my neighbor . Though in time I will cease taking any money  --  even a small share  --  from the business , still the problem will not be solved . I too am caught in the interlocking tragedy of this world . There is among men a strange solidarity to the ways of evil . My brothers presented the disciples with a new boat , one large enough to carry all of us from one end of the Sea of Galilee to another with less effort . The craft is light of weight , but it is sturdy . James , the oldest of my four brothers , has shown an interest in the work I am doing and on a number of occasions has accompanied us to various cities . Several weeks ago in the city of Bethsaida Julias , James was surprised and angered to see at first hand how one individual suffered from the dog-eat-dog tactics of those who exploited her . This particular person was once an important lady in Israel , a widow whose husband had adequately provided for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had daily an issue of  | blood . In addition she has suffered at the hands of many physicians who gradually demanded all of her savings . They accepted her money but helped her not at all . Now with money gone and health destroyed , she is an object unnoticed and uncared for by the rulers of the people . I stood in the streets of Bethsaida Julias and talked to a crowd of people . Even while I spoke , I felt a timid touch on the hem of my tunic . Turning , I asked , " Who touched me ? " This pitiful , emaciated creature , once no doubt a beautiful lady , said , " Lord , I did . I thought if I but could touch the hem of your garment I would be made whole . " Then she told me the story of her illness and the treatment she had received at the hands of many physicians . Hers was a superb demonstration of faith , and I was moved by it . I took her trembling hand , lifted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made you whole . Go in peace and be free from your plague of many years . " James , my brother , stood by and watched every detail of this dramatic experience . He is a quiet man , not given to many words . But the indignation he felt at the sight of the exploited young-old lady moved him to say , " These physicians and rulers ought to be doers of the word and not hearers only . Religion , pure and undefiled before God , surely includes nothing less than assisting widows and orphans in their affliction . " Before we left Bethsaida Julias , word reached us that Herod Antipas had destroyed John the Baptizer . The  | king had given John every opportunity to recant , but this he refused to do . His execution was carried out in a most brutal fashion . It was Herod 's birthday , and a banquet was held in the castle of Machaerus in honor of the event . Herodias ' beautiful daughter Salome danced for the king and his guests . Her beauty , grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king himself . Herod , drunk and impulsive , promised Salome anything for which she might ask , even to half of his kingdom . Quickly Herodias , Israel 's new Jezebel , went into action . She told her daughter to request neither houses , land nor jewels , but only the head of John the Baptizer , the man who had publicly humiliated her . She further wanted John 's head brought before the guests on a silver platter . Word of this gory exhibition would make the rounds and it would accomplish at least one important objective . Other wouldbe prophets in Galilee would give their considered judgment and ponder a second thought before they voiced a criticism of the king 's lady . Thus , in John 's death , Herodias achieved a personal victory which undoubtedly gave her precious satisfaction . The disciples of John approached me again in Bethsaida Julias and related the entire story . They also added an interesting piece of information . Herod Antipas , they reported , is now troubled by the ministry of Yeshua of Nazareth . He believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . No ruler among us is more superstitious than Antipas . He is surrounded by a large cast of soothsayers , magicians , fortune tellers , and miracle workers . He makes no decision without  | consulting one of his fakirs . John 's case was the exception . Herod , in his sodden drunkenness , reluctantly gave his official consent to John 's beheading , and he did so without outside assistance . Now the disciples of John say the king 's conscience troubles him so that he finds sleep difficult . Beyond the crowded streets of Bethsaida Julias , the rolling hills of Iturea lie soft and green . Much of this territory is desert wasteland , but that part which lies near the Sea of Galilee is fresh and fertile . Early one morning , accompanied by my disciples together with my brother James and the disciples of John who had joined us , I sought the stillness of this familiar countryside . But I soon learned that this was to be no quiet retreat . We were followed not only by many natives of the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capernaum , Chorazin , and Caesarea Philippi . These made the journey on foot around the northern shores of the Sea of Galilee and caught up with us as I began to teach the word of God . With the arrival of the people from Galilee , the crowd had grown into a vast multitude . Due to the efficient supervision of Judas Iscariot , master promoter and organizer , the people were orderly and attentive . The day wore on and night began to fall . At various intervals I called a halt to the discussion , but each time I stopped , some person raised an alert question , one that demanded a careful reply . At last I was reminded by one of the disciples that we had gone all day without food . The people who had made the early morning  | trip on foot from Galilee were weak and faint . Someone handed me five loaves and two fishes . I blessed them with prayer and asked that they become food for the thousands seated before me . The five loaves and two fishes were multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples , distributed the food to the waiting multitude . Though I have questioned using the power of God to turn water into wine at the wedding festival in Cana , I certainly have no reservation about multiplying the loaves and fish . The people were hungry . I fed them . The day following the feeding of the thousands , we returned to Capernaum in the new boat . On the Sabbath I taught in the nearby synagogue . Many people who had eaten yesterday of the bread and fish that came from my hand were present again to hear more of what I had to say . They also felt that I might be the answer to the serious economic plight which has befallen Israel under the Romans . The matter of survival is crucial . The system demands that the people exploit each other . Only the strong and the clever manage to exist while the weak and helpless are trampled under foot . There is no place in such an economy for those who can not get to the top . Being weak and without resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive . . . except as domestics or slaves . Those who had eaten of the loaves and fish were impressed by what had taken place . Yeshua of Nazareth was like no other prophet . If Israel 's food problem is to be solved , they believe , here is one who could do it .  | Certainly I realize that bread is important , but man can not live by bread alone . I talked to the people this day not about food for the body but about food for the soul . I explained to them that my own life represents a type of spiritual food which , eaten in faith , means abundant life . Whoever partakes of me shall live forever , for I am the bread of life , the life of God 's love . The people saw that I was not interested in becoming an economic adviser or political official , and they openly displayed their disappointment . For many reasons the statement I had made about being " the bread of life " was hard for them to accept . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Even my disciples were affected by the abrupt manner in which I shifted emphasis from bread for the body to bread for the soul . Several of the disciples were about to be caught up in the movement of the retreating crowd . Looking directly at them I asked , " Will you also go away ? " Without a moment 's hesitation Simon Peter ( even more enthusiastically than usual ) replied , " Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life . " The life of the entire group was stabilized and solidified by Simon Peter 's bold and forthright statement . Tomorrow we begin our longest tour to date . We go to the region of Tyre and Sidon , an area of Phoenicia which none of us has ever visited .  |  | Weeks have melted into months , and months into seasons . It is more than a year and a half since I began this ministry . The summer just past has been pleasant and memorable . In Bethsaida Julias and Capernaum , and in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lame , the blind , the deaf and dumb , the crippled , and the maimed . I have fed the hungry , raised the dead , and declared the word of God to all who would hear . Before leaving Nazareth on that occasion many months ago , I said to my fellow townsmen : " The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty those who are oppressed , and to proclaim the fact that the kingdom , the  | year of the Lord , has come . " Many people , but especially my disciples , have seen with their own eyes the detailed fulfillment of these words . The disciples are maturing . Faith and understanding are deepened . This does not mean that they are yet anything but ignorant and unlearned men . Ignorant and unlearned ; childish , petty , and easily frightened . But they are still teachable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The attitude of the rulers of the people , the scribes , Pharisees , priests , and Levites , has hardened . The lines are sharply drawn . Charges formally made by the powerful group in Jerusalem have been accepted almost without question by the religious forces throughout Judea and Galilee  --  even in Capernaum , where I had hoped to find a degree of acceptance . The attitude of the multitudes who have followed me from one city to another is more difficult to interpret . One day they give the impression of accepting me as the Christ of God . The next day the same people will gnash their teeth and declare that all the charges made by the rulers against me are true and that I should be exposed and punished as a child of the devil . The four days ' journey from Capernaum to Tyre and Sidon in the land of the Phoenicians was made without incident . For the most part we were ignored by the natives . Those few who gave us a second look took us to be just one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to avoid honest work . However , in the city of Tyre ( the streets of which no one of  | us had ever walked before ) , we were approached by a woman , a Syrophoenician by birth . Someone had told her who I was . Without hesitation , and even though she was of a different heritage than I , she knelt in front of me and cried , " Lord , my daughter is demon-possessed . One word from you and she will be healed . " This was my first face-to-face encounter with a person of this race . I decided to test her faith . Affecting a stern countenance , I spoke abruptly to her : " It is not right to take the children 's bread and cast it to the dogs . " ( I had often heard my friends refer to Gentiles as " dogs . " This , spoken in jest , was my first and I trust last use of this unfortunate epithet . ) The woman , whom some would call a heathen , suddenly disarmed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not good to give the children 's bread to the dogs . But even the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crumbs . All I am asking is a crumb from the bountiful table which God has set before Israel . " " My dear woman , " I said to her , " in all of Israel I have not seen more genuine faith . From this moment your daughter is clean and sound . " While I was speaking to the Syrophoenician woman , a painful and in retrospect amusing incident occurred . An angry bee stung me on the tip of my nose . Swelling started , and within minutes I was in severe pain , and my nose had swollen to almost twice its normal size . It was a nose to match in size that of James the Less . The throbbing pain brought tears to my eyes , and for a moment I gasped for breath . The woman whose daughter had been healed saw  | what happened . She kissed her daughter , now fully recovered from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of wild honey , butter , and herbs . Gently she rubbed the ointment on my nose until the pain subsided . It was several days , however , before the swelling went down . Thomas , one of the twelve , said to me , " Lord , you have brought recovery to this woman 's daughter . Why do you not heal yourself ? " I know that this is not the last time I shall hear the challenge : " Physician , heal yourself . " But the victory I won in the Wilderness of Judea is too precious to be lost over anything so small as a bee sting . I shall joyfully use God 's power to relieve the suffering of others , for I have come to minister and not to be ministered to . Nevertheless , under no circumstances will the power God has entrusted to me be used to save myself from the pain which mortals must bear . Before leaving Phoenicia we made plans to attend the Festival of Tabernacles in Jerusalem which comes at the end of summer . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the children of Israel in the wilderness , the pilgrims erect booths around and in Jerusalem , where they sleep and eat for seven days . When the year has been bountiful , as this one has , the fruits from grainfield , oliveyard , and vineyard are displayed . Passover and Pentecost are the first and second annual festivals which all able-bodied male Israelites are expected to attend . Tabernacles , the last of the three required festivals , is marked by a greater  | gaity than the other two . This year 's harvest has been surprisingly plentiful ; therefore , Jerusalem will be overrun with great crowds of rejoicing people . There was yet sufficient time to visit majestic Mt . Hermon before setting out for Jerusalem . Leaving the coast of Tyre and Sidon , we passed leisurely through the verdant valley that lies between the two mighty ranges of the Lebanon mountains . The trees of this area are unsurpassed in beauty and strength . Timber from these forests of cedar , fir , and cypress is used in the construction of masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship . But it was not Mt . Lebanon that we were determined to see on this trip . It was snow-capped Mt . Hermon , whose underground springs and streams nourish the Galilean valleys for miles around . We entered into the region of Caesarea Philippi . In the shadow of Mt . Hermon we rested as we discussed those things relating to the word of God . The more I thought about it , the more convinced I became that the question John the Baptizer had asked me before his execution ? " Are you he that should come to bring salvation to Israel , or must we look for another ? " ? is the decisive question as far as the growth and development of the disciples is concerned . Do these men trust me as God 's ultimate revelation of himself , the full expression of his love ? One night as we sat at the foot of Mt . Hermon before a flickering fire , I directed a question to the twelve : " Who do the people say I am ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antipas that you are John the Baptizer come to life . "  | Philip added , " But other people say that you are Elijah or Jeremiah or one of the other great prophets . " Then I said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " There was a thoughtful pause . For a moment I wondered whether anyone would reply . Then Simon Peter , with great earnestness , gave the answer for which I was hoping : " You are the Christ , the son of the living God ! " Before many months have passed , the implications in this declaration of faith will become increasingly clear not only to Simon Peter but to all the disciples . Several days elapsed while we remained in the region of Caesarea Philippi . The time was growing short . If we intended to hike to the top of Mt . Hermon , we must do so without further delay , for soon we must turn our faces toward Jerusalem . Simon Peter , James , and John volunteered to make the climb with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aching feet , and inadequate clothing to meet the rigors of the steep ascent . It took the four of us nearly two days to reach the top , but we all agreed that the breathtaking view was worth the effort . I suggested to the men that they rest awhile in a sheltered spot , and there they partook of the olives , figs , and bread which they had brought with them . Meanwhile I climbed to a rocky pinnacle nearby and knelt in prayer . The warm rays of the sun beat directly upon the glistening snow which lay in the basins and crevices wherever the rocks would give it room , but since the air was dry and cold there was no melting . My eyes were dazzled by the glare of the sun upon the icy  | whiteness . Even my tunic of drab gray sackcloth seemed to shine . As I prayed , a vision more clear than the one which had come to me in the Wilderness of Judea appeared before my eyes . Two of Israel 's most honored men stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Elijah , representing the prophets . They came as friends . They spoke of my death , which they said would be accomplished at Jerusalem  --  if not during the Festival of Tabernacles , then at the Passover in the spring . I would be slain  --  sacrificed as a lamb upon the altar , these messengers from God told me . And they pledged that the mighty hosts of heaven would not abandon me but would be with me all the way . Furthermore , they described something that up until now has not been clear in my own mind : my own resurrection from the dead . As if to seal and confirm the message of Moses and Elijah , the voice of God spoke to me also in the vision : " You are my beloved son , in whom I am well pleased . " For several hours I remained in prayer and contemplation . Here was a spot which in a short time had become as sacred to me as the secluded temple on Mt . Tabor . Though strikingly different , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of God clear and reassuring . Faint and exhausted , yet fed and nourished , I returned to the place where Simon Peter , James , and John rested . They had fallen asleep but at my approach they awakened . In detail I described for them what had taken place on the snow-covered peak above them . In recreating the  | event I had no intention of overdramatizing what had occurred . However , I was yet under the spell of the vision as I communicated to them the excitement and exhilaration I felt . When I had concluded the description , all three disciples fell on their knees in awe and wonder . Giving them my hand I reassured them : " Arise , do not be afraid . " James and John remained silent , but Simon felt that he ought to say something . " Lord , " he cried , " it is thrilling for us to be with you at such a time as this . Let us not go to the Festival of Tabernacles , but let us stay here and build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one for you . " In his excitement Simon did not realize the impossibility of what he was saying . Slowly we descended the mountain . During the last Festival of Passover Simon Peter had heard the rulers of the people plotting my death . Other than making him sorrowful and fearful , their words had for him no further meaning . As we made our way over rock ledges and then down the wooded trail , I discussed with Simon Peter , James , and John the deeper meaning of my death and resurrection . This predetermined event will become for them the supreme experience in their faith ? in fact not only for them but for the other disciples and the entire community of believers which shall proceed from my little group . Upon this rock of faith I shall build my community , and not even the ravages of death shall prevail against it . Rejoining the disciples who had remained in the valley below , we started our journey homeward . Skirt-  | ing the city of Caesarea Philippi , we walked due south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with family and friends . All of this day and into the late hours of the evening , I have been attempting to find a way to tell Mary my mother that next week , when I take the disciples to Jerusalem , will be the last time I shall ever set foot in Capernaum . No more shall I visit the synagogue , nor shall I ever enjoy again this lovely home by the sea . I have decided that there is no easy way to tell her , but tell her I must .  |  | Before my departure for Jerusalem I made all necessary and final preparations . I turned over my small share of the business to the other boys and directed them to care for our mother for the rest of her years . At last I explained to this lovely one in Israel what lay ahead of me in Jerusalem . She was saddened but not surprised . Her eyes of sorrow looked at me , and then she softly said , " My son , when you were a baby no older than forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presented you to God . An old man , frail and worn , stood by and blessed you . Simeon was his name , and he was a prophet . He said , loud enough for all to hear , 0 God , now let this servant depart in peace . For my eyes have seen the salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all the people . . . a light to show  | truth to the Gentiles and glory and honor to your people Israel . ' " My mother was silent for a moment as if she were recalling every detail of this experience . She continued to speak in a faraway voice . " The old prophet turned his eyes on me and said , This child is set for the fall and rise of many in Israel . He will expose the secret thoughts and deeds of many , and he shall be railed against . As for you , his mother , your own soul will be pierced as if by a sword . ' " " The sword , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms enveloped me in a warm embrace . Thus , for all these years she has known what is to come . What thoughts she has pondered and what feelings she has kept locked within her heart ! As I turned my face toward Jerusalem , she touched my hand and said , " When spring comes , I shall attend the Festival of Passover and I shall see you then . Goodbye , my son . God bless you and keep you . May he cause his face to shine upon you and give you strength . Whatever the Passover brings , I shall be near you . Goodbye , my son . " I joined the disciples at the foot of . Mt . Tabor , and we were on our way . Thomas asked , " Will it happen at the Festival of Tabernacles ? " " I think not , " I replied . " My hour has not yet come . The rulers will inflame the hearts of the people and set them against me . However , it will more likely be during the Passover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | over , I hope to complete one more tour with the disciples . There are several sections of Judea and of Perea to which the word of God should be carried . This I propose to do . Upon our arrival in Jerusalem on the first day of the Festival of Tabernacles , I suggested to the disciples that we separate and that each morning at nine o'clock we meet in front of the Temple . All public inns and lodges in Jerusalem were filled to capacity . Thus it was fortunate that the disciples had friends and relatives in the nearby villages of Arimathea , Emmaus , and Bethany who would welcome them . As usual I would abide in the home of Mary , Martha , and Lazarus in Bethany ? but not until tomorrow . This day I intend to make a visit , long-planned and long-delayed , to the village of Bethlehem . The disciples scattered and left me in front of the Temple . Here once stood Solomon 's Temple , built in glory and destroyed in ignominy . Here also stood Zerubbabel 's Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of King Zerubbabel 's reign , but now gone . Here now stands the Temple of Herod the Great , which was begun twenty years before my birth . Like the older Temples it will one day lie in dust . Into this massive white stone building I first walked as a boy of twelve years . As I stood gazing upon the Temple , a small group of people approached me . One of the men said , " Are you Yeshua of Nazareth ? " " My name is Yeshua and I am from Nazareth , " I quietly replied .  | The leader of the group said , " The rulers seek to do you harm because you claim to be the long-promised Christ of God . Do you dare to make such a claim for yourself ? " I had hoped to avoid any kind of disturbance during the Festival of Tabernacles , for this is the year 's most joyous week . But here I had been in Jerusalem less than one hour , and I was being asked a question which , if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I worded my reply carefully . " Men who believe in me find abundant life , " I said . " They who believe not are condemned by their unbelief . For I am the light of the world . He who in faith walks with me shall not walk in darkness , but in the light of life . " A stern-faced Pharisee stepped forward to confront me . His heavy jaw and long beard trembled as he shook his finger at me and cried , " You bear witness only of yourself , and your witness is false . You are an imposter , a madman masquerading as the son of God . " This outburst was all that was needed to incite my listeners , several of whom took up stones and began to pelt me . One of the stones struck me in the mouth and split my lip . Though the wound was not serious , blood from the open cut streamed down my chin and onto my tunic . Before the crowd could cause further damage , two heavy-helmeted Roman soldiers moved in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom still muttered angrily in their beards . One of the soldiers grabbed me by the shoulder and gave me a shove that nearly sent me to the ground . " Get  | on with you , " he shouted , " and see to it that you start no more trouble ! " Trouble at this particular time was the last thing I wanted . Wiping the blood from my face , I walked slowly beyond Solomon 's Porch toward the great castle of Antonia . Within minutes of this episode I was again involved in a dispute , but this time there was no violence . Two men strode toward me , one a scribe , the other a Pharisee . Between them they dragged a terrified and nearly naked young woman . During the great festivals , when thousands of visitors crowd the streets of Jerusalem , there are excesses and indulgences of every sort . This is especially true during the gaiety of Tabernacles . Many women , young and old , cast aside all restraints and give themselves to the lusts of men . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crave men 's company . Some of these pitiable women are young widows who have been unable to accept the burdens which their new and tragic life has brought them . The two men dragging their prey toward me were enraged at the sight which they had witnessed . The Temple 's Court of Priests is enclosed by a high wall . Against the inner side of this wall are built storage chambers , and in front of these is a covered colonnade . Passing by this out-of-the-way storage-chamber area , the scribe and the Pharisee had stumbled upon the young woman and her male companion locked in a sexual embrace . Though hidden from the view of casual strollers , their exposed flesh was in full view of the two men . It  | was yet morning before noon , and full daylight . The storage chamber in the Temple wall , though in all probability often used for such clandestine purposes , now failed to give needed protection . As is the custom the man went unmolested . But the young woman was being dragged to her punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moses commanded us to stone to death such a woman . What do you , with your high and mighty claims about being the son of God , say ought to be done with this sinner ? " I said nothing , but stooped to the ground and wrote with my finger in the dust , " Show mercy . " This was met with a derisive outburst by the people who had collected about us . The special committee appointed months ago by the Sanhedrin had officially charged Yeshua of Nazareth with being a blasphemer and a perverter of the Law . To these charges it could now be added that he is a defender of harlots . Standing firmly , I met their gibes in silence . Then I said , " He that is among you and without sin let him cast the first stone at her . " There was an awkward pause . I stooped to the ground and wrote a second time , so that the letters in the dust now read : " Show mercy and mercy will be shown to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . One by one the people melted away and I was left alone with this wounded creature , a sad and despoiled spectacle . She clutched her hands over her breast as if in modesty to hide her shame from me . Her gaze was on the ground . She could not look at me.  | " Where are they ? Did no man condemn you ? " I asked . In a faint , bird-like voice , she replied , " No man . " She hesitated and then whispered , " No man , Lord . " " Neither do I condemn you . Go now and enter not into this sin again . " These were my parting words to a forlorn creature whom I am likely not to see again . I walked the narrow , cluttered streets of Jerusalem and several times stopped in front of the booths to admire the products of the grainfields , oliveyards , and vineyards . The harvest this year had been abundant ; thus , in spite of Rome 's heavy heel , the people are blessed . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Royal Porch and saw a blind man sitting in the archway . He looked as if he were afraid to enter . Chatting with him a few minutes , I learned that he had been blind from birth . Though the bright sun beat down from the heavens , to him who lived in darkness there was no day ; all was darkness . Having compassion on him , I gave him the power of sight . It was soon noised about that I had healed the blind man . As the Pharisees told the story , however , one would have thought that instead of helping the man , I had transformed him into a Samaritan dog . The rulers seized the poor fellow and accused him ( and his parents ) of being in league with Yeshua of Nazareth , a sinner and a charlatan . In desperation he said to his tormentors , " Whether Yeshua of Nazareth is a sinner I know not ; one thing I know , that whereas I was blind , now I see . "  | When I heard that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went in search of him . Finding him I asked , " Do you now believe in the son of God ? " Innocently he replied , " Tell me who he is that I might believe on him . " I said , " You are looking at him . He that now speaks to you is he . " The religious rulers had cast him from the Temple and taken from him the comfort and assurance of the Law . But I gave the man his sight . I also gave him the love of God . A prominent lawyer stopped me in the Temple court and put a question to me that had nothing to do either with healing or with my relation to God . " On several occasions , " he said , " I have heard you speak to the people and you make much about a man loving his neighbor . Tell me , who is my neighbor ? " Lawyers can be difficult people . Most of them ( not all ) are conservative individuals whose only yardstick for measuring anything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at all . I was tempted to move on without answering him . But instead of so doing , I told the lawyer a story . I deliberately made the hero of my story a Samaritan , because in the minds of our people there is none lower , none more despised . The Samaritan is a heathen , an object to be avoided . To accept a Samaritan as a human being is difficult ; to accept him as a social equal is impossible . The lawyer knew who his neighbor was  --  a person of  | his own race and religion , one with whom he held all things in common . The little story I told him went like this : A certain man of Israel traveling the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was attacked by a band of thieves who robbed him , beat him , and left him in the road bleeding and half conscious . Two religious leaders , a priest and a Levite , saw the man but , wrapping their clerical robes about them , they each passed him by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying man with compassion , bound up the poor man 's wounds , and treated them with oil and wine . Setting the man on his own beast , he brought him to an inn . He told the innkeeper to look after the man , promising that when he returned , the innkeeper would be paid for all he had spent , and more . I then asked the lawyer , " Which of these three ? the priest , the Levite , or the Samaritan  --  was a neighbor to the man who fell among thieves ? " " He that showed mercy upon him , " the lawyer replied . Bluntly , perhaps too bluntly , I said , " Go and do likewise . " As the sun touched the Great Sea in the west and night began to fall , I passed beyond the city 's wall and turned toward Bethlehem , a distance of three miles . To this hour , I had never revisited the place of my birth . I entered the little village , now crowded with visitors who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where more than thirty years ago a sweet and beautiful peasant girl and her frightened husband  | had sought refuge . I then walked across the road and entered the cave-stable where the girl had given birth to a son , her firstborn . It was to this cave that a group of humble shepherds had come to find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger . It was above this place that the heavenly song was sung : Glory to God in the highest , Peace on earth to men of good will . I stood for a moment amid the cattle , staring with wonder at the straw-filled rack and manger , and I was overwhelmed by the meagerness of the dreary surroundings . I then retraced my steps to the inn on the opposite side of the road . " Do you have a room for the night ? " I asked the innkeeper . " Are you alone ? " the innkeeper inquired , suspicion marking his voice . " Yes , I am alone , " I said . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened that only minutes before , this stern old Israelite had removed from his premises several visitors who had come to the Festival of Tabernacles . Their revelry had gotten out of hand . I had heard the noise and commotion , and I knew with their removal that there was room in the inn . The innkeeper looked disdainfully at my shaggy beard , my worn and spattered tunic , and my bare feet . He said , " I have no room in the inn . If you want a place to stay , make a bed in the stable across the road . " With that he handed me a lantern and pointed the  | way . From his point of view I was perhaps harmless , but I obviously was not of the class from which he chose his patrons . To the cave-stable I went , and there amid the straw and cattle I spent the night . It was a memorable experience . My rejection by the innkeeper , as well as by my people in Nazareth , made me more aware than ever that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazareth . It was a small thing , yet I feel that it is highly symbolic . Men have a higher regard for prestige , status , and money than for God . This morning I arose early , walked the short distance to Jerusalem , and met the disciples in front of the Temple at nine o'clock . Before noon I arrived in Bethany and was happily greeted by my friends , Mary , Martha , and Lazarus . This week will not be all work and no fun . Each one of us has promised to save time for resting , relaxing , and discussing those lively subjects which turn hours into minutes .  |  | Martha is a large , affectionate woman at least fifteen years my senior . She mothers not only Lazarus , Mary , and myself but all who enter her household . A kindly , more devoted person I have not met . To be in her presence is to feel wanted and understood . It is no wonder that this household has become a center of hospitality for all of Bethany . Lazarus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his shoulders are wide and his arms are muscular . He walks with a slow , heavy stride . His face is dark , and his bronze hair has been burnt by the Judean sun . He looks like exactly what he is , a farmer who has always lived with the soil and under the open skies . He is a perfect specimen of unspoiled manhood , strong and healthy and clean .  | Though not wealthy ( with political and ecclesiastical taxes what they are , only a few people in Israel can so be designated ) , Lazarus is financially secure . He owns many acres of land extending through the rolling countryside from Bethany almost to Bethlehem and grazes large flocks of sheep there . Though the land in this area is rocky and sometimes barren , his oliveyards are among the most beautiful . A host of farmers , vinedressers , and other men work with him . They are dependent upon him for their substance and life . Because of his just and loving treatment of them , I have observed that they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They till the soil together as brothers . Mary is the baby , not quite twenty-three . Her mother died giving her birth . Her dark eyes sparkle and dance under a mass of luxuriant hair which is curly and oftentimes unruly . She combines beauty and charm ; she is strong and wholesome without a touch of self-consciousness . Though she must be aware of her loveliness , there is not so much as a hint of pride or vanity . To no living person have I ever said what I now write in this diary . If I had not made the painful but necessary decision to remain unmarried , the one girl in all Israel I would have chosen for my wife is Mary of Bethany . The house in which my friends live is in the open country , just beyond the village limits . It is a large two-story , sun-dried brick residence built in the form of a quadrangle . In the center of the courtyard , around which the house is constructed , there is a fountain whose gushing waters are fed by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overlooking the court-  | yard . By day and by night I can see and hear the everflowing splash of the fountain which my friends have named in my honor . Inscribed on the stone wall which encloses the deep well are the words , " To Yeshua of Nazareth , our friend . " The opposite side of this large , comfortable room faces the east . Carefully cultivated olive trees extend as far as the eye can see . Beyond the groves lies the desolate Wilderness of Judea . Sometimes as I sit and watch the fountain in the courtyard , I am reminded of the thirst-satisfying water of eternal life which God is projecting into the life of men . Then I walk to the window facing eastward and , looking beyond the clean olive trees to the Wilderness of Judea , I am reminded of the darkness , the sin , the death which are so much a part of this earthly life . When I identified myself with the race of men , I became completely one of them . It became my lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and laugh , suffer and weep . Also like them I would die , and in every waking moment I would be conscious of this grim fact of human existence . The animals of the field die and their bodies decay , but they are spared the awareness of this fate . I hate death . It is an ugly , demonic intruder . It makes a mockery of life . Whether death is visited on a man because he is a sinner or because he is a mortal makes little difference to him ; what matters is the stark reality , leering and hateful , that death is his lot . Not only does death tear loved ones apart so that the warm touch of the hand is never more felt , but it stands above  | the human scene as if to say , " I , Death , am the proud ruler of all I survey . It is I who have the final word about the nature and destiny of man . " Death is demonic , not because of the agony of the last gasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly living . It expects and demands deterioration of body and mind until extinction . From the time of birth , a man is not simply a creature living and breathing but is a creature dying , a being unto death . He lives from birth to death and the goal of his existence is the grave . Earth-enslaved people will one day be able to say , " Death is swallowed up in victory ; 0 Grave , where is your victory ? 0 Death , where is your sting ? " As surely as the sun rises , men will know that they can be conquerors over all that besets them . Neither life nor death will be able to separate them from the love of God . They shall possess eternal life , God 's life . Triumphantly , they shall live forever ! On the day after my arrival in Jerusalem I received a strange invitation . It was from a prominent Pharisee by the name of Sanballat . In connection with the Festival of Tabernacles he was giving a banquet to which many of the illustrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arrived , most of the guests had found their places on the couches surrounding the heavily laden table . Sanballat greeted me , and it is to his credit that he made an effort to show at least a semblance of warmth . However , he gasped when he saw my clothing . I wore no sandals , and my gray tunic of sackcloth had seen  | better days . " Shalom aleichem , " he weakly greeted me . " Welcome to our little party . " As I glanced at the guests lounging about the table , I observed that many of them were from faraway countries . All wore distinctive sandals expensively made of alligator or sheepskin and decorated with jewels from Rome , Egypt , or Babylon . Some wore tunics of white linen , but most were dressed in flowing silk robes of many brilliant colors . Togas marked those from the west ; turbans those from the east . Other than myself there were no Galileans present . There were several men from Judea , however . These wore no headdress . Their appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but regardless of their dress , they were a cynical , arrogant , and hostile lot . Sanballat escorted me to a couch and seated me between two important looking gentlemen . The name of the man on my left was Nicodemus , a Pharisee and a member of the powerful Sanhedrin . I wondered how much he had to do with the appointment of the special committee which had come to Galilee to investigate me . On my right was a calm , modest-appearing man quite unlike the others of the group . He was introduced to me as Joseph of Arimathea . I later learned that . he is the wealthiest person in all of Judea . Our host was nervous and jumpy . It was obvious that he had invited me for a purpose other than the enjoyment of my company . Sanballat was in a mood of conciliation . The dark clouds of opposition to me and my ministry were hanging low . His associates , if pushed far enough , were capable of doing certain deeds which  | they later might regret . Yeshua of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had collected about him a small band of faithful disciples . And there were thousands of people in Galilee and in Judea who believed in him and claimed to be his followers . But the rulers had first ignored him and then fought him . None accepted him . To Sanballat the Pharisee it must have seemed that Yeshua was starved for a little attention from the right people . Sanballat was therefore determined that poor , deprived Yeshua would have the opportunity of meeting some of Judea 's most prominent people and thus would enjoy the feeling of being on the " inside " rather than the " outside . " Once this goal was achieved , Sanballat felt that an ugly clash would be avoided . The wandering teacher would soften the claims he made for himself and he would speak less critically of the authorities . Sanballat gave me the impression that he had used the **50;231;TOOLONG approach before , and with success . I felt my host staring at me ; he desired to address me . The other guests turned their contemptuous gazes in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked directly at Sanballat , and waited for him to speak . At last he said , " We can not proceed with the dinner . Our guest from Galilee has not cleansed himself according to Moses . " What he said was true . I had begun to eat without observing the Mosaic ritual of handwashing . My hands were not dirty . Clean or dirty was beside the point . The matter of crucial importance was : I had  | not washed my hands in the manner prescribed by the ancient ceremonial injunction . In reply to Sanballat 's indignant announcement I did not shout , but I lifted my voice so that all present could hear what I said . My rejoinder went something like this : " You Pharisees are fond of cleaning the outside of your dishes , but inside you are full of greed , extortion , and wickedness . You pay your tithes and make your offerings , but you ignore justice , love , and mercy , the things of the spirit . " Pretense and insincerity are your badges . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert , then you turn him into a son of damnation twice as bad as yourself . You are like whitewashed tombs , which appear clean on the outside but inside are full of dead men 's bones and all kinds of rottenness . " You talk proudly of your ancestors and the aristocracy which they represent . In this you are correct . You are the sons of the very men who murdered the prophets , the same prophets to whom you now erect monuments . Like fathers , like sons . You serpents , you vipers ' brood , when the time comes you will hunt and flog those who now challenge your corruption , and you will expel them from the Temple and the synagogues . In the name of the Law and religion you will murder and crucify those who oppose you even as your fathers did before you . " Thus the dinner ended for me before it started . I arose , asked to be excused , and started for Bethany . As I walked down the hill to the street that led through  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned and confronted the man following me . I recognized him as Joseph of Arimathea , the man who had sat on my right at the dinner . He was silent for a moment and then with a grin on his broad face he said , " It was a good party while it lasted . " " People who strain a gnat out of the cup and then swallow a camel try my patience , " I said . Joseph smiled for a moment , but his expression quickly turned to earnestness . " All my life I have waited to hear a teacher speak as frankly as you did tonight , " he said . " We who possess wealth hear only soothing things from our teachers and priests . " There was a spark of genuineness about the man that attracted me to him . Joseph of Arimathea clasped my hand and said , " You speak with authority and not as the scribes and Pharisees . Will you accept me as a follower ? " The banquet had not been a total loss . So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel will not be destroyed . Early in the week of Tabernacles a young man about sixteen years of age , John Mark by name , made himself known to me . He said that he had become a believer during my visit at the last Passover and that he had persuaded his widowed mother also to believe . With unbounded enthusiasm he now invited me to his home . I went , met his mother ( who was the widow of a wealthy merchant ) , and enjoyed the food she set before us . The  | house was located not far from the center of Jerusalem . It was a larger house than Lazarus ' and in every way more pretentious . It had an upper story and was built of stone with huge columns and straight lines in the manner of the Greeks . John Mark 's mother insisted that I make use of this upper room where I could enjoy the company of my friends away from the noise and confusion of Jerusalem 's crowded streets . It was to this place that I took the disciples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and wine enjoyed weekly by the teacher in Israel and his disciples the night before the Sabbath . The food partaken of at such gatherings is unimportant . Unity of purpose , deepening of fellowship in the group , and clarification of understanding between the teacher and his disciples are more important objectives . For several hours we ate bread , drank wine , and heatedly discussed those immediate and distant issues before us . I have encouraged the disciples to feel free and unrestrained during these sessions . No matter how sensitive or personal a question is put to me , I always attempt a clear and honest reply . The most vocal of the disciples last night was Judas Iscariot . His first contribution was more of a tirade than question . Half smiling and half sneering , Judas looked at me and declared , " Lord , you have said much about the evil of riches : No man can serve God and Mammon . ' And It is harder for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you have , and come follow me , ' you told one young man in Israel . To another you said , A man 's life consists not  | in the abundance of things he possesses , but rather in the genuineness of his faith and love . ' To still another you said , The love of money is the root of all evil . ' Then there is the story , attributed to you , which is making the rounds of Jerusalem during this week of Tabernacles when our people are enjoying the most abundant crops in years : It concerns the successful farmer who tore down his inadequate barns and built bigger ones to house his surplus grains and goods , and concludes : You fool , this very night your soul will be required of you . ' " Judas had waited a long time for this opportunity . His beady eyes gleamed . Like an arrow poised for flight , he pointed his small , short-bearded chin in my direction . I did not interrupt him with word or gesture . My attentive silence encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sayings with your deeds ? " he asked . " You talk about the evils of wealth , but you accept the hospitality of the wealthy , including the widow who owns this mansion-like house where we now observe the simple Kiddush . " Judas turned his face toward Matthew , Capernaum 's former tax collector , the one man in the group he most envied . He said , " One of this group was a man of great means and he still may be a holder of many possessions as far as I know . Lazarus , your host this week , is one of Judea 's most important landowners , and we have just learned  --  from a secondary source , of course , because none of us was invited to Sanballat 's feast  --  that you accepted Joseph of Arimathea as a follower  --  the wealthiest man in all of Judea ! " Simon Peter , who disliked and distrusted Judas , was  | enraged at what he considered to be unbounded impudence . The big fisherman started to silence the speaker , but I insisted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish . Ignoring Simon Peter and speaking rapidly , Judas continued , " You attend mighty feasts . While the poor go begging , while little children starve in Jerusalem 's streets , you eat the choicest foods , drink the rarest wines , and furthermore permit extravagances such as that of the woman who anointed your feet with expensive Egyptian oils . Money from these oils would have fed seven children for seven and two-thirds days . Lord , what say you to these things ? How shall we , your disciples , answer the people who question us ? " Judas ' speech was finished , his tirade concluded . I replied , " Judas , for the most part you have accurately quoted what I have had to say about money and property . I do not withdraw , nor do I subtract from what I have said . Money is a seductive goddess . The love of it is the root of every kind of evil . It is difficult , if not impossible , for a rich man to get into heaven , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to see . Mammon is God 's chief competitor for the souls of men . " However , a small purse can be a man 's idol as easily as a large one . Possessions are not in themselves evil . The value a man attaches to them is the important matter . He who becomes spiritually dependent upon material things  --  food , drink , houses , camels , chariots  --  is in danger of bringing destruction upon himself . " In the spirit of lively give-and-take which I have en-  | couraged at these Kiddush gatherings , I continued : " Judas , you would do well to learn to enjoy a grand feast . You should also learn to suffer scarcity without complaint . When we go several days on a short diet , you are the first among the disciples to grumble . And , holding the purse , you are the first to resist our giving to the poor . Though you compute to the day and hour how many meals the money from a certain amount of oil would provide for the hungry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture that would indicate that you really care whether hungry children eat or starve . " Learn the meaning of contentment no matter what your state or condition . Know how to be abased without self-pity ; know how to abound without pride ; learn to ride in a chariot , but also learn to walk without sandals . In this way you live above both plenty and want . " One last thing I must say on this subject : When any man , whoever he is , looks at his overflowing barns and his great possessions and says to his soul , Soul , take your ease , eat , drink , and be merry , for this is the sum of life , ' that man is a fool . " Ij The next disciple to speak was Nathanael . He was troubled by the recollection of the holy absolutes I gave to the disciples months ago while we were on Mt . Tabor . Quietly and with no purpose other than to seek information , Nathanael said , " Lord , one day while we were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root of murder and like murder , it is to be condemned . All of us , and perhaps all of Jerusalem by now , have heard about the  | tongue-lashing you gave the Pharisees last night at Sanballat 's banquet . We know how despicable the Pharisees are , but can your violent reaction to them be defended ? " " I have no apologies for anything I did or said last night , " I replied . " I am weary with the religious masquerade put on daily by the rulers of the people . Two things I say in answer to your question . First , I said nothing but the truth , the simple truth , the whole truth , the undiluted truth . At no point did I exaggerate . Never in the sad history of Israel has there been so vain , empty , and hypocritical a group of religious leaders as now exploit the people . The truth is sometimes harsh , sometimes devastating , but there are times when nothing else but the truth will do . " Second , though what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in perfect control of myself . I knew precisely what I was saying . At no time was I at the mercy of temper or feelings . Herein lies a great difference . Anger that blinds is the root of murder and all sorts of evil deeds . Indignation expressed with control is often necessary and sometimes helpful . He who can not feel and express indignation in the presence of evil is more fish than man . " Simon the Zealot had a question which has troubled him deeply . His hatred of Rome has lessened but not disappeared . The matter has become a problem to his maturing . Simon is aware of the problem and he will no doubt eventually become master of it . He said : " Entrenched power  --  ecclesiastical or political  --  can-  | not be overthrown by prayer , fasting , or teaching . Power can be displaced only by greater power . Rome will never give up the stranglehold it has on Israel 's throat except by revolutionary force . Caiaphas and his religious associates will never voluntarily relinquish their control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered to bits . Obviously , Lord , you do not feel that bloodshed is the way to dislodge these tyrannical forces . But what shall helpless people do ? Sit and wait , pray and hope , while entrenched power grows stronger ? " I was ready with my answer . " One of the most unfailing laws of life and history is this : Demonic means predetermine demonic ends , " I replied . " A force that comes to power through blood will turn out to be as ruthless as the force it dethrones . They who take the sword are eventually destroyed by the sword . Though he has often tried , man has never found a way to beat this inexorable law . There are many nonviolent ways whereby a man may express his feelings . " Conditions among men can be improved . Men of faith and love will work unceasingly to that end . Due to the limitations imposed by the flesh , a perfect order among men can never here be achieved . Sin and selfishness coexist with hopes and dreams . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a system which cares for widows and orphans and one that cares not . " John , the beloved disciple , also had a good question . It concerned the nature of love . Said he , " If we love friend and enemy as God loves , does this mean that we shall be loved and accepted in return ? "  | " There is no power in the world so strong as the power of love , " I answered . " Frightened and lonely people who are loved by someone else will often learn to return love with love . But this is by no means a law of life . Just as often as not , love is spurned and rewarded with rejection . Love must never be considered a strategy to gain a more desirable condition or relationship . We love because this is the way of God , and there is none higher . " Some of you heard the story I told the lawyer who this week asked me who his neighbor was . The Samaritan , the man who showed mercy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in distress . Upon this we all agreed . There is an unhappy ending to that story which did not serve my purpose to relate . When the injured man of Israel regained consciousness and discovered that he had been aided by a filthy Samaritan , he was filled with wrath . Forevermore he would be unclean . Samaritan hands had touched his flesh . His lips had drunk from the wineskins of one he detested . This act of love on the Samaritan 's part wrought no change in the man 's heart . Love was not returned with love , but only with wrath . But the Samaritan had a greater reward : He had loved as God loves , and this is all that matters . Love is not talk , not even affirmation ; it is selfgiving action where identification with pain and hurt is made . " Andrew , brother to Simon Peter , spoke up : " Lord , is suffering a punishment for sin ? " I replied : " If the tower of Siloam falls on a group of  | men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude that these men were the worst sinners in Jerusalem and that they received their just punishment . But right living does not necessarily lead to health and prosperity in this world ; and by the same token wrong living does not always lead to sickness and poverty . Simply by looking around you , have you not observed that the rain falls on the good and bad alike ? That the sun shines on both the faithful and faithless alike ? Right living carries with it its own reward and sin its own seeds of destruction . " There are times when sin obviously results in suffering . This fact has no doubt given rise in the past to the belief that all suffering is directly related to specific wrongdoing . The Book of Job , now accepted and loved by our people , is a literary attempt to correct this misconception . In God 's time and in his own way there is a justice which awaits the deeds of men . In the meantime , be reminded that you are a part of an order which is infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to see a twisted body housing a faithful man as to see a strong and healthy body housing a faithless man . " Simon Peter had not spoken during the long , exciting session . Now he had a request : " Lord , tell us more about those things we discussed when we were on Mt . Hermon  --  your death , resurrection , and the end of the world . " I reminded Peter that the hour was growing late . In a few days the Festival of Tabernacles will be over and we shall begin our last tour . I promised that during the  | winter months the topics he has suggested would receive our major consideration . This explanation was satisfactory to all the disciples . We left the upper room in John Mark 's house and separated to our various places of abode . The full moon cast its beams on the path that leads across the Kidron brook . Within minutes I was in Bethany , breathing the fresh country air and listening to the gushing waters of the fountain below my window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the one place in this world where I prefer to abide , perhaps forever . But also like Moses I have seen a burning bush , and I have heard the voice of God say , " I will send you forth that you may deliver my people from bondage . I will be with you , and this shall be the sign for you , even that I have sent you . "  |  | A month has swiftly passed since the week we spent in Jerusalem at the Festival of Tabernacles . The season of fall now upon us is the most pleasant of the year . The long , hot days of summer are gone and the cold , wet days of winter have not yet set in . Trees with crooked , leafless , and cross-like limbs signal the coming of winter 's shivering blast . Our projected plans to tour Perea were abruptly changed . Instead of proceeding directly to the land beyond the Jordan , I suggested that we walk north through the country of the Samaritans . From the city of Samaria we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the city of Jericho . My suggestion brought strong objections from most of the disciples . Judas Iscariot , who dreads the chill of  | winter , insisted that we would get trapped in Samaria and never make it to the delightful area by the Dead Sea . He was eager to see the resort city of Machaerus and to enjoy the warm , dry climate which prevails in that southern region . Judas also pointed out that the purse was getting low and that we could not afford this unexpected extension of our tour . James , the brother of John , was more honest in his objections . He stated forthrightly that in all his life he had never had dealings with Samaritans and that he was not going to begin at this late date . They were a race of dirty , smelly , and subhuman people , he said . He intended to have no part of them . In spite of general disapproval among the disciples , I insisted that Samaria be included in our tour . Only Simon the Zealot and Matthew supported me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far there have been no unpleasant occurrences . Right now I am writing these words in the diary while I am a guest in the house of Solomon bar Jonah , a Samaritan and the first citizen of Sychar . Men of Israel have no dealings with the Samaritans . Though the shortest route between Galilee and Judea is directly through Samaria , our people prefer to cross to the east side of the Jordan River . Here , away from Samaritan soil , they travel a narrow , rocky road that lies between the Jordan and the mountains of Gilead . In this way they avoid contamination by a people from whom they have been separated hundreds of years . The city of Samaria ( which is also the capital of the  | region called by the same name ) is rich in Jewish tradition . It was the capital of the ten tribes of Israel during the longest period of their history . A wild , reckless city , it was noted at that time for every type of corruption and idolatry . King Ahab and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the courageous ministry of the prophets Elijah and Elisha also took place in this region . About seven hundred years ago the countryside and the capital city were laid waste by two powerful Assyrian kings , Shalmaneser and Sargon . Thousands of men , as the prophets had warned , were carried into captivity . Those who were permitted to remain in Samaria were soon joined by captive heathens from many surrounding countries , including Babylon , Hamath , and Arabia . These hordes of displaced persons were imported by Sargon , king of Assyria and successor to Shalmaneser . The heathen captives brought not only their families and their feeble possessions but also their idolatrous ways of worship . They erected images of their gods on every hill and mountain in Samaria . A synthesis between Jehovah worship and idol worship began to take place . Marriages between Israelites and the people from Babylon , Hamath , and Arabia occurred on a large scale . As the years went by , Jehovah worship grew stronger and idol worship disappeared from the worship life of the Samaritans . Magnificence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerizim . Though the Temple was destroyed some years ago , the Samaritans to this day continue to worship on Mt . Gerizim , the place where once stood their beautiful house of worship .  | When Jehovah worship at last prevailed among the Samaritans , certain of their leaders indicated a desire to reestablish relations with the religious forces of Jerusalem . They specifically requested permission to help in the building of Zerubbabel 's Temple when our people returned from exile in Babylon . This period of chaos could have been a time of reconciliation , but the rulers at Jerusalem stubbornly refused to recognize the Samaritans as anything other than idol-worshiping heathens . To this day no Samaritan is permitted to set foot in the Temple at Jerusalem . Hostility toward Samaritans varies from person to person . Some refuse to recognize them as human beings . They are considered animals with no morals and little intelligence . The nation would be better off , say these intolerant critics , if all Samaritans were carried back to Babylon , Hamath , and Arabia , countries from whence they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be mistreated  --  that they should have the right to live their own lives so long as they remain separated from the people of Israel . Still others contend that Samaritans are more like the people of Israel than heathen , and that they have the right to worship in the Temple at Jerusalem . It is true that Samaritans believe in God , have torn down their shrines and idols , and have great respect for the Law . Therefore , say these Jews , the Samaritans should be invited to the Temple and to all religious festivals . These same Jews insist , however , that acceptance of Samaritans should stop at the point of religious cere-  | mony , that they should not be treated as social equals . Eating or drinking with them , fraternizing in any way whatsoever , is discouraged . Each of these views is to be found among my own disciples , no one of whom is prepared to accept the Samaritan as a child of God and a brother in the flesh . Simon the Zealot and Matthew are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , their views do not include " social " acceptance . Several days ago we left the city of Samaria and journeyed eastward toward Sychar . Outside this ancient city stands a cherished landmark  --  the well of Jacob . Here is the parcel of land which in the long ago was given to Joseph by Jacob the patriarch . News of my ministry had preceded us in Sychar . The word had gone forth that Israel has raised up a teacher who taught that Samaritans were human beings and should be accepted as other human beings . This teacher was different from the many teachers in Israel who taught the same thing . He lived what he taught . Ignoring threats and criticism from his associates , he ate and drank and mingled openly with Samaritans . Our welcome to Sychar began in a chance conversation with a Samaritan woman who had come to Jacob 's well for her daily supply of water . I intended to rest by the well while the disciples entered the city to acquire food and places of lodging . Judas Iscariot , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . He was so agitated that he seemed on the verge of fainting . " Do you know her ? " I asked , I pressed him for an answer and at last in great hu-  | miliation he told me the story of his family 's most dreaded secret . In addition to the two reasons  --  winter weather and low funds  --  Judas had given for not wanting to travel through Samaria , there was yet a third , and it involved the woman at the well . Though he had seen her only once , he recognized her immediately . She was an adulteress , she had been previously married five times , and now she was living a common life with Judas ' brother ! The tale that Judas had told the disciples when he first joined the band back in Galilee had not a shred of truth about it . Judas ' brother was not an important official in Kerioth , he had not married the daughter of a wealthy merchant who had given him sons , and his brother was certainly not the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now told me was that his brother had met this woman in a house of harlotry , that he had run away with her , and that now they lived together without marriage in the city of Sychar . By this act Judas ' family had been disgraced for all time . The disciples , with Judas hidden in their midst , bypassed the well and entered the city . The woman filled her waterpots . I approached her . She was a squat , heavyset woman with a pockmarked face . " Would you give me a drink ? " I asked . " The journey from Samaria has been hard and I am thirsty . " Stunned , she could not speak at first . The silence that followed was long and forced . I waited for her to reply . At last she said , " How is it that you , a man of Israel , ask a drink of me , a Samaritan  | woman ? " She could not believe that I would drink from the cup that had touched her lips . I then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God who could give her the water of eternal life . If she drank of the water which I could give her , she would nevermore thirst , and she would live forever . I said , " Go , call your husband ; I would like to tell him about the life I have to give . " Here was the opportunity for her to continue her deception . She could lie and pretend that she was something other than what she was . Instead of so doing , however , she said with feeling , " I have no husband . " With deliberate frankness I replied , " You have honestly said I have no husband . ' You have had five husbands , and you are now living with a man who is not your husband . " In saying this I managed to communicate to her not condemnation but understanding and acceptance . Confusion , astonishment , and gratitude gleamed from her eyes . Several of the disciples , minus Judas , who remained in the city suffering from a headache , returned and were surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She suddenly left her waterpots and walked quickly toward the city . Straightforward she went to a number of men , some of whom she had known intimately , and said , " Come see a Galilean teacher who knows all about me but accepts me and offers me eternal life . Can this be the Christ about whom we have heard ? " Her comments created so much excitement among the  | natives that many of them came out to the well to greet me . Among those who approached me in good faith was our present host , Solomon bar Jonah . He promptly invited not only Yeshua of Nazareth but all of Yeshua 's disciples to be his guests . Solomon is a grain merchant and his house is the largest in all of Sychar . The disciples ( with the exception of John 's brother James and Judas Iscariot ) accepted the invitation . This would be their first time to sleep under a Samaritan roof and eat at the same table with a Samaritan ! Though a lowering cloud threatened a heavy rain , James and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a manner with those whom they had been taught since childhood to consider as inferior . Many of the citizens of Sychar became believers because of the convincing word of the Samaritan woman . However , before many days had passed and while we still lingered as guests of Solomon bar Jonah , other Samaritans said , " Now we trust you , not because of what the woman said about you but because we have heard for ourselves and we are convinced that you are indeed the Christ , the Savior of the world . " I have never felt more at home than in the land of the Samaritans and in the home of Solomon bar Jonah . It has been both amusing and tragic , however , to observe how difficult our stay has been for my disciples . Only with awkwardness have they accepted the hospitality of our host . His house is clean , his food is well prepared , and he is a man of faith , character , and intelligence . Furthermore , his person is clean , and not smelly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter ( who some day will learn not to call unclean that which God has cleansed ) said , as we prepared for bed last night , " Solomon bar Jonah is a good man and a kind host , but he is still a Samaritan. "  |  | As we walked the Samaritan road toward the Jordan , I kept thinking of the woman I had met at Jacob 's well . She was heavy and coarse and there was a lusty air about her . Her face was terribly scarred , but there was an inquisitive and expressive look in her eyes , and though she had been married five times she was still under forty . The tone of her voice , the bright look in her eyes , and the sensual lips bespoke a person capable of great feeling . She was now living with a man not her husband , and for this transgression she was paying a high price . It is impossible for such a person to find acceptance in any group . She is despised by women who know her , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The names by which she is known are harsh and not easily forgotten .  | Marriage and divorce laws , and customs regulating the behavior between men and women , are as confusing in Samaria as they are in Judea . The one difference is that in Judea a woman taken in adultery may  --  though it is not often done  --  be stoned to death . In Samaria such a person is not treated with physical violence , but is subjected to scorn and separation from the community . Women 's rights have never been protected , and against this injustice I have lifted my voice . The case of divorce illustrates the point . No woman has ever been able to secure a divorce from her husband no matter how cruel he may be . On the other hand , a man may divorce his wife if she has been unfaithful , or if he suspects her of being unfaithful , or if he is weary of her and desires a younger , more beautiful wife . He divorces her by declaring to the community that he is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , according to the present practice in Israel , is permitted to remarry as often as he desires . His wife may also remarry provided her husband has given her the all-important bill of divorcement . If the wife 's second husband " puts her away , " she may marry a third time . This procedure may be repeated indefinitely so long as each husband is sufficiently generous to put in her hand a full bill of divorcement . ( According to the Law , a divorced woman is not permitted to remarry her first husband under any circumstances . ) In recent years , the tangles of marriage and divorce have become even more tragic , especially from the woman 's point of view . Her only rights are those which her  | husband deigns to grant her . In Samaria and Judea it is now common practice for a man to put away his wife for a trivial reason or for no reason at all , and in spitefulness he may refuse to give her a bill of divorcement . Without such a document a divorced wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . If she should remarry , she commits adultery and he who marries her under such circumstances is also considered to be living in adultery . Solomon bar Jonah , the foremost citizen of Sychar , explained to me some details in the life of the woman I had met by Jacob 's well . Her first four husbands had put her away for no other reason than to seek the company of a younger woman . But it is to their credit that each one gave her a bill of divorcement . The fifth husband , who also sought to leave her marriage bed for that of another woman , put her away , but in bitterness gave her no bill of divorcement . The community therefore concluded that the Samaritan woman had been unfaithful to her fifth husband . Because she was a divorced woman without a bill of divorcement , she was considered to be in the same class with women of the streets . Under such circumstances few men would risk being seen in her company . Jacob Iscariot , Judas ' brother , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her , defied tradition , and offered her common-law marriage . How twisted and tragic can become the holy relationship between a man and a woman ! On the other hand , what an inspiring sight it is to behold a husband and wife who cleave to each other as one flesh , who re-  | main together in love through joy and sorrow , sickness and health , want and plenty , until death parts them . Thus far in my ministry I have gained the reputation of having uncanny skill in making friends with the " wrong " people . At the moment I am guest in the house of one Zacchaeus , the chief tax collector for the city of Jericho and by all standards the most despised man in this region . Except for Matthew , who himself had been a tax collector , the disciples declined Zacchaeus ' warm invitation to be his house guests . They preferred to seek lodging with friends and relatives . But I am getting ahead of my story . Yesterday morning about noontime we approached Jericho on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large company of people came out to greet us . Men , women , and little children lined the road and the streets of the city . I have learned to be reserved about mass demonstrations of such nature , for people can be so easily swayed . Today they shout " Hosanna " ; tomorrow " Down with the traitor . " However , I was more pleased than displeased by the Jericho reception . A serious handicap to my ministry has almost been overcome . In Galilee I saw the development of a problem whose solution was sometimes beyond me . The multitudes followed me for no reason other than that I was a worker of miracles . The hungry wanted bread but cared little for the bread of life . The sick of body wanted hea ' h but were not interested in wholeness of spirit . The poor wanted prosperity but were restless  | when I talked about their need for God . Thus I was trapped . I am committed to the use of God 's power to relieve human suffering . But in helplessness I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing become a wedge between the people and their deeper needs . The citizens of Jericho came out to greet us , but they did not cry , " Behold , a worker of miracles ! " Instead they said , " Behold , a prophet of God ! " I sought the explanation for this change and soon found it . The episode in the house of Sanballat the Pharisee had made the difference ! The story of my confronting the Pharisees with their hypocrisy had not only covered Jerusalem but had spread throughout Judea and even to the city of Jericho . According to the natives no prophet in Israel since Amos had spoken so truthfully about corruption in high places . The people of Jericho therefore came out to greet not a worker of miracles but a prophet who dared to say to the Pharisees even in the city of Jerusalem , " You are whited sepulchres , clean on the outside but inside filled with extortion and all kinds of wickedness . " So the episode with Sanballat the Pharisee had made the difference ! To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , the prophet who calls men to the mercy and judgment of God . Jericho is a city of the Canaanites , a city of Judea but also a city of Arabia , a city of lawlessness , a city of mystery . Here is where Herod the Great died  --  but not before he had ordered hundreds of people slain so that there would be among the populace mourning and  | lamentation at the time of his death . Here also is where Herod 's son Archelaus built hanging gardens and Arabian palaces in the fashion of . Nebuchadnezzar . Here are to be seen daily great camel caravans coming from the north and east bearing spices , perfumes , and silks . Around the city , underground springs bring life and fertility to the soil . The air is heavy with the scent of roses , figs , and balsam . Jericho is a small city , but it has more than its share of commerce and trade . Like the waters from the mighty fountain outside the city wall , money flows freely from one hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crowds rushed upon us , and the people cried , " Here he comes , the prophet who brings judgment to the Temple . Hurrah and Hosanna ! " My attention was attracted to a little man , who , in order to see all that was going on , had scaled a wild fig tree . Someone whispered to me , " That is Zacchaeus , the chief tax collector in Jericho . " How well I knew this man so hated and despised ! A man who for money had sold himself and his people to Rome . In his eyes there shone the haunted look of one who was separated from all he held dear in life . Estranged from family and friends , estranged from God , he was also estranged from himself , a split person . He was a man with money and all the comforts money could buy , but he was without peace , dignity , and self-respect . The only way he knew of filling the void in his life was to pile coin upon coin . Zacchaeus ' neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than he was despised by them .  | Above the din of the crowd I shouted to the little man in the tree , " Zacchaeus , may I spend the night at your house ? " He was so surprised by this unbelievable greeting that he almost fell out of the tree . His tongue could not move ; he answered not a word . I came closer to him and said , " Zacchaeus , I really want to stay at your house . Make haste and come down . " He scrambled out of the tree , clasped my hand , and welcomed me and my disciples to his house . In his excitement and newfound joy he exclaimed , " Lord , I am going to give half of all my goods to the poor , and to any man that I have defrauded I shall restore to him fourfold ! " With arms interlocked in the fashion of friends we shoved our way through the crowd . For a brief moment I had been a hero to the natives of Jericho . Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now there was silence , as I offered friendship to the hated tax collector . Astonishment and disgust were written on the faces in the crowd . Someone said , " Incredible ! He has gone to be the guest in the house of a man who is a sinner . " Several Pharisees were standing by . Up to this moment they had been lost in the crowd . Now one of them spoke up sneeringly : " We told you so ! " Still holding Zacchaeus by the arm , I stopped and spoke to the people . I told them one of my favorite stories . " Two men went up to the Temple to pray , " I said . " One was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector . The Pharisee stood and prayed like this : ' I thank  | you , God , that I am not like other people , greedy , dishonest , and impure ; especially am I proud that I am not like that tax collector standing over there . I fast twice a week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in his corner afraid to look toward heaven . In despair he smote his breast and cried , ' O God , have mercy upon a sinner like me ! ' " I say to you that this penitent man went home forgiven while the proud Pharisee sought the presence of God in vain . " The crowd dispersed . The disciples scattered to the homes of friends and relatives . Matthew and I , with Zacchaeus between us , walked the streets of Jericho until we at last reached the great house of many rooms where Zacchaeus lived alone beyond the city wall . It stood cold and bare . In all of Jericho Zacchaeus could not find a servant who would consent to work for him . The dark , gloomy house was a symbol of the loneliness and despair of the man who for many years had lived in it . To see and feel the joy that now burst from Zacchaeus ' life was to me a strengthening experience . As we prepared for the noon meal , I said to Matthew , " Of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek the lost and to save men from the curse of being men .. . men who sin , suffer , decay , and die . " This afternoon , joining the other disciples , we made plans to move on to the city of Machaerus . We stood in front of the famous fountain outside the wall of Jericho . Matthew , concerned about the remark I made yesterday , " I have come to seek the lost and to save men  | from the curse of being men , " said to me , " Lord , can it really matter to God whether one miserable tax collector like Zacchaeus is lost or found , dead or alive ? " For the benefit of all the twelve I replied : " God is concerned about every sparrow that falls . If this is so , he is even more concerned about you who are his children . " To illustrate this point I told three simple stories : " It is like this with God and a child who is separated from him . Any man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go after the lost one and remain with the search until he finds it . When he comes home he calls his friends and neighbors and says to them , Rejoice with me for I have found my one sheep which was lost ! ' " The second story : " Or any woman having ten pieces of silver , if she loses one of them , will light a lamp and sweep the house diligently until she finds it . When she finds it , she says to her neighbors , Rejoice with me for I have found the piece of silver which I lost ... " And still another story to illustrate how God feels about losing and finding a child : " A certain man had two sons . The younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the share of property that will come to me . ' So the father divided his property between his two sons . Not many days afterward the younger son gathered his goods together and took his journey into a far country . There he wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that he had , there arose a mighty famine in that country and he  | began to be in want . He went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into the fields to feed swine . Here he reached low bottom . He got to the place where he filled his belly with the same slop he fed to the swine . He was alone . No man assisted him . At last he came to his senses and said , Servants in my father 's house have bread to eat and more , and I am here perishing with hunger . I will arise and go to my father and ask his forgiveness . ' " He arose and went to his father . While he was yet some distance from the house , his father saw him and was moved with compassion and ran to him and took the boy in his arms and kissed him . " And the son said , Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you . I am not worthy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the servants , Bring forth quickly the best robe and put it on him . Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet . Bring the fatted calf and kill it . Let us eat and be merry , for this my son was dead and is alive again . He was lost and is found . ' " The whole household rejoiced and made merry . " I looked at Matthew and asked , " Do you recognize the lad in this story ? " " Yes , Lord , " he answered . " It is I ; it is Zacchaeus . It is every man who has defied God . "  | Winter with its bitter rains and frosty air has come to Judea . For the first time in many years snow fell in Jerusalem . All of us are now grateful that Judas Iscariot prodded us until we at last crossed the Jordan into Perea . With Machaerus as a stopping point , we have spent nearly two months touring the countryside . Surrounded by a vast desert where the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a resort for wealthy men of Israel , some of whom come from Tyre , Sidon , and Caesarea Philippi ; from Jerusalem , Rome , and Athens . The city is known as the world 's foremost playground . During the season there is much dancing and drinking . Gambling is the principal diversion . The people who come to this place year after year  | provide an interesting study . They burn themselves to a crisp in the desert sun . They soak themselves in salt baths . Massagers rub their bodies with oils and magic potions . Fortune tellers , miracle workers , and magicians soothe and reassure them . Never have I seen people struggle so hard to convince themselves that they are happy . From what are they running ? From fate , from withering old age , from the specter of death ? In recent years the city has attracted thousands of new visitors because of the word that the hot salt baths of Machaerus were nothing less than the waters of eternal youth . So the wealthy , worried , sensate pilgrims come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rubbed by massagers and to be consoled by professional soothsayers . In the midst of weary gaiety they seek eternal youth , peace of mind , and the meaning of their existence . My disciples and I move in and out of the city with little notice . To the natives as well as the visitors , we are but one more band of religious fanatics who have come out of the Wilderness of Judea to escape the winter 's cold winds . We are a group of poverty-stricken nomads forced out of seclusion to find food and supplies in a prosperous city . Not more than ten miles from Machaerus , the caves and countryside swarm with Essenes who seek salvation by withdrawing from the world . The vacationers of Machaerus identify us with these . Here in the desert two destructive ways of life are seen in contrast . The winter-resort devotees look to the world to satisfy the desires of the flesh and to fortune  | tellers and soothsayers to satisfy the spirit . The Essenes , despising the world , separate themselves from it . Believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter of the Law ; thus not only will the integrity of Israel be preserved but salvation for the holy remnant will be achieved . The Essenes do little harm , but alas , they do little good . There is abundant life beyond the salt baths of Machaerus and the gloomy caves of Qumran . Eternal life , triumphant over sin and death , is to be found in the grace and love of God . I am come that men may have life and have it abundantly . The day we reached Machaerus , the disciples insisted that we go beyond the city to see the great castle of Herod Antipas . Herod used a portion of the castle as a prison for dangerous criminals . It was here that John the Baptizer was beheaded . Rose gardens , flower beds , and palm trees decorate the road leading up to the impressive Grecian structure . However , neither the fragrance of the flowers nor the beauty of the carefully planted palm trees could soften the harshness of the sight we beheld . John the Baptizer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . Several of my disciples had first heard the word of God from John 's lips . They loved and respected him , and they mourned his untimely death . He paid with his life for the high privilege of speaking the truth . Little did these , my disciples , know that each one of them had been marked for an early death , not unlike that which befell their friend . Spring , bringing with it the Festival of Passover , will shortly be upon us . Be-  | fore that week has passed , the fierceness of the day in which we live will become a reality to these men . By day we mingle with the visitors who crowd the streets ; by night we sleep on the ground beneath the starry skies . No cloud hides either sun or moon . We had been in this territory nearly a month when friends from Bethany came seeking us . Lazarus , dear friend and faithful follower , was sick unto death . Would I come and be with Mary and Martha during their hour of need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Bethany now ! Those in Jerusalem who sought to stone you during the Festival of Tabernacles are still there . Word of your increased following throughout Judea and Samaria has reached their ears . Please do not go ! " " I must go to Bethany to be with my sorrowing friends , " I replied . " From this experience the name of God will be honored . Those of you who care not to make the trip may remain here . I shall rejoin you as soon as possible , and here we shall abide until Passover . " Simon Peter , James , John , and Thomas volunteered to go with me . The other disciples complained of blistered feet . Judas , who could find no infirmity for an excuse but who was immensely enjoying the desert sunshine , suggested that he stay behind to look after the ailing disciples . When we arrived at the Bethany home after a journey of four days , we were met by a crowd from Jerusalem who had come to offer their condolences to the two sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads and telling each other  | what a splendid man Lazarus had been . While we were journeying , Lazarus had died . He had now been in his tomb nearly four days . When I beheld the look of anguish in the faces of Mary and Martha , tears rushed to my eyes . A good man , a child of God young in years and noble in spirit , had been cut down . With Mary and Martha at my side I left the house and walked beyond Bethany to the cave where Lazarus ' grave-wrapped body lay moldering in death . To some of the men standing by , I said , " Take away the stone . " My mortal enemy , Death , was once again to be confronted face to face . " But , Lord , " Martha cried , " he has been dead four days . By this time his body has begun to decay . " I said , " Martha , did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the power of God ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How deep the still waters run ! In that moment all faith was hers , and with faith came confidence and trust . The men removed the stone from the mouth of the cave . I lifted my eyes to heaven and said , " Father , God , I am grateful that you have given me power over life and death . Come now , give life to my brother , and deepen the faith of these who have believed that you sent me into this world . " As with the widow 's son in Nain , I called in a firm voice , " Lazarus , come forth ! " The dead man came out , his hands and feet bound with grave clothes and his face covered with a handkerchief . " Now untie him , " I said , " and let him go home . "  | Some of the people who had come to Bethany to console Mary and Martha witnessed this event . They were dumbfounded , but their timid faith in me was increased , even as was the faith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Pharisees and to Caiaphas the high priest to report that Yeshua of Nazareth had dared show his face near Jerusalem and had perpetrated another fraud . The high council of the Sanhedrin quickly assembled and I am told that the main topic of discussion was what to do about me . According to my informant one of them said : " If we permit him to continue with such activity , he will have everyone in Jerusalem believing on him , and that will be the end of us . " Caiaphas , in great haste , secured a number of soldiers from the Roman garrison and sent them to Bethany in search of me and my disciples . We left for Machaerus minutes before the soldiers arrived . I am not as yet prepared to give myself into the hands of those who seek to destroy me . The time is short . Before the end I must strive to make clear to my disciples  --  those from whom the everlasting community of believers will come ? why I must die at the hands of men . Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The blistered feet of those who had stayed behind were now healed . Today the one topic of conversation has been not Lazarus ' death but my own death , which will be accomplished as surely as spring comes . As plainly as words can be spoken , I said to the disciples , " I shall be taken by the chief priests , scribes ,  | and Pharisees . They will condemn me to death , and I shall be delivered up to the Romans as an object of mockery . " Thomas said , " Lord , this is a gloomy picture you paint . " " It is gloomy , but it is also real . Listen to this story , " I replied . " There was once a great landowner who planted a vineyard , fenced it , dug a hole for the winepress and built a watch tower to protect it . Then he let it out to tenants and went on his way thinking that all would be well with his carefully tended vineyard . " When the season of fruits drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect his share of the proceeds . The tenants , in an ugly mood , took his servants , beat one , stoned another , and killed a third . " When he sent more servants , the conniving tenants treated them as they had the first group . Then the landowner decided to send not servants but his own son , saying to himself , They will respect my son . ' " When the tenants saw the son , they said each to the other , This is the son , the future owner . Come on , let 's kill him and we shall get the full inheritance . ' So they took him and killed him and threw his body out of the vineyard . " When the landowner comes to reckon with the tenants what will he do to them ? " I asked , as I concluded the story . Simon the Zealot cried , " He will come and destroy the ruthless tenants and give the vineyard to others who will in justice bring forth fruit ! " " You no doubt have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The stone which the builders rejected , the same stone was made the chief cornerstone . ' " " Lord , what does this mean ? " asked Philip . " It means , " I answered , " that I shall die at the hands of men ; it also means that I shall be raised up . You may not understand fully what I am saying , but understanding it is unimportant compared to trusting what I say . Do you trust me ? " " We trust you , " they said in chorus .  | It is Thursday midafternoon of Passover week . I am sitting on the grass close by the fountain in the courtyard of the Bethany home . Braced against a spreading fig tree , I rest awhile and write awhile . The events of this week have been so numerous and so hectic that I have hardly had time to set them down . The disciples are staying with friends and relatives in Jerusalem and nearby cities . Each day of this week has brought its own set of exciting developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flared , and the crisis is about to be reached . Simon Peter , James , and John will arrive within the hour and accompany me for the last time to Jerusalem . We shall meet the other disciples in the upper room , and in the fellowship of the Kiddush we shall make ready for the Passover .  | The raising of Lazarus has enraged and solidified the opposition . It is now agreed by all sects , even by those which perennially fight each other , that my removal is essential to the peace and stability of Israel . Scribes , Pharisees , Sadducees , Herodians , high priests , and members of the Sanhedrin present a united front . The crusade is on in earnest . Yeshua of Nazareth must surely be put to death . On Sunday of this week , just before we entered Jerusalem , I led the disciples up the Mount of Olives to a lookout point which gave us a panoramic view of the entire metropolis . We gazed upon the sprawling city with its narrow , winding streets , its houses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Temple . We saw the hurrying people who from this distance looked like frightened chickens scurrying through the streets . I said , more to myself than to the disciples , " 0 Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who stone and kill your prophets , how often I would have gathered you to myself even as a hen gathers her brood , but you would not permit me . " Philip , impressed by the breathtaking view , cried , " See how the Temple rises above all else ! Look at those giant stones and the width of the mighty columns . Surely this is a majestic sight . Long after Caiaphas has been forgotten , the Temple will stand as a monument to Israel 's glory . Lord , do you not think so ? Will not the Temple last forever ? "  | I replied , " Yes , the Temple with its many buildings and great size is an imposing sight . But before this generation has passed it will be leveled to the dust . Not a stone will be left standing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Temple goes , is not all the world doomed to destruction ? " " Nathanael , " I said , " you are correct more than you suppose . There is nothing permanent about this world . Like the Temple , it too will pass away . There was a time when the world did not exist . It had a beginning . The time will come when it will be as it was before the beginning . This world will end . " " By flood , by fire , by shooting stars ? " asked James the Less , wide-eyed and breathless . " This world will not end by accident or by chance or by a whim of nature . It was not so begun . It will end as it was begun , according to God 's wisdom , power , and love . " " But when will all this happen ? " asked Simon Peter , James , and John , in one voice . " I can not tell you . I know not the day or hour . When I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the same time I emptied myself of absolute knowledge . The future is not known to me any more than to you ; it is known only to the Father , who will finish it as he began it  --  in love and wisdom . " Judas Iscariot , his mouth twisted into a familiar sneer , said , " But just a little while ago you predicted your death and also the destruction of the Temple . You surely must know some things about the future that we do not know . "  | I answered , " Any man can look into the heavens and when he sees a black , lowering cloud can say with reasonable certainty , It is going to rain . ' " Simon the Zealot , embarrassed by the sarcasm in Judas ' voice , quickly asked , " If the Temple is going to be destroyed , and if the world will some day end , why should we bother about working for what is right ? Why should we strive to make this a more decent world ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's question : " The believer remains in the world and gives himself to the ways of justice , mercy , and love , not because he expects great returns for himself , nor because he believes he can make this world a perfect world , but because in so doing he expresses his love for God and God 's people . The believer gives himself to the kingdom because this is God 's way , it is the right way . Achievements and results , times and seasons , are in God 's hand . The end will come at an unexpected time , in an unexpected way . The important thing is that a man be found faithful to the trust that is his . " When we were fully rested , we arose and started down the Mount toward Jerusalem . We passed the Garden of Gethsemane and took the path that led across the Kidron brook . In the distance near the city gate a multitude of people had gathered . An excited young man leading a jackass came out to meet us . It was John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . He cried , " I have a gift for you . Will you not ride this animal into the city ? " With a feeling of appreciation for the lad 's thought-  | fulness , I mounted the jackass and rode through the city streets . People from every city and hamlet in Judea and Galilee and from the lands beyond the seas have come , to Jerusalem for the Festival of Passover . Most of these pilgrims had heard of my ministry and of the opposition of the rulers of the people . The question , " Will he dare come to Passover ? " had been bandied about . Now that I had appeared , the people were in a mood of uncontrollable excitement . My appearance had challenged the authorities . Certain ones in the crowd , in a wild gesture of homage , spread their garments upon the way . Others took branches which they had cut from the trees along the road and threw them in my path . A booming voice shouted , " Hail him , he is a worker of miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! " Another , " He is a savior of sinners ! " Another , " He brings judgment to the Temple ! " Another , " Hail to the King ! " In chorus and with a rhythmic chant others sang , " Hosanna to the Highest ! Hosanna to the son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna to the Highest ! " Roman soldiers mounted on their handsome steeds kept the crowd under control . Their metal helmets , breastplates , and spears glistened ominously in the sun . Glaring at me astride my jackass , they scornfully surveyed the multitude as if to dare any or all of us to start a riot or a rebellion . This was Roman-occupied territory and these men of the sword and spear were here to  | remind all people that Rome , with its eternal power , would keep them in their places . Scribes and Pharisees mingling with the crowd heard the cries of welcome from the people . They frowned and fumed and gritted their teeth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean rejoicing later . As we moved through the city , the attention of the crowd was directed toward another spectacle . A platoon of Roman soldiers pulled and dragged a mud-spattered prisoner through the streets . They were taking him to a dungeon-room beneath Pilate 's palace . The crowd recognized the man in chains . In all Judea there was no man whose hands were bloodier . The people yelled , " It is Barabbas , the thief ! It is Barabbas , the murderer ! " Several mobsters broke through the soldiers ' lines , rushed at Barabbas , and spat upon him . Others took branches and struck him in the face . " Back , you fools ! " the soldiers commanded . " We will take care of this fellow . " Barabbas , along with other dangerous criminals , was slated to be crucified during the Passover season . We reached the Temple and entered to pray . Passing through the Temple court I observed that certain tradesmen had set up their tables and , though this was only the first day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disgusting sight . Was nothing sacred to these hucksters ? In the name of free trade and business enterprise they would stoop to any revolting practice . The Festival of Passover is no longer a religious festival . It has become a commercial racket , a sure way to make a quick profit . Merchants who never enter the  | Temple to pray set up their counters and stalls along the walkway and in the Temple court . With oily smiles they greet the people , and with clever slogans they sell their wares . Brightly colored signs read : " Put Moses Back Into the Passover " " Buy a Dove Now and Pay Later " " Get It Cheaper Here " I stifled the nausea that swept over me . After instructing the disciples to meet me on the morrow in front of the Temple court , I walked alone unnoticed to Bethany . The clean air of the countryside was even more refreshing than usual . After lunch as I rested outside the city by the Kidron brook , Philip and Andrew brought several visitors from Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made the long trip from Athens not to observe the Passover but to see and talk with Yeshua of Nazareth , about whom they had heard many things . The introduction over , one of the Greeks said , " You are a brave , righteous , and brilliant man . We have come to invite you to return with us to Athens . Our people will give you a hearing . " Smiling , I inquired , " Do not the Greeks poison their prophets still ? " The question was accepted good-naturedly even in the spirit in which it had been offered . The Greek replied , " No , we do not poison our prophets . Our people  | have grown up . We may not believe what the prophets say , but we extend to them the right to say it . You would be welcome in Athens and we can assure you a forum on Mars Hill . " Seriously now I said to them , " You are very kind , and your proposal disturbs me more than you realize . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own people , not by what I teach but by the way I die . Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains a single grain of wheat ; but if it dies , it brings a full harvest . The man who clings to his own life shall lose it ; the man who gives his earthly life in love shall find eternal life . " Still speaking to the Greeks , I continued , " The hour of crisis is upon me . In the face of your kind and generous offer , what can I say ? Father , save me from this hour ' ? I can not so pray . It was for this purpose that I have come to this hour . By that which is done in my life this week , the Father 's name will be honored . " When I said this , I heard a voice from heaven . It was the voice I had heard at my baptism ; it was the voice that had spoken to me on Mt . Hermon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through you , and I will honor it again . " Philip said shakily , " I thought I heard someone speak from the heavens . " Andrew replied , " You heard no voice . That was thunder . We will have a storm before this day is over . " The visitors from Athens thanked me for taking the time to talk to them . They left  --  but not before saying , " If you change your mind , let us know ! "  | In my own country of Galilee , the Herodians are more of a political group than a religious one . They are a party in Israel who bless with religious faith the rule of Rome as it is carried out by Herod Antipas . Local rulers who bow the knee to Caesar are not usually held in high esteem by the people . The Herodians , however , are strong supporters of Antipas , and because of this loyalty they have been generously favored by the king . Tuesday morning I was accosted by several of these favored ones . They were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen publicly with Herodians . Smooth and smiling , one of the Herodians approached me with these words : " Good teacher , we have noticed that you speak the truth regardless of the consequences to yourself . You seem to regard the truth of God more than you do the opinions of men . " While the Herodian spoke , a small crowd of the curious collected around us . I waited . I said nothing . The speaker , convinced of his own cleverness , betrayed himself with every smile and every gesture . He continued , " Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar or not ? Shall we pay or shall we not pay ? " The Herodian-Pharisee coalition sought to trap me in front of the people with a question that is as hoary as the history of military occupation . If I said , " Give honor to Caesar , " I would lose favor with the people . If I said , " Do not give honor to Caesar , " then , of course , I  | would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so obvious , the question so ancient , and the trap so easy to avoid that I was tempted to walk away and ignore the encounter . I thought better of my impulse , however , and asked someone in the crowd for a coin . " Whose face is this and whose name is on the inscription ? " I asked . " Caesar 's , " the people replied . " Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and to God what belongs to God , " I said . It was with considerable reluctance that I so spoke . This answer is as ancient and as trite as the question . But on the spur of the moment it was the best I could do . Yet the Herodians , the Pharisees , and the people seemed staggered by my success in avoiding the clever trap ! The ways of men are often beyond my comprehension . In the afternoon of the same day ( Tuesday ) I was approached by yet another party in Israel . This time it was the Sadducees , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadducees are a cynical lot . They pride themselves upon their expert knowledge of the Law . Though they profess to believe in the Law , I sometimes wonder if they believe in the God of the Law . One of the most notable characteristics of the Sadducees is their forced sense of humor . They feel that they must turn every statement into a pun or joke . They strain harder at being funny than any performing comedian . If they can not joke and make fun , they  | resort to sarcasm and cynicism . It is easier for the Sadducees to explain what they deny than what they affirm . For instance , they strongly deny the resurrection . Posing as scholars , they wrap the simplest statement in a fog of meaningless language . The more obscure the language , the more scholarly the man , they hold . The leader of the group , wearing a black mantle over his shoulder which signified that he was a doctor of the Law , shoved his face toward mine . His eyes danced , and his thin lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lamb before the kill than a doctor of the Law addressing an itinerant teacher from Galilee . Every word snapped and crackled as he spoke . " Teacher from Nazareth , " he said , " Moses wrote for our benefit that if a man 's brother dies leaving a widow but no children , the man should marry the widow and raise children to honor his deceased brother . Now , in the case which I am presenting for your consideration , there were seven brothers . The first took a wife and left no child . The second brother married the widow and he also died without producing a child . The same thing happened with the third . In fact , it happened to all seven brothers . All married the same woman ; none produced a child . Finally the woman died . " The Sadducee curled his lips as if to say , " It was about time she died . " He had difficulty keeping under control what to him was a very funny story . Checking himself , he continued , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , whose wife is she going to be ? Which brother will claim her as wife in that resurrected life ? "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | But I firmly put aside the voice of the tempter . Instead of calling down lightning upon these greedy heads , I took off my leather girdle-rope and used it for a whip . Rushing toward the cashiers ' tables , I started swinging . With two or three shoves I overturned the tables and whacked the fellow with the loud voice across the seat of his tunic . Coins of the money changers went flying in the air . Astonishment , confusion , and bedlam broke loose . Gripped by surprise and fear , the disciples rushed from the Temple court in search of cover . To the dove-dealers and those who sold the sheep and cattle , I said , " You have turned this house of prayer into a house of merchandise . This can not be tolerated . " Several men started to charge me . I held the girdlerope in my hand ready to use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they stopped and began to mutter among themselves . One of the cashiers said , " Who does he think he is ? Yelling at us and knocking over our tables ? By whose authority does he do this ? Did we not pay Caiaphas , the high priest , rental for these spaces ? " Another complained , " My business has been bad all year . I depend on the profit I make during these religious festivals to keep me out of debt . If Caiaphas lets him get by with this , I am a ruined man . " Some of these merchants were among the people who on Sunday had shouted , " He is a prophet of God . He brings judgment to the Temple . Hosanna to the Highest ! Hosanna to the son of David ! " The scribes and Pharisees , silent on Sunday , were now  | amused by the conflict which had arisen . One of them said to the money changers , " Have we not told you that this is a wild man ? He is crazed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to roam the streets he ought to be in chains . " Several bystanders shouted , " The scribes and Pharisees are right . He ought to be in chains . " The evening of this same day ( Wednesday ) I enjoyed a quiet supper with Mary , Martha , and Lazarus . We sat around the table and talked as if we did not know that this would be the last evening we would ever spend together . As I was about to retire , Martha , answering a knock at the door , said that a gentleman from Jerusalem desired to see me in secret . I took the stranger into the courtyard and there by the waters of the beautiful fountain we talked . He introduced himself . " My name is Nicodemus , " he said . " Though I have lived a number of years in Jerusalem my home is in Tarsus , the chief city of Cilicia . I am a citizen of Rome as well as of Israel . I am of the tribe of Benjamin , and by party affiliation I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sanhedrin . " I replied , " My name is Yeshua . I am from Nazareth . " He said , " I come to you by night and under the cover of darkness . I can not afford to be seen . You may not remember , but I was among those present at the dinner which Sanballat the Pharisee gave during the Festival of Tabernacles . " I laughed and said , " I certainly do remember . It was an awkward time for all of us. "  | " From that day to this , " he continued nervously , " I have been a believer . I went to Sanballat 's dinner that night knowing that you would be there . I was embittered toward you . Two years ago I helped to appoint the special committee that was sent to Galilee to investigate you . I was determined to make you conform to the way of Caiaphas and of our party . " But I felt the heat and the truth of your words . My conscience was seared , and I have lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you do , no man has the wisdom which you have , and no man has the courage to confront official power as do you , except God is with him . I have borne witness to the truth which I believe is within you , but I have done so secretly . " " Why do you come here tonight ? " I asked . " I come to warn you that as a result of the conflict with the money changers in the Temple court today , Caiaphas this very hour makes plans to lay hold of you before another night passes . You have time . Flee this place and live ! " He was about forty years of age and slight of build . His eyes watered , and he kept wiping them with a large handkerchief . He was a Pharisee with the best of training . A citizen of Rome and of Israel , he no doubt could speak several languages . His knowledge of the Law and prophets was extensive . He had traveled widely . I have long wished that my band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharisee who with zeal and courage would carry the good news of God 's love to the Gentiles . I said to him , " Nicodemus , it is not necessary that you  | live a double life . It would please me to have you join my small band of disciples . For reasons which I shall not mention , by this time tomorrow night the number of my disciples will be reduced by one . I invite you to join this group . Make a clean break with the people who now grip you . Cease telling yourself that you are going to change them and that you can do my cause more good by being on the inside ' than by being on the ' outside . ' In remaining inside ' of the party it is your own welfare and security you seek . Is not this so ? " " Yes , " he said , " it is so , but I can not make the break . I am where I am in Israel today because I have always been careful . My life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face twitched as he spoke . " If you come and follow me , I shall make you an instrument to carry my name to the Gentile world and to heathen kings as well . What we now do in Judea is not for our people alone ; it is for all the families of the earth ! " Lowering his head into his hands , he began to sob . His frail body shook with the conflict that tore him asunder . At last he cried , " I can not do it ! I have not the courage ; I have not the strength ! " " Nicodemus , you can do it , but not in your own strength . You must be born again by God 's love . You have lived so long in the shadow of the Law that you have forgotten what love is like ; you can be born again . " " You confuse me ! " he exclaimed . " How can a man as old as I am be born again ? " " That which is born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is born of spirit is spirit . Your life , bound by  | the grave-clothes of legalism , tradition , and personal ambition can be brought to new life by the love of God . Make the leap of faith and leave the rest to God . " As much as I wanted him for a disciple , I could not persuade him further . We stood by the fountain whose eager waters rushed to quench the thirst of those who would drink . Neither of us spoke a word . As last he sobbed no more . The conflict within him was resolved . He said , " I can not do it ; I simply can not do it . I have worked too hard for what I have . I can not throw it away ; I have an obligation to my family as well as to myself . " He fell into my arms . We said goodbye . Sorrow filled his heart and mine as he turned and walked into the blackness of the night . Thursday morning This morning , under a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , I walked into the city . The streets were jammed as they have been every day this week . The noise , however , seemed subdued . I was neither approached nor followed , praised nor cursed . I was seen but ignored . The icy greeting served notice on me that in challenging the money changers and hucksters I had gone too far . The people , and not simply the rulers , by their sullen silence were now telling me to get out of the city or they would not be responsible for what happened .  | I met the twelve in the Temple court . The stalls , the counters , the cashiers ' tables were gone . The clever slogans had been removed , and the voices of the hucksters were silenced . Only the sounds of praying people emanated from the Temple today . We entered the Temple , prostrated ourselves on the floor , and remained in prayer longer than usual . On leaving we passed the Temple treasury box . Several curious onlookers stood and watched the people as they dropped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing silk robes came by and cast in a large sum . There were " oh 's " and " all 's " from the onlookers . " Did you see that ? " one of them said , awestruck . The wealthy contributor had cast into the treasury at one time more money than any of the people standing by could give in an entire year . " What a generous man ! " a fawning Pharisee said . " All Israel is indebted to him and his kind . " At that very moment a poverty-poor widow came by . Unnoticed by the Pharisee or by any leaders of the Temple , she cast two small coins into the treasury box . They were worth about half a penny . I called my disciples to a corner in the Temple court . To them and not to the crowd I said , " Here is a lesson I hope you will not soon forget . The men of the Temple , our rulers , were impressed by a large sum contributed by one of the richest men in Judea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman dropped into the treasury box . The rich man gave out of his abundance . He has enough money left to live like a king . Yet he is honored as a generous and charitable  | man . But this woman in one gift has given more than the rich man in all his life . She has given away everything , even her entire living . " " Was it wise for her to give her all ? " asked James , the brother of John . I replied , " The spirit of the poverty-poor widow , in giving all she possessed , must be the spirit that possesses our hearts . " Recalling my conversation of the night before with Nicodemus , the half-committed man , I said as much to myself as to the twelve , " It must be all or nothing . " Thursday , late afternoon , just before dark , in the Bethany home This diary is almost complete . Simon Peter , James , and John arrived a few minutes ago . In the large room on the upper floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ await our coming . To the disciples I said , " The hour has come . Let us be going . "  | Today I am to be executed . My death has not been prearranged or preordained by God . It has been predetermined by man 's hate , lust , and bigotry . The way of violence this day has taken its ultimate course . During these years , God 's love has shone like a light in the darkness surrounding the life of men . That darkness  --  the great abyss of futility and meaninglessness  --  will not be able to quench the light . I am convinced that in my death I will be more alive than in my life . Death will be by crucifixion and according to Roman law . Outside the dungeon window I can hear the pounding of hammer against nails . Since daybreak the workmen have been preparing the great beams of my cross . Others besides myself will die today on Golgotha 's hill . How many , I do not know .  | Often during these turbulent years of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses , with broken bodies hanging from their beams , dotting the roadsides or grotesquely decorating a Judean hillside . It is an ugly sight . It is a brutal way to die . The past twelve hours have been more like a wild dream than an event in real life . The Festival of Passover nears its conclusion . Every year since my twelfth birthday I have come to Jerusalem for this occasion . Last night in an upper room of John Mark 's home I ate the Passover preparatory meal  --  the Kiddush  --  with my disciples . All of us were aware that this was no ordinary meal . This meal , the last we shall eat together , will forever be associated in the minds of my followers with my death . When we had taken our places on the couches surrounding the table , I took the bread , blessed it with prayer , broke it into pieces , and gave it to the disciples to eat . As the bread was passed from one to another , I said , " Take eat , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over it I offered a prayer of thanksgiving . The cup was passed from one to another . I said , " Drink this wine , for it is my blood of the new covenant . It is being poured out for you . " Eleven of my disciples were present . The twelfth saw fit to break the circle . He was excused before the meal was completed . Beyond the Kidron brook , just outside Jerusalem , there is a small garden atop the Mount of Olives . It is called the Garden of Gethsemane . Like most of the land in this part of Judea , it is a rugged , rock-strewn spot .  | There is a sternness about it that fits well into this week 's dark events . However , Gethsemane is quiet and secluded . Following the Kiddush , I sought this place for prayer and meditation . I was accompanied by my closest disciples , Peter , James , and John . This was last night ? Thursday night  --  and the hour was late . While the disciples rested and slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the first part of the night , I prayed for the disciples whom God has seen fit to give me during the years of my earthly ministry . I have given them his word and they have believed that I came from him . As God has sent me into the world with his message of love , so now I send them into the world . As the world has hated and rejected me and the love I brought to earth , so will it hate and reject them . During the latter part of the long night in Gethsemane , I turned my thoughts toward the immediate issue at hand . The cup of hate which I am about to have thrust upon me was gall to my soul . It was not simply the humiliation and suffering of the cross which I dreaded , though I anticipated that this would be severe . It was taking upon myself the sin , the fury , and the hatred of men . To myself I said , " Is there no other way whereby the love of God may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desperately I prayed : " If it be possible , let this cup pass . " Then I cried , " Nevertheless , it must not be what I want , but what you want . Your will must be done . " By now it was nearly dawn . The disciples , worn and  | weary by the pressures of the week , were still asleep . I arose from the ground , walked to the edge of the garden , and awakened them . Together we left Gethsemane 's trees , rocks , and shale and started toward Jerusalem . Night lingered . The dawn hesitated as if it dreaded the day which was about to be brought forth . At the foot of the Mount , on the path leading across the brook , we were suddenly confronted by a host of people . Some carried swords , staves , and knives . Others carried lanterns and torches . In front of the mob was a band of Roman officers and soldiers . Judas , one of the twelve , preceded the officers . By the flare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear . He spoke not a word . He singled me out , approached me , and as is the custom with teacher and disciple , he greeted me with a kiss on the cheek . The soldiers , having had their man pointed out to them , quickly seized and bound me . I was first brought before aged Annas , the Temple 's retiring high priest . The old man dispensed with me without delay and ordered me taken before his son-inlaw , Caiaphas , the present high priest . A number of witnesses were brought into Caiaphas ' court . They testified that they had heard me utter blasphemous words , that I had ignored the Law , and that I had made a mockery of the Sabbath . They further swore that they had heard me plotting with my friends to destroy the Temple . As a conclusion to the witnesses ' testimony , I was blindfolded , spat upon , and beaten with staves . Caiaphas at last commanded his men to cease beating me . One of his servants brought a sponge and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blindfold was re-  | moved , and while the high priest and his associates debated about their next move I was permitted to rest . I looked out the court window across the narrow yard where a fire shot its flames into the early morning air . Several people were milling about . I recognized Simon Peter , my friend and disciple . He was talking to a young servant girl , no doubt on her way to Caiaphas ' quarters to help prepare breakfast for his staff . Simon Peter appeared to be agitated and angry . I was unable to hear what he said to the girl until he raised his voice in a hoarse shout . He cried , " I tell you , I do not know the man . I am not one of his disciples . " The crisp morning air carried his words to my ears . It had been less than an hour since we were together in the garden . I stood yet another moment , staring across the courtyard . Servants and workmen on their way to their several jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in their midst . At last he turned his face toward the court building . His gaze met mine . He felt and knew the forgiveness in my heart . It was enough . In his eyes there were tears of shame , remorse , and repentance . Caiaphas ' strategy now was to call a special meeting of the Sanhedrin . The purpose of this was to secure ratification and approval for the irregular action which he had already taken . Scribes , Pharisees , elders , and as many members of the Sanhedrin as could be routed out of bed were called in . Solemnly and sleepily they heard the serious charges . By unanimous vote the Sanhedrin sustained Caiaphas ' action in having me apprehended  | and beaten . But there was another obstacle . The Sanhedrin , though it is the highest ecclesiastical court , can not pass the death sentence . Only the recognized Roman court can do this . The high priests had determined to settle for nothing less than the death penalty . Caiaphas and his associates discussed their next move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached me . Grasping my hand , he introduced himself : " My name is Simon . I have lately come from Cyrene to visit my family in Jerusalem . I am now a paid servant in Caiaphas ' household and I am one of your followers . Lazarus is my cousin . My sister was a woman of the streets and you brought new life to her . She was the woman taken in adultery by the temple gate . I was a man without faith in the Law or the Temple . When I returned to Jerusalem and saw at close hand the corruption of Israel , my soul knew only bittterness and distrust . You have renewed my faith . " He paused and added , " I wish I could die in your place . " " Bless you , my friend , " I said , " This is one thing I must finish alone . No one can do it for me . " He replied , " They have given me permission to remain by your side through the trial and whatever else may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice trembled as he spoke , " I bring you tragic news of Judas Iscariot . He returned the silver to Caiaphas . Then , just a few minutes ago , even as the sun rose , he hanged himself on a tree in the Garden of Gethsemane . " I said , " I 'm sorry . It could have been otherwise with Judas . "  | The Sanhedrin , recognizing its limited authority , voted to have me taken immediately before Pontius Pilate . The Roman governor , before whom I now stood , had also been roused from his slumbers . He was in a black mood . He had little patience with the bickering of his fanatical subjects . An assistant of Caiaphas arose and carefully presented the charges against me . When he completed his statement , Pilate , who had sat bored and irritated through the lengthy presentation , said , " Take this man out of my court and judge him according to your own law . " Caiaphas ' assistant calmly replied , " The accused is guilty of subversion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his confederates  --  one of whom is a member of the Zealots , an underground revolutionary party  --  have plotted to destroy the Temple . Furthermore , this man refused to pay tribute to Caesar and he sets himself up as the king of these Jewish people . He incites the people to revolt . He is worthy of death by crucifixion . But you , as governor , the representative of Caesar , must say the word before the execution can be carried out . What say you ? " Pilate ignored the question . He stared at me and the meager dress I wore . There was no toga on my body , no turban about my head . My feet were without sandals . I wore no mantle , only a seamless burlap tunic which was tied around my waist by a girdle-rope . " Man , " he asked , " do you really claim to be the king of these people ? " I hesitated a moment . Why say anything ? Finally , I answered , " You have so stated it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " He is a Galilean and is therefore under the judisdiction of Herod Antipas . Herod has been in Jerusalem for more than a week , and he is staying at the old palace . Take the prisoner to Herod and let him pass judgment . " The rulers of the people were disappointed at this decision , but they saw that the governor was in no mood to be intimidated . " To Herod Antipas we shall take our case , " they said . The comedy of misdeeds continued . Again I was led across the city  --  this time to the old palace , once the abode of Herod the Great . Antipas appeared in a jolly frame of mind . He said that he was glad to meet me face to face . He had heard that I had spent the winter in his favorite city of Machaerus but he had missed seeing me . Antipas made no reference to my friend and kinsman , John the Baptizer , whom he had murdered nearly two years ago . Though troubled for a while by this bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was at the moment interested in me because he had heard that I was a worker of miracles . An avid follower of magicians and soothsayers , Antipas hoped that I would perform a miracle for him . Caiaphas ' assistant , the young lawyer with the cropped beard , rehearsed in monotonous detail the charges which he had presented before Pilate . The king interrupted him before he had completed his statement . Antipas wanted me to perform for him . When he saw that I would neither call forth a miracle nor speak a word in my defense , he pouted like a child . While he sat in  | silence and stared at me , the soldiers , with his permission , had their fun . They mocked me and threw over my tunic faded garments which once had been worn by the king . During the demonstration I stood silently before Herod . Antipas soon grew tired of the carnival proceedings and abruptly ordered me returned to Pilate . I had been apprehended in Judea , and as far as he was concerned , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Still dressed in the clownish-kingly garments the soldiers had thrown about me , I was taken back across the city to appear before Pilate a second time . The rulers of the people had to exact an early decision . Time meant everything . No man can be crucified on the Sabbath , and the Sabbath begins today at sundown . Delay beyond this point could prove disastrous to their carefully laid plans . Right now the people seemed to be supporting their religious leaders in demanding that I be punished . But the people are fickle . A week from now they may be praising Yeshua of Nazareth and calling for the overthrow of Caiaphas . ( My entrance into Jerusalem , amid the wild acclaim of the people , occurred only five days ago ! ) As we walked from the old palace to Pilate 's court , a mob followed close upon our heels . The morning hour was still early , but the people sensed that an unusual occurrence was taking place in Israel . They did not want to miss it . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria , Antioch , Ephesus , Rome , and Athens to worship in the Temple and to  | observe the Passover . They seemed to relish the unexpected excitement to which they were now being treated . At the Festival of the Passover each year , it is customary for the governor to suspend the sentence of a notable criminal selected by the people . Pilate anticipated that Herod Antipas would return me to his court . In the brief time of our absence , the governor formulated a plan which would enable him to avoid passing a death sentence on one he felt to be innocent . He was holding a well-known outlaw , Barabbas by name , the same prisoner we had seen being beaten in the streets the first day of this week . When the religious rulers of the people and the multitude that had followed us , assembled in front of his court , the governor shouted at them , " Whom will you that I release to you ? Barabbas , or Yeshua ? " He did not doubt that the people would openly prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of violence . But Pilate had not reckoned with Caiaphas and his determined associates . Several key leaders in the mob had been prompted to say , " Release Barabbas to us and crucify Yeshua ! " Soon the entire mob began to chant , " Release to us Barabbas ! Release to us Barabbas ! We want Barabbas ! We want Barabbas ! " The governor was obviously irritated with the rulers of the people and also with the mob . He succeeded in quieting the screaming people and asked them , " What shall I do with Yeshua who is called the Christ ? " In one mighty chorus the people cried , " Crucify him ! Crucify him ! "  | When Pilate saw that he could neither prevail nor any longer evade making the decision , he called for a basin of water . In the presence of the people , he washed his hands and cried , " I am free of the blood of this innocent man . " The people shouted , " His blood be upon us and upon our children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " Father God , forgive them . They know not what they say . " The governor ordered the release of Barabbas and gave his legal consent for my execution . I am to die by crucifixion before sundown . Caiaphas , the chief priests , the scribes , and the Pharisees were jubilant when the decision was announced . They laughed and sang and danced in the streets . The religious rulers , usually conscious of their exalted position and restrained by their dignity , now pounded each other and shouted mutual congratulations . The protectors of the Temple , the guardians of the Law , the defenders of morality , the custodians of religion had won the most important battle of their administration . A guard of soldiers quickly marched me to a dungeonlike room beneath the governor 's palace , near the court . I was again at the mercy of the soldiers who desired to prolong their fun . The harassment , begun in Caiaphas ' quarters , was continued . They stripped me naked and in Gentile fashion made jokes about my circumcision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that had been discarded by a Roman magistrate . They
