But a postseason world-championship series would be the climax . On New Year 's Day college football will begin its second 100 years with an unprecedented TV invasion of Great Britain . NBC International has sold overseas rights to the Rose Bowl game to London Weekend Television . Which marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ televised outside the Western Hemisphere . Video reception of the Michigan-Southern Cal contest may be novel for the Rugbysoccer-oriented British . But the pregame . Tournament of Roses parade will be old hat . , The two-hour parade has long been seen on TV from Japan to North , Africa , with an American audience alone tabbed at more than 104 million . The Soviet Union 's bid to host the 1976 Olympic Games in Moscow may pose a sticky problem for the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . Russia was one of the founding nations of the modern Olympic movement and , in terms of population , is its largest member . In political terms , the staging of the Games in a Communist country is believed by many observers to be long overdue . Also bidding for the ' 76 Summer Games are the United States ( Los Angeles ) , Canada ( Montreal ) , and Italy ( Florence ) . - Here comes the ticklish part . Los Angeles , which has already hosted one Olympiad ( 1932 ) , is equipped with better facilities and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wants to hold the Games in conjunction with the 200th anniversary of America 's Declaration of Independence .

How and why ... One of pro football 's oldest cliches is that weather is the great leveler . It is a sound theory and immediately comes to mind in regard to the National Football League 's Western Conference title game Dec. 27 in Minnesota . The game is between the Central Division champion Minnesota Vikings and the Coastal Division champion Los Angeles Rams . The weather in Minnesota in late December is often more predictable for skiing than football . So George Allen , the Rams ' coach , will bring his team into Minneapolis for " weather practice " three days before the actual game . Two years ago , when Los Angeles lost a ? title game to Green Bay in Milwaukee , they did n't travel to the . Midwest until the day before the game . And they certainly never adjusted to temperatures which ranged to a low of 8 degrees above zero . " This time we 'll be ready , " Allen says . But will , it be a true contest for either team if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature plunges ?
