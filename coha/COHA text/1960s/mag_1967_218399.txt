In their cheerful forecasts for a summer surge in the U.S. economy , Washington policymakers have counted on a strong rebound by the housing industry-the foremost victim of last year 's tight money . Though housing has clearly begun to climb back from its worst slump in almost a decade , the revival so far has been a bit sluggish . Last week the Commerce Department reported that March housing starts showed a mere 1.7% gain from their February doldrums , to an annual rate of 1,171,000 new houses and apartments . At that pace , the industry was barely bettering its performance during the last half of 1966 . " It 's easier to scare buyers away than to get ' em back , " says Los Angeles Builder Ben Deane , sounding a common sentiment among his colleagues . " The recovery is going to be slow . " <P> Cheaper Loans . Still , builders , lenders and economists agree , with rare unanimity , that the ailing industry will regain its health by year 's end . President Leon Weiner of the National Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the summer and fall will lift starts to a 1967 total of 1,300,000 , as against 1,220,000 in 1966 . Such optimism is based mainly on the Government 's sharp switch toward easier credit . Interest rates on home mortgages have dropped faster than in any recent period in Federal Reserve records .

" By midyear , " says President Irving Rose of Detroit-based Advance Mortgage Co. , " the apartment market should be particularly tight in New York City , Detroit , San Francisco and San Jose , Calif . " <P> A Blow to Cost Cutting . Similarly , last year 's building plunge erased a glut of some 100,000 unsold new houses in California . " Now , " says Vice President C. E. McCarthy of the Bank of America , " there are actual shortages , except in units priced over $40,000 and in poor-quality developments . " <P> In a number of cities , including Pittsburgh , Chicago , Atlanta and Cincinnati , builders ' efforts to step up production are complicated by shortages of carpenters , plumbers , bricklayers and electricians . " The building trades are replacing only 50% of their people who retire , " explains Robert Teti of Pittsburgh 's Ryan Homes .
