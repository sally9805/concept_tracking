Passages to India by Stanley Kattiftrtann historic changes . Now Viking presents , in an attractive volume illustrated by the author 's brother , fifteen very old Indian tales retold by Narayan . He explains that these are truly storytellers ' stories . Every village has such a storyteller , usually an old man . " When people want a story , at the end of their day 's labors in the fields , they silently assemble in front of his home , particularly on evenings when the moon shines through the coconut palms . " These stories , traditional like those of all the world 's village storytellers , have certain particularities . First , they are steeped in religion . They exemplify divine attributes , mortal virtues and failings vis-a-vis religious precept , demonic schemes , basic moral unity . Chesterton said of Aesop that there is only one moral to all the fables because there is only one moral to everything . This is sound Hinduism , but Aesop is dramatized homily in which the point is not clear until the end . These Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambience . As in Greek myths , a line between man 's free will and the gods ' determination is never firmly drawn . And as in those myths and the Old Testament , man 's con-frontation with the divine is con-stant , both in dialogue and influence . Throughout these stories man is learning his place , hierarchical and moral , in the cosmos ; and the stories live because each new generation must learn the same cosmogony , simultaneously certified and imposed by the billions who have preceded them . In these stories are both the strengths of tradition and a hint of the past as burden . A second particularity of these stories is the way they use time , neither in a linear way nor in the variations of the linear by flashback and vision to which we are accustomed . Speaking of The Ramayana , the great epic by Valmiki from which some of these stories derive , Narayan says : " The time scheme of the epic is somewhat puzzling to us who are habituated to a mere horizontal sequence of events .... One has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get used to a narrative going backwards and forwards and sideways . When we take into consideration the fact that a king ruled for sixty thousand or more years , enjoying an appropriate longevity , it seems quite feasible that the character whose past or middle period is being written about continues to live and turns up to have a word with the historian . " The explication is helpful , but let it not sound forbidding ; the adjustment is not difficult . In fact the West has , in its technology , a kind of lubricant of the imagination . In these days of stratospheric weightlessness , of circling the globe in two hours ? indeed , in the stopping , reversal , dilation of time in the cinema ? the flights of Hindu imagination are apposite . A man who can see other men 's past incarnations is not so remote from men who have made fine wires into brains with histories and judgments ; both are acts of intense imaginative will . The stories are divided into five groups , each with a topic : adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion ; kingly principle . They are told by Narayan with an uncoy simplicity . ( The dialogue has its own archaic charm . A highwayman , asking his victims to hand over their money : " You are seven and may be hiding something among yourselves . Immediately deliver it , will you ? " ) Almost every story starts with an ostensible intent , then , as Narayan promised , refocuses , flowers unexpectedly along its tangents . There is a slight , pleasant tedium to most of the longer ones , like just a bit too much lovely sightseeing . All travelers convert currency in their heads as they go ; so with trips into foreign myth . There is no question of reducing the unfamiliar to the familiar , for we do not live in One World and " they " are not , at bottom , just like " us . " But there is a lingua franca in mythology , and familiar themes give us a ground from which to assimilate the less familiar . The theme of wifely devotion through dreadful adversity ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Arabian Nights . Harischandra and Sibi are versions of the Job theme , man being tested by Heaven ( in more ways than Heaven sometimes seems aware of ) . Lavana , in which ages pass in an instant , is like the legend , retold by Stevenson , of the monk who grew old while listening to a bird 's song . Savitri is , essentially , Orpheus and Eurydice with the roles reversed . There is just enough echo in it all to give us some paradoxical feeling of rediscovering the new . It ought also to be noted that , as in Japan , another country whose immense past is greatly involved in its busy present , the old tales of India are very much a part of their films . Harischandra was one of the first long films made in India . Shakuntala , dramatized 1,50o years ago by Kalidasa , was made into one of the major postwar Indian films . Savitri was filmed in the silent days and has subsequently appeared in six different sound versions . Narayan provides some explanatory material both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essence of both the terminology and the religion . Nothing need be memorized though certainly not all the names and traits and epochs can be remembered . Despite the profligacy of odd terms , the book appeals and illuminates , though , unlike other myths , it never deeply moves us . Two impressions are dominant : this religion of serenity and peace has a legendary base of bloodshed that makes the Norse sagas look mild . Women , who are of course inferior , have humbly to be wiser than the wise men ; there are several women in these stories who want children by sages and have to entice the men into fatherhood . And there is one unforgettable parenthetical comment at the end of a passage about a certain king : " He was childless . He devoted all his hours to praying for issue . . . . The goddess Savitri , whose hymn he recited a hundred thousand times as a part of his prayer , appeared before him and conferred on him the boon of a daughter ( although he prayed for a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people so ancient in acceptances ?
