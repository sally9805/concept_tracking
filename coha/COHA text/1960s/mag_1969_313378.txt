In 1948 , long before proclamations on racial justice were commonplace , the First Assembly of the World Council of Churches declared that segregation by religious organizations is " a scandal within the Body of Christ . " Over the years , the council has been an outspoken apostle of brotherhood-although its ringing declarations have also insisted that racism should be fought by nonviolent means . Last week , however , an international Consultation on Racism in London organized by the Council suggested that if all else fails , even outright warfare is morally justified to end this moral blight . <P> Though the statement troubled some delegates , the 25-nation meeting declared that " the church and the world are filled with blatant institutional racism . " They recommended economic sanctions against " corporations and institutions " that practice discrimination , and said that " guerrilla fighters struggling against racist regimes must be given the support of the church if all else has been seen to fail . " Under the chairmanship of Democratic Senator George McGovern of South Dakota , a Methodist lay delegate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain circumstances , " support resistance movements , including revolutions , which are aimed at the elimination of political or economic tyranny that makes racism possible . " <P> Platitudinous Drivel . The mood of the delegates , white and black alike , was as militant as the resolutions . After the Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr. Michael Ramsey , told the delegates that " there was no room for discrimination " in the house of God , the Rev. Channing Phillips , a black United Church of Christ minister from Washington , snapped : " The same old platitudinous drivel .

' What is necessary is for us to really recognize one another as equals .

" <P> While pacificism seemed outdated in London , the idea of reparations for past injustices was very much in style . Despite a few questions about who would control the money , the conference supported the proposal that churches compensate those who had been " exploited " by a capitalistic system . The Christian churches , the delegates reported , had " not only tolerated but also profited from " the system . Of all the meeting 's decisions , this was perhaps the one of greatest practical concern to American clergymen . Ever since he disrupted a Sunday service at Manhattan 's Riverside Church with his demand for $500 million in reparations for American blacks ( " $15 per nigger " ) , James Forman 's Black Manifesto ( TIME , May 16 ) has become one of the most hotly debated issues in U.S. churches .
