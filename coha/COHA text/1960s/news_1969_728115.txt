txt The controversial underground test of a hydrogen bomb was carried out today as planned on the south end of this island . A strong ground motion , lasting about 40 seconds , shook the control center 40 miles away . . The authorities here said that this had not been caused by any earth slippage triggered by the blast . The motion was caused , they said , by the fact that the shock waves reached this point by reflection from different levels beneath the earth and so arrived at different times . Aerial sweeps and remote reading of instruments showed no escape of radioactivity one and a half hours after the test . The weapon fired was reported to be 1.2 megatons in force . In Washington , the Atomic Energy Commission said that the test had not triggered tidal waves or a damaging earthquake , United Press International reported . Critics of the test had argued that it might touch off a severe earthquake and tidal wave . The western Aleutians , where this // From Page 1 , Col. 3 island is situated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available from the extensive set of ecological experiments that were a part of the test . Some opponents of the project had objected that the shock might upset life balance and endanger such species as the sea otter . The bomb , fired at 12:06 P.M. Bering Sea time , 6:06 P.M. Eastern daylight time , caused the earth at ground zero to rise considerably . The structure over the 4,000-foot shaft where the bomb was buried survived the shock . One remotely controlled television camera was focused on a known slippage point called Rifle Range Fault . Water and mud could be seen squirting from it as the pressures seemed to force it to slip . It appeared that slippage might have occurred , but no positive information will be available until a later physical inspection . The cost was about $125-million for building the construction camps , drilling the holes for this and two future shots and firing this test . Remoteness of the site increased costs greatly , so that this test cost perhaps twice as much as a similar one would have in the Nevada desert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a second as the components of the bomb were forced together and the explosion occurred , creating temperatures of millions of degrees that vaporized thousands of tons of rocks . The shot caused a shower of rock above , and as the cavity pressure lowered , the ceiling progressively collapsed . This frequently produces the crater effect ' typical of underground tests of big bombs . The shot was fired in weather that was unusually benign for the Aleutians . After a series of rainstorms , the skies cleared , and the sun was shining at blast time . Winds were at 17 miles an hour , and the temperature was 42 degrees . The bomb called Milrow , with 1.2 megatons of power , was designed as a match for one called Boxcar , which was fired in April , 1968 , in the Nevada desert . Scientists and the Atomic Energy Commission have decided that weapons tests of larger magnitude must be moved away from Nevada , where they may have adverse effects on Las Vegas , 100 miles from the Boxcar site , and Salt Lake City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bomb tests in the range of two megatons and more has been contested by groups in Alaska and elsewhere . A megaton is equal to the force of a million tons of TNT . The critics argued that the test of the 1.2-megaton Milrow could trigger an earthquake in the fault that runs beneath the Aleutian Ridge and back to mainland Alaska . I They said that bomb testing , even underground with the radioactivity contained in the earth , was bad and constituted a needless contamination of the environment . They also believe that the next weapons tested will be upward of two megatons in power , and that these bombs are designed for the controversial antiballistic missile system . Thus , the opposition to this test allied the antiwar , antibomb , anti-A.B.M. group with the naturalists . and the conservationists who oppose environmental contamination . Many exploitation - oriented Alaskans who normally support the military but are afraid of earthquakes and tidal waves also opposed the test .

Few Alaskans have seen the island . The nearest inhabited places are islands 200 miles away , Shemya to the west and Adak to the east . Until four years ago , no one lived here after troops left at the end of World War II . The south end of the island is littered with hundreds of old Army buildings , and there is a heavy scar on the tundra where in 1965 the Department of Defense held an 80-kiloton bomb test called Longshot . The commission installed a public information office in a room on the ground floor of the Anchorage Westward Hotel . Pamphlets were given away . Movies were shown . Questions were answered . The commission also provided quarters aboard the aircraft carrier Princeton for news reporters wanting to come to the island as soon as possible after the blast . The Princeton has been cruising 10 miles offshore for several days . Representative Chet Holifield , chairman of the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy , came to Amchitka on Tuesday . Testers Need Island " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have every confidence it is completely safe , " the California , Democrat said then . " So it seemed to me ' I ought to show this by coming here . " The public relations concern arose in part because the testing program needs Amchitka . No realistic alternative is bed lieved to exist anywhere else on American soil . There had ? been a suggestion that the tundra of the frozen North be used , but ' that was before heavy oil strikes were made there . Scientists working on the program were confident that Amchitka would come through the tests without major incidents . They were also con. - fident that the island would prove to be a suitable test site for hundreds of bombs far beyond the range that could be tested in Nevada . Dr. William Ogle , scientific adviser to the test manager here , was asked in an interview how many megatons in one bomb the island could withstand . He replied , " I 'm sure the number is tremendously larger than anyone in the United States will ever want to test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
