Results Predicted From Areas Cbange-Over TO THE EDITOR OF TIIRNsif You I have been reading with interest and dismay A. Rosenthal 's ; series on the transfer , of West Ne*t'Ouinea to United NatiOitti ! administration . These articles , along with your Oct. 2 editorial " Change Over in New Guinea , " tell a disheartening story of the results of American foreign ' policy in Southeast Asia . It seems that the Bunker agreement ( to turn . over administration of West New Guinea to Indoneka with interim United Nations stewardship ) has had and will continue . to have purely negative results . For example , in the two months since the Dutch bowed to Indonesian and United ' States pressure and agreed to leave West New Guinea , we have seen the following results : United Nations officials standing by idly as hundreds of Indonesian " technicians " pour into New Guinea in a de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to under the Bunker proposal . Disruption and ultimate discontinuance of Dutch plans for development of the Papuans to social and political maturity . This has begun with an exodus of Papuans from cities and towns back to the interior , away from unfamiliar United Nations and Indonesian personnel . Deterioration of communications and other public services . Reversion to Dutch One of the more curious provisions of the Bunker agreement calls for a referendum in 1969 in which the Papuans will be permitted to vote either for independence or continuance of Indonesian rule . Surely a more logical and ethical arrangement would have offered them a third option  --  an opportunity to revert to Dutch administration . This could be particularly important because it seems unlikely that the Papuans could have reached the political maturity necessary for selfgovernment in *seven years , even under the Dutch . Certainly under inexperienced Indonesians this process will take considerably longer , Finally , what of the eastern portion of New Guinea now adminis tered humanely and efficiently ' by the Australians ?

ROBERT B. DOWNEY . Winnetka , Ill. , Oct. 4 , 1962 . Defacing Library Books TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRK TIMES : Recently I have been using the New York Public Library system for research and am appalled by the condition of many of the books . High school and college students who consult these books seem to have little compunction about marking up page after page with whatever is handy  --  often pen and ink . Then there is the problem facing a researcher when he discovers that the only copy of a book which is vital to his work has permanently disappeared  --  possibly under the coat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public property can be made aware of their responsibility to their fellow citizens ? Are the schools and colleges powerless in the face of this problem ? EST HER LIBERMAN . Brooklyn , Oct. 3 , 1962 . . Our Legal Rights in Berlin To TIES EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEs : The presence of the former Allied powers in West Berlin and West Germany has for many years been founded on legal rights arising by virtue of international agreements . Soviet Russia has called Into question the ? binding nature of such agreements under present circumstances . On July 26 , 1961 , President Kennedy reaffirmed America 's reliance on its treaty rights when he stated in an address to the nation that : " If anyone doubts the legality of our rights in Berlin , we are ready to have it submitted to adjudication . " It would seem particularly appropriate at this time for the United States to assert its preposed submission of the questions of legal rights in Berlin for decision by the International Court of Justice . The recent advisory opinion of the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should assuagie fears A many circles that this body is in any manner dominated by . an Eastern bloc . While the Soviet Union has never adhered to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court , - it may nonetheless submit to jurisdiction in an individual case . There is little doubt that the , Sovids would reject such an offering . . ' However , . the advantage of Mg publicly se4uring such refusal is not , Without merit . The charge is some- , what tiringly made that the United States is all too often merely reacting to opposition thrusts . Our confidence in our legal rights and sincere belief in peaceful adjudicathin of international disputes is a ' weapon in its own right and may warrant a thrust . ROBERT LAYTON . New York , Sept. 25 , 1962 . Indiana Port Plan Favored ' ' Save-Dunes ' Move Questioned , Project 's Aid to Jobless Stressed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIME* : The Times , I believe , has exhibited less than its usual objectivity in its Sept. 26 editorial in presenting the merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor in the Indiana dunes area . The proposed port project is a necessary answer to Indiana 's need for more rapid economic growth in a region which has a serious proble . of chronic unemployment . The port project is supported not just by politicians of both parties and steel executives but by the majority of the people of the state of Indiana , and especially by the working men who would benefit from the new employment opportunities the port would provide . Indiana has less than 50 miles of shoreline on Lake Michigan ; large areas of this shore are now occupied . by the existing industrial complexes of Lake County ( Gary ) and Michigan City . The Porter County site is thus the only area along the In- ' diana shore which would lend itself to the development of a port . This is the area already approved by the United States Corps of Engineers . No plans . to interfere with the Indiana Dunes State Park , also in Porter County , are known to me . The Lakeshore project of Senator Paul Douglas , presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Id preservation of a unique ecoloc ira 1 formation , is in reality a rather blatant subterfuge , designed only to perpetuate the commercial monopoly of the port of Chicago . This same dune formation , present for only a. few miles along Indiana 's crowded lakeshore , lines the west coast of Michigan for a considerable distance . Why is n't Senator Douglas interested in preserving these vast stretches , rather than In propounding an unreasonable program , detri -- mental to the future of a neighboring state ? There can be only one answer , and the people of Indiana are entitled to a fair hearing by those interested in competition and continuing , economic growth . DOUGLAS F. BURNS .

Professor Carberry to Rescue To THE EDITOR OF T HE NIEW-r0RX TIMES : It is pbvious from the recent Shakespeare editorial Sept , 21 that neither The Times nor the would-be Shakespearean grave robbers are cognizant of recent researches designed to settle the questions surrounding the authorship of these famous Elizabethan-era plays . Prof. Josiah S. Carberry of Brown University has recently completed an exhaustive and intensive examination of Shakespeariana while in England this past summer . Aided by a variety of newly developed scientific devices  --  including the Erewhon Temporal Probe , the Graustark Graphological ' Analyzer and several other devices still under security wraps  --  Professor Carberry was able to establish to the satisfaction of leading scholars that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were written not by the " Bard " himself but- by another actor of the same name .
