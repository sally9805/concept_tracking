txt A %yarning that the city transit system 's 15-cent fare might have to be increased some time within the 12-month period after July 1 was sounded yesterday by the Transit Authority . State law requires the system to ; charge a fare high enough to cover its operatting expenses . Joseph E. O'Grady , chairman of the authority , said an estimated $33 million deficit for the year ending next June 30 could be covered by special resources made available when the city and state helped avert a transit strike Jan. 1 , 1964 . But he forecast that the deficit between operating expenses and revenues would be " substantially more than $33 million " for the year starting July 1 , The present labor contract expires next Jan. 1 and Mr. O'Grady said he assumed that this might lead to increased costs . Mr. O'Grady discussed the Transit Authority 's financial situation after a regular biweekly meeting with his two fellow commissioners , John J. Gilhooley and Daniel T. Scannell , at their headquarters , 70 Jay Street , Brooklyn . The Transit Authority chief told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's increase in fare was currently estimated at $12 million a year . This would indicate that a 3-cent fare increase or fare combination might be needed to meet the expected deficit . But Mr. O'Grady declined to speculate on this or on alternatives . He said Mayor Wagner and Governor Rockefeller were actively trying to set up the . joint committee on financing transit here that they prom- , ised at the time they helped settle the New Year 's strike ' threat of 1964 , and he said he hoped this committee would get going within " weeks . " The proposed committee would be required to study all public , passenger transportation in the , city and its relationship to oth er transportation and to neigh-1 boring areas , aiming at a long- , term solution . One study , fon in- ' stance , might be how suburbs of the Boston metropolitan dis- , triet help pay for transit lines ; ) the authority here has already studied such problems as zone fares . Fare Stable Since ' 53 , In Albany , Robert L. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . committee is going to be appointed shortly . " The city has maintained the 15-cent fare on both subways and buses since July 25 , 1953 . It is the lowest for any rapid transit ' system in the nation , Mr. O'Grady said . Boston 's rapid transit fare is 20 cents ; Philadelphia 's and Chicago 's 25 , and Cleveland 's 30 . Since the authority began operations June 15 , 1953 , Mr. O'Grady went on , manpower requirements had been reduced by 8,000 by attrition , producing economies he estimated at $50 million a year . " I do n't feel there is room for any further slashes , " he said . With efforts that included purchases of new equipment , the authority reversed a trend and attracted increasing numbers of riders starting . = in 1959 and going on through 1962 , Mr. O'Grady recalled . But a new fall-off began with the newspaper strike of December , 1962 , and has not been overcome since , he said . He made public a report showing that the system 's ex penses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 435 , for an operating deficit of $17,067,892 . This , he said , would be offset primarily by a $16 , million bookkeeping transfer The New York Times Fob. 3. 1965 The asterisks on the chart represent projections based on Transit Authority data . authorized by the 1964 citystate deal , by which the city gave the authority that much in materials and supplies formerly leased and paid for from revenues . For the remaining six months of this fiscal year , a $16 million deficit was indicated . This , along with a carryover deficit of $3,275,934 from the twelve months ended last June 30 , is to be covered by another arrangement in the 1964 deal , accelerated payment of $20 mil ; ' lion by the city to the authority growing out of sale of transit plants , otherwise payable only at the rate of $5 million a year . The ' authority , Mr. O'Grady said , had correctly estimated that 35 per cent of the visitors , to the New York World 's Fair would use the subway and bus lines . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors , transit revenues were $2,090,000 , or $397,000 less than estimated , he said . The 720 miles of rapid transit lines had a six-month operating deficit of $16,153,214 , while the , 554 miles of bus lines had a deficit of $914,678 . The bus losses , Mr , O'Grady said , mainly em- , anated from the Staten Island service , - for which the deficit was $1,159,928.
