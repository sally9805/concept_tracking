txt President Johnson said today that a recently achieved " economic breakthrough " meant the " long promised day of economical nuclear power is close at hand . " The resulting new technology , " now being applied in the United States , will be available to the world , " he said . The President , who spoke at commencement exercises at Holy Cross College here , gave no details of the breakthrough . However , it was apparent that he was referring to the $68 million nuclear power plant being built for the Jersey Central Power and Light Company at Oyster Creek , N. J. Mr. Johnson said that by Sept. 1 he would report to the Third International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy " on our new capability to use the power of the atom to meet human needs . " Plant Design Improved The breakthrough to which he referred has come in the last six to eight months . MorF efficient plant design and longer life of nuclear fuels are expected to make nuclear power ultimately competitive with other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek plant thus symbolically opened the door for greater interest in nuclear power here and abroad . Subsequently the Mohawk Power Company decided to have a similar plant built at Oswego , N. Y. Mr. Johnson 's remarks were part of an address to about 20 , - 000 persons in the Fitton Field Stadium at Holy Cross . He said that " many of our most urgent problems " would exist even if the cold war were ended today . A. Warning on Isolation " Even if peace were to come to the nations , " Mr. Johnson said , " ominous obstacles to man 's efforts to build a great world society " would remain . " Those who live in the emerging community of nations will ignore the problems of their neighbors at the risk of their own prosperity , " he said . They would become , he warned " an increasingly isolated island of wealth in the midst of mounting misery . " Mr. Johnson proposed that 1965 , which has been designated International Cooperation Year , should also become " the Yea ) . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finding new techniques for making man 's knowledge serve man 's welfare , " he said . " Let it be a turning point in the struggle ? not of man against man , but of man against nature . In the midst of tension , let us begin to chart a course toward the possibilities of conquest which bypass the politics of the cold war . " Mr. Johnson said that he intended " to call upon all the resources of this nation , public and private , to work with other nations to find new methods of improving the life of man . " This was the President 's sixth commencement address this year , probably giving him the world 's record for a single year . He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law , his fifth honorary degree since becoming President and the 24th he holds . Despite the occasion , Mr. Johnson 's appearance here had a certain political tone . A crowd of about 150,000 persons lined the six-mile route through this heavily Democratic city from the municipal airport to Fitton Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent about 10 minutes shaking hands with another crowd of about 3,000 persons that welcomed him at the airport The motorcade was routed through downtown Worcester . The city 's schools had been closed for the day and the route was lined with school bands and drum and bugle corps . Gov . Endicott Peabody of Massachusetts , a Democrat , who Is seeking re-election , rode in the motorcade in another car . At Fitton Field , he told the applauding crowd that Mr. Johnson had been considered by President Kennedy " the best fitted of all living Americans to he President of the United States . " This was apparently a reference to Mr. Kennedy 's choice of Mr. Johnson to run for Vice President on the Democratic ticket in 1960 . Mr , Johnson interrupted his prepared address to announce to the crowd that closure had been voted in the Senate to halt the filibuster against his civil rights bill . He had just said , " We are going ahead , in our country , to bring an end to poverty and racial injustice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President said : " In the last 10 minutes , we have made considerable prog-1 ress when we voted closure in I the Senate today by a vote of 71 to 29 . " This brought even heavier applause . Mr. Johnson , speaking in a city largely populated ? by Roman Catholics and at a Catholic college , opened by saying he was so surrounded by Irish aides inherited from President Kennedy that he sometimes felt like " a one-man ecumenical conference . " Then he paid high tribute to the late Pope John XXIII and to President Kennedy " two of the great men of this century . " Both , he said , " left a world transformed by their triumphs and lessened by their leaving . " " They both handed on a heritage of hope , a vision of the future which will occupy the thoughts and labors of men for generations to come , " he said . The large-scale nuclear reactor , he said , " offers a dramatic prospect of transforming sea water into water suitable for human consumption and industrial use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in combination , economic electric power and usable water in areas of need , " he said . The Jersey Central nuclear power plant being built by the General Electric Company , will have a capacity of 515,000 kilowatts when it is put into operation . Later , at maximum capacity , its output Is expected to be 620,000 kilowatts . At that maximum , the estimated cost of the power would be about 4.5 mills per kilowatthour . This rate would be competitive with power produced by other methods in about half of the United States . But this capacity would not be reached until the latter part of the decade . Mr. Johnson said the technology of the plant would be shared with the world . One difficulty in doing so , however , will be that the 4.5-mill- " rate can be reached only in plants at least as large as Oyster Creek will be . Such an output could be absorbed only in industrially advanced countries with large existing power grids  --  Japan , for example , or Britain .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
