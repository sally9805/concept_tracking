txt Miaini Beach , Aug. ** Mom ! Here we are in Disneyland atiuth , : ready to ? nominate the next President of the good old U. A. , , We hope , we hope . I am looking out of my- oceanside hotel room right on the water . But I have n't seen a single bather yet , maybe because there is a kind of brown surf on the beach , which loOks something like the . washbowl after a shampoo . TheIrip " down was fine . We landed at the Fort Lauderdale airport after I had had time to lose $14 at gin rummy to the chief . I kind of got slugged by the wet heat when I stepped out on the concrete and I guess you were right , saying I should/ have brought , a new lightweight jacket . The chief had a big black Lincoln Continental limousine waiting , " complete with bar and TV . The driver had loaded up the plastic ice bucket , but managed to spill the ice over the chief 's shoeshine making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shredded Wheat We checked in at the hotel'and found ourselves surrounded , by a bunch . of college kids wearing those plastic straw hats-that are probably made out of old shredded wheat . Some of them had ribbons saying , " Nixon 's the one , " and some had a more . terse . " Rocky " or " Reagan . " It was real exciting to feel that you were part of the action , but nobody seemsto know where the action is , or what it is . Maybe we 'll find out later , which gives a touch of suspense . YOu , never saw anything like . this part of the world . The whole seaside from Lauderdale thru Hollywood into Miami Beach is , built up . to  --  the last ? inch with sucker traps apparently constructed of tinsel and white wallboard , and more are going up all the time . I do n't know how they expect to fill them , or where all the suckers come from  --  but , then , I 'm here , are n't I ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said , Miami Beach mitst-love the tourists , there are so many of them . Has No Chinatown I must say , ' hoWever , that I got more of a charge out of the ' convention at Frikils four years ago . Miami Beach does n't have anything picturesque , like Chinatown ; quite the contrary . You do n't find any Chinese down here . How the convention pall compares with the Ciiw Palace is something I'll. be able to report after I take my chair under the good old Illinois banner when the convention gets going tomorrow . Last night the chief took us all to dinner at an Italian restaurant up in Hollywood which is run by a Chicago graduate who had a facility for getting meat without red points back in the OPA days . It is typical of the chief that with thousands of restaurants within walking distance or in the hotel itself , he had to embark on an hour run to find a place to feed the inner man . A contretemps developed after we left the suite . The chief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Fort Lauderdale do n't jump to any conclusions , as they are f am il y friends , took off first , and we assumed they were riding in the jumbo limousine , with the I ice and TV . Impresses the Throng They had rented this hack from a Lauderdale florist who was in Detroit on business . It sure impresses the throng when we sweep up to the hotel entrance or , better yet , some bar to lave the tonsils between our arduous stints . They must rate the chief a dark horse for the nomination , at the least . The driver of this hired equipage is a youth from Houston who works in the flower shop and says he is learning the art of flower arrangement from an interior decorator who doubles in fluffing un the nosies . Anyway , when the chief and party went down to climb into the tonneau , which is separated from the driver by a glass partition , communication being achieved by smoke signals or intercom , boy and car were nowhere to be found , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking all the way to Hollywood . There is one consolation , for the cabs have a window sticker saying , " Pay 10 cents less than meter registers . " Why this is I do not know , but it would have little effect on an hour 's cab ride . Munching on Scotch The rest of us drove up in a station wagon , passing what was described as " Billionaires ' row , " millionaires apparently being thought small fry in these plush surroundings , and arrived at the restaurant in good order , to find the chief disconsolately munching on a Scotch . From time to time he put his agents on the phone with inquiries about the whereabouts of the kid and the limousine . One unfounded report was that the kid had taken off with a girl , but eventually word filtered in that the car would be waiting when the chief finished dinner . The dinner was very good , and the proprietor was so overcome by renewing old Chicago acquaintances that he called up the manager of our hotel at 1:30 a. m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We gathered from the manager later that he would sooner receive such intelligence at some hour other than 1:30 a. m . On the way back , I got to ride with the chief , and the boy explained that he had gone to dinner and the car parks at the place had pushed the button which automatically locks all the doors , leaving the keys inside . He said he finally got a locksmith to get back in business , but vigorously disputed that he had taken off in the car with a girl . After he told his ambitions as a flower arranger , I was inclined to credit his story , which was further complicated by a dispute over previous arrangements which would permit him to sleep in a cot in a restaurant also apparently owned by the florist . Creek drive and is colored a bilious puce . Topside it is embellished with busts in gold of such Roman worthies as Augustus , Caracalla , Tiberius , and others who indulged in the innocent sport of feeding Christians to lions . There are no Christians on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? The cot was somewhere in the recesses of this trap , and the boy said that a manager , who turned out not to be a manager at all but a bartender , tried to jump his claim on the cot , and a telephone call to the florist in Detroit was necessary to resolve this dispute . Just to be safe , the chief ordered the car left at the hotel , so that it would n't stray off again , and told the boy to go on his way , first having given him $10 as a grubstake to get a cab to the Forum and eat breakfast . The boy was on hand this morning , and said he had got the cot . Reagan-Rama on Tap Things , as you see , are marked by the confusion which seems to attend the chief wherever he goes . I hope it does n't rub off on me . There is something called a Reagan-rama on tap today , and last night Nixon 's crowd had a bash in the Hilton Plaza , where a line said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mezannine to collect one weak drink . It was kind of astonishing , with all the bars there are around , and we stood watching the spectacle of modest avarice with jaws agape . It gives you to wonder , as they say , what would be the consequence if Rocky dipped into the sock and started handing out quarts of the sauce to all comers . I got to bed a bit late and saw a fellow delegate who was trying to ingratiate himself with a chambermaid in the corridor down the way from the elevators . She kept wearily making a gesture like brushing away flies , muttering , " Go away . " You can trust the old man not to try any canoodling like that , for I am here representing the dignity of the sovereign state of Illinois , and that thought clnstantly keeps me aware of my responsibilities , even if the thought of you and the kids would n't , and you know it would . Tell Sonny to be sure to spray the roses no later than Wednesday .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
