To the Soviet Union last week went honors for the most spectacular satellite achievement since Sputnik I : Russian scientists became the first to send living animals into space orbit and to recover them successfully . <P> The dramatic launching was dramatically announced . Into the hushed Moscow courtroom where the fate of U-2 Pilot Francis Powers was being deliberated rushed a Soviet official , with word that the U.S.S.R. had just orbited a 10,143-lb. animal-carrying satellite . <P> Russia 's huge " flying zoo " was the heaviest object ever fired by man into space , more than twice the weight of Midas II , the biggest U.S. satellite . Aboard the bulky capsule as it spun around the earth in a near-perfect circular orbit were two dogs-named Strelka ( Arrow ) and <P> Belka ( Squirrel ) - rats , mice and flies , as well as land and water plants , fungi and seeds . U.S. engineers estimated that the multi-stage rocket that boosted this bizarre collection into space must have had a first-stage thrust of at least 800,000 lbs . - twice as much thrust as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well . In their hermetically sealed cabins , equipped with air-purifying chemicals similar to those used in U.S. atomic submarines , spacesuit-clad Strelka and Belka lolled in a constant 77 temperature . Old space dogs ( each of them had taken short rocket rides before ) , they stared at each other through a pane of glass and ate eagerly from an automatic feeding apparatus while instruments fastened to their bodies relayed their blood pressure , temperature , pulse and breathing rate back to earth . Strelka seemed to bear up better than Belka under the rigors of weightless space travel : her breathing rate remained at a steady 30 pants per minute , while Belka 's dropped sharply to twelve . On the ground , excited Russian scientists clustered around a closed-circuit television screen ; a camera inside the satellite followed the curious , white-haired space mutts in their tiny cells . <P> As the satellite circled the earth once every 90.6 min. at an altitude of 198.8 miles , its powerful radios broadcast its presence to listening stations all over the world . A ham radio operator in Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven minutes . On its 18th pass around the world , an electronic command flashed up from earth , triggered rockets that altered the satellite 's course and pointed it back toward earth . A quick blast from retrorockets slowed its descent , and a special thermal shield protected the satellite 's skin against the heat generated by rapid descent through the earth 's atmosphere . The capsule , with its canine passengers , was ejected automatically , floated down separately . Both satellite and capsule , said the Russians , landed astonishingly close-within 6.2 miles-to a pre-selected ( but still secret ) target area . Soviet physiologists rushed to the scene , hastily broke open the capsule and examined its inhabitants , pronounced them " alive and well . " In a laboratory , the dogs munched jellied candy , the mice ate cookies and the flies buzzed angrily around the jars in which they had been imprisoned during flight . Said a Russian scientist : " We have crossed the threshold of manned space flight . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
