One afternoon in November of 1954 , a week before Thanksgiving and just at dusk , Willard Carroll drove out to the cemetery on Clark 's Bill , parked down by the fence , and climbed the path until he reached the family plot . The wind was growing colder and stronger by the minute , so that by the time he had reached the top of the hill , the bare trees whose limbs had only been clicking together when he left the car were giving off a deep groaning sound . The sky swirling overhead had a strange light to it , though near the horizon it already appeared to be night . Of the town of Liberty Center he was able to discern little more than the black line of the river that bordered it and the head lamps of the cars as they moved along Water Street toward the Winnisaw bridge . As though the cemetery had been his real destination all along , Willard sank down onto the cold bench that faced the plot , raised the collar of his red hunting jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , before the grave of his granddaughter Lucy and the rectangles reserved for the rest of them , he waited . It began to snow . Waiting for what ? The stupidity of his behavior dawned quickly . The bus he had left the house to meet would be pulling up back of Van Ham 's store in a few minutes ; from it Whitey was going to disembark , suitcase in hand , whether his father-in-law sat here in a freezing cemetery or not . Everything was in readiness for the homecoming , which Willard had himself helped to bring about . So what now ? Back out ? Change his mind ? Let Whitey find himself another sponsor  --  or sucker ? Oh , that 's it exactly . Let it get dark , let it get cold , and just sit it out in the falling snow . . . . And the bus will pull in , and the fellow will get off and head into the waiting room , all brimming over with how he has taken someone in once again  --  only to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiting room . But at home Willard 's wife , Berta , was preparing a dinner for four . Passing through the kitchen on his way to the garage , Willard had kissed her on the cheek and said , " It 's going to be all right , Mrs. Carroll , " but he might have been talking to himself for all the response he received . As a matter of fact , that 's who he was talking to . He had hacked the car down the driveway and looked up to the second floor , where his daughter Myra was rushing around her room so as to he bathed and dressed when her father and her husband came through the door . But saddest of all , most confusing of all , a little light was on in Lucy 's old room . Only the week before , Myra had pushed the bed from one end of the room to the other and taken down the curtains that had hung there all those years and then gone out and bought a new bedspread , so that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy had slept , or tried to sleep , the last night of her life . Of course , on the subject of how and where Whitey was to spend his nights , what could Willard do but be silent ? Secretly , Willard was relieved that Whitey was to be " on trial . " If only it could have been in a bed other than that one .. . Over in Winnisaw , Willard 's old friend and lodge brother , Bud Doremus , was expecting Whitey to show up for work at his hardware-supply house first thing Monday morning . The arrangements with Bud dated back to the summer , when Willard had agreed to accept his son-in-law once again into his house , if only for a while . " Only for a while " was the guarantee he had made to Berta ; because she was right , this just could not be a repetition of what had happened in 1934 , with someone in need coming for a short stay and managing somehow to stretch it out to fifteen years of living off the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , " Berta asked , " that it wo n't be fifteen years again this time ? " " Berta , I do n't imagine for one thing that I have got fifteen years left to me . " " Well , " said she , " neither do I , which might be another reason not even to begin . " " You mean just let them go off on their own ? Before I even know whether the man really is changed over or not ? And what if he has reformed , once and for all ? " " Oh , sure , " said Berta . " Sneering at the idea may he your answer , Berta , but it does not happen to be mine . " " You mean it does not happen to be Myra 's . " " I am open to opinion from all sides , " he said . " Well , then , maybe you ought to be open to mine , " Berta said , " before we start this tragedy again . " " Berta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his bearings in . " " January the first , " she said , " but which year ? The year two thousand ? " Not to be rich , not to be famous , not to be mighty , not even to be happy , but to be civilized  --  that was the dream of Willard 's life . What the qualities of such a life were he could not have articulated when , in the summer of 1903 , at the age of eighteen , he had decided to leave his father 's house , or shack , in the northern woods of the state ; his plan was to travel all the way down to Chicago to find out . He knew for sure what he did n't want , and that was to live like a savage . His own father was a fierce and ignorant man  --  a trapper , then a lumberman , and at the end of his life a watchman at the mines that rimmed the town of Iron City . It was to Iron City that the logs were brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxcars , the clanging , buzzing , swarming , dusty frontier town to which Willard himself , as a boy , each school day walked  --  or in winter , when he went off in a raw morning darkness , ran  --  through woods alive with bear and wolf . As it happened , Willard had to travel only a hundred and fifty miles downriver from Iron City in search of the civilized world . Liberty Center was a town of small white houses shaded by big elms and maples , with a bandstand in the middle of Broadway , its main street ; if ever there appeared to be a place where life could be less bleak and harsh and cruel than the life he had known as a boy , if ever i sl to be a place a ntan we to be rem . every 14 , if , something in tl Icl either did not inankind of ' t even know of fence . sort ' is Libel ' 11Ala i.ghc he tows . Brace serene or-der , s  --  u dial hail I .10 lo him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man 's secret burden , even at times his shame , came streaming forth . He was free at last , or so he thought , of that terrible tiTanny of cruel men and cruel nature . He found a room ; then he found a job  --  he took an examination and scored high enough to become a postal clerk ; then he found a wife , a strong-minded and respectable girl from a proper family ; and then one day  --  the fullillment , he discovered , of a very deep desire  --  he bought a house of his own with a front porch and a backyard ; downstairs a parlor , a dining room , a kitchen , and a bedroom ; upstairs two more bedrooms and the bath . A back bathroom was built downstairs six years after the birth of Myra , his only child , and following his promotion to assistant postmaster of the town . In 1930 , Mrya married Whitey Nelson , who they had no reason to believe was anything but a first-rate young fellow , courteous , healthy , clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical . A daughter , Lucy . was born to Myra in 1932 , and then just as life seemed as sweet and fruitful as any man could hope , the Depression really hit . Willard opened the door of his house and , to tide them over until better times , took in to live with him the struggling young couple and their child . Only they never left  --  not as a family , at any rate . Seated alone up in the cemetery , the tree limbs rising in the wind , and the dark of the town seemingly being drawn up into the sky as the first snow descended , Willard was remembering the days of the Depression , and those nights too , when sometimes he awoke in the pitch black and did not know whether to tremble or be glad that someone in need of him was asleep in every bed of the house ... . He brushed the snow off the shoulder of his jacket and stamped away a tingling that was beginning in his right foot . He looked at his watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . And if it 's not , he can wait . It wo n't kill him . Now he was remembering again ; of all things , the Independence Day Fair held in Iron City that Fourth of July almost sixty years back when he had won eight of the twelve track events and so set a record that stands today . Willard knows the record stands , because he always manages to get hold of an Iron City paper every fifth of July just so as to take a look and see . He can remember running home through the woods when that glorious day was over , rushing up the dirt road and into the cabin , and dropping onto the table all the medals he had been awarded ; he remembers how his father hefted each one in his hand , then led him back outside to where some of the neighbors were gathered and told Willard 's mother to give them an " on your mark . " In the race that followed , some two hundred yards , the father outdistanced the son by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Willard had thought . 1 ran the whole way home ! " Who 's the fastest ? " one of the bystanders had asked , teasing the boy as he started back to the cabin . Inside , his father had said , " Next time do n't forget , " " I wo n't , " said the child , chastened . Well , there was the story . And the moral ? What exactly were his memories trying to tell him ? The moral , if there was one , came later , years later . He was sitting in the parlor one evening , across from his young son-in-law , who had stretched himself out with the paper and was about to munch an apple and so let the comfortable evening begin , when suddenly Willard could n't hear the sight of him . Four years of free room and board ! Four years of floundering and getting on his feet again ! And there he was , on his back , in Willard 's parlor , eating Willard 's food ? Suddenly Willard wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to pick up and get out . The holiday is over ! Scat ! Go ! Instead , he decided that it was a good night to give his mementos a look-through . In the kitchen pantry he found a piece of soft cloth and Berta 's silver polish . Then from beneath the wool shirts in his bureau lie removed the cigar box which was filled with keepsakes and , settling on to the bed , opened the box . The medals were gone . When he came back into the living room , he saw that Whitey had fallen off to sleep . The snow drifts were floating up to cover the windows : across the street the houses looked as if they were going down into the rising white waves . It ca n't be . thought Willard . It just ca n't . I am jumping to a rash conclusion . During his lunch hour the next day , he decided to take a walk down to the river and back , stopping on the way at Rankin 's pawnshop . Ha-ha-ing all the while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he recovered the medals . After dinner that night he invited Whitey to come with him for a walk downtown . What he said to the young fellow , once they were out of sight of the house , was that it was absolutely and positively beyond his understanding how one man could take the belongings of another man , go into a person 's private belongings and just lake something , particularly something of sentimental value ; nevertheless , if he could receive from Whitey certain assurances about the future , he would be willing to chalk up this unfortunate incident to a combination of hard times and immature judgment . And pretty damned immature judgment too ! But then , no one deserved to be discarded from the human race on the basis of one stupid act  --  a stupid act you might expect of a ten-year-old , by the way , and not a fellow who was twenty-eight , going to be twenty-nine . However , the medals ' CH : . back where they belonged , and if he were given an ironclad promise that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Whitey iiised to cut out immediately this new business of whiskey drinking , then Willard would consider the matter closed . Here was Whitey , a fellow who 'd been third baseman on the Selkirk High baseball team for three years running , a young man with the build of a pr , izefigh ter goof.l. look ing too  --  Willard said all this right out  --  and what was his intention , to wreck the healthy body the good Lord had blessed him with ? Respect for his body alone ought to make him stop , but if that did n't work . then there was respect for his family and for his own human soul too , damn it . It was up to Whitey entirely : all he had to do was turn over a new leaf . Otherwise , something drastic was going to have to he done . So overcome was the young man with shame and gratitude that all he could do at first was take hold of Willard 's hand and pump it up and down , while tears glistened in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened in the fall . when the circus had come to the armory down in Fort Kean . Right off , Lucy , his daughter , had started talking a mile a minute about the elephants and the clowns , but when Whitey looked in his pocket , he found only pennies and not too many of them either . So he thought if he borrowed the medals and then returned them a few weeks later . . . But here Willard remembered just who it was that had taken Lucy to the circus , and Myra and Whitey and Berta too . None other than himself . When he pointed out this fact , Whitey said yes , yes , he was coming to that ; he was saving the most shameful for the last . " I suppose I am just a coward , Willard , but it 's hard to say the worst first . " " Say it anyway , boy . Make a clean breast of the whole thing . " Well , confessed Whitey as they turned off Broadway and started back home , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with himself that instead of using the money as he had intended , he had gone straight over to Earl 's Dugout and made himself numb on whiskey , hoping thereby to obliterate the memory of the stupid , vicious thing he had just done . It had been the last week of September , just after old man Tucker had had to lay off half the shop , including Whitey .. No , no  --  removing a calendar from his wallet. studying it under the front porch light as they both stood stamping the snow off their boots  --  as a matter of fact , it was the first week of October . he told Willard. who earlier in the day had had the date fixed for him by the pawnshop clerk as only two weeks back . But by this time they were already inside the door . Knitting by the fire was Berta ; sitting on the couch , holding Lucy in her lap . was Myra. reading to the child before sending her off to sleep . No sooner did Lucy see her daddy than she slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the face of this scene , what on earth could Willard possibly do ? If after the long deliberation of that afternoon he had decided to consider Whitey 's theft torgiyable , was he now going to bother to catch his son-in-law in a petty lie ? Only why . if Whitey felt so depraved after taking the medals , why in hell did n't he put them back ? Now . why had n't he thought to ask 111211th:11 Hey , you , why did n't you put my med. als back , if you felt so awful about it ? But by this dire , Whitey was carrying Lucy up the stairs on his shoulders , and he himself was smiling at Myra. saying yes , the men had had a good bracing walk . Earl 's Dugout of Buddies . Oh . 11 only they had knocked that place down years ago ! At Willard 's request , they had agreed to stop letting Whitey drink himself into a stupor at the Elks ' and at Stanley 's Tavern too Inow under new management - the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ) but for every human or even semihuman bartender. another named Earl was actually amused to take the paycheck of a husband and father and cash it for him . The ironic part was that in that whole so-called Dugout of Buddies there was probably never a man who was one-tenth the worker or the husband or the father that Whitey was  --  that is , when things were n't overwhelming him . Unfortunately . however , circumstances seemed always to conspire against him at just those times , rarely more than a month at a stretch . when he was suffering through a bad siege I what you finally had to call by its rightful name : lack of character . Probably on that particular Friday night that none of them would ever forget , Whitey would at worst have weaved up the walk . thrown open the door . made some insane declaration , and dropped into bed with his clothes on , that and no more , if circumstances or fate or whatever you wanted to call it had n't arranged for his first vision upon entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in a pan of water . Then he must have seen Lucy bent over the dining table and understood that she was doing her homework downstairs so that her mother would n't have to face the dragon alone when he returned . Willard and Berta had gone olt to play their Friday rummy . Driving to the Erwins ' that night , he agreed that this time they were staying clear through to coffee and cake , like normal people . no matter what . If he wanted to go home early . said Berta , that was his business . She herself worked hard all week and had few pleasures . and she simply would not cut short her night out because her son-in-law had come to prefer drinking whiskey in a musty bar at the end of the day to eating a home-cooked dinner with his family . But Myra soaking her feet . Something told Willard he should n't go off leaving her that way . Not that she was suffering so from the pain . It was just the picture that he did n't like somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / do n't see why you have to stand so much . " " I do sit . Daddy . Of course I sit . " " Then how come you 're having this feet trouble ? " " It 's not trouble . They 'll be line . " " It 's from giving them lessons all afternoon long , Myra. standing over that piano . " " Daddy , no one stands over a piano . ' " Then where did this feet business come from ? " " Oh , Daddy , please . It did n't ' come ' from anywhere , It 's just a little , tiny thing , and it does n't have any terrible cause . it 's just weak arches . " She kissed him . " Good night . " What more could he do ? He called into the dining room . " Good night , Lucy . " When she failed to resprmd , he walked over to where she sat writing in her nolehi N , k and touched her hair . " What 's got your tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good night , " she mumbled , without bothering to look up . Well , it was just as he had expected : Whorl Whitey got home , he did n't like , I ? ? ' ' it her . The first suggestion he . lyra was that she might at 0111 the shades down so that everywho walked by did n't have to see .1 suturing martyr she was . When , n. lit , r panic . she did n't move . he pulled at one to show her how , and it came clear off the fixture . She had only taken on all those piano students -- -seven years earlier , he neglected to add  --  so as to turn herself into a hag. to cause him , it she could manage It . to start running around with other women , so that she could have that to cry over as well as her poor , crippled toesies . Why she taught piano was the same damn reason she would n't go with him to Florida and let him start a brand-new life down there . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that a man should not say to a woman  --  even to one he hates , and the fact was that Whitey loved her . adored her . worshiped her  --  that he did n't say to M yra . Then , as if a torn shade and a broken fixture and all those garbled insults were n't enough for one night . he picked up the dishpan of warm water and Epsom salts and , for no rational reason in the world . poured it out on the rug . What happened subsequently Willard learned from a sympathetic lodge brother who was on duty in the squad car that night . Apparently the police tried as best they could to make it look friendly and not like an out-and-out arrest ; they drove up without the siren blowing , parked out of the glow of the streetlamp. and stood patiently in the hallway while Whitey worked at buttoning up his jacket . Then they led him down the front steps and along the path to the patrol car . They were not so much holding him down as up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Whitey. using all his physical strength . broke from between them . In the first moment , no one could figure out what he was doing . His body folded once in half . so that for a moment he seemed to be eating the snow ; then with a jerk he straightened up and , swaying as if in a wind . heaved an armful of snow toward the house . The powder tell on Lucy 's hair and her face and the shoulders of her sweater ; but , for all that she was only fifteen and , with her pug nose and freckles and straight blond hair . looked no more than ten , she did not so much as flinch ; she stood as she was . one loafer on the bottom step and one on the walk , and a finger in her schoolbook  --  all ready . it seemed , to return to the studies that she had interrupted only to dial the station house . " Stone ! " Whitey shouted " Pure God-damn stone ! " And here he made his lunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene . leaped to his duty . " Whitey. it 's your own kid ! " Whereupon the drunk , either remembering that he was father to the girl or hoping to forget that connection for good , evaded the policeman 's grasp and went ahead and did all it was he had apparently intended to do in the first place : He pitched himself facedown into the snow . The following morning , before going down to the jail to Wil lard sat Lucy dots her a talkine-to " I ha ' I ' COW ? througa in t ? I , hours .

We are able to settle our own arguments and conduct our own affairs , and we do n't require the police to do it for us . I happen to be the assistant postmaster of this town , young lady , in case you 've forgotten . I happen to be a member in good standing of this community . and so do you .

In the middle of Lucy 's first semester at college , she came home at Thanksgiving to say she was getting married to a boy named Roy Bassart. qwq why be was making the sonar 's in the lirst place . For the first hour he weja steadily like a woman ; then gaspingly like a child for another hour , until even though he wanted you to forgive him , you almost had to anyway , watching him perform that way within plain view of his own family .

In the evening he would sit out on the front porch , refusing to speak , or to come in out of the cold .

Whitey , ca n't sleep ? " " Do n't want to sleep . " " What is it , Whitey ? Why are you all dressed ? " Here Whitey turned to the wall , so that all Willard could see , as his son-in-law 's whole big body began to tremble , was the back of his broad shoulders and his wide , powerful neck . " What is it , Whitey , what is it you are thinking of doing ? Now tell me . " The day after Lucy 's wedding .

When the weekend came , Whitey whitewashed the basement and chopped practically a whole cord of wood . Willard stood at the kitchen window watching him bring down the ax in violent . regular whacks . So that month passed and the next , and though eventually he came out of his silent , morbid mood and took up a little more his old teasing and kidding ways , I here could no longer be any doubt that at long last something had happened to penetrate his heart . Thal winter he grew his mustache . In Illy lirst weeks he got the usual jokes from Ole boys at the shop , but he kept on with it , and by March it was diffi colt In remember how he used to look it seemed that the big , strapping , healthy , misdirected boy had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . More and more , Willard heard himself calling Whitey , as Berta and Myra always had , by his given name , Duane . He actually began to behave now as Willard had had every reason to expect he would , given the eager young fellow he had been hack when they 'd first met . At that time he was already a first-rate electrician and a pretty good carpenter too . and he had plans , ambitions , dreams . One of these was to build a house for himself and Myra , if only she would be his bride : a Cape Cod-style house with a fenced-in yard , to be built with his own hands . And that was n't so farfetched a dream either . At the age of twenty he seemed to have the strength and the vigor for it and the know-how too . He even went ahead and plunked down a one-hundred-dollar deposit on a tract of land at the north end of the town , a wise move too , for what was only woods then was now Liberty Grove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw up his own building plans and was well into his first year of marriage , when along came national calamity  --  and the birth of his daughter . As it turned out , Whitey took the Great Depression very personally . It was as though a little baby , ready to try its first step , stands up , smiles , puts out one foot , and then one of those huge iron balls such as they use to knock down whole buildings comes swinging out of nowhere and wallops him right between the eyes . In Whitey 's case it took nearly ten years for him to get the nerve to stand up and even try walking again . On Monday , December 8 , 1941. he took the bus to Fort Kean to enlist in the United States Coast Guard and was rejected for heart murmur . The following week he tried the Navy , and then his last choice . the Army , but to no avail .

That was the whole trouble to begin with : He had gotten himself all those props and cushions to give him a start back into the world , and all they had done was impede his progress by reminding him of the failure he had been from the start . " Drinking and losing jobs and getting jobs and drinking and losing them . ? . It 's a vicious cycle llyra .

What he had begun to think about  --  and he was n't going to promise right off and be made a fix ) 1 of a second time  --  but 44 hat he had begun to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow had put up out near Clark 's Hill .... Spring . Each evening Duane would get up from the dinner table  --  slapping at his knees , as though just to rise to his feet was a strengthening experience in itself- and . pitting the new self against the old temptations. he would take a walk down Broadway to the river . At eight on the nose , he would be back shining his shoes . Night after night Willard watched him as though hypnotized , as though his son-in-law was not just another man cleaning his shoes at the end of a hard day , but inventing before Willard 's eves the very idea of the shoebrush and polish . Willard actually began to think that instead of encouraging the fellow to move out of the house he ought now to encourage him to stay . It was becoming a genuine pleasure to have him around . One night in May , the two men got to talking together before bedtime ; the subject was the future . When dawn came , neither could remember who had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack to the original plan of his life , to be out contracting on his own . With new housing developments going up everywhere , a fellow with his electrical know-how would be swamped with work within a matter of weeks . Early the following morning , shaved and in suits , they drove to the bank to inquire about a loan . At seven that evening , after a nap and a good dinner , Duane went off for his constitutional . Meanwhile Willard sat down with a pencil and par and began to figure up the available money , what the hank said they would loan , plus certain savings of his own . By eleven , he was filling the paper with circles and X 's ; at midnight he got into the car to make once again the old rounds .

" gut 11 , " Millard said , dragging los son-ill-law toward the car , " let go of that thing ! " But Whitey staged a sitdown strike on the curb rather than submit to being parted from his tire . He said he and Cloyd here had run great risks in procuring it , and besides  --  could n't Willard see ? ? it was brand new . He carried fifty pounds more than Willard , and over twenty years less , and so , drunk as he was , it was still nearly half an hour before Whitey could he detached from what he and his new friend had " borrowed " from God only knew where .

On a Saturday afternoon , the two were 511 ling alone in the parlor lisacning to the White Sox game , when Whitey stood and , glaring at his father-in-law , made his indictment : " So that 's the way it is , Willard . One lapse , and a man 's whole new life , right down the drain ! " Then , in June , while they were all getting ready for bed one night , Myra made a remark to Whitey that did not set very well with him . as it was on the subject of his new life and hers . Adolph Mertz , who had picked up his daughter after her piano lesson that afternoon , had asked if Whitey was still interested in going into electrical contracting ; a fellow up in Driscoll Falls was retiring , selling everything he owned at a good price . Here Whitey swung at Myra with his trousers and nearly took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't meant to  --  he was only warning her not to tease him again about something that was n't his fault ! Why did she go shooting her mouth off about other people 's plans ? At this stage of the game it was nobody 's concern but his , and Willard 's too , no matter how much her father now wanted to sneak out of the whole thing . As a matter of fact , if it was up to Whitey , he would go back to that bank any day of the week . It was Willard who had withdrawn his support and knocked the confidence out of him about the whole idea , after having encouraged him to begin with . Actually , living in Willard 's house had undermined his confidence all along , right from the beginning . A grown man being treated like a charity case ! Sure , blame it on him , blame it all on him ! But who was it who had cried for her daddy . years back , just because it was a depression and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damn it ! Who was it that would n't leave for the South with her husband so as to start a new life ? Who ? Sure . always him ! Only him . Nobody but him ! As for hitting her  --  this he said when he came back from the kitchen with an icepack for her eye  --  had he ever struck directly at her with the intention of doing her harm ? " Never ! " he cried , getting back into his clothes . " Never once ! " Willard rushed into the hallway as the outraged Whitey started for a second time down the stairs . " Now all of you can stand around day and night , " said Whitey , buttoning his coat , " and talk and laugh and tell stories about what kind of failure I am , because I m going ! " There were tears rolling down his face . and he was clearly so miserable and broken-hearted that for a moment Willard became totally confused , or enlightened . At any rate , he saw the truth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years : There is nothing the man can do . He is afflicted with  --  himself ! Willard nonetheless let the afflicted fellow proceed out the door and , for good measure , bolted it and shouted after Whitey . " I do n't care what you are ! Nobody strikes my daughter ! Not in this house they do n't ! Or outside either ! " Whitey began ringing the bell around two in the morning . Willard appeared in the hallway in his robe and slippers and found Myra at the top of the stairs in her nightdress . " I think it 's raining , " she said . Willard did not move . " Daddy , what help is it to anything , " she asked , " for someone to stand out in the rain ? " " I ai n't his father . Myra  --  I am hallway , The rapping at the glass stopped . For a WhitlIeNi there was not a sound , but then the bolt snapped shut . and Lucy shouted . " Never ! I ) o you understand me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did you do ? " asked Myra . " Mother , the man is 1 ) eyond hope ! Beyond everything ! " " A-men , " said Berta . " You do n't even know what I 'm saying ! " said Lucy , turning on her grandmother . " Oh , no , " cried Myra , rushing past them into the hallway . " Duane ! Duane ! " But he was already running down the street . By the time Myra had unlocked the door and was onto the porch , he had turned a corner and was out of sight . Gone . Until now , with live years gone and Lucy gone two years herself  --  poor Lucy , whose brief nightmare of a life had ended so incredibly , so horribly ; In flight from her family , she had frozen to death beneath the snow in the woods where she had chosen to hide out ; she had died , Willard believed , altogether deranged by her hatred of them all . . . And Whitey , her father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Willard sat up here in the cemetery . Unless Whitey had become impatient , and decided to go back where he came from ; unless he had decided that maybe this time he ought to disappear for good . A pain shot down Willard 's right leg , from the hip to the toe . Cancer ! Bone cancer ! Yesterday , too , he had felt it , searing down his calf and into his foot . Cancer of his bones ! But the pain settled in now , like something bubbling over a low flame . It was only his sciatica . But what did he expect , sitting outside like this ? The shoulders of his jacket were covered with snow ; so were the toes of his boots . It was a cold , black night , and he was thinking , Yes sir , he would have to pay attention to that sciatica , no more treating it like a joke . The smart thing was probably to take to a wheelchair for a month or so , so as to get the pressure off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice two years ago , and maybe it was n't such a silly idea as it had seemed . A nice long rest . Throw an afghan over his knees , settle down into a sunny corner with the paper and the radio and his pipe , and whatever happened in the house , let it just roll right by him . Surely that is a right you have at seventy years of age . In the months to come , he could pretend every once in a while that his faculties were slipping some . Yes , sir , just have to make their way without him . Welcome to use his house for a while , that was fine with him , but beyond that  --  well , he was n't all there in the head , you know . But why ! Why should I be senile when that is not the case. ! He jumped to his feet . Why be getting pneumonia and worrying myself sick , when all I did was good ! The fear of death , horrible . hateful death caused him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good ! " he cried out loud . " Unto others ! " ? and down the hill he went , shedding snow from his jacket and his cap , while his old , aching legs carried him as fast as they could out of the graveyard to where he had left the car . Not until he was past the cemetery road and under the sl ? Hups 4 ) 1 South Water Street did W heartbeat begin to resume some .. ! ! , g resem- bling a natural rhythm . Just ' because winter was beginning again did not mean that he was never going to see the spring . Ile was not only going to live till then , he was alive righl now . Problems or not , we are all alive ! What had he been doing in a cemetery ? At this hour , in this weather ? Come on , he told himself , enough gloomy , morbid , un . necessary , last-minute thinking . There was plenty more to think about , and not all of it had either . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the night , as though in judgment of itself , the building that housed Earl 's Dugout caved right in. roof first , and had to be demolished . And so what if Stanley 's is under new management ? Whitey had as much disdain of a low-down saloon as anybody , when he was being himself ? and that was a good deal more often than it might appear tio someone purposely setting out to remember only the low points in a man 's life . Wait till he sees the new shopping center , wait till he takes his first walk down Broadway . Sure , they could do that together , and Willard could point out how the Elks ' had been remodeled . " Hell , the fellow is nearly fifty . " He was speaking aloud now , as he drove on into town . " There is a job waiting for him over in Winnisaw . That has all been arranged . and with his wanting it . with his asking for it . As for his moving in , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that other stuff What we are planning is January the first ... Oh , look , I am not God ! I did not make the world ! I can not predict the future either ! Damn it anyway , he is IVIyra 's husband  --  that she loves . whether we like it or not ! " Instead of parking at the back of Van Ham 's store , he pulled up in front , so as to take the long way to the waiting room , so as to have just another thirty seconds of reflection . He entered the store . slamming his wet cap against his knee . And most likely , he thought , most likely he wo n't be there anyway . Without going into the waiting room , he set himself to peer inside . Most likely I have sat up there for no good reason at all . In the end he probably did not even have it in him to come back . Only there was Whitey sitting on a bench , looking down at his shoes . His hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed and recrossed his legs . so that Willard saw the undersides of the shoes , pale and smooth . A little suitcase , also new , sat beside him on the floor . So . said Willard to himself , he did it . He got on a bus and he came . After all that has happened . after all the misery he has caused . lie has had the nerve to get on a bus and then get off it and to wait here for a half an hour , expecting to be picked up . . . Oh . you idiot ! Still unseen , he glared at his middle-aged son-in-law , at his new shoes and his new suitcase . Oh , sure , new man too ! Oh , you dumb cluck ! You scheming , lying , thieving ignoramus . you weak , washed-out lushhead , sucking the life 's blood from every human heart ! You no-good , low-life weakling ! So what if you ca n't help it ! So what if you do n't mean it ! " Duane , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Duane ?
