REQUIEM FOR THE GREAT SOCIETY Lyndon B. Johnson came to the White House on November 22 , 1963 , an accidental President retrieved from obscurity by three bullets out of a cheap Italian rifle . Just a year later he won the greatest election victory in American history . By the summer of 1965 he stood alone on a peak of political power probably never before reached by any President . He was then presiding in lordly fashion over a Democratic Congress that was bringing to a grand conclusion all the liberal aspirations of three decades and all the unfulfilled platform pledges of Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman and John Kennedy ; and he had made the necessary dispositions of men and resources that were to contain Asian Communism . as Johnson believed Truman and Dwight Eisenhower had contained European Communism , so that an era of Pax Americana  --  or , better still , Pax Johnsona  --  was about to cascade its incalculable benefits upon a grateful world . Writing about Johnson now , just over three years after that remarkable moment when he seemed unchallenged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution for the 20th century , is a little like writing about Grover Cleveland . Johnson retained , of course , until the end , that power of life and death over us all that has made of the modern Presidency a potential Frankenstein 's Monster ; yet , as the weeks wound toward the end of the Johnson Administration , it became hard to recall the old days , the landslide limes , how it used to be with a President who , finally , could not even muster the power to put through his own man for Chief Justice . That so large a man as Lyndon Johnson was brought so low is , if not quite Aristotelian , as near to tragedy as American politics is likely to come . Politics is , on the whole , a cautious and questing trade , and it does not produce many men of size and valor . When one of them falls with a crash ( Wilson after Versailles , Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 ) , it can hardly leave us unmoved . I remember the first time l called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a week after he succeeded John Kennedy , one evening in the imposing Oval office , and he was seated in the middle of the room , under a barber 's sheet , while someone unobtrusively cut his hair . Men seem defenseless and a little-boyish in that familiar pose , but not Lyndon Johnson , not that night . I had known him for years but only as reporters know officials  --  and already , that soon , the unmistakable aura of power and of the unique loneliness of the Presidency hung about him . I muttered something embarrassing about the country 's good fortune in having such an experienced man to pick up the pieces , but he did n't answer , he merely looked at me , studying me , gauging me . I stood uncomfortably , trying to meet his eyes squarely , trying futilely to measure up ; and l remember thinking : This is somebody . This is really sonwhocir . And it was only when those narrow and demanding eyes had beaten me down , and I had looked away ( turning red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that he relaxed , told me to sit down , and ordered an " orange drink " for both of us . It was , of course , an unfair advantage for a President to take . But injustice has its uses , and one imagines long lines of diplomats , labor leaders , Cabinet secretaries and unruly senators undergoing the same kind of challenge , for far greater ends . The country was to learn of Lyndon Johnson that he valued nothing more than a man " to go to the well with " ? one who , in Texas-tongue , would have made a reliable companion on a foray out of a fort . and among hostile Indians , in search of water . But it learned also that Johnson 's often overwhelming proportions could diminish everything else . There was one quiet Saturday in August of 1964 , for instance , when Johnson called in the press  --  as in those days he was quick to do  --  to celebrate the descent of Ranger 7 upon the moon . The rocket 's ingenious appurtenances had , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar landing surface . and a selection of the pictures had been brought in for the President 's edification . But he was not the man to settle for a mere briefing , with such materials at hand . First , Johnson hitched his chair so close to the movie screen that photographers could not take pictures of it without taking pictures of hint , too . As each lunar landscape flared on the screen . and flashbulbs popped in the room , there was the rugged , inescapable profile of the President looming over the crags and craters of the moon as if he were surveying a good piece of Texas rangeland . Then , when all the photos selected for him had been shown , the President , wasting no time on technical discussion , and with an instinct surer than the rocket 's radio guidance , put the occasion to work , " Are you satisfied w ith the return on that investment ? " he demanded of Dr. Homcr E. Newell , an associate administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Newell said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Elated . " Newell hastened to say , Did the Ranger " adventure , " l he President inquired ominously , leave any doubt whatsoever about the desirability of going to the moo in ( a then under lire from such mportant critics as Barry Goldwater and Dwight Eisenhower ) ? " Not in my mind , not at all , " the good doctor was happy to say . " I would feel that we were hacking down Irons a real challenge , the kind we 've never backed down from before . " " So what ? " Johnson said , beginning to milk the lines . " We would lose leadership , " Newell suggested , rather tentatively . " In the world ? " The President threw him an unmistakable cue . " Ili the world . " " Do you think we can be first in the world and second in space ' ? " Johnson inquired , as if he really had doubts . " No , sir , " Newell said , recoiling from the very idea . A NASA official was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 ? had made , that day , the biggest publicity breakthrough for the moon program since its inception , which perhaps justified this performance . But there was clearly foreshadowed here the imperial personage who would refuse to send Vice President Humphrey to the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill , and who could later refer to the leaders of allied governments in the Pacific as " my prime ministers . " Besides , booming up the space program was no great trick for the Lyndon Johnson of August , 1964 . That same month he first bombed North Vietnam and rammed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution through Congress . And it would not be long before the campaign crowds would hear him in the streets of Denver , croaking into a bullhorn : " Come on down to the speakin ' tonight , folks , and bring the kiddies with you ? " In the great times that were coming , he aimed to play all the parts . The cartoonists , with their instinct for the jugular , were right , of course , to picture L.B.J. as a cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol of the West , and one of the essential truths about Lyndon Johnson is that he is a Westerner . Even his initials , established as a motif in family names , dogs ' names and political slogans , are used just as the old-time cattle barons once used theirs . for a brand . Westerners are a particular kind of people land maybe Texans are a particular kind of Westerner ) . Theirs is a big , rugged country . reaching out to infinite horizons , and It produces men cut to the measure of the land . Whether it is Howard Hughes building the biggest seaplane and buying Las Vegas , or Judge Roy Holheinz throwing up the Astrodome , or Billie Sol Estes perpetrating grand-scale fraud , or just Neiman-Marcus selling " His " and " Her " airplanes , something in Western life seems to require people torespond in kind to the big sky and the vast unrolling plain . In Lyndon Johnson , both the expansive notions and the range-hots attitude of the West 's biggest men were always plain to he seen , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An initiative For a negotiated settlement ill Vietnam could easily he I urned 111111 a .17-day " peaces ffemivewith diplomats catapulted about the world hy jet , the President 's agonies of hope rendered periodically in 72-point type , and an apocalyptic climax that featured B-52 's returning to the attack after late-night conferences in the Cabinet room . An international courtesy suddenly required by the death c I Australia 's prime minister quickly became a world-girdling political excursion at Christmas time , replete with helicopter visits to the Pope and sudden swoops into the battle zone  --  an episode this range-boss President imperiously decreed at such short notice that radio negotiations with the Vatican were still going on as Air Force One neared Rome . In the West , too , strength and its frequent handmaiden  --  violence  --  are part of a tradition in which hard rren had to build a society from a savage wilderness . and not so many years ago at that . Not far from the LBJ Ranch , at one of the battles of the Pedernales , the Colt revolver won , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . So Lyndon Johnson came into the White House , despite 30 years in Washington , innately a man of the West , and there was never much chance in the early years that when confronted with danger he would respond except as a tough , expansive . demanding , confident Texan . When they told him in 1965 that Communists were about to take over the Dominican Republic . threatening him with another Cuba . he acted first and asked the right questions  --  if at all  --  later . He not only sent in the Marines but . with truly western profligacy , used more than 20.000 of them . He did not do so without criticism  --  which brought into greater public view another rather Western characteristic that had been there all along : his suspicion and defensiveness before the suave sophisticates of the East . as he saw them . with their Ivy League educations , European orientation and clear preference for the jet-set style of John Kennedy over the backyard-barbecue manner of Lyndon Johnson . To Johnson , much of the criticism of the Dominican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . was rooted in Eastern disdain for his accent . background and education . as well as in nostalgia for the handsome Kennedy era ( to say nothr - actual allegiance to Robert Kt .. ? , who was always , in the Johns , , plot-ting The Restoration ) . He " . is just right enough on the separate counts . although far wrong in the generality to have his Western sense 4-grie , , ane : ' and inferiority confirmed . This co'n ditioned Johnson  --  then poised On - the e ? 1 , ? . if the greater Vietnam curl to believe he was the victim of regional and political prejudice rather than of genuine public revulsion against a policy , and it stiffened Inni to stand fast against adversity . Out of Western conditions , too , had conic another important fact about Lyndon Johnson  --  that he was a New Dealer . first and last . He had come to manhood in the dustbowl , and the earliest political influence , derived from his father and family , had been the sort of Populism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly Eastern or at least " big city , " were exploiting the people and depriving them of their birthright . When the great depression disclosed the economic bankruptcy of unfettered free enterprise and the political bankruptcy of the long-dominant Republican Party . Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal wrought a limited revolution in America , absorbing dust-bowl Populism in the process . Johnson , first as a young congressional aide , then as a National Youth Administrator in Texas , later as a member of the House in the late ' 30 's , found the answer to a genuine and deeply experienced concern for poor tenant farmers and small ranchers and sodbusters in the New Deal 's principal thesis  --  that the Federal Government had a responsibility for the welfare of the people and hence for guiding the economy upon which they depended . Yet Johnson saw that even in the desperate years of the depression , this new governmental role required powerful leadership and powerful institutions . In Franklin Roosevelt and the expansive , restless , muscular Presidency he created , the New Deal found its power ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do great deeds and hungry to exert vast powers and be a giant among men , could find a hero , a model , a Grail . But in the long run , Roosevelt was a war President . The central assumption springing from that war was the lesson of Munich  --  that aggression unchecked is aggression unleashed , that appeasement inevitably leads to further demands and finally to desperation wars , so that the prudent course is to quash aggression at the start . From that assumption , as well as from the general experience of the war , one corollary was inescapable  --  that the nation had to maintain a position of military strength , that it must not he caught again unable to halt aggression . Even John Kennedy , extolling his new generation of leadership , insisted at his inaugural 15 years after World War II , that military strength was the first requisite for peace . As Majority Leader of the Senate during the Eisenhower era , Johnson found all these assumptions nicely applicable to the division of the globe into Free World and Communist World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic instruments of eollective security %011ie as a member of the powerful congressional security committees , he urged even greater military preparedness upon Eisenhower . So the Texas New Dealer , putting his faith also in collective security , military strength and the lesson of Munich , had his world and national views resting on an unquestioned base . He knew what he would do , how he would go about it , what could be made to happen . what the people wanted . Ile would cope with his time as no President had . Probably it never occurred to him that his time might be passing . " It seems , " Lyndon Johnson said on Election Eve , 1964 , at the State Capitol in Austin , " that I have spent my life getting ready for this moment . " It proved worth waiting for . Not only did Johnson carry 44 states and more than 60 percent of the popular vote ; his party decisively broke the long postwar deadlock of American politics by gaining 38 seats in the House of Representatives for an overwhelming margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats even added two seats to the 66 they had already held in the Senate . The first session of the 89th Congress was one of the most remarkable of this century , clearing out a backlog of legislation that had been building up since the New Deal , Johnson himself , in his hyperbolic style , christened the 1965 session " the greatest in American history " because of " the greatest outpouring of creative legis halo ! ' in the history of this nation " Medical core for the aged through the Social Sectirity System , federal aid to education , immigration reform , proved voting rights for Negroes. a major housing program with the innovative rental subsidy feature , regional economic planning and development , a national foundation for the arts and humanities , heautification of parks and streets , improved manpower training and anti-poverty programs . regional medical centers for heart disease , cancer and stroke , increased Social Security benefits ( and taxes ) , a water pollution control plan , even programs to get rid of auto junkyards and highway billboards  --  it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Deal days were being realized as easily as some Congresses had ignored them . Medicare , for instance , had been before Congress in one form or another for at least 20 years . So had aid to education , which , as recently as John Kennedy 's first year in office , had thrown Congress into a massive religious and political tangle from which nothing constructive could emerge . Johnson was not , of course , invincible . He took a resounding legislative defeat in trying to repeal Section 14th of the Taft-Hartley Act , and he retreated , under rightwing pressure . from the consular treaty with the Soviet Union . Still , when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . and the Selma marchers became involved in a racial crisis in March , 1965. it was Lyndon Johnson who seized the opportunity io put before Congress a measure to repair the major weakness of existing civil-rights legislation by putting federal registrars into the South to register Negro voters . And it was Lyndon Johnson . in one of the most moving moments of modern American political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech in which he pledged , in his southern accent : " We shall overcome . " It occurred to some critics , of course . that the President really was only catching up with an overdue backlog : that Medicare , for instance , was long established in most other industrial democracies . But so lengthy was the list of achievements that such reservations sounded a little carping ; and in any case , there were some suggestions that Johnson was getting ready to move beyond the old New and Fair Deal ideas . In June . 1965 , for instance , in one of the great presidential speeches of the 20th century . he went far beyond what any other political leader had been willing to say about the racial situation in America . " Freedom is not enough , " he told the graduating class at Howard University . " You do not take a person who , for years , has been hobbled by chains and liberate him ; bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say . ' You are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly believe that you have been completely fair . Thus . it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity . All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates . " But that was the high-water mark . By then , Johnson already had carried out the Dominican intervention and was about to suffer his break with J.W. Fulbright of the Foreign Relations Committee . In May , a brief bombing pause failed to ease a steadily worsening situation in Asia , or to produce the " unconditional discussions " Johnson had proposed at Johns Hopkins University . On June 28 , American troops carried out their first major combat operations in Vietnam . In July , Johnson announced what a year earlier would have seemed incredible : He was building up American forces on the battlefield to 125.000 men . Then , in August , Watts bless up and the racial revolution in America entered a new phase , in which Johnson 's specialty  --  civil-rights legislation  --  could play only a small role . Not many  --  least of all the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House  --  recognized what reall had happened that summer of 19h5 . L.B.J. still seemed astride the scene like some Colossus : who else would have gone to the foot of the Statue of Liberty to make a production of the signing of the immigration bill ? Was it not ap-propriate that when ' hi list Pope tot visit the United S , at . rr sod in Ness York . there to mi. ( hin-. should be Lyndon B. Johnson he Disciples of Christ ) ? And so used to his pyrotechnics had the nation become that when he managed to laik Arthur Gold berg oil the Supreme Om la a nil into Adlai Stevenson 's old seat at the I Inked Nations , it seemed only natural that Goldberg should exchange the best for the worst ; what Lyndon wanted , Lyndon got . Even the removal of the President 's gallbladder in October , 1965 , became a major event on the scale of an Eisenhower heart attack ; and I was moved to write , not altogether whimsically : It was just as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one kidney stone ( leaving another for future reference ) did not locate those extra glands Jack Valenti had claimed as Presidential equipment . This failure was downright reassuring after a year in which it had become all too easy to believe that L.B.J. was not constructed quite like you and me . He was not , after all , the probing surgeons were able to show us , a super-Lyndon. lf , like Valenti , we could sleep more soundly because Johnson was our man in the White House , it was not for glandular reasons . After the spectacular bombing pause and peace offensive of December , 1965 , and January , 1966 , the war resumed  --  hut so , only a little slowed , did the flow of legislation from Congress . The demonstration-cities program , a Cabinet-level Department of Transportation , an increased minimum wage , and an overall $3.3 billion increase in spending for domestic social programs were among the major congressional achievements  --  and Johnson kept up his personal triumphs by appointing the first Negro to the Cabinet ( Robert C. Weaver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by organizing his first Asian " summit conference " ? a meeting with the leaders of South Vietnam at Honolulu . But the atmosphere was changing , if almost imperceptibly . In February . Robert Kennedy spoke out against the Vietnam war ; in March , those who joined Wayne Morse in trying to repeal the Tonkin Gulf Resolution included Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota  --  whom Johnson had almost made Vice President . In the war itself , troop strength rose to 215,000 in March , 292,000 in August ; in June and July . 1966 , the bombing crept into the Hanoi-Haiphong areas . Not only did the White House Conference on the racial situation  --  which Johnson had called for in the great Howard University speech  --  prove a disaster , but in September . Congress rejected his open-housing bill . The pressures of Vietnam were beginning to affect the economy adversely , and in the fall , Johnson asked for and got suspension of ' an investment tax credit that had been designed to speed industrial expansion . There was this remarkable series of events in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Senate Foreign Relations Committee turned routine hearings on a supplemental appropriation for the war into a full-scale debate on Vietnamese policy , obviously in an effort to influence or change it . ? Congress put together a far tougher and more effective auto safety bill than the limited measure Johnson had proposed . ? A committee dominated by liberal Democrats conducted hearings on the problems of the cities , which had the net effect of a solid criticism of the President 's vaunted social program , . ? An influential group of senators began urging troop reductions in Europe , against the Administration 's wishes . To the most thoughtful observers , it looked very much as if Congress was beginning tentatively to reach for positive means  --  not mere obstructionism  --  of countering the dominance that the White House had asserted for more than 30 years over the legislative process , foreign policy , and domestic priorities . Primarily , this impulse was a delayed reaction to the immense , almost frightening , power that had necessarily been concentrated in presidential hands since 1933. as the Federal Government grappled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urban , technological , industrial society . But Congress was especially stirred to more active efforts in 1966 , it appeared , because the Vietnamese war vividly showed the extent to which foreign policy had been delivered into the hands of the President . The problem was more than just the institution of the Presidency . Johnson 's political skills , his influence over public discussion , his range-boss manner of running things , had made him personally too overwhelming , too dominant . for comfort . And  --  ironically  --  the demands of the war upon even his Gargantuan energies had left other matters , like China , Europe and the cities unusually open to congressional tives . In midsummer 1966 , after a swing around some of the states where interesting congressional races were in progress , l reported . in words that now seem a little incredulous : " The strongest impression an avid listener can bring back from travel in this country today is that the President is disliked and mistrusted by all too many people . " It seemed to me then that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . not always to be believed , a hit too concerned with the appearance of things to maintain a proper regard for the substance of things " and because they feared he had " accumulated too much power  --  that through a combination of the legitimate powers of his office and the not-quite-legitimate political guile with which he is so widely credited . he is not strongly enough challenged and checked , in Congress , in Vietnam or anywhere else . " That year , in the time-honored method of rebuking a President , the people gave the Republicans a net gain of 47 seats in the House and three senators , as well as a majority of the state governors . Suddenly . that momein for which I yndon Johnson had wailed ail of his life was gonv . Both in memory and in 1,1o , it has all been different since 1966 , ' Ellis is not because there were no monora his incidents . 1 here was , for example , I Inc instant at Glassboro , NVI .. in 1967 alai the " spirit of Holly Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the gaudier Johnson productions , although in the long run it accomplished nothing . There was the appointment of another First Negro  --  to the Supreme Court . this time , and ThtrrgoodTi Marshall , naturally . There were sec in-1,1,0y innumerable jaunts HILO the Pacific , followed by optimistic communiques , and a couple to South An - riea  --  plus the wildest Johasonian expedition of all , the round-the-world extravaganza following Harold Holt 's death in Australia ( hut not , sadly and significantly , the trip to the Soviet Union which Johnson had long coveted ) . Not the President 's pitchman skills but his luck had begun to slip . Had it not been for the 1968 Tet offensive , displaying for all to see the hollowness of White House and Pentagon pretensions to " victory " in Vietnam . Johnson 's adroit use of Gen. William C. Westmoreland as a messenger of glad tidings to Congress and the public in late 1967 might have ranked as one of the President 's most effective public-relations ploys . He still had the power to stun ; almost no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectively or act on it so decisively as he did on March 31 , when he withdrew from the race for re-election . And finally , just when it seemed most unlikely that he would be able to do so , he found means to wrench a bombing pause and a new phase of negotiations out of the deadlocked and nearly moribund talks in Paris  --  and nearly made Hubert Humphrey President as a result . Yet it all seemed different , not so much because the action had subsided , or even because the triumphs were fewer , but because the surrounding mood had changed . It was not really that Johnson had failed , or had begun to do things much differently ( although the man who handled the Pueblo incident was wiser and less Texan in the ways of power than the one who sent the Marines to the Dominican Republic and the planes winging north from the fonkin owl : it was rather ihai he things Join N In did and the way did Ihem came to seem arbitrary and frequently irrelevant . heca use Iheworld in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer the world he had known ; it did not respond in the ways he had learned to expect . In the 1960 's , revolt was sweeping across the world  --  revolt against power , against authority , against institutions , against politicians , against customs , against " the system , " even against more abstract qualities like sham , hypocrisy and pomposity . In the affluent United States the individuality after which Western man has unceasingly aspired had been inundated by the postwar era 's triumphs of technology and production . Americans were living in beehive apartments or sprawling anonymous suburbs , usually at the mercy of giant impersonal corporations and distant and unresponsive labor unions . Their cities had grown to ungovernable proportions ; Mill accompanying Minima ion , degradation and 1 rustration of all thal tried 10 11 ) MC and breathe within their hank , I here had been other changes . The great advances of medicine , ihe vast strides of technology insulated Marl against nature , his oldest , worthiest and most constantly challenging opponent ; and in the vacuum of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward on himself or outward against others . It was little wonder that so many young Americans  --  with little useful work left for them to do  --  sought the meaning of their lives in sex and drugs . But if it seemed Americans were being reduced to spoon-fed automatons , there was one area in ki hich the individual still retained  --  or thought he retained  --  a sovereign voice . That was in politics and government , which guaranteed each man a vote  --  direct participation in at least one great institutional influence on his life . It was the fate of Lyndon Johnson hal his range-hors personality . and his unlimited faith in federal action , made him precisely the wrong kind of President In cope with this age of revolt , this time in which men striving desperately to retain the last flicker of their individuality simply would not suffer their government and politics to he administered , however benevolently , by smothering authority expressing itself through overpowering institutions . Johnson had the power to wage war in Vietnam , and he did , but in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great public demonstrations of American history . He had the authority to draft young men to fight the war , and he used it . but the Government had to put on trial the chaplain of Yale University . the heavyweight champion of the world and Dr. Benjamin Spock , and it still could not stop the draft-card burnings or the exodus to Canada and Scandinavia . Johnson used his skills and powers ably to advance the ideals of his time and generation . to seal the aspirations of the Children of Depression . But to the Children of Affluence in their search for an ethic of their own , the great legislative achievements of 1965 and 1966 seemed remote and irrelevant , poor recompense indeed for an immoral war and an onerous draft . And a man who could play upon the American governing system as if it were an organ made for his hands , and who for a while made it function more smoothlp than had any President of modern times , naturally came to represent personally what those who were disillusioned saw as the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely felt , its unchecked powers . They really sass only Lyndon Johnson . Final y  --  and most important  --  because of his campaign pledges not to do what , in fact , he later did do in Vietnam , and because of the desperate tactics he was driven to in trying to vindicate himself and his war policies against those he sneered at as " Nervous Nellies , " Johnson and his " credibility gap " became symbols of compromise , evasion , half-truth , deception and expedience . And these were precisely the qualities that most outraged a generation that judged politics , in the ' 60 's , not by its pragmatic achievements , nor ' 30 's , but by the precedents of the ' by its moral 0111111'n and popular origins . The strange and devouring involvement in Southeast Asia had made men see that the political principles of one time might not apply in later years  --  indeed might bring disaster it ' rigidly adhered to in altered circumstances . The anguish of Vietnam , arising from ancient dynastic rivalries , the remnants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonisms far too complex to categorize merely as Communism vs . Democracy , as well as the clash of international ideologies and interests in a strategic region , simply did not fit the World War II-Cold War stereotype of aggressor nations battering at the walls of the Free World ; nor did the political nature of the war lend itself to the kind of fire-power reliance that was the American heritage from the victory over Hitler . As the last months of his Administration passed , Johnson even seemed to be fighting the war at home , where his touch had been so sure . After the Howard University speech  --  and after Watts and other clashes in Chicago . Cleveland and elsewhere  --  his understanding of the race revolution , to which he had given so much sympathy and support , seemed to falter . Negroes , he said at a news conference in 1966 , had to realize that they were only 10 percent of the population , that by explosions of violence they were jeopardizing gains already made , that most white Americans believed in peaceful progress for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could to see that " equality is given . " In return , Negroes ought to " cooperate with constituted authority . " This was the authentic voice of white moderation , which by 1966 was out of date and dangerously weak . Two summers of urban rioting and the emergence of the Black Power movement already had shown that great numbers of Negroes knew all too well that they were a minority and believed it was precisely that " democratic power with a small ' d ' " of which Johnson had spoken glowingly that had denied them their rights , equality , jobs and comforts . Peaceful progress , judged by the pace of the past , obviously was going to be too slow and too limited for them ; and ghetto Negroes facing sluggish , inept and sometimes corrupt city regimes , waiting for federal programs that seemed inevitably too little and too Inc. living in states quicker to call out the National Guard than tk , move against conditions of poverty and degradation , saw " constituted authority " as the enemy . Nor did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or earned by , them when it was the unquestioned right of others . Thus , as the public mood changed , Johnson 's rhetoric and impulse slipped out of phase , not only on the questions of Vietnam and of race , but across the spectrum of the President 's social program . The New Deal , first and last , had placed its reliance upon government , upon federal agencies and guidelines and matching grants and taxing power . In three decades all of these had so 14kdil'erated that I he apparatus over which Johnson presided land had expanded , notably with the Department of Transportation and the Office of Economic Opportunity ) was less and less efficacious or efficient , more and more a bureaucratic glacier , cold and creeping and distant from those it was designed to serve . And as the war began to eat into the nation 's vitals , Johnson could not even provide the funds which might have lubricated this ponderous contraption into more expeditious movement . The American model of the " welfare state " was being questioned on more basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to abolish it . Those , like Robert Kennedy , who genuinely wanted to assist the poor and the downtrodden , questioned not the intent but the instrument , which they saw as degrading and ineffective and wasteful , a trap rather than a hope . Welfare in America was basically a dole , and one which was policed , at that , for violations of the regulations and of the Protestant ethics of hard work and sexual self-control . Critics wanted less policing and more incentives for self-betterment ; less federal planning and administration , more local control and participation . In the final analysis , it was the insistence of Americans that they had a right to participate that brought about the downfall of Lyndon B. Johnson  --  that rejected his war , downgraded his achievements , who saw his rangy confidence as stubborn willfulness , his old vigor and combustibility as unbridled impulse , his power  --  verbal and political  --  as less the manner of a leader than the ominous potential of a tyrant . This was not just the insistence of the thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 196768 and exposed the President 's political weakness , and it was not just the insistence of the great crowds who rallied to Robert Kennedy in the spring of his death and apotheosis . Rather , it was the insistence of millions of Americans who in their separate and inchoate ways were not ready , after 1965 , to succumb to massiveness and authority in their government . What had Lyndon Johnson accomplished ? A great deal , certainly , yet  --  as is the way of the world  --  by no means as much as might have been , and far less than he must have anticipated . Quantified , the Great Society obviously gets brilliant marks : 435 domestic social programs today as against only 45 at the end of the Eisenhower Administration , a $25.6 billion social budget this year compared to only $9.9 billion in 1960 ( not including Social Security expenditures in either ) . More specifically , Johnson can point to three years with unemployment below 3.8 percent , to 10.5 million jobs created by industrial expansion , and to an estimated 18 million persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statistics make an impressive argument for the extent of his achievements . Yet most of his programs were underfunded. mostly because of the financial squeeze created by Johnson 's war . One m ust cone ' ude that , in essence , the great problems remain , seeming virtually untouched . Seething racial animosities , collapsing public services , an alienated younger generation , choking cities , overblown military expenditures , inadequate and in some cases disastrous schools  --  it would be hard to argue that four years of the Great Society have brought the nation anywhere near what Johnson envisioned , In fact , some of his opponents insist that , by arousing expectations , particularly among the black and the poor , that could not be fulfilled , the President caused even greater unrest , anger and violence . If so , Lyndon Johnson did bring the nation face-to-face with itself . He presil'ed over the first beginnings of a shift of its interest from the old concentration on raising its standard cf living to a new concern for the quality of its society . From population control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social areas previously forbidden . To his successors he left not only government instruments of vast potential but ? more important  --  a standard of politica concern for American life that they would have difficulty in putting aside . Nevertheless , the tragedy of Lyndon Johnson remains . In the midst of profound change , more sweeping than any previous generation had seen , he was still the Texas New Dealer . the product of a rooted past and a controlling experience .

Once he said that he had found the answer to a President 's problems in " the land where I was born "  - -  a barren land where " the angular hills were covered with scrub cedar and a few large live oaks " and little else would grow .

" But that was the dream of yesterday , consciously maintained . " A President , " Johnson said , " does not shape a new and personal vision of America . He collects it from the scattered hopes of the American past . " No wonder , then , that he turned unerringly to what he knew to shape the course that he would take  --  to the soil of the Pedernales and to the life and times into which it had delivered him . It was not his fault that . % ? hert " a new and personal vision of America " was more profoundly demanded than ever before , he could turn only to the scattered hopes of the past .
