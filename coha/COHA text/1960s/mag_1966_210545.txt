By Saudi Arabia 's Islamic calendar , this year is 1386 , and visitors to the-desert kingdom often feel that is about where Saudi Arabia stands on the Western calendar . Justice still decrees an eye for an eye . Marriages are arranged sight unseen . A few weeks ago the deputy rector of the Islamic University at Medina even came out in support of a 14th-century theory that the world is flat and mountains are only ballast to keep it from tipping over . But for all this , Saudi Arabia 's old ideas and old ways are giving way to the 20th century . King Feisal ibn Abdul Aziz , 62 , is not afraid to call it a revolution . " Revolutions , " he says , " can come from a throne as well as from a conspirator 's cellar . " <P> Across the country , new hospitals , schools , housing projects and factories are sprouting up on the hot horizon . In the privacy of their homes , many Saudis no longer fear that drinking , dancing or a little poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out in the desert , the country 's ever-wandering Bedouins , who comprise 80% of Saudi Arabia 's 3,500,000 people , are swapping their camels for Land Rovers and pickup trucks , and-thanks to a government well-drilling program that guarantees them water-are abandoning their nomadic ways and settling into community life . <P> In the process , a true nation ' is emerging out of what once was four major tribal confederations and two or three urban centers . As its leader , Feisal himself was his own best proof of the change last week . In his flowing white robes and gold headband , he flew off to Spain for five days of trade and foreign-investment talks with Francisco Franco . From Madrid he goes on to Washington this week , where he will meet with President Johnson to discuss economic development and other problems of the Middle East . In the old days of Saudi extravagance , there would have been one plane for the King , another for his luggage and 100 to 150 traveling companions . This time there were only one black , green and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Riches to Work . Unlike his profligate half-brother-ex-King Saud , whom he nudged aside in 1964 after Saud had all but bankrupted the country-Feisal is an energetic , reform-minded ruler determined to put Saudi Arabia 's oil riches to work for the people . No sooner was he in power than he ordered free education and medical service for all Saudis , stepped up oil production and trimmed the country 's budget . Today Saud 's lavish , pink-walled Nasiriyah Palace in Riyadh-with an air-conditioning system said to be second in size only to the Pentagon's-lies deserted . <P> Feisal lives instead in a smaller economy model . Saud 's beloved fleet of Cadillacs has given way to a pair of Chrysler New Yorkers , and with a deftly democratic touch , Feisal always sits up front next to the driver . To get just as close to the people , Feisal holds a daily majlis ( assembly ) and invites everyone-from the richest merchant to the scruffiest Bedouin-to come and get his gripes off his chest . " We believe , " says Feisal , " that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be alien to Western ways . "
