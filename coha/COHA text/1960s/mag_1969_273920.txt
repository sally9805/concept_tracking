A broody , pushy , sexy young thing hits the road to seek meaning in life and self . She does n't find it , because she does n't really want to . She even flees from the realities she stumbles upon-a Catholic church in Phoenix , a Mexican whorehouse , an offer of unselfish love . She is essentially untouched by the episodes she floats through . The story is a series of commas . <P> Chastity bears the mark of first effort . It tries , awkwardly , to innovate : the heroine has several thought-soliloquies that are slangy , pretentious mini-sermons on God , man and morals . The final frames , which flashback to reveal a troubled upbringing , are too late and too pat-merely a neat way to label things and go home . The film is arch and inconclusive ; in Chastity 's own words : " Do me a favor . Do n't try to make me . I 'll tell you if I feel like it . " <P> Sonny Bono 's screenplay and production are flawed . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , is more than creditable . True , the messed-up-youth scene can hardly be new to her ( and the Bonos ' little girl happens to be named Chastity ) , but Cher is on-screen for virtually the whole film and still handles herself with an easy flair . She clearly enjoys playing a side-of-the-mouth , post-teeny-bopper bitch , and even brings off the role 's dark comedy . An instance : as a would-be prostitute she collects a garterful of cash from a young Alfred E. Newman type by deadpanning , " Take the special-the quickie 's a drag . " Then , still leading him perfectly , she talks him into " the whole works , " which never materializes . Chastity 's primary virtue is that it serves as a showcase for an engaging newcomer .
