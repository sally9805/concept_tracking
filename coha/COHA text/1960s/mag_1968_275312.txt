In the final week , a barrage of personal charges further marred the undistinguished presidential campaign . First came the revival of some old charges that turned into a new attack on the integrity of Spiro Agnew . Then Hubert Humphrey was hit by a niggling accusation that raised questions about his probity . Both Agnew and Humphrey had well-founded rebuttals-though it was a little late in the campaign for rebuttals fully to catch up . <P> Question of Conflict . The charges against Agnew appeared in a New York Times editorial that denounced him for " clear and repeated conflicts of interest . " The blast was based on a news story published earlier in the Times , but the editorial went far beyond Reporter Ben A. Franklin 's conclusion that lengthy digging by many investigators had " turned up little that is new . " Said the editorial : " It now develops that as a zoning board member , as chief executive of Baltimore County and as Governor , Mr. Agnew has been the political ally and financial partner of a group of wealthy land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing land in suburban Baltimore over the past 15 years , and Mr. Agnew 's financial worth has also risen sharply . " <P> Specifically , the Times contended that in 1965 Agnew and the businessmen had bought some land on the probable approach route of a projected parallel span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge . Later , said the Times , " as Governor , he approved this route . " Further , and with some justice , the Times questioned the propriety of Governor Agnew 's continuing to serve as a director of the Chesapeake National Bank . The editorial added that from 1964 to 1966 , Agnew , as county executive , had voted to deposit county funds in the bank , and noted that " the state has public funds on deposit with this bank . " <P> Detailed Denial . Agnew 's quick denial was far more detailed than the charges made against him . Indeed , he had bought a one-ninth share in the Chesapeake Bay Bridge land in 1965 , but publicly disclosed that fact when he ran for Governor in 1966 . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with instructions to sell it and turn over the profits , if any , to charity . The land was sold at auction in 1967 for $34,200-exactly what Agnew had paid for it . He also observed that the bridge route had been recommended and approved by the state roads commission under the previous Democratic administration and that he , as Governor , had no authority to approve or veto any route the road might take .
