txt Now that the supersonic transport is nearly a reality , some critics are saying people and buildings wo n't be able to take the continual shock waves regular SST flights across land will generate . Traveling at 1,800 miles an hour 12 miles above the earth , an SST will build shock waves as it cuts through the atmosphere . These waves radiate in all directions as the cone in the drawing shows . The rounded forward edge locates the line of momentary impact of these waves . The shaded area shows the width of the area covered by a shock wave of a single SST . It takes about 12 seconds ( at the speed of sound ) for these shock waves to reach the ground directly beneath the SST 's flight path . The time is somewhat longer in the 50.80 mile wide area on either side . Because of its high speed , the SST will he out of sight and 30 miles away before its boom is heard . One foe of the sonic boom , Dr. William A. Shurcliff of . Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supersonic flights overland , we mean to oppose the very existence of SSTs .
