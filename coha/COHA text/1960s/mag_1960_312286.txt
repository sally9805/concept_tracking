In the plain-spoken letter that prompted visiting President Eisenhower to invite him and six of his friends to see the U.S. for themselves , Chilean University Student Patricio Fernndez drew a bitter contrast . He compared the failure of the U.S. to finance the economic development of Latin America with " the initiative of the U.S. and its immense sacrifices in Europe-the Marshall Plan . " Last week , as the Chileans finished their tour of the U.S. , they made it plain that they had come , seen and not been conquered . <P> Fern7#225 ; ndez and his friends think that " the key to understanding the current world situation is recognition that man has entered the period of the most intense , widespread revolutionary activity in his long history , " and that the revolution 's cause is the disparity between the high U.S. standard of living and the low standard of 1.8 billion hungry havenots , including Latin Americans . <P> In this mood they traveled the U.S. from San Francisco to Manhattan , touching at Philadelphia , Albuquerque , Pittsburgh , Chicago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational system , fraternity houses , cement plants , free enterprise , soil-conservation projects and a calendar printing plant . They were briefed by State Department officials and rebriefed by professors , Rotarians and students of Hispanic affairs . <P> In Washington at journey 's end , the students made it clear at a press conference that their brains had not been washed . They still had the questions ( and preconceptions ) they arrived with , and said they had got no satisfactory answers . Sample : " Why does the U.S. not grant credits for fundamental government-owned industries like petroleum ? Why has not the U.S. come anywhere near fulfilling our basic necessities ? " <P> At week 's end they flew to Cuba , where Fern7#225 ; ndez pleased a television audience by saying that " the Cuban revolution represents a hope for the peoples of Latin America , " but made clear that the U.S. visit was " pretty good , because we had absolute freedom to converse with the personalities we wanted to talk to .
