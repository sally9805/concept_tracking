A TREE ON FIRE by Alan Sillitoe . 451 pages . Doubleday . $5.95 . <P> <P> As one of the angriest of Britain 's Angry Young Men , Alan Sillitoe made painfully vivid the mill-town world of chapped hands and cold-water sinks in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning . In this novel , he seems neither quite so young and angry , nor quite so British . <P> Frank Dawley , a young ex-factory worker , has deserted his wife and his pregnant mistress to fight for the F.L.N. against the French in Algeria . His journey turns into what might be called an existential Pilgrim 's Progress . Is he simply trying to escape the ties of his former life , or is he really bent on revolutionizing the world by fighting for Communism and the Algerians ? The relentless sun becomes a more formidable combatant than the French , the endless sand a more unarguable reality than any dialectic . <P> Surrounded by scorpions and fleas , sandstorms and the fire bombings from French helicopters , Dawley soon feels that his past is irretrievable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeking refuge from the stony midday sun , no longer knowing that they walked . Land was like alcohol ; he walked , and walking was like drinking . He drank it in on waking , and went all day from sundown to blackout wallowing in it until he dropped from exhaustion and total inebriation , happy and not caring if he ever woke again . Trudging all day over the flat stale beer of the stony plain , brandy of hills , mouth shut tight because it seeped in continually through eyes , ears , nose and anus , the drink of land and the never-ending gutterbout of topography , a blinding weekend of landbooze that went on for months . " <P> In the other half of the book , Albert Handley-a middle-aged madcap painter presiding over a whole circus of a family in Lincolnshire-rages against the sudden wealth and new-found fame threatening his old bohemian way of life . His children pester him for money , journalists hound him for interviews . Visions of unborn paintings torment his days and nights . He , too , claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the social structure that feeds him . <P> The author attempts a parallel but fails to sustain it . But Sillitoe is himself obviously more at home in Algeria and its stark alternatives than in the equivocal uncertainties of the sybaritic world of his Lincolnshire artist .
