Almost at once China put its border clash with Russia to use in a new domestic propaganda campaign . The aim is " to convert the workers ' indignation at the Soviet revisionist armed provocation into revolutionary energy , " as the official New China News Agency put it . According to the agency , miners promised to " produce more top-quality coal , so as to burn the Soviet revisionists , a paper tiger , into ashes . " Workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company were reported so angry at the Russians that they opened a new furnace ahead of schedule . <P> Peking 's exhortations were designed to rally fervor for China 's latest economic venture . The project bears a striking resemblance to the Great Leap Forward of a decade ago , probably Mao Tse-tung 's most ambitious scheme for China , and his most disastrous failure . <P> On Two Legs . At the height of that folly , smoke was belching from millions of tiny , homemade backyard steel furnaces stoked by peasants-a fantastic waste of manpower that eventually resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course , China 's economy had been set back by nearly a decade . <P> Although China has scarcely recovered from the Great Leap Forward and the more recent ravages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , the rhetoric today- " walking on two legs , " " flying leap , " " new leap " - is virtually identical with the admonitions of the earlier fiasco . As was the case then , agriculture will have to bear the main burden . <P> The new leap orders China 's 74,000-odd communes to forget about any aid from Peking . They have been told that henceforth they themselves-not the government-must remunerate schoolteachers and medical personnel working in the countryside . Commune members are to make their own simple farm tools , freeing industry for more sophisticated production . Moreover , Peking is pushing a frugality theme to such a degree that celebrations for the New Year , China 's biggest and happiest holiday , were woefully crimped last month . <P> Fighting Lethargy . The communes are already hurting : they have to feed an estimated 20 million former urbanites - including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent into the boondocks for lengthy spells of physical labor . The peasants ' response to Mao 's latest brainstorm so far seems to have been remarkably unenthusiastic : troops had to be sent to a commune in Szechwan province to " overcome local lethargy . " <P> What seems to distinguish the new drive from the old Great Leap , however , is its flexibility . There has been some advance planning , and there appear to be no rigid output targets . In fact , Peking is admonishing local officials to " leave enough leeway . " Though not too much , of course . The goal of the latest campaign , as Shanghai radio explained it recently , is " a fruit that can be picked by jumping and reaching up , not a fruit that can be taken by stretching out one 's arm from a lying or sitting position . "
