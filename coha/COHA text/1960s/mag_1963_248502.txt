It was by all odds the most extraordinary date a man and woman ever had . The Soviets one day last week orbited Vostok V , piloted by Air Force Lieut . Colonel Valery Feodorovich Bykovsky , 28 . LISTEN WORLD , headlined Izvestia , SOVIET MAN IS AGAIN STORMING THE COSMOS . But this time , Soviet Woman was storming right along . Two days later , Bykovsky was joined in orbit by the first female in space , Lieut . Valentina Vladimirovna Chereshkova , 26 , at the controls of Vostok VI . In radio and television transmission to the breathless spectators on the ground , he referred to himself as " The Hawk , " while she called herself " The Seagull . " <P> Weightless . Soon after Bykovsky was launched , Khrushchev gave a hint of what was to come . When Britain 's visiting Harold Wilson asked how many cosmonauts were up , he replied delightedly : " Only one-so far . " <P> As Bykovsky soared through his orbit , at a speed of 18,000 m.p.h. and in an oval that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he dined on roast beef and chicken , manually operated the controls of his spacecraft . From the capsule , live television images were periodically flashed to Soviet viewers . Bykovsky waved his logbook , let his pencil and other objects float in the cabin to demonstrate weightlessness . On his fourth orbit , the cosmonaut talked directly to Khrushchev in the Kremlin . Not yet a full-fledged party member , Bykovsky said : " I want to be a Communist , a member of our great Leninist party . " <P> After Seagull joined Hawk , there were more messages . Said Khrushchev : " Dear Valentina Vladimirovna , cordial congratulations to the world 's first woman cosmonaut on the wonderful flight through the expanses of the universe ... A happy journey to you ! We will be extremely glad to meet you on Soviet soil . " <P> Smiling at the TV camera in her capsule-some viewers described her as resembling a tougher-looking Ingrid Bergman-Valentina thanked Khrushchev for his " fatherly concern , " assured everyone that she was feeling fine . <P> Together . Her biography made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father a tractor driver killed in World War II , mother a factory worker . Cosmonette Valentina herself was a textile worker , night school student and Young Communist functionary until she got interested in parachuting as a hobby ( she made 126 jumps ) and was picked for cosmonaut training . <P> The Russians , of course , had earlier managed a tandem space shot , with two men . This time , though , the expectation was that they would try to " dock " the two capsules together aloft , thus possibly permitting one of the pair of cosmonauts to transfer into the spacecraft of the other . Even if this extra twist does not come off , the duo flight once again proves that Russia is at least two years ahead of the U.S. in space , and moreover , knows how to woo the world 's females . Stated purpose of the Valery-Valentina feat : to study the impact of space " on the organism of a man and a woman . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
