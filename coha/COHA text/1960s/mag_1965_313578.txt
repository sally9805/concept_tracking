Tucson 's morning Arizona Daily Star ( circ. 44,000 ) was up for sale and , at an asking price of $8,000,000 , it seemed a good buy . Profits were high and the paper owned valuable real estate besides . Prospective purchasers ranged from Robert White , co-publisher of the prosperous Mexico ( Mo . ) Ledger , to Minneapolis Star &; Tribune President John Cowles . But the out-of-towners never made it . The afternoon Tucson Daily Citizen ( circ. 45,000 ) beat them to the draw by anteing up $10 million for the Star because of " a desire to see this strong , outspoken newspaper remain a vital force in Tucson , rather than become just another link in a chain . " <P> Echoed Arguments . Though the Citizen 's owners said their offer was in spired by local loyalty , the Justice Department thought differently . Last week trustbusters descended on Tucson , charged that the Citizen-Star deal was illegal on the ground that it violated both the Clayton and Sherman antitrust acts . Justice Department arguments echoed those used last June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government charged that chain ownership of both the morning Enquirer and evening Post &; Times-Star in Cincinnati constituted a monopoly , even though the two papers had separate plants , staffs and editorial policies , an arrangement that Scripps-Howard deliberately nourished to discourage a federal suit . <P> The Citizen-Star marriage brokers had also been cautious . They spelled out sale terms designed to keep the Democratic Star 's policies as different from the Republican Citizen 's as possible . Editorial authority at the Star " for the next ten years " went to longtime Editor and Publisher William Rankin Mathews , a crusading newspaperman best known for his 1953 expos of an Arizona real estate swindle . The arrangement apparently convinced U.S. District Court Judge James Walsh , who denied the Government 's plea for an order restraining the sale . <P> Shared Plant . But the Government refused to give up . It brought suit , not to block the merger but to undo it . And strangely , the heart of the trustbusters ' argument was not so much the present merger but a 24-year-old agreement between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff-a clear violation , the Government claimed , of the restraint-of-trade and antimonopoly sections of the Sherman Act . <P> The outcome of the suit is certain to be watched in dozens of other publishing offices across the country , for one-owner newspaper towns are now the rule rather than the exception in the U.S. And in such cities as Nashville , El Paso , Tulsa and Salt Lake City , joint ventures almost identical to Tucson 's have been thriving for years .
