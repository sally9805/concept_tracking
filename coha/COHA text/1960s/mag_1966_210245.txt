All over France , women are making advances , and the traditional French sugar daddy is in decline . Ladies of means in their 30s and 40s are turning into sugar mommies , raising cane by taking young boy friends . Latest to join in is Actress Jeanne Moreau , 38 , who disappeared lately in the south of France with a 23-year-old lad named Theodore Roubanis , only to turn up in Paris last week with a more mature companion , Photographer Cyril Morange , 25 . They are now blissfully ensconced in Jeanne 's country house , and throughout France the middle-aged men are singing a variation on the old Piaf standard : Oui , je regrette quelquechose . <P> <P> Henry Ford II gloomily surveyed the state of the nation , 1966 model , and concluded that in many ways it 's an awful lemon . " I am troubled by the growth of violence , " he told the National Association of Purchasing Agents in Detroit , " by the riots , vandalism , irresponsible demonstrations , the tendency toward rebellion for its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ford , is " to join the war on poverty . The free-enterprise system will not gain the acceptance it needs until all men share in the abundance that system provides . " One night after Henry spoke , he shared some of his own abundance with an unworthy citizen-the thief who foot-padded into his Manhattan apartment and disappeared with $50,000 worth of his wife Christina 's jewels . <P> <P> " Your visit is unique , " said Israel 's Premier Levi Eshkol in the understatement of this or many another year . West Germany 's former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , 90 , stood in Jerusalem with his old friend ex-Premier David Ben-Gurion , 79 , and declared : " Your hearty welcome has assured me that my visit here will be unforgettable . " There were moments during the eight-day trip that he might just as soon forget , such as an ugly fracas at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University , where police tangled with anti-German demonstrators . Otherwise , the Israelis were warm to der Alte , a staunch anti-Nazi in wartime and a champion of Israel since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he gravely told guests at Eshkol 's home , " then no good can be created . " <P> <P> The artist 's model is surviving the art . At 53 years of age , the U.S. Indianhead nickel is now vanishing like a lost tribe . But at 103 , Seneca Chief John Big Tree , one of the three men who posed for the 5 bas-relief by Sculptor James Earle Fraser , has suffered little depreciation . Chief Big Tree has so much mettle , in fact , that he traveled down from his home near Syracuse , N.Y. , to help the Chase Manhattan Bank observe the 100th anniversary of the first U.S. nickel . The celebration featured a nickelodeon , a cigar-store Indian and a carrousel buffalo . Alas , the original beast on the nickel 's flip side was turned into a robe in 1915 . <P>
