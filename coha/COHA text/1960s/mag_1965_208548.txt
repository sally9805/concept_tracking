Most of the accolades accorded Edward R. Murrow on his death last April skipped over the fact that there was another man who had made a historic and earlier contribution to broadcasting journalism . People had forgotten the clipped , high-pitched , precisely accentuated tones of H. V. Kaltenborn , who died at 86 last week of a heart attack . In his prime in the ' 30s , Kaltenborn had roamed a sick Europe , producing fascinating , ominous interviews with Hitler and Mussolini , and his brilliant marathon coverage of the Munich crisis jarred American homes into a chilling awareness of the war to come . <P> Kaltenborn had more firm opinions on more topics than any other commentator , and he delivered them with complete self-assurance . He was often profoundly right , especially in his early diagnosis of the dangers of Nazism . He could also be spectacularly wrong . In the close 1948 presidential election , which tried the stamina of most pundits , he kept insisting , long after it was prudent , that Tom Dewey would win by an " overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in H.V. 's voice . Kaltenborn did not resent it ; he mimicked Truman mimicking him . <P> Scorning a Script . Descendant of an aristocratic German family , Hans von Kaltenborn was born in Milwaukee , left home and school at 14 because he thirsted for " information of the world . " He joined the Brooklyn Eagle in 1902 , but after a few years of reporting , he decided he needed a formal education and went to Harvard . After graduation , he returned to the Eagle , where he gave weekly lectures on current events . On a whim , the Eagle broadcast one of the lectures , and Kaltenborn was launched on a new career . <P> He became radio 's first regularly scheduled news commentator . Scorning a script , he spoke only from sketchy notes-and sometimes from none at all . Scarcely glancing at the clock , totally unflappable , he rattled off the news without muffing a line . In his early days of broadcasting , a pianist stood ready to knock out a tune if Kaltenborn should run out of words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In Spain during the Civil War , Kaltenborn broadcast the first live radio coverage of combat ; once , he installed himself in a haystack on the battlefield so that listeners could hear the crackle of gunfire . For 20 days during the Munich crisis in 1938 , he scarcely budged from his CBS studio in New York , where he subsisted on onion soup and slept on a cot . He provided running translations of the speeches of Hitler and Mussolini as they came over short wave and analyzed them on the spot . He saw the significance of Munich and warned his audiences accordingly : " Hitler always says after each of his conquests , ' Now , no more . All is well . ' But there has always been more , and there may be more still . Sir Robert Walpole said when the British people rejoiced because he had kept them out of war : ' Today they ring the bells . Tomorrow they will wring their hands . ' "               @ @ @ @ @ @
