Herzog : what a title On the realistic surface , the word is a name you can find in telephone books , free of English meaning or association . But there are cracks in the realistic fa  --  ade The name is German but is it also Jewish ? And how is it pronounced , Hurtsog , Hurzog , Hairtsog2 In the pidgin of the ( American ) unconscious , it puts " heart " and " hog " together in all sorts of silly ways , with " sog " in the offing These , then , are juxtaposed to the literal German meaning " duke " Duke Heart 's Hog . . . .

Still , there are ways to write stories which can ruin the most interesting subject Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Gandhi 's life would disappear shapeless . under the cairn . Herzog , like most characters , is neither a Gandhi , so interesting that it would take a perverted anti-writer to make him dull , nor a Bloom , so uninteresting that only a perverted super-writer would think of telling his non-story The book has no plot , but at least Herzog is in an intense situation , full of hate for the treacherous wife and friend ; at least he does something , nowhere near enough to keep you reading for the story 's sake , but something He is a rather typical character in modern American fiction , alienated , baffled , but he has an intellect almost exactly as extraordinary as Saul Bellow 's , one which raises him to a realm altogether brighter than the smog in which Chicago characters usually seem to live , Sister Carrie , Studs Lonigan , Bigger Thomas , Frankie Machine But intellectual vigor is not in itself enough tomake a character worth knowing . As a subject , Herzog is down toward the Bloom end of the scale : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is sustained in the reader 's mind by his creator 's prose The play of Bellow 's prose causes in the reader 's mind a play analogous to the play of Herzog 's mind Of no live ' character , real or fictional , is it truer to say .

Dear Wanda , Dear Zinha , Dear Libbie , Dear Ramona , Dear Sono , I need help in the worst way . I am afraid of falling apart Dear Edvig , the fact zs that madness also has been denied me . I do n't know why I should write to you at all . Dear Mr. President , Internal Revenue regulations will turn us into a nation of bookkeepers The life of every citizen is becoming a business . This , it seems to me , is one of the worst interpretations of the meaning of human life history has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quirky , leaping , sometimes silly , sometimes piercing  --  such is Herzog 's mind , such the prose of the letters and of the entire novel . It is ' far from the self-effacing prose of most fiction , of realistic novels It is much closer to the style of the " anatomy , " Rabelais , Robert Burton . Among novelists , it has a good deal in common , functionally , with the prose of Tristram Shandy and Ulysses . That is , it is erudite , allusive , and full of tricks , and in itself it is the Main source of the reader 's pleasure . Because of the prose , Herzog is the first intellectual in American fiction whose mind is fully a part of him , who is all there in the reader 's imagination . This is not the least of the reasons why the first round of literary-intellectual reviewers liked the ' book so much . To be sure , a style sets its own limits . How Herzog works on a willing reader who is nonliterary , nonintellectual and non-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the book who can Besides , as soon as Herzog gets to Chicago , everything picks up and the style expands to include all who will . Of course Herzog is n't identical with the style The book is not a confession , an arrangement of words projecting a self directly and immediately The man personally is not as funny as the style . He is humorous , he sometimes does ludicrous things , he laughs at himself But we readers laugh a lot more than he does Our laughter may often be ' painful , since we do not cease to sympathize with him in his silliness and misfortune . Still , we do laugh Try telling someone what Herzog is about , all the time insisting that it 's funny Loneliness , betrayal , disillusionment , near murder , humiliation , half-madness , sorrow , severance , confusion , waste  --  comic , all comic ! ' A strange combination Why does Bellow insist on making the novel comic ? In this book , the style is the man plus his author 's looking at him . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his widowed stepmother , a strong , shrewd old woman . He gets her out of the room so that , on the pretext of taking some Czarist rubles from his dead father 's desk he may filch his father 's loaded pistol . ( Neither he nor we are fully conscious of why he wants the pistol ; it turns out he takes it with him when he goes to spy on his former wife and her lover , though he does not shoot . ) Immediately after he pockets the gun , he goes to the old woman , Taube , and Bellow represents his thoughts as follows : He knew it was not proper that he should think her expression sheep-like . This figurative habit of his mind crippled his judgment , and was likely to ruin him some day . Perhaps the day was near ; perhaps this night his soul would be required of him . The gun weighed on his chest . But the protuberant lips , great eyes , and pleated mouth were sheeplilie , and they warned him he was taking too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be heeded , had fought the grave to a standstill , balking death itself by her slowness . There is nothing comic about either the situation or his reflections . It is their juxtaposition which is comic , and this juxtaposing Bellow has caused so that he and we alike may keep our distance from Herzog . Without the double distance of comedy , near and far simultaneously , all would have descended into a glop of free association and self-justification ; no Herzog , no Herzog . As it is , the character and his self-justifyings remain over there ; we see him , we laugh at him even as we feel for him , we can understand him . Usually . Nearly always , but not quite always . In one important respect , Bellow fails . Herzog 's noncomic , anti-comic loathing of his false friend , Gersbach , almost totally obliterates that character for the reader . The faithless wife , Madeleine , we can see somewhat better , though now-here near so well as his present mistress . But wife and friend we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know them well if we are to size up Herzog fully . Here , and here only , Bellow allows Herzog 's fantasy to supplant the reality almost entirely , rather than to play counterpoint to it A serious flaw , fatal if the book had been realistically serious . That is , according to realistic psychology , we know that Herzog , even in his middle age , Was false-naive . Looking at a photograph of himselftaken at the time he got ' his M. A. , he thinks : His younger face expressed the demands of ingenuous conceit . A man in years he then was , but in years only , and in his father 's eyes stubbornly un-European , that is , innOcent by deliberate choice . Moses refused to know evil . But he could not refuse to experience it . And therefore others were appointed to do it to him , and then to be accused ( by him ) of wickedness . This is the naivet ? which made it possible for him to be so thoroughly duped , and his natural rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows he puts himself into the position to shoot them , and then does not . He ' knows and Bellow knows , but we readers must know too . We must know more about Gersbach than externals , than that he was a poet-announcer with a wooden leg , we must know him in our hearts . We were n't victimized by him . After all , Herzog , an arrogant , , intellectual , experienced man , had no business being so innocent at his age , he is guilty of innocence . The evil of ) Ger " gbach and Madeleine we can not take on Herzog 's word ; Bellow must prove it , if we are to credit it fully enough to hate them on our own , and he does not . He seals us inside Herzog 's mind too much , as he does not with the other ' secondary characters . But , happily , the book is only partly about the rape of Herzog 's naivete . There is more to him than that , much more . According to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sloth He has his quota of the other sins , lust , pride , anger , but sloth dominates him . Not merely indolence , but busy-work too , furiously doing a thousand other things instead of what he ought to ' be doing His , soul wallows , and all the time his mind is thinking wildly , surrounding it with swarms of thoughts , attacking it , darting every which way , always coming back to it , prodding it till it shifts and grunts , jabbing at it . Sometimes the heaviness gets into the book . Late one afternoon his mistress phones and invites him over to dinner . He says he will be right there . It takes him thirty or forty minutes to get to the door of his apartment , during which time he doeS nothing ' but have twenty pages of thoughts . There is a lot of ? n'ergy in these thoughts , but the inertia beneath them makes the passage drag . Realistic or moral , whatever the psychology , there is the flaw in Herzog 's character which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without He ca n't stop thinking , lie is out of control of his thoughts a good deal of the time , he spills over , he darts all over the place . A lot of the thoughts he has are worth having , their energy is abundant , and they reek with vitality , even the silly ones . And the way Saul Bellow has put them together is a delight , a treat . On the next to last page occur the last words of Herzog 's last imaginary letter : " ' But what do you want , Herzog ? ' But that 's just it  --  not a solitary thing . I am pretty well satisfied to be , to be just as it is willed , and for as long as I may remain in occupancy . ' " When you read this , you believe it . This is not just an easy upbeat ending . Herzog has earned the right to say . this , Still . " For as long as I may remain in occupancy . " Here he is , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in Who 's Who , and he writes a sentence like that ! The language of it may be more or less in character , but Bellow uses the locution to hold Herzog over there to the very end , so you wo n't take his sentiments too ' much to heart . You believe him , but you also believe Bellow 's prose : Herzog has got through , all right , but only just , and there 's plenty of trouble ahead How long has Herzog , to our knowledge , ever been satisfied with anything , much less existence ? " I am pretty well satisfied to be , to be just as it is willed .
