txt  |  phase of sewing machine operation . Many stress this as the cardinal rule in training operators . " Do the operation on one run " is their by-word . The operator is trained not to stop sewing the seam ( or stitching ) after the operation has begun until it is finished . This is discussed at length in the last half of this chapter . What is important now , is the place of sight reading in the situation . The operator must learn not only to think , visualize , and feel the situation ( like the chauffeur feels the curve he is approaching in the road ) , but she must also be able to control the situation . Sight reading is a situation where the present moment is lived subconsciously and what is done is done as a matter of habit , memory , or past planning . The accent of awareness is on the future moment . 1he concept of sight reading is related to the concept of tempo and rhythms . he two niiist not he diwnreed . The mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tempo and rhythm of the activity . Ibis is true in sew " ng machine operation as well as other activities such as driving , typing , or playing a musical instrument . The reverse is also true . The preciseness of the rhythm and the degree of tempo in executing a task in any of the aforementioned activities vary directly with the ability to sight read . Good sight readers are capable of maintaining perfect rhythm with fast tempo . Poor sight readers have difficulty in adhering to rhythm patterns and can do so only at a slow tempo or after muscular memory is present . This is discussed on p. 352. 17 . The Pattern Concept of Sight Reading Sight reading is based on pattern concept . The good sight reader can see , grasp , and mentally retain large patterns regardless of whether the patterns are formed by music notations or fabric contours and sewing guide-markings such as notches , chalk lines , or awl holes . The patterns of written music arc definitely more intricate than the line , contour , and space patterns of sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint of both the quantitative and qualitative values  | of the finished performance . Quantitative because it has the greater number of elements composing its patterns ; qualitative because the relationships between the pattern elements require finer degrees of precision tolerances . When a student begins to learn sight reading at the piano , the student sight-reads at the fastest tempo and with the largest " sight group " possible with which he can maintain the required rhythm . " Sight group " is the segment or pattern which the eye can see and the mind 's eye can digest , interpret , and act upon to execute fluently . Sight reading is actually a transmission process . It is the quick , spontaneous transmission of an envisioned image into an expression . Concept and reflex compose the interim connecting image and expression . The reflex is the expression of the concept ; the concept is formed , then the reflex takes place . Good sight reading depends on habit patterns which can only be acquired by repeated practice . This is aptly illustrated in the activity of piano playing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have a good command of chords , scales , arpeggios , broken chords and all other musical ingredients which go into sharpening the taste of musical composition . The piano student is taught to recognize lengthy arpeggios and other basic tone patterns at a glance and to react spontaneously . " I he Inge part which memory plays in sight-reading may also be illustrated by using basic arithmetic as an example . Why do we memorize the multiplication and division tables in our childhood ? Why do we memorize our basic addition and subtraction , such as 2 plus 2 equals 4 , etc. ? The better one 's memory on these basic arithmetical processes , the better the ability and degree of sight reading in computation . The better the typist 's memory as to key placement , and word patterns , the better the ability and degree of sight reading t hat the typist possesses . Sight reading patterns must be memorized fluently with repeated practice until the desired habit is formed . As the ability to sight read increases , the length of the passage to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses . A new sight reading  | length is never attempted until the present length practiced has been mastered . The same is true for the tempo used in executing the sight reading . The new length is first practiced at a slow tempo , and as the proficiency increases , the tempo is increased . The use of the above methods have produced good sight readers in the field of piano , typing , etc . The average pianist and typist ( professional in both cases ! ) are proficient at sight reading in their field . This is true not only of professional pianists . The good pianist always reads ahead of her playing just as the good typist reads ahead of her typing . Liszt was an outstanding master sight reader at the piano ; he could read as much as twelve measures ahead of his playing . This called for exceptional momentary memory as well as excellent habit and reflex patterns . It also called for thinking in terms of lengthy patterns . That is a prink essential iu any sight reading , to think in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stated as follows : " Do not execute pattern number 1 , until you have pattern 2 in your mind and you know how you are going to execute it . As you finish executing pattern 1 , get the image of pattern 3 in your mind , etc . " The two principles underlying sight-reading are : ( 1 ) think in patterns , and ( 2 ) never execute a pattern until the next pattern is prepared mentally for execution . 18 . Muscular Memory Pattern concept is an ingredient in developing muscular memory as well as sight reading capacities . Muscular memory is the ability to execute a motion pattern without conscious control . Most people tie their shoe laces with muscle memory . When an individual ties a shoe lace without looking at the action or thinking about the manipulations involved , that is done by muscle memory . Skilled sewing machine operation depends on good sight reading and muscle memory capacities . It is necessary to differentiate between skill and craftsmanship at this time . Skill is the ability to execute a unit of activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . The element of time is an important ingredient in defining the  | term " skill " for work production purposes . Craftsmanship is the ability to execute a unit of activity with given quality standards . The term craftsmanship does not contain the element of time . Skill is craftsmanship per unit time . A high degree of muscle memory is a requisite for quick sight reading . The less time the person needs to think about executing the motion pattern of the present and the immediate future , the more time the individual has to devote for planning the execution of the pattern in the more distant future . To become a skilled sewing machine operator , one must develop high capacities of time sense ( rhythm and tempo ) , muscle memory and sight reading with respect to sewing manipulations and situations . 19 . General Mental Fitness A person can be a highly skilled operator and yet be highly undesirable as a sewing machine operator . The operator of today must have the temperament , character , and attitudes which are prerequisite for team membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not solo or virtuoso effort . The operator must be able to work harmoniously with her colleagues and supervisors as well as the machine , materials , and physical conditions of space , sound , light , and temperature that surround the occupation . An operator who possesses little inclination to compromise , cooperate , and to follow instructions , will tend to lower the production capacity of those with whom she must coordinate her sewing . People who are quick to argue vulgarly , or fight , are undesirable as operators . Any production man who keeps hourly production records is well aware of the loss of production throughout an entire group of operators due to a momentary passionate argument between two members of the group . The loss , unfortunately , is more than momentary . The loss will be as great as 35% for a two-hour period after the argument is over . The general attributes an operator should possess are regularity , punctuality , a desire for repetitive work , precision , speed , and making things with her hands .  | 20 . Training Sewing Machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to swim is to toss the learner off a pier into deep water . Still others maintain that dropping a nonswimmer into deep water is a good method provided the individual has been told to kick his legs and flay away with his arms as soon as he hits water . The trainee must either sink or swim . Fortunately for the nation , and for many an individual , neither of these educational practices is a popular one . Some factories use the second method for training operators . The prospective operator is put at a machine and then told to do this or that and then the other thing . In due time a good or bad operator is developed . Good operators are developed in spite of , and not because of , this method . Telling is not teaching . Telling is merely the process of stating a phrase . Teaching is the process of communicating an awareness which the receiver utilizes for some function . If the receiver of the statement or demonstration does not receive and use the giver 's awareness , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " why " is often more important than the " how " or " what . " All rules , regulations , and principles must be correctly interpreted and modulated for the ever present exceptions and individual dif ferences . The " why " points the way to proper interpretation and modulation . The trainee first must be given the awareness that every muscular activity , such as sewing machine operation , calls for mental activity ( thinking ) as well as physical activity ( motion ) . External doing is the result of either the presence or absence of thought control . The better the thought control , the better the execution . The instructor must strive to : ( 1 ) remove fears and emotional blocks of sewing , and ( 2 ) develop reasoning power with regard to sewing . 21 . Gaining the Trainee 's Confidence In order to do this the instructor must win the respect and confidence of the trainee . This can be accomplished by : ( 1 ) using a quiet , friendly tone of voice when speaking to the trainee at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terms suit-  | able to her level ; do not use language above or below her ; ( 3 ) giving the trainee only as much as she needs for the immediate situation ; if she is not going to use the information immediately , do not present it ; ( 4 ) giving the trainee only as much as she can assimilate mentally or handle successfully at one time ; and ( 5 ) making the trainee aware of each measure of success no matter how slight it may be . The general pattern of the training program is similar to the accepted pattern used for training someone to swim . In teaching ( beginners how to swim , one first teaches the student how to breathe . How to float , kick , and the arm stroke is taught in later periods . ( Some teach the use of the arms before kicking . That depends on the school of thought . ) After the student has acquired a semblance of proficiency in the first phase , he is int roduced to the second phase . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coordinate phases 1 and 2 . This is followed by phase 3 which is in turn followed by the coordination of phase 3 with phases 1 and 2 . The process continues until the whole has been mastered . The student is introduced to the elementary concepts of tempo , rhythm , and kinesiology in his first phase . These concepts are developed throughout the succeeding instructional periods . This gradual approach utilizes the 3rd and 4th principles of the five principles needed for gaining i lie trainee 's confidence . 22 . The General Training Program The general program for teaching sewing machine operation should be as follows : ( 1 ) elementary mechanical principles of the sewing machine and its parts ; ( 2 ) power control : transmission , treadle , foot ; ( 3 ) fabric and thread awareness : identification and working properties ; ( 4 ) work cycle : pick-up position , sew ( phase 3 ) ; ( 5 ) threading ( also bobbin winding for 300 stitch class machines ) ; ( 6 ) stitching regulation and unlocking : quality factors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 8 ) angle stitching ; ( 9 ) curve stitching ; ( 10 ) concentric stitching : tubular form ; ( 11 ) tacking ( 301 and 304 stitches ) ; ( 12 ) four-phase work cycle ; ( 13 ) seaming : quality evaluation ; ( 14 ) straight seams : grain varia-  | Figure tions , seam guides ; ( 15 ) curved seams : grain variations and curve variations ; ( 16 ) angular seams : grain and angle variations ; and ( 17 ) live-phase work cycles . ( Sec Figs . VI-4 and VI-5. ) 23 . The Specific Training Program The specific training program will depend on the degree of versatility the management . wishes the trainee to have . For example , the management of the factory may desire to use the trainee for simple stitching operations and not for any seaming operations . There would be no need in that case to include steps 13 to 16 . Steps 11 , 12 , and 17 would be presented only when needed . By the same token steps 8 , 9 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to work at straight stitching . A simple awareness of the elementary mechanical principles of sewing machines and the following machine parts should be Figure  | presented as soon as the trainee is seated at the machine . This should not take longer than 10 to 15 minutes . This should be enough for the trainee to identify the following : ( 1 ) the head pulley ( and hand wheel if the machine has a separate hand wheel ) ; ( 2 ) the needle bar , and needle ; ( 3 ) the presser-foot bar , presser-foot , feed-dog and presser-foot controls ; and ( 4 ) the machine bed , throat plate , feed-dog , and needle hole in the throat plate . This should be followed by a word of explanation of the power control system used for the machine ( single motor or shaft drive ) . The instructor should then explain and demonstrate how to control the machine action with the use of the power treadle . 24 . Developing Power Control One of two control methods may be presented to the operator ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one foot power control . One foot has more than enough strength to depress the foot treadle ( approximately only 5 lbs . is necessary to depress the foot treadle ) . If the trainee uses two feet , the trainee has the additional mental burden of coordinating both feet . Presser-foot lift is controlled by right knee or foot action . Most machines , especially 301 and 304 stitch machines have knee manipulators for presser-foot lift control . It is easier to control and coordinate the power and presser-foot lift with the right foot than with the action of both feet , left foot for power control and right foot for knee manipulation . The ball of the foot should be placed on the upper end of the treadle . This position gives maximum leverage with minimum exertion ( minimum antagonistic action ) . The trainee should practice controlling the speed of the machine . The presser foot should be set in a raised position during this drill to prevent the feed-dog from contacting the under surface ( sole ) of the presser foot . Care should be taken not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar should not contact the presser foot at the end of its downward stroke . The trainee should aim to control the machine action with a slow , uniform speed . The speed should be as slow as possible .  | If possible , the trainee should operate the machine slow enough to count the needle strokes . The slower and more uniform the speed , the greater the control the trainee has over the machine velocity . The trainee should aim to develop the ability to accelerate and decelerate the machine velocity slowly and uniformly . A good chauffeur who can accelerate and decelerate a car smoothly , can keep his car going for long stretches at slow uniform low gear speed such as 5 miles an hour . The machine speed increases as the upper treadle edge is depressed . For example , the treadle on a 301 stitch class machine was set with the upper edge 3% " from the floor . The machine did not begin sewing until the upper edge was depressed to 37/s " from the floor . Maximum speed for the machine with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I his speed was not reached until the treadle was depressed to within 2% " of the floor . The operator of the Ina ( hint ' had a % " leeway to depress the treadle until the machine would begin to run and had % " depression to attain maximum speed . This meant that the operator had to learn to control foot extension ( and flexion ) in degrees of approximately 1/ 6 of an inch for operations requiring a wide range of accelerating and decelerating without stopping during the sew element . 25 . Developing Fabric Awareness After the trainee has acquired a small degree of proficiency in controlling the machine speed , she should be given an awareness of fabric structure and grain and the pertinent wort : ing properties of fabric she will use in the drills of step 3. -I he first power lesson and drill may last about an hour . The fabric explanation should not be more than 10 to 20 minutes . Presete a uniform batch of rectangular pieces of plain woven pieces approximately 9 " to 7 " ( warp or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill with the use of this fabric . The trainee should now focus her attention on the speed with which the fabric feeds under the presser foot ; she should not Joni on the needle during the drill ! In order to develop sight read ing capacity , she must learn to see the sequence leading up to the sewing point and not just the sewing point !  | 26 . Developing Sewing Sight Reading The machine is still without thread during the power drill with fabric awareness . This drill should be done with the use of a large size needle , a size which will leave visible needle holes in the fabric . The trainee " stitches " these pieces consecutively with the three-phase work cycle and uses the right outsize edge of the presser foot as the guide edge for the stitching . The first line stitched in each piece will be parallel to the right-hand edge of the presser foot . The second row of " stitching " in the pieces will be parallel to the first " stitching " row . To obtain this precision the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right edge of the presser foot . This type of spacing between two parallel rows of stitching is called " foot spacing . " In step 2 , power control , the trainee developed an awareness of tempo and rhythm at the sewing machine . In step 4 of a threephase work cycle , the trainee continues the power drill with the introduction of a new phenomena , sight reading . The trainee practices sight reading and coordination of this simple foot space drill ( without thread ! ) , a three-phase work cycle . The trainee must be made aware of the fact that practice is valueless if the correct form is not used . Muscle memory ( and physical strength ) is developed by proper repetition . The repetition is not good practice unless it is executed with proper muscular coordination , relaxation , and uniform movement with fluent rhythm patterns . The trainee should be taught the principles about tempo , rhythm , and sight reading in the light of her past , personal experiences regardless of whether they are swimming , dancing , playing a musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trainee will give the scope and depth of her past motor activities and hobbies . Awareness results from the cv , iluation and transfer of past or present experience . The use of any pertinent analysis the trainee has made , or , awareness the t i . i i nee has had in the past , will go a long way in accelerating the learning process . Reference should be made to the similarities 4of the motor activities in sewing machine operation to those of 1 he trainee 's favorite avocational pursuits .  | 27 . Developing Fabric Work Characteristic Awareness The " stitched " pieces should be inspected to determine whether or not the trainee has distorted the size or shape of the piece . If the trainee applies tension to the fabric during or before the sewing phase , the fabric will be stretched . If the trainee pushes the fabric faster than the feed speed of the machine , the fabric may tend to pinch or gather . The operator may have to guide the fabric in this drill by moving her hand ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric ) with the moving fabric at the same speed the fabric is being moved by the machine feed . The guide hand(s) should release the end of the fabric within approximately " of the front end ( toe end ) of the presser foot . The trainee should be able to guide the fabric with only the right hand . One should refrain from giving a trainee a piece size which will prohibit the trainee front doing this ; the drill piece should not be longer than 9 " X 9 " . ' phis size enables her to pick-up and pre-position piece 2 with her left hand while her right hand is controlling the third phase , sewing of piece 3 . This is explained more fully in step 7. 28 . Developing Sewing Form The trainee should do the cycle in a relaxed manner , then she should do it with the correct rhythm ( uniform time relationships ) in the quickest tempo possible that can be executed with proper form and control . The accent at this stage should always be on conscious control . " Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master you . " After relaxation and rhythm have been acquired to a primary degree , the learner should be initiated to the fundamentals of sight reading the situation in order to coordinate actions . Coordination is actually the process of combining rhythm pa t terns ; it is a complex rhythm pattern . If the trainee has ( 1 i I ficulty maintaining even rhythm because she can not master one of the phases ( pick-up , position , or sew ) as well as the other two phases , she should be stopped to have her practice only the ? faulty phase before proceeding with practicing the entire work  | cycle . Such blocks are removed by practicing them in isolation . When isolation practice is necessary , the trainee should include the end of the preceding phase and the beginning of the succeeding phase in the isolated practice patterns . It might even be necessary to break a phase into a smaller segment and to practice one or two segments of the phase because lack of mastery of this segment ( or segments ) is the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , the motion elements at each end of the block must be included in the isolated practice in order to develop fluency over the blocked area . If the form of performance is always emphasized , the trainee will acquire the proper muscular control necessary for high quality and quantity performance . Mere telling the student which finger depresses the key and then telling the student to practice is not enough to teach typing . The same applies to the teaching of playing the piano , sewing machine operation or any other locomotive muscular activity . The student must be made aware of the factors which form the foundation of muscular control . This is based on the aforementioned premise of making the student aware of the " why " as well as the " how " and " what . " The " why " awareness should precede the presentation and practice of the " how " and " what . " These should be based on thought stimulated by " why . " Practice without thought is valueless . Practice should never be executed unconsciously or in mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accompanied at all times with an analytical , questioning thinking , alive throughout the practice . This thinking will be automatically abandoned by the conscious when the desired habit is acquired and muscle memory takes effect . If there is no thought during the movement on the action and its principles , there is no practice . Approximately an hour may be spent on the fourth step . The instructor must be alert to detect any sign of fear of the posit ion or sewing phases which may be shown by the student at this time . The student should be taught to position this rectangular piece for sewing without lifting or touching the presser  | foot . If fear manifests itself , the tempo of execution should be slowed . This permits the trainee to have greater control over the situation . We tend not to fear situations we can control easily . The exact time spent on each step will depend on the progress of the student . If the student is progressing and is still interested , it may be wise to continue the practice of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning ( a period of time in which the student shows no improvement ) the student should be introduced to the next step . The student must be advanced to the next instructional step before the student shows signs of boredom or disinterest . The instructor must guard against boredom or disinterest . We learn little when we are bored or disinterested . It is sontctinres necessary to advance the student to the next step , although she is not quite ready , iii order to give her a feeling of ' growth and success in her endeavor . Such a feeling often prevents boredom or disinterest . 29 . Developing Quality Control Awareness When step 5 , threading , is introduced , the trainee is acquainted with the following machine details : ( 1 ) the specific stitch and its quality specifications ; ( 2 ) the threading parts of the particular machine : thread grades , tensions , take-ups , the needle and its sections , loopers , bobbins , etc. ; ( 3 ) the function and general sequence of the parts ; and ( 4 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any necessary tool , such as a tweezer ) . The threading sequence is presented with a demonstration of threading the machine . After the instructor demonstrates the threading machine , the trainee should sit down at the machine and dethread and rethread the last step of the threading se quence , the needle 's eye . After repeating this 3 to 5 times , the trainee should dethread and rethread the needle 's eye and the threading step ( usually a thread guide ) preceding it . The trainee repeats the dethreading and rethreading of the last two steps of the threading sequence 3 to 5 times . The trainee continues this tactic of adding the previous threading step to this dethreading and threading process , re-  | peating each process three to five times until the entire threading sequence of the needle has been completed . The entire needle threading process is then repeated consecutively six times . By this time , the trainee can almost thread the needle sequence with muscular memory . This tactic is repeated for the other threads of the machine such as looper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 300 stitch class machine , bobbin winding should be explained and demonstrated at this point . If the trainee is being trained at a multiple needle machine , it is advisable to teach the threading of the needles at one time because the needles will usually have identical and parallel sequence . There are two major types of threading tweezers , straight and curved blade . The individual machine design dictates which is preferable , although either one may be used in most cases without loss of time . Regardless of which tweezer is used , no more than a 1h " to 1/2 " of thread should protrude from the tweezer points when the needle or looper eye is being threaded . The exact length of the protruding end will depend on the flexibility of the thread , the more flexible the thread , the less the end may protrude . If a larger end of thread protrudes , the thread end will tend to sag . This prevents the operator from inserting the thread end in the needle hole with a perpendicular thrust to the needle hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the needle hole to the scarf side . Then the tweezer is used again to grasp the thread end and to pull the thread through to the proper length for beginning the stitch . The t weezer blades should be grasped between the thumb and forefinger at approximately the middle of the blade lengths . Step 5 , threading , should include instruction in replacing needles . After the threading drill , the trainee should be taught how to do the following : ( 1 ) regulate stitch quality : size and tension , ( 2 ) unlock and extract sewed fabric , and ( 3 ) mend a broken stitch line caused by thread breakage . This is presented in step 6 . It is the student 's first actual experience of sewing fabric with the machine . This is taught with the use OI ' pieces of fabric similar to those used in step 4 . The trainee  | adjusts the machine for the required stitch size . Demonstrate the work cycle of sewing intermittent parallel foot space lines with unlocked connecting threads . The stitched lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5 " long . Although the aim of this drill is to teach the student how to unlock the machine quickly , the trainee is also practicing the past lessons : ( a ) power control ( step 2 ) and ( b ) sewing guide control ( sight reading ) with the use of the presser foot ( step 4 ) . 30 . Developing Basic Speed Concepts The next drill , step 7 , consists of foot spacing pieces of fabric 9 " long and at least 5 " wide . The trainee must sew each line without stopping during the sewing of the line . The trainee must never exceed the speed with which she can not sew the line completely without stopping . If the sewing control is poor because the fabric was not guided or controlled well , the operator must sew the line slower the next time . The trainee must learn to sight read the entire 9 " length at one time . This is possible because the operator can see the entire sewing length as soon as she positions the fabric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant of initial positioning , she is not positioning the fabric correctly for proper sewing control . In most sewing operations , the bulk of the material being sewed travels to the left of the needle , left of the seated operator . This means that for such operations as SSa seams , hems , binding , and other edge finish operations the operator will usually pick-up and position initially with the left hand and guide ( control ) the sewing with the right hand . The aim of this drill is to develop the trainee 's capacity to : ( a ) sight read a straight line stitching situation , and ( b ) execute a three-phase work cycle without stopping during the sewing phase . A third aim may be added for this drill . The trainee should be able to sew for approximately 10 minutes without stopping the machine and without making more than a ' / , inch slit ( ! ' chain ( or 1 inch , if that is more desirable ) between the . sewed pieces . This means that the trainee must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the last stitches are being sewed in the piece under the presser foot . This is actually the most preferable aim for this drill and many trainees can accomplish this if the fabric used in the drill does not have working properties that prohibit this attainment at this early stage of the training period . This capacity of sewing successive pieces with a minimum time value elapsing between successive sewing phases ( the end of the sewing phase of one piece and the beginning of sewing phase of the successive piece ) is vital to maximum production per unit time hourly , daily , weekly , etc . In an absolute sense , lost time can never be recaptured or " made up. , , The trainee should be motivated to acquire the ability to pick-up and position piece 2 with one hand while piece 1 is guided in sewing by the other hand ; the trainee should also strive to acquire this ability in all other future drills ( see Chapter IX ) . All the drills used in this learning process are real sewing jobs whose exact duplicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that any drill used is not exactly like the sewing job the operator will do is not important . What is important is that the practice drill ( or drills ) is the best means to the end , to develop a skilled operator as quickly as possible . ' l'he actual dimensions of the drill pieces should be those that will make the drill the best teaching device . The similarities in the practice operation to the actual production line operation should be shown . This will make the practice meaningful and valuable to the trainee . The trainee must always see the reason for doing something . If not , the learning pace will be slower and learning will take place in spite of , and not because of , the doing . 31 . Developing Basic Sewing Patterns In step 8 the trainee develops the capacity to sight read and c()ordinate in a situation where the sewing phase has two or more segments . The operator must stop during the sewing phase to teposition the fabric . In most single needle operations , es-  | pecially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sew the angle by repositioning the fabric while the needle is in the fabric at the apex of the angle . The fabric is pivoted around the inserted needle to the new position . The quality requirements are such that the operator must stop for repositioning . There are angular sewing operations which have quality specifications which the operator can execute without stopping the machine ( see Fig . VI-5 ) . Although most angle stitchings call for counterclockwise pivoting , the trainee should be given a drill to develop clockwise pivot concepts if that is what is needed . There are three basic types of curved sewing : concave , convex , and reciprocal . Concave curves curve into the body of the fabric ; convex curves curve away front the body of the fabric . Reciprocal curves arc generally either S or Z curves ; S curves start out as concave curves during the sewing process and finish convexly ; whereas Z curves are the reverse of ' S curves . For these drills , the fabric may be approximately 9 " X 5 " . This size permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance during the positioning phase . The trainee should not begin to sew the curve until she knows exactly how she is going to steer ( guide ) the fabric during the entire sewing phase . The curve must be sewed without a stop no matter how slow a speed is used . The trainee can master the work cycle pattern only if she can control the speed for the work cycle . If the trainee has difficulty sewing the curve at slow speeds , the depth of the curve should be reduced temporarily . The deeper or more complex the curve , the greatci must be the operator 's capacity to sight read the situation . To acquire overall mastery for curved sewing , the trainee should be given curve drills in the following sequence : con cave curves , convex curves , S curves , Z curves . The trainee must be taught how to sew curves without distorting the original values , depth and length , of the curve . In order to do this the trainee must learn to : ( I ) position the fabric ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric during the sewing phase without distorii the original yarn structural relationships iii the fabric . The  | latter is accomplished by moving the fabric with the hands ( one or both , depending on the curve and fabric size and trainee 's capacity ) during the sewing phase at the same speed the machine is feeding the fabric . The hands move with the fabric as the curve is sewed and describe a parallel contour of the curve as the curve is sewed . The sewed contour will be distorted when the following is true . I. The hand movement contour is not parallel to the cut or marked contour desired . 2 . The parallel hand movement is faster than the machine feed speed . This tends to shorten the curve 's length . 3 . The parallel movement is slower than the machine feed speed ; this lengthens and straightens the curve length . The exact distortion of the length and depth of the sewed curve varies with the relationships between : ( 1 ) hand movement and cut or marked contours , and ( 2 ) hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shape and values of the curve , the trainee must also have an awareness of the grain factor of the curve and its attendant working properties that are inherent to that particular kind of fabric ( see p. 358 ) . The cylindrical concentric stitching drill , step 10 , is used to develop the capacity to sight read and sew a line on the perimeter on a tubed item . A piece approximately 48 " X 5 " is used for the drill . The narrow ends are seamed to form a tube whose perimeter is equal to the length of the piece minus the scam width , approximately 48 " for the perimeter . When the scam is made , the ends should be joined with a foot space distance of each end protruding free from the end of the seam . This will permit the trainee to sew foot speed stitching 1 i ues concentrically around the perimeter . The objective of this drill is to develop the trainee 's capacity to reposition long or large pieces of fabric during the sewing phase without stopping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubed items . The exact size of the tube will vary with the trainee 's sewing ability at the moment . This drill also gives the trainee  | the first task of running the machine continually for comparatively long periods . If the stitch size ( 301 stitch ) of the drill is 14 stitches per inch , the foot-space width is 1/ " , the tube perimeter 50 inches with a 5% " depth , and the trainee operates the machine at approximately 1400 rpm , then the sewing phase will be approximately 10 minutes long . This is a comparatively long , continuous sewing phase . If the trainee can execute this drill at 2100 rpm , the sewing phase will have a stitching line forming 20 concentric circles around the perimeter of the tube . ) This drill develops the trainee 's capacity to reposition the fabric with one hand while guiding the sewing with the other hand . This eliminates the need for stopping a sewing phase on order to re-position ( see Chapter I X ) . 32 . Developing Back-Tacking Ability Tacking is a stitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in a seam or otherwise ) from opening ; and ( 2 ) holds two pieces of material ( cloth , braid , tape , elastic braid , buttons , etc. ) intact at one point or small area , under 1 " in length . Tacking may be a separate operation performed with any one of the many automatic stitch series machines designed especially for tacking purposes . On 301 and 304 stitch class machines , tacking may be performed as part of the operation itself . In the case of an SSa-1-301 seam , the quality specification may call for a % " tack at each end of the seam . These types of tacks are called back-tacks . There are two structural types of back-tacks ; bar tacks and pin tacks . Bar tacks are formed by superimposing 3 ( or more ) equal lengths of stitch chains on top of one another . Pin tacks are formed by superimposing 2 or more stitch links on top of each other . The length of a bar tack is equal to the number of stitches in one stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of a pin tack is equivalent to the length oI the stitch . The principles of making either 301 or 301 bar and pin tacks are the same .  | Pin tacks are made by holding the seam ( or fabric ) , at the point where the tack is required , for the instant necessary to form the desired number of superimposed stitches . This is accomplished by raising the presser foot with the knee lift when the point , where the tack is desired , is over the needle hole of the throat plate . In machines whose needles thrust perpendicularly to the throat plate , the point is directly under the needle point . The presser foot must be lifted only that fraction of an inch at which point the foot no longer presses the fabric against the feed-dog . When the presser foot does not press the fabric against the feed-dog , the feed-dog can not feed the fabric and the stitches will pile on top of each other as long as the fabric is not fed . If the ' presser foot is lifted too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presser foot by the tug of the needle thread take-up will tend to distort the tack structure . Hence , the presser foot should not be lifted higher than the height the feed-dog protrudes over the throat plate surface on the positive thrust plus the thickness of the fabric . If the feed-dog height is r/16 of an inch and the fabric(s) thickness is %iz of an inch , then the total presser-foot lift should be only I1/i4 of an inch . The operator holds the fabric(s) in place with her hand(s) ( luring the tack formation . The hand(s) acts as the presser during the tack formation . The hand(s) presses the fabric to the throat plate and not the feed-dog . This prevents the feed-dog from gripping and feeding the fabric . If the hand pressure is such that it presses the fabric to the feed-dog and-not to the throat plate , then the feed-dog will grip and feed the fabric . This will distort the tack . In bar tacking during a 301 or 304 stitch operation the presser foot . is lifted in the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The presser foot is lifted at the point where the bar-tack ends as the operator 's hands feed the fabric toward the operator for the length of the bar tack . The operator lowers the presser foot after this backtrack sewing phase , and the feeddog feeds the fabric back again over the double stitched area ,  | The bar-tack area is actually an inverted N motion with the three lines forming the inverted N superimposed on each other . No more than three superimposed stitch lines are needed to form a 301 or 304 bar tack . The quality of a bar tack is measured by length and width of the bar tack as well as the number of superimposed stitch lines forming the bar tack . The usual preference for 301 and 304 bar tack in apparel manufacturing are single stitch line width with a 1/8 to 1/. r " length . The tacking drill , step 11 , is exercised with the use of a piece of cloth approximately 9 " X 9 " which the trainee foot-spaces parallel to the warp grain ( preferable ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . This develops the trainee 's ability to construct a bar tack at any point in a sewing line . The same procedure is used to develop pill-tacking ability . It is preferable to precede pin-tack by bar tacking if the trainee must learn both . 33 . Developing Complex Sewing Patterns The four-phase work cycle , step 12 , is used in situations where the operator is required to dispose her work in a definite manner after each item is sewed ; the operator 's hand(s) removes the finished article from the machine bed or table . In the three-phase work cycle this was not necessary because gravity or some other force disposed of the sewed work . A simple SSa-1-301 seam may be made with either a two , three , or four-phase work cycle . This depends on the requirements of the production line . If it is better for seamed work to remain chained to each other the operator uses a two or three-phase work cycle . The operator may use a two or three-phase work cycle if an automatic thread cutter attachment ( see p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between consecutively sewed pieces . However , the production line cycle may require the operator to arrange each finished item , in a definite manner for the next production step , immediately after she finishes each item . This requirement gives the operator a four-phase work cycle . The sight reading and coordination of a four-phase work cycle can be taught in conjunction with the tacking drill . A batch of  | pieces approximately 9 " x 3 " may he used for this drill . The trainee stitches and tacks these pieces as in step 10 with a required disposal pattern which the trainee must use for each item as soon as it is completed . A four-phase work cycle drill does not have to be used at this time . It should be presented when needed regardless of whether it is steps 6 , 7 , etc . Step 13 consists of making the trainee aware of factors which are used to evaluate the qualities of seam(s) the trainee is going to make . Step 14 is the drill for a straight seam operation . The trainee should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing phases when the work cycle is introduced . The work cycle introduction must include an explanation of the sewing properties of the grains of the seam edges of the different fabrics and plies used in the seam if the trainee lacks this awareness . When an operator makes a seam she must do one of the following in the first phase of the operation : ( 1 ) picks up one piece , ( 2 ) picks up two pieces from the same place , ( 3 ) picks up two pieces , one from each of two different places , ( 4 ) picks up more than two pieces from one place , and ( 5 ) picks up more than two pieces from more than one place . From the standpoint of giving the trainee a good overall concept and training for making seams , the initial seam drill should be a two piece SSa-1 seam which can be made with a simple pick-up phase ; picking up both pieces from the same place at one time with one hand . The simplicity of such a pick-up will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric , ( 2 ) the size and shape of the pieces , and ( 3 ) the arrangement of the pieces at the machine . I ? f it is possible to have a choice of fabric type , size , and shape , it is recommended that the first drill be given with a plain weave , solid color ( pastel shades ) fabric approximately 9 " X 4 " with the 9 " side parallel to the warp grain . The pieces should be uniformly cut and stacked as they would be when cut by a die , or cutting machine ( see Fig . VI-6 ) . The specific working properties of the fabric with respect to pick-up will determine whether or not the stack should be tilted for a quick grasp ( hiring the pick-up phase .  | Figure The drill , step 14 , can be given with or without tacking specifications and can be executed in either a three or four-phase work cycle . The job for which the trainee is being trained will dictate the details of the drill . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved and angular seams . 34 . Curved Seaming Two-piece curved seams arc formed with one of the following combinations of contours on the scant edge of each piece : ( 1 ) concave edge seamed to another concave edge , ( 2 ) convex edge seamed to another convex edge , ( 3 ) concave edge seamed to a convex edge , ( 4 ) straight edge seamed to a convex edge , ( 5 ) straight edge seamed to a concave edge , ( 6 ) S curved edge seamed to a straight edge , ( 7 ) S curved edge seamed to a concave edge , ( 8 ) S curved edge seamed to a convex edge , ( 9 ) S curved edge seamed in superposed position with like curvature to another S curved edge , ( 10 ) Z curved edge seamed in superposed position with complementary curvature to an S curved edge , ( 11 ) Z curved edge seamed to a straight edge , ( 12 ) Z curved edge seamed to a concave edge , ( 13 ) Z curved edge seamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge seamed to another Z curved edge in superposed position with like curvature . Basic curved shapes have been shown in Fig . VI-4b . Regardless which combination of edge contours are seamed the seam operation is affected by the same set of geometric principles . These principles are : 1 . A stitching line sewed parallel to a concave edge is longer than the fabric edge . The greater the width of the parallel space between edge and stitch line , the longer the parallel stitching line to this edge .  | 2 . A stitching line sewed parallel to a convex edge is shorter than the convex edge . The greater the width of the parallel space between edge and stitch line , the shorter the stitch line . 3 . A stitching line sewed parallel to a straight edge is equal in length to the straight edge . 4 . A stitching line sewed parallel to an S curved edge is equal to the edge if the convex and concave portions of the curve have equal degrees of curvature ( equal loci ) . The same is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator makes a curved seam , she must bear in mind one or more of these principles . While making the seam , she must be aware of the relationship between stitch line and edge as well as the focus for guiding the seam and the seam 's edge . She must guide the edges of the fabrics according to the dictates of these principles . These geometric principles often make it necessary to notch curved seam edges in order to get good qualitative and quantitative sewing results . There are two kinds of sewing construction notches used for this purpose , slash notches and V notches . An SSa-1 seam formed with two symmetrically curved edges does not require any of these construction notches to facilitate the seaming operation . Sewing construction notches are not the same as sewing guide notches . The function of a sewing construction notch is to permit the proper future alignment or utility of the seam or stitching . The function of a sewing guide notch is to give the operator a point for positioning either the fabric at the notch or something to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing construction notches are placed in the , seam edges of an SSa-1 symmetrically curved seam . These notches are placed in fabric edges because they are necessary for some future sewing and/or pressing operation with which this SSa-1 seam will be processed . This permits one to butterfly the edges of this SSa-1 seam or to invert the edges between both fabric pieces or against either piece by a sewing or pressing operation ( see Fig . VI-7 ) . If one of these edge proc-  | essing operations follows the SSa-1 operation the fabric edges must have these construction notches before the sewing or pressing process places the SSa-1 in one of the aforementioned positions . These notches should be placed into the fabric edges during the cutting operation when the sewing operation can be made equally well , qualitatively and quantitatively , regardless of when the notch is made . Slash notches should be used on the following edges : ( 1 ) a concave edge when it is butterilied , folded against the body of the fabric , or seamed to a straight or convex edge ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seamed to a convex edge or shaped ( by pressing or sewing ) into a convex contour . V notches should be used on the following edges : ( 1 ) convex edge when the edge is butterflied , or folded against ( or towards ) the body of its fabric , or folded against any other fabric regardless of the contour of the other fabric ; and ( 2 ) a straight fabric edge when the edge will be shaped concavely ( see Fig . VI-8 which illustrates the construction notches as used in the various situations ) . The number of construction notches per linear inch or the length of the notches ( slash or V ) and the base of the V notches must be increased when the following dimensions are increased : ( 1 ) the degree of curvature of the edge , ( 2 ) the seam allowance width , and ( 3 ) the fabric thickness . Quality specifications control the size and number of construction notches used in a seam . If the notches are for a future shaping operation , sewing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within %o " of the stitch line , ( a ) ( b ) Fig . VI-7 ( a ) Butterflied SSa-1 scam , ( b ) Inverted SSa-1 seam .  | Figure then the construction notches should be made after the seaming operation . Sewing construction slash notches should be cut in seam allowances of SSa-1 seams before the seaming operation when one of the following curved seams have relatively sharp degrees of curvature : ( 1 ) the seam of a concave or straight edge piece seamed to a convex edge slash notch the concave or straight edge ; and ( 2 ) the seam of a straight edge piece seamed to a convex edge ? slash the straight edge . When such seams are sewed , the slashed edge should be placed on top of the unslashed edge whenever possible . This permits the operator to see both scam edges during the operation . The operator should guide the unslashed edge ( the bottom fabric ) while she manipulates the top fabric with the notches to permit each slash to spread as the seam is made . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the operator can easily sight read the notches and manipulate the notched edge without stopping the sewing phase .  | 35 . Mathematics of Construction Notch Placement The correct amount and location of construction notches in a curved seam let-out can be determined with either simple mathematical formulas or geometric constructions . The formulas are based on the application of geometric principles governing the locus of curved lines . Let us assume that in the garment segment in Fig . VI-9 AB is a concave curved line which is the arc of a circle . If an SSa-1 seam 1/4 " wide is made parallel to the AB edge , the edge AB must be rotated 180 ? and located at A'B ' in order to be a perfectly butterflied seam . The difference of A'B ' AB is equal Figure to the total distance the slash notches in AB must spread to permit butterflying without fabric torsion . If the radius of AB is 7 " , the perimeter of the AB circle is 44 " . The radius of the A'B ' circle is 71/2 " and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A'B ' is equal to the ratio of the two perimeters . Hence , AB/A'B ' = 14r/15r This means that every 14 inches on AB must spread to 15 inches before AB is equal to A'B ' . If only one slash were made in 14 inches , the base of the triangle formed by the butterflied slash would have to be one inch . This is impossible because the sides of the triangle , the slash notch edges , are only % " . This shows  | that regardless of the fabric characteristics , this seam will need at least three slash notches in order to butterfly 180 ? without objectionable seam torsion . A curved seam let-out will butterfly 180 ? without objectionable seam torsion if the curve is a close approximate to the chord that subtends the curve . For butterflying purposes , an arc is approximately a straight line when the altitude from the arc to its subtending chord is less than 1/s " . This distance varies with the fabric thickness and torsion characteristic . The distance between slashes is determined by the equation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any subtending chord is : subtending chord = 2 v r2 ? ( r ? chord altitude ) 2 Actually , curved edges such as AB will never butterfly onto A'B ' , no matter how many slashes are made . An inspection of Fig . VI-9 will show this is impossible topologically . The butterflied edge AB rests slightly below the A'B ' line . However , since the distance between slashes can be determined faster by construction instead of calculation , only the construction method will be presented here . A straight edge is placed on the arc in a position which subtends the arc when the straight edge has the proper chord altitude . The intersection points denote the slash locations . II the arc is a parabolic or hyperbolic curve , the slash placements sometimes can be located easier by placing the straight edge on the exterior sides of the arms of the curve . The first point at the maximum tolerance from tangency ( i/8 " ) is the place for the first slash notch . This process of tangent construction is continued around the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very simple matter to teach an operator how to de1 ermine the minimum number of slashes , and the proper placeIuent , if for some reason the operator must determine slash placement . The correct number and placement of the slash notches , as well as the method for making the slashes , should be determined by management and taught to the operator . This prevents  | any production time or quality loss due to excessive or improper slash notch placement resulting from the average operator 's " guess " method of notch placement . The same principles used for the placement of slash notches on concave letouts can be applied to all straight , concave , or convex let-outs regardless of whether slash or V notches are required . This applies to hems as well as seams . This principle is elaborated in Chapter III , " Apparel Design , " because it is an important principle in calculating curvature tolerance in pattern design . 36 . Angular Seaming There are eight kinds of two piece angular SSa-1 seams : ( 1 ) parallel equal exterior angle seam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) Figure angle seam , ( 3 ) parallel unequal exterior angle seam , ( 4 ) parallel unequal interior angle seam , ( 5 ) interlocking equal angular seam , ( 6 ) interlocking unequal angular seam , ( 7 ) seam made with a straight edge and an exterior angular edge , and ( 8 ) seam made with a straight edge and an interior angular edge ( see Fig . VI-10 ) . ( To these one can add seams made by joining angular and curved edges . ) Specific geometric principles govern the notching and trimming of seam allowances for angled edges . These principles arc somewhat similar to those governing the notching of curved SSa-1 seams . They are as follows : 1 . A stitching line sewed parallel to an interior angle edge is longer than its parallel edge .  | 2 . A stitching line sewed parallel to an exterior angle edge is shorter than its parallel edge . 3 . The smaller the angle , the greater the difference between the stitching line and the parallel edge of the angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaming operation . Some interior angle seams , SSa-101 , 301 , or 401 , must sometimes be slash notched to within i/ls inch of the angle apex after the seaming operation , if the seam is going to be turned inside out and the seam allowance is more than 1/16 to an 7/g of an inch . The same is also true if the sewed piece or seam allowance must be rotated or folded around the seam ( stitching ) lines . The slash size measurement varies with the angle size and the fabric thickness . The smaller the angle and the thicker the fabric , the closer the slash end must approach the vertex of the sewing angle . Similar SSa-1 exterior angles have to be trimmed ( the seam allowance ) at the apex after seaming , if the seam is to be turned inside out . The depth of trimming depends on the angle size , fabric thickness , and quality specification . Special trimming machines are usually used to trim exterior angles ; this is a very common operation used in the making of pointed collars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned angular seams can sometimes be avoided if narrow seam allowances are used . This is why some 301 and 401 stitch class machines are made with seam allowance edge trimming knives . These machines produce high quality seams with even 1/16 , %2 , % , etc. inch seam alI owances . When two unequal exterior angles are sewed together with an SSa-1 seam , the seam should be sewed with the larger angle on bottom against the machine bed whenever possible . The presence of a smaller angle on top against the presser foot gives i he operator a better sight reading situation . If there is a great size difference between the two angles and the pieces are bulky , I he operator will get better results by reversing the placements because the operator can not either : ( 1 ) encompass the larger angle quickly with the smaller angle when she repositions at the  | angle apex ; or ( 2 ) the smaller angle is too small to encompass the larger angle and still permit both seam edges to be parallel underneath the presser foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine bed , when two superposed unequal interior angles are seamed ( SSa-1 ) together . In this case the smaller angle must be notched ( slash ) to within approximately i/1s " of the stitching line before the apex is reached in the sewing operation . The notch is made either before the operator receives the pieces for seaming or it is made by the operator during the sewing phase . If possible , it is better to do the notching on the cutting table during the cutting processing . As to whether or not it can be done on the cutting table depends on the sum total of the following four factors : ( 1 ) the texture of the fabric ( will the notch lengthen easily ? ) ; ( 2 ) the critter 's ability ( how accurate is his notching ? ) ; ( 3 ) the handling the piece receives during the time it . leaves the cutting table and the time it arrives at the operator 's hand ( will the handling distort or lengthen the notch ? ) ; and ( 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece until the notch is reached without lengthening or distorting the notch ? ) . When parallel exterior angle SSa-1 seams are sewed , the operator can sew either off the angle edge at the apex and reposition ( see Fig . VI-5 ) , or the operator can keep the needle inserted at the apex and pivot ( rotate ) the fabrics around the needle to the new position . In parallel interior angular SSa-1 seams the operator has no choice ; she must pivot the fabrics around the needle when the needle is inserted at the angle apex . If possible , the exterior angle should be on bottom against the machine bed when an interlocking angular SSa-1 seam is made with either equal or unequal interior and exterior angles . The interior angle must he notched at the apex before the pieces are prepositioned at the apex . ' the same four factors that govern the notching of the sanaller of Iro lo ; nallel unequal angles in an SSa-I seam , govt an this situation ( u e , ab ? a ? t . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot seaming ; all interior angles ; the  | needle must be inserted in the angle apex and the pieces must be rotated around the needle to the new sewing position in order to get maximum precision for angle quality . When an SSa-1 seam is sewed with a straight edge and an exterior angular edge , the angular edge should be on bottom against the machine bed and the straight edge should be on top against the presser foot sole . The seam allowance of the straight edge must be slash-notched to within /i , , " of the stitching ' line at the point where the apex of the angular seam will be on the stitching line of the straight-edged piece . This slash permits complete vision and manipulation freedom for repositioning the pieces at the apex . The opposite procedure should be used for sewing SSa-1 seams with a straight-edge piece and in interior edge piece . The straight edge should be on bottom against the machine bed , and the interior angle should be on top against the presser foot . In this case , the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apex of the stitching line . The straight piece is not slash notched . It should be obvious by now that there are two basic rules for seaming angular and curved SSa-1 seams which are actually alike . These theorems may he restated as follows : 1 . The piece whose seam allowance edge is shorter should be positioned on top against the presser foot . The longer seam allowance edge is on bottom against the machine bed . 2 . The piece whose seam allowance edge is shorter must be slash notched to within approximately %s " ? of the stitching line . If the operator follows these two basic rules whenever the situation permits , the operator will perform with better precision , in less time , and with less mental and physical effort . This is so , because she always will have the pieces in a position which enables her to : ( 1 ) see and sight read the operation better , ( 2 ) manipulate minimum amounts of fabric through minimum dislance in order to guide and/or reposition the seam edges . 37 . Five-Phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , appIicluc , welt pocket , bound buttonhole , etc. operations . Any one of these operations can be used to develop five-phase work  | cycle coordination . The drill that is chosen should have precision requirements equal to the job for which the operator is being trained . Bound buttonhole operations require one of the greatest degrees ( if not the greatest ) of five-phase operating precision when these operations are not made on automatic stitch series machines . Although the Reece and Singer sewing machine companies have automatic machines for producing bound buttonholes and piped pockets in one operation , some firms still find it best to use man-paced 301 stitch machines for these jobs . This applies to firms making small quantities of such jobs and those making pockets and buttonholes with curved or angular pipings or welts . This is therefore a very effective drill for developing high precision in a five-phase cycle . The amount of fabric needed for the drill is very small . It is recommended that this drill consist . of sets of parallel bound buttonholes sewed parallel to the filling grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 " . Begin the operator with large buttonholes , both length and width at first , if necessary , and then increase the precision requirements by decreasing the length and width of the buttonhole as the operation improves . If the operator is going to work at sewing bound buttonholes ( or some other similar operation ) on a bias or cross grain , by all means give the drill on that grain . This approach should be used for training slash pocket and precise short length five-phase operations . The details of a drill should always duplicate or approximately duplicate the operation the trainee is being trained to perform . When the operator lacks the capacity to grasp all the details efficiently in one drill , the learning process should be broken up into a group of drills ( steps ) each of which prepares the trainee to grasp more easily the additional concept of the successive drill . The completion of the last drill in the sequence gives the trainee the required operation capacity . Although SSa-1 seam drills were used to illustrate the basic principles involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following types of operations ( or others ) should be used as the drill instead of the stitching or SSa-I presented here ,  | whenever this operation is what the trainee is being trained to do : ( 1 ) lap seam , including stripping operations , etc. ; ( 2 ) bound seams ; ( 3 ) flat seams ; ( 4 ) superimposed seams ( other than SSa-l ) ; ( 5 ) stitchings : darts , tucks , pleats , gathering , etc. ; and ( 6 ) patch pockets and appliques . The basic principles of pick-up , positioning , guiding , and repositioning during the sewing phase , extraction , and disposal will be the same with respect to : ( 1 ) the geometric line of the sewing operation and the fabric ; and ( 2 ) the fabric construction , working properties and the sewing grain line . This holds true regardless of what the details of the drill are . 38 . Factory Training Policies The factory training methods are usually determined by the size , purpose , and personnel problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training programs which they are constantly striving to improve , the average factory , both small and large , attempts to train its beginners via the section system method of production . The beginner usually is introduced to the machine , and is shown ( not taught ! ) how to start and stop the machine . The trainee then is shown how to stitch straight lines or how to make a simple seam . After a few hours of practice of this minute operation , the student is given a section of work to do , which is the same operation she just practiced . The trainee is cautioned as to the quality desired and from there on out she is on her own . Any proficiency of speed the student acquires is the result of personal trial and error , diligence , and luck . The training situation is largely a matter of " monkey see , monkey does " ; there is rarely a cognizance of why or wherefore . If the factory is organized on a highly sectional basis , the trainee remains at this task until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another urgent operation . Most often , the trainee is given the work which is required momentarily for total factory production . Any growth as to quantity of sectional skills ( operation versatility ) is purely incidental ; it actually occurs after the factory necessity demands it . As to whether the student is taught the principles of stitch  | tension and size , needle , feeder adjustment , etc. will depend on management policy . In many factories the trainee is not shown how to do these things . Usually , the larger the factory , the less the chance of learning because there is a tendency among some floor supervisors and machinists not to teach their operators certain essentials . This is true of the foreman or forelady who feels that the less the average operator knows about such things , the more they ( foremen ) are needed , the better chance they have of keeping their jobs . Another of their thoughts is , the less the operator knows , the less competition for the foreman 's job . This is not true in the average small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the " inside " man ( foreman or superintendent ) . Ile knows that it is to the economic advantage of the factory for every operator to know as much as possible about machine adjustments , work manipulations , etc . He will see to it that the operator learns these things as soon as possible . This type of factory manager will often try to develop the creative capacity of every operator to formulate better operation methods . He develops a mind and does not merely mold a monkey . He is aware of the fact that the mind controls the motion and that one gets better results in the latter by first developing the former . However , there are some proprietors and foremen who feel that their operators may leave them for greener pastures if they become versatile . These supervisors strive to train the operator thoroughly in a narrow dimension . The less the versatility of the operator , the less the possibility of her finding other employment . If the factory , small or large , is run on the whole garment system , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible in order to increase her versatility for future needs . The amount and type of operation taught will be determined by the simplest garment the beginner will make first . After the beginner learns these operations , she will begin making this first garment type . The same procedure is used to train an " inexperienced " operator , one who can perform some of the required operations . The momentary state of affairs in the individual  | factory ( whole garment system ) determines how much the operator will learn re : ( 1 ) sewing manipulation and garment assembly , and ( 2 ) machine adjustments and regulation . The proficiency of the learning situation in either the whole garment or section factory depends on the thinking and attitudes of the supervisor managing the factory . During World War II , some of the large factories found it necessary to organize classes and training programs , because there was a severe shortage of labor and a high rate of turnover . It was very urgent to have maximum production because if you sewed it , you sold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginner to reach a good production capacity as soon as possible . Some organized teaching programs taught the beginners the principles of minor machine adjustments ( stitch size , tension , etc. ) , and the principles of motion and time economy with respect to power sewing . The individual factory policy determined the scope of the program for its students . 39 . Training in Large Industrial Establishments Large industrial establishments , factories which employ hundreds of operators can easily afford to inaugurate a training program similar to the training program presented in this chapter . Information sheets with ample visual aids may be distributed to the beginners for them to peruse at home . The training groups ( or individuals ) should not be placed in the regular assembly lines or the factory proper until the degree of skill acquired warrants it . The basic training should take place away from the regular assembly line(s) . The size of the training group should be determined by the optimum turnover rate of operafor personnel management desires . The emphasis in the training group ( or classes ) should always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good muscular control , i.e. , relaxation , rhythm , coordination , and sight reading . Skill ( speed ; in ( 1 quality ) will come automatically with the aforementioned type of adherence necessary in practice and drill . The section work system definitely should be used for the training .  | The whole garment system is detrimental to the acquisition of skill when used as an instrument of training . This is true , regardless of whether the training takes place in a vocational school ( public or private ) or in an industrial establishment . The whole garment system presents too much of a mental bite for a beginner . The manipulation pattern is too varied and complex for the formations of relaxation , rhythm , coordination , and sight reading habits in the beginner . Using the whole garment system for the beginner in power sewing operation is analogous to starting a beginner in piano on a Brahms piano concerto . 40 . Training in Small Industrial Establishments Expediency governs the training program to be used by the small industrial establishment . Although small establishments can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the desired program in principle . The presentation of principles on machines , materials , and time and motion study , should be reduced to the baarest essentials necessary for immediate performance at the easiest operation it is possible to give the beginner . Principles governing sequence of garment construction should not be presented at all , until the operator has manipulation skill , and it is necessary to begin the operator on the whole garment system ( assuming the proprietor insists on this production method ) . The emphasis should be placed on the factors governing speed of muscular manipulation , fatigue , and the impairment of muscular activity . This should be applied to the repeated practice and drill of the initial operation presented and to any other subsequent operations given to the operator . This should continue until the operator has basic " good form " and can apply that " good form " immediately to any operation as it is presented . 41 . Public Schools for Developing Operators For the benefit of the community , the individual ( sewing operator ) , and the garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should receive their train-  | ing in public iocational schools , just as typists receive their training there . In a recent interview a New York City garment manufacturer stated that his training cost , due to labor turnover , was $3000 for the past year . He based his figures on the amount of money he had to pay new employees who failed to produce enough to earn minimum wages during their learning periods . This manufacturer was surprised to learn later that his loss due to labor turnover was much greater than $3000 . He had failed to include the additional rent , power , supervisory and capitalization charges that increased per unit with each decrease of production per unit time . He also failed to include the loss of sales due to late production . These failures to meet due dates caused some heavy cancellations . There were extraordinary losses accrued from rejected garments which were made by the new employees during their training periods . After all these facts had been presented to the manufacturer , he saw that the cost of labor turnover was many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of replacement is difficult now in some branches and areas of the needle industry and in years to come it may be acute due to the competition for labor from defense and other industries . The cost for training an operator varies from approximately $250 to $750 . This cost could be reduced to almost zero if the industry could employ graduate high-school students who are skilled operators . No employer , in an office , would think of hiring someone for a typist 's position , who did not know how to type . No employer would think of taking a non-typist and then teaching her how to type . Therefore , the same should apply in many areas , considering the number of sewing operator jobs in the community . 42 . Community Responsibility It is not necessary to train typists on the job because the school systems , public and private , are taking care of the situation . The same should be true with respect to the teaching of sewing machine operators . It should be a community and pub-  | lic school function , administered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be of such a nature so as to enable the graduating student " to earn her keep " within her first two weeks on the job as an operator . If the school program can not do the same for the prospective sewing machine operator as it does for the prospective typist , then the educational program for training sewing machine operators is not as meritorious as the one for training typists . As to whether or not the community Board of Education inaugurates an educational program which trains sewing machine operators will depend in large measure on the wishes of the needle industries in the community . The manner and efficiency in which any such program is carried out 1vill also be correlated to the desires , interest , and cooperation of these apparel and allied factories . It is recommended here that this educational program be offered to day high school students as a part of their regular high school curriculum as well as to adults during the day or evening . This program should not be offered below high-school level or to students , adults , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for efficient sewing machine operation . 43 . The Public School Philosophy A school program is either an educational or a training program . Education is not synonymous with training . Training is measured merely by the ability to perform a prescribed " how . " Education is measured by the abilities to : ( 1 ) perform a prescribed " how , " and ( 2 ) develop modulations for the " how " pattern when changes become necessary . The educated individual can create a desirable performance pattern as well as execute it , whereas the trained person is capable only of executing the prescribed task . Every individual can be creative in his own measure . Even birds and insects are creative in a limited manner . Ant hills , bee hives , and bird nests are examples of the limited creativeness of birds and insects . The function of education is to give  | one the capacity to create to the limit of his innate ability . The goal of training is to develop a robot regardless of the individual 's creative potential . Obviously , facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the individual must be trained and be able to handle new problems without further formal schooling . 44 . The Public School Curriculum The proper public program can develop better operators in less machine hours than the average training program in a factory . The average factory training program keeps the trainee at the machine comparatively constantly for the length of the work day , be it 7 hours or 8 hours per day , five days a week . The public school program would keep the student at the machine from 1 to 2 hours daily , five days per week . This is the preferable practice schedule . The student must spend a maximum amount of time sewing at the machine . There should not be any lost waiting time . When the student is not learning independently at the sewing machine , the student should be participating in some class lesson session . During a learning period one can learn more by using a schedule calling for comparatively shorter and more sessions than comparatively less and longer sessions . For , example , a trainee can acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice schedule consisting of 100 two-hour practice sessions taken once daily five times a week for 20 consecutive weeks than in a 200 hour schedule of 25 eight-hour training sessions taken once daily five times a week for 5 weeks . It is for this reason that a high school with the proper educational program can develop a skilled sewing machine operator , without having the student devote more than 2 hours to sewing machine operation during her ( his ) any day of her stay in high school . The curriculum for developing sewing machine operators should include the following content and sequence : 1 . The sewing machine a . Principle of stitch formation and regulation ( including power control ! )  | b . Principles of maintenance ( necessary to the efficient operator oiling , changing the needle , cleaning , minor adjustment , etc. ) c . Principles of setting temporary attachments 2 . Principles of time and motion study a . Basic movements b . Motion economy re : amount of motions c . Motion economy re : length of motions d . Motion economy re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Principles of muscular control and muscle fatigue a . For relaxation ? physiological and psychological b . For rhythm-physiological and psychological c . For coordination ? physiological and psychological d . For sight-reading ? physiological and psychological 4 . Analysis of materials used a . Physical working properties b . Machine and hand adjustments 5 . Principles governing sequence in garment construction a . Re : the machine used b . Relative time evaluation with respect to sequence position in construction c . Draping principles affected by sewing d . Finishing principles affected by sewing 45 . The Function of Public School Education The aforementioned items should not be taught as isolated subjects that are related only to the activity of sewing machine operation . The program should use the vocational goal as the vehicle for educating the individual . The success of the educational program must be measured in part by the student 's ability to apply the basic principles in other o , cupations and vocational areas . It is only such an approach that will prepare a student properly for future industrial changes . This approach will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now takes place in evening schools . Emphasis should be placed on developthe awareness of " why . " The student must realize these two basic premises : ( 1 ) all types of apparel and allied construction are governed by the same fundamental principles ; and ( 2 ) there is a fundamental set of principles which governs all vocational and avocational activity . The prevalent educational approach for teaching Chemistry p 391 and Physics is to develop the basic principles and then show the applications in various industrial activities . Practically all of these basic principles can be developed by analyzing the problems within the boundaries of any one industry . The particular industrial activity should be used as a means of educating the individual for any vocational and avocational pursuit . This concept applies to all school curricula regardless of whether one of their individual goals is to develop sewing machine operators , typists , beauticians , machinists , carpenters , or electricians . This approach develops a better sewing machine operator , etc . It may be that a great deal of the curriculum can and should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers of these classes have a basic , demonstrable , working knowledge of the vocation(s) on which the curriculum is based . The rate and approach of presenting the curriculum will vary with the innate ability , fundamental curiosity , and motivating drive of the average student for whom the curriculum is constructed as well as the ability and drive of the classroom teacher . A sound educational program will not permit the student to see each type and kind of sewing machine as something totally unrelated and different from other types of machines , sewing and otherwise . The principle should be given priority " and predominance over the rule whenever possible . All crafts have a common ground in time and motion study as well as in Physics , Mathematics , and other sciences . The daily machine practice sessions should emphasize the means more t Ilan the ends . ( If the means are adequate , the ends will be attained . ) The form of the sewing or muscular activity for attaining the end product is more important than the end product ( the garment ) itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and practice session to be similar to a section system . The student should not be taught the principles for making a garment with the whole garment system u n t i l he has displayed a sound comprehension of basic princi-  | pies as well as proficiency in various sectional sewing operations . This is important from the standpoint of education and individual and community economic welfare . 46 . Labor Union Policy Section work was used formerly only in the low price ranges of mass produced apparel . Now , section work is replacing the whole garment system in the higher price ranges . This trend will increase in pace regardless of whether or not educated operators are made available to the industry . The welfare of the community and industry make this change necessary . An excellent indication of this trend is the fact that the various apparel unions are encouraging and assisting in inaugurating the section system in garment factories wherever possible . The unions encourage this trend because they believe this policy to be vital for the ultimate welfare of the operator , entrepreneur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Education Learning is a comparatively slow process which must be approached scientifically , with cause and effect applications if good results are to be derived from the process . The average industrial establishment does not have the time to teach the use of the basic tools of life , the three R 's ( reading , ' riting , and ' rithmetic ) , therefore , this is done in the public schools . Our pattern of life has changed to the extent where it is now advisable ( and soon it will be imperative ! ) for the community to accept the responsibility of teaching the essentials controlling the three R 's necessary for all productive muscular activity such as power sewing operation , typing , etc . These twentieth century three R 's may be called " relaxation , rhythm , and reading " ( sigh t reading motion concepts for proper motion coordination ) . Mo tion , time , and proper awareness of machines as such play to() important a role in the average individual 's life to be neglected in the manner in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Pressing and Molding Production Analysis 1 . Definition A molding operation ( or process ) is an activity ( or group of activities ) in which heat , moisture and/or pressure is used to change the density , form , shape and/or surface structure of an apparel product or piece of fabric . " Pressing , " " sponging , " " shrinking , " " decating , " " pleating , " " blocking , " " mangling , " " steaming , " and " baking " are trade names for various molding processes used in the apparel and allied industries . 2 . The Function of a Molding Process Every apparel product or piece of fabric has four basic physical properties that have geometric dimensions : density , shape , form , and structure . These properties have characteristics such as elasticity , resilience , flexibility , and elongation which are measures of the dynamics of the change in the fabric 's geometric dimensions . The function of a molding process is to change either the geometric dimension or the characteristic(s) of a fabric . Shape defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometric form of the single plane formed by the fabric when it is parallel to a flat surface . Form defines the three dimensional perimeter value of the I ; ihric surface when the fabric conforms to the product requirements and the piece of fabric can not be placed parallel to a single flat plane . The approximate figure of 8 used as the pattern for one half of a baseball cover is the shape of the ball cover patt ern . The spatial perimeter value this flat pattern attains , when i t covers half the surface of the baseball , is the form the flat  | pattern ( shape ) takes on in covering the ball surface . This form , however , is only one of the forms this figure 8 shape flat pattern may take on without adding or subtracting to the plane area content of the pattern . When one either puts a crease into , or takes a crease out of fabric , the fabric is " formed . " When a molding process changes a flat surface square to a flat surface rectangle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the fabric has been changed and not its form . Shape or form changes are also those in which the dimension of either the original shape or form are altered , although the original linear design relationships are kept intact . For example , if the flat surface square was molded into a smaller or larger flat surface square , this would also be a shape change . If the baseball cover dimensions , which were fornied for a given ball perimeter , were increased or decreased symmetrically without varying the curvature relationship values of the cover , this change would also be a form change . Density is the term used here to define weight per unit volume of fabric . The draping , utility , and working characteristics , such as rigidity , flexibility , elasticity , and resiliency , of a fabric usually will vary with , or inversely to , the density factor . A molding process which alters the dimensions of a fabric 's ( or product 's ) shape or form may vary the durability , utility , and/or style of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process alters the density dimensions . Surface structure refers to two aspects of a fabric 's surface : ( 1 ) the linear value of the surface contour ; napped , ribbed , pebbly , smooth , piled , etc. ; and ( 2 ) the color dimensions of the surface : its hue , value , and intensity . Molding processes can vary the dimensions of fabric surfaces such as pile , napped , ribbed , or smooth . For example , the process can " pebble " a smooth surface . A molding process may either erase or increase the pebbly dimensions of a fabric original l y made with such a surface . Color dimensions may likewise he increased or decreased . The original hue may be changed t c another spectrum , or the value of the original color may be  | deepened or faded , or the intensity of the coloring may be dulled or brightened ( shined ) . Sometimes color changes in a molding process will be correlated with density , shape , form , or surface structure outline changes . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric with certain molding processes will either dull or brighten the fabric surface due to a change in density that accompanies the manner of accomplishing the change in rigidity. 3 . Elements of Molding Processes Molding processing should not be confused with cutting or sewing processing . Cutting varies a shape by cleaving , sewing varies a fabric 's shape or form by the manner of applying a series of stitches , whereas a molding process varies shape and form ( also density and surface structure ) by applying either one or more of the three basic elements that define a molding process : heat , pressure , moisture . Every molding process in apparel production must affect one or more of the four basic geometric properties of fabric with one or more of those three elements in order to be classified as a molding process . Therefore , a molding process is one which submits the fabric or garment to one of the following seven situations : ( 1 ) heat , ( 2 ) moisture ( liquid , not steam ) , ( 3 ) pressure ( mechanical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid or steam with or without " air " pressure ) , ( 5 ) moisture and mechanical pressure ( or air pressure ) , ( 6 ) heat and mechanical pressure ( or air pressure ) , and ( 7 ) heat , moisture , and mechanical pressure ( or air pressure ) . The heat values of a molding process can easily be measured in Fahrenheit ( or Centigrade ) degrees by any potentiometer or pyrometer which makes use of the thermocouple principle . Figure VII-1 shows various types of potentiometers which may be used for this purpose . Moisture values in a molding process should be measured by the amount of water applied per unit area of the fabric . The temperature of the water ( or steam ) at the moment of application should also be recorded . If heat and moisture are used as the molding medium in the form of steam , the steam pressure ( " air " pressure ) at the point of application tnttst. also be measured as well as the heat value at this point .  | Figure Mechanical pressure must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds force in the initial impact and the pounds pressure per unit time ( and the time duration ) after the initial pressure impact . All three molding mediums ( heat , moisture , pressure ) must always be measured with respect to time as well as the absolute physical force value at the moment of intial contact . Time recordings may be made with a stop watch which gives readings in hundreths of a minute . Any such stop watch that is acceptable for a time and motion study will be satisfactory . This should be the minimum requirement for the timepiece . There are , of course , some fabrics whose characteristics are rather constant in molding operations over large time intervals and large variations in the molding medium . In such cases , time measurements may be made with watches giving accurate readings in seconds of half seconds or larger time intervals . 4 . Defining Trade Names for Molding Processes Pressing is the most prevalent molding process used in the apparel industries . Pressing is any molding process which varies the fabric 's geometric structure or characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric .  | Heat and/or moisture , are used often in mechanical pressing processes either to diminish the processing time or to improve the molding stability and/or characteristics , but the mechanical pressure is the basic ingredient in the molding process . Mangling , pleating , blocking , buck pressing , expansion-form pressing , and iron pressing are types of pressing defined by the manner in which the pressure is applied . Mangling is any pressing process in which a rotating roller ( or rollers ) applies pressure directly on the fabric . Blocking is a pressing process in which the fabric or product encompasses a fixed form , the block , before pressure , heat , or moisture is applied to the fabric in order to stabilize the fabric 's conformance to the form of the fixed form . Buck pressing is the pressing process in which the fabric or product is placed on a fixed surface before pressure is applied with a complementary fixed surface . Each of these fixed surfaces is called the buck . Blocking should not be confused with buck pressing . A complimentary buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block applies the basic pressure . Additional pressure is applied with either a varying or kinetic surface such as a hand pad , flat iron , or steam blast . Iron pressing is any molding process in which pressure is applied with the flat contact surface of a flat iron . Form pressing is a molding process which uses a collapsible-expansion form ( actuated by steam ) as the means of applying pressure to form a given fabric or product . The product or fabric is placed on the collapsible form . When this form is expanded by steam , the pressure from the expanding form , and/or steam , molds the fabric or product to the perimeter value of the expanded form . Pleating is any molding process which uses mechanical pressure mold a series of creases or eruptions in the surface contour of a fabric . This is accomplished with either a fixed mold or a synchronized system of pressure surfaces which exert pressure on the fabric or product . Creasing is a molding process using mechanical pressure to form a crease pattern in fabric . ' This process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric prior to submitting the fabric to a sewing operation . Die press-  | ing is a molding process in which a flat surface is molded into a desired shape by a forgelike process which co-processes and distorts the original surface between two complimentary interlocking die shapes . Sponging , shrinking , compacting , and decating are molding processes which are usually part of the mill operations used to construct fabric . They are considered part of apparel processing when the apparel manufacturer employs these processes to change the properties and/or characteristics of the fabric before the fabric is cut or sewed . The apparel manufacturer actually refinishes the fabric if these processes were applied previously at the fabric mill . As to whether or not the fabric mill is responsible for finishing the fabric to conform to the apparel manufacturer 's individual taste is a matter that varies with the terms of the contract for the purchase of the fabric . Shrinking is a molding processing which varies the length and/or width of the fabric with moisture . There are some products , such as chenille robes , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sponging is a shrinking method which uses heat as well as moisture . Sponging is used often to alter the characteristics and/or surface structure of a fabric as well as the linear dimensions of the fabric . Decating is a molding process which uses steam and mechanical pressure to change the characteristics and/or surface structure of a fabric before the fabric is cut . Steaming is a molding process akin to sponging which uses free steam to change the fabric 's surface structure and/or characteristics during the manufacturing process . In some applications the fabric has been either partially or completely processed iii t o the basic form of the finished product . Baking is any molding process which uses only dry heat by conduct ion to change the characteristics or geometric properties of a product or piece of LIh1 is . No mechanical pressure or moisture is applied to the item in a true baking process . Raking , as defined here , should not he conhtsed with the baking phase of a btic'k press , rot 111 pies , . non 1 ) 11 ' , , , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one ill % hi ( h 1 otlstant mechanical  | pressure is maintained on the product or fabric while dry heat or steam is applied to the item for a given period of time . Electronic molding is the process of changing geometric properties and characteristics with heat generated or transmitted electronically ( radiation heating ) . This is used largely at present , for seaming plastics or synthetics by fusing together two or more pieces . The materials that are seamed together are placed between two welding electrodes which contact one of the two exposed surfaces of the seam . The heat transmitted into the fabrics , by the high frequency current passing between the electrodes , melts the synthetic substance in the yarn or finish of the fabric and fuses the fabric plies throughout the area between the electrodes . Casting is a process in which a solid substance is reduced to a liquified or viscous state ; it is then poured into a mold which forms the liquid state into the predetermined form of the mold after the temperature and/or humidity of the liquid is reduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry today , experiments with some plastics and synthetics indicate t hat this process will eventually be applied in more areas of the apparel and allied industries . 5 . Quality Measuring Scales for Molding Processing One should have a scale for measuring the quality of a molded fabric or product before one chooses the molding process for the item . This quality scale should be stated in the physit al units used to measure the properties and characteristics of fabric . A molding process may affect one or all of the style , t i 1 i ty , and durability characteristics of fabrics which are defined in Chapter II , " Raw Materials . " ' 1'lie quality scale must measure changes in fabric properties as well as changes in fabric characteristics . The more important property changes are : ( 1 ) color , ( 2 ) surface contour , ( 3 ) density , ( d ) yarn count per linear inch , ( 5 ) fabric structure change due to fusion , matting , or scorching , and ( 6 ) shape . The charau t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fit ) It. , utility , and durability functions of the finished product  | and the fabric . There is no need to measure the crease retention or crease removal capacity of the fabric if the consumer will not care as to whether there is or is not a crease in the finished product . The same applies to the other fabric characteristics . The quality measuring scale may be constructed in the form of a two dimensional table . The first column on the left-hand side of the table lists the properties and characteristics that are being measured . The successive columns to the right of this column are columns for increasing or decreasing values of the measured properties or characteristics . One may construct a table scale which lists the measured properties and characteristics on the first ( or last ) row in the table . This type of table uses the successive row below ( or above ) this row for increasing or decreasing values of the measured properties or characteristics . Such tables permit one to get a clear picture of the total quality desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired values for the fabric properties and character istics , whereas the row table furnishes a horizontal profile . Quality scales should not be confused with quality homographs which are discussed in the next section . 6 . The Quantitative Analysis of a Molding Process After one has the profile of the desired properties and cli ; u acteristics , one must select the best molding process and method which can yield these required properties and characteristics in the most economical manner . For example , assume that the ( lc sired molding requirements can be procured with either a dry heat electric iron , a steam buck press ( or steam-electric oil ) . a steam jet , a baking oven , or a cold roller press . Each of tlhem. molding processes uses one of the different elements or cone bination of elements shown in Table VII-1 . The cost of the five methods shown in Table VII-1 can IJr calculated as soon as the time factor for each method is knoNv u . The labor , space , capital investment ( equipment ) , and u l W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time factor . " 1'hr t1.11  | cost of the method will be the sum of these four costs . The most economical method is that which has the lowest total cost . However , with methods such as 1 , 2 , or 3 ( the dry-heat hand iron , he steam buck press , and steam jet ) , there will be more than one combination of elements which will yield the desired molding characteristics . The variables in the steam-electric iron press method are time , heat , steam ( moisture ) , and pressure . By increasing the heat value one may get the same results with less steam and/or pressure as less heat and more steam and/or pressure . The time values may or may not vary , but in any case a different cost situation is present . I low can one tell whether he has the most economical molding method with respect to the iure expenditure of each element ? Is the combination used the best ? It is true sometimes that a method using larger time values is more economical to one using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , labor and space is less although the time factor is greater . I f one were to attempt to get the answer by trying every conceivable combination of molding elements , the cost and time of testing all such possible combinations might possibly be more than what could be saved . Also , the time factor needed to actoutllislr this would be prohibitive for use in fashion industries where the production and marketing cycle of a given fabric and design is relatively short . The best method for determining  | the most economical means of " molding " a fabric or garment is to construct nomographs for the molding characteristics of the fabric . Before constructing the nomograph for a combination of two or three of the molding elements , the critical quality points for heat and moisture should be determined with respect to scorching ( or fusing ) and shrinkage because these two ( or three ) characteristics are correlated individually to the elements of heat and moisture respectively ; scorching ( fusing ) to heat and shrinkage to moisture . The general procedure for making the nomograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the graph sufficiently spaced with respect to both the element and the time value to draw the curve of the characteristic . This curve is a function of both the time values and the value of the molding element used to give the desired characteristic being measured . The general characteristics ( with respect to heat , pressure and moisture ) of the fiber or raw material from which the fabric is made will give one an indication of the ranges within which one should limit the test points for depicting the graphs of the characteristics which are being measured . 7 . Classification of Molding Equipment Molding equipment is classified in the trade according to type of process : buck-press , iron , mangle , pleating machine , decater , steam-gun , steam-box , sponger , etc . This type of classification does not give one a clear picture of either the molding elements used by the equipment , or the precise manner of application on the fabric . This latter factor is important if one wishes to evaluate the range of potential for a given piece of molding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being caused by some pressure phenomena connected with a solid , liquid , gaseous , or heat energy contact , it is possible to Cate gorize molding equipment into the following three major categories : I. Solid pressure equipment ( pressing equipment ) 1 . Buck presses : steam presses , man controlled cycles , automatic cycles  | 2 . Pressing irons : dry irons , steam irons , steam-electric irons , rheostat controls , thermostat controls , supplementary equipment 3 . Mangle presses : dry manglers , steam manglers 4 . Block pressing : solid blocks , expansion blocks , supplementary equipment 5 . Form presses ; expansion form systems 6 . Pleating machines : dry heat , steam heat , knife cycle action , rotary action 7 . Creasing machines : edge folders II . Moisture pressure equipment ( steaming and wetting ) 1 . Wetting tanks : London Shriukers and auxiliary equipment 2 . Sponging machines : single and double steamers with and without hot plates 3 . Decaters : with and without leaders and hot plates 4 . Steam guns and jets 5 . Steam chambers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( heating and baking equipment ) 1 . Thermo-electric machines 2 . Hot plates 3 . Casting equipment 4 . Dry heat ovens 5 . Autoclaves This classification system is based on the major molding element in the equipment which is always present when the equipment is used . Any one of these types of equipment may employ more than one of the three basic elements ( solid pressure , heat , moisture ) during the molding process . Heat is used in practically all mold processes ; cold presses are rare . Steam is used with most buck presses . A classification system could be presented which would segregate equipment according to the seven basic molding situations with respect to the combination of molding elements , but this would not be more helpful because it is often possible to add or subtract any molding element at will . 8 . The Heat and Mechanical Pressure Value of Steam When steam contacts the fabric directly in a molding , process , the steam has a definite heat , pressure , and moisture value . All three molding elements are actually present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative amounts of heat , moistnre , and pressure varies with the steam pressure at the moment when the fabric contacts the fabric . The steam pressure table on p. 165 is extracted from Keenan and Kayes Thermodynamics  | of Steam , John ' Wiley and Sons , New York , 1937 . It lists the values of absolute pressure in pounds per square inch and temperature in degrees of Fahrenheit of dry saturated steam . Dry saturated steam is the water vapor without water droplets that exists at the temperature and pressure present when it is formed from liquid water . This table shows that when steam under 213 ? is applied to a fabric surface , it exerts practically no mechanical pressure in addition to the normal atmospheric pressure of approximately 15 psi . Therefore , any steam pressure below 15 lbs . absolute pressure that is applied to fabric , exerts only two molding elements on the fabric , heat and moisture ( water vapor ) . If the fabric has a temperature equivalent to the heat value of the applied steam pressure before the steam is applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric : moisture . The steam pressure gauges on steam boiler and pressing equipment do not register absolute pressure . These gauges register steam pressure in relation to atmospheric pressure . A boiler , whose gauge reads 20 lbs. , has an absolute pressure of 35 lbs . Absolute steam pressure = Boiler gauge pressure + atmospheric pressure , or , Boiler gauge pressure = Absolute pressure ? atmospheric pressure . For example , let us assume that a piece of fabric lying on a steam buck is steamed with 10 lbs . of steam pressure ( not absolute ) . If the buck 's heat raises the temperature of the fabric to 245 ? F. before the steam is applied , the steam adds only moisture and mechanical pressure to the fabric . No heat has been given to the fabric because the temperature of a dry saturated steam pressure of 10 lbs . is 240 ? F. and this is less than the fabric 's temperature before it was steamed . The relative beat and mechanical pressure values a steam application exerts on a fabric depends on the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the moment steam is applied to the fabric . This principle mist be considered before one decides to use steam in any molding process . One must decide why the steam is necessary . Is t h e  | function of the steam to impart heat , mechanical pressure , or moisture to the fabric ? In some molding processes , steam is applied needlessly because moisture is not a necessary ingredient for the process and this is the only element that the steam adds to the process . Steam is actually wasted in such molding operations because the required heat and pressure values were present before the application of the steam . The temperature of the fabric before the application of steam may be an important factor for moisture ( steam vapor ) application . The ratio between the fabric temperature and the steam temperature determines the rate with which the steam condenses to water within or on the fabric . The amount of moisture the fabric receives and/or retains for any given period of time varies with this temperature ratio . 1f fabric temperature before steaming is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric varies with an increase in the ratio . When the steam temperature is used as the denomina. tor , the amount of moisture imparted to the fabric varies inversely to the ratio increase . The higher the temperature of the fabric before receiving a given steam pressure , the less the moisture imparted to the fabric . The higher the steam pressure applied to a fabric with a given temperature , the more the moisture imparted to the fabric . When the fabric temperature exceeds the steam temperature the steam can not impart moist we to the fabric . This is axiomatic because the fabric is vaporizing moisture at a greater rate than the steam temperature . Ibis prevents the fabric from acquiring any moisture from the steam . One of the major functions of moisture is to make the fabric supple ( malleable ) for molding . The effect of moisture on most fabrics is akin to that of a lubricant in a system of rigid m e c h a n i c a l links . The moisture tends to lubricate the yarns , libels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I his gives the fabric a greater degree of plasticity for molding . I be addition of moisture may swell or shrink the fabric . This is discussed in detail in a subsequent section of this chapter .  | 9 . London Shrinking Processes There are three major types of moisture shrinking processes ; London , hot-water , and steam shrinking . London shrinking is a cold-water shrinking process used primarily to shrink pre-cut fabric , fabric in yardage formation . The London shrinking process has two or more operations . The two basic operations are wetting and drying . Before the advent of London shrinking machines , this was a hand process which consisted of bookfolding the fabric between alternate layers of wetted pre-shrunk fabric . Book-folded fabric is fabric that is folded zigzag on itself . The London shrinking machine process is either a continuous or intermittent process depending on the method used for drying . If the fabric is dried with the static natural process used in hand London shrinking , the entire process is intermittent . The complete machined London shrinking process is a continuous process which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , the wetting unit and the drying unit . In the continuous London shrinking machine process the fabric moves continuously throughout the wetting and drying phases until the fabric is book-folded by the drying machine in its desired shrunken dry state . The drying machine book-folds the fabric on a portable platform ( or tray ) which is located outside of the drying unit . The drying chamber of the continuous London shrinking system contains a heating system , an air circulation system , and either a series of parallel rollers or a conveyor belt . These rollers are mounted near the top of the box with the roller length parallel to the prime drying feed and/or the secondary feed on the wetting unit . The roller length lies in the width of the drying chamber . The length of the drying chamber is the horizontal distance from the fabric 's entrance point into the chamber to its exit point from the chamber . This length varies . The longer the drying chamber length , the faster the fabric can be moved through the given length to attain a required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended  | vertically in its passage through the drying chamber , whereas the fabric passes through the chamber in a horizontal position when conveyor belts are used . The length of a drying chamber is only one factor which affects the fabric 's drying distance . The fabric 's drying distance is the distance the fabric travels in the drying chamber . The fabric drying distance is equal to the number of vertical plies in the drying chamber times the length the parallel plies in the chamber plus ' /z the perimeter of the drying roller in the chamber ( see Fig . VII-2 ) . The continuous London shrinking machine ( see Fig . V.II-2 ) Figure process is the best type of London shrinking , because it permits it fine degree of control throughout all phases of the process . The quality of shrinking a bolt of fabric varies with the precision and consistency with which every section of the fabric receives identical processing . The continuous system permits one to submit the fabric to precise as well as consistent processing conditions . The steam pressure , water temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drying rate can be regulated and controlled within the limits required for close shrinking and finishing tolerances . The values of these factors can be measured and observed cotttirtuously throughout the process by incorporating stripchart recorders into the system . Strip-chart heat recorders and  | thermostatic controls can be used to measure and control the water and drying temperatures . Speed and pressure strip-chart recorders and regulators can be used to control the speed and pressure of the wetting and drying . The precise conditions necessary for a desired shrinkage and finish characteristics can be determined with a series of laboratory tests . Comparatively small cuts of the fabric can be wetted and squeezed in a continuous manner with a wringer mounted on a small tank . The wringer speed can be controlled in a series of speeds connecting the wringer drive to the shaft of a synchronous motor with a variable speed control . The squeezed fabric 's reaction to different drying conditions can be charted by using a thermostatic drying oven such as the Precision-Freas Oven Model 201 . A thermostatic drying oven can be set to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The saute applies to air circulation in models made with air circulation control . Nomography for determining the proper shrinking conditions for the desired shrinking of a given fabric can be constructed with the results of such a series of tests . The man hours required to service a continuous London shrinking process vary with the length of each bolt of fabric and the total machine processing time , and the fabric width . The fabric width affects the time necessary to seam and rip the ends of two successive bolts . The size of each bolt and the processing time enable one to compute the time interval at the end of which the unshrunk fabric must be seamed to the tail end of the bolt passing through the wetting tank ; and , the time interval for ripping the tail of the dried book-folded fabric from the bolt emerging from the dryer . These time values , the time required to remove the dry cloth , and the time required fur reading and operating the strip chart controls can be used to calculate the minimum number of man-hours required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hot-Water Shrinking This process is rare . It is used largely for shrinking chenille apparel . Chenilling is the process of sewing tufts of yarn into  | fabric . The prevalent practice is to sew cotton yarn into cotton sheeting . If the sheeting is shrunk after the tufts are stitched into the sheeting , the shrinking increases the sheeting 's grip on the tufts . This increases the stability of the tuft . Hot-water shrinking tends to felt wool fabrics and can be used for more unique felt finishes . This shrinkage process may car may not be combined with the dyeing process . Many chenille products are made in a solid color . This permits one to dye and shrink the unbleached ( or white ) tufted sheeting in one operation . This type of shrinking in chenille is performed most often after the finished product is sewed completely . The dyeing and shrinking process is the last process . The wetted dyed products are dried in tumbler dryers similar to those used for drying laundry . Usually hotwater shrinkage can yield higher percentages of shrinkage than London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and characteristics of the fabric . 11 . Steam Shrinking Sponging is the prevalent trade term for steam shrinking . Sponging is any shrinking process in which only steam is used as the wetting agent for shrinking the fabric . There are four major types of steam shrinking : single sponging , double sponging , open steaming , and enclosed steaming . The basic single sponging machine consists of a perforated drum mounted in a Ii:une with its rotary axis parallel to the floor . When the drum is rotated , it can wind a bolt of fabric concentrically around its perforated perimeter . After the whole bolt of fabric is %%rapped around the drum , the rotation is stopped and steam is released through the perforations . The steam pressure forces the steam through all the concentric layers of fabric on the d This steaming shrinks the fabric . Besides shrinking the labile , the steaming may serve to raise a fabric nap and/or to temove nonlibrous matter used to finish the loomed fabric . Ileni c , sponging can double as a finishing process to change the .0 lc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some highly napped fabrics are shrunk with free steaming .  | In the free steaming process steam passes freely into and through the fabric as the fabric passes over a steam pot or open steam box . The greater the diameter of the steam drum , the more weight the winding fabric on the bolt spindle has to pull to rotate the steam drum in order to unwind the steamed fabric . The steamed fabric will stretch if it has to pull too heavy a load . The second factor that limits the steam drum size is the differential in speed that builds up between the increasing bolt perimeter and the decreasing drum perimeter . A point on the bolt perimeter turns faster as the bolt grows . This increases the velocity of each successive ply on the rotating drum . This increase is accelerated because the steam drum perimeter diminishes as each steamed ply is unwound . " VI lc increasing momentum tends to play excess fabric into the winding drum as well as stretch the sponged fabric-. 1 Icncc , a large difference between the drum and bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper tension throughout the bolt unless the drum is powered in a manner which synchronizes its perimeter speed to the speed of increasing speed of the growing bolt perimeter . The same principle applies to the difference between the drum perimeter as the drum is wound and the decreasing perimeter of the un-sponged bolt on the unwinding spindle . As the drum winding speed increases , the operator has less opportunity to correct a momentary faulty winding . The manner in which the fabric is wound around the steam drum has a marked effect on the shrinkage quality . If the fabric is wound with tension it will not have the capacity to shrink . The fabric may stretch or distort if large billows or small folds ( due to the unwinding spindle acceleration ) are permitted to form in a wound ply . This occurs when the fabric plays with alternating tension and freedom as it is wound onto the drum . Most pile fabrics and some highly napped fabrics are shrunk with free steaming . In the free steaming process , steam is passed  | into and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a steam pot . The fabric continues from the steam pot onto a hot plate and/or " vacuum opening . The hot plate dries the fabric . The vacuum dries and cools the fabric . Air ejection systems are sometimes used in place of vacuums as a means of cooling the fabric . The fabric continues from the final cooling or drying cycle onto a spindle where it is rolled into a bolt ready for cutting . In free steaming the entire shrinking process is continuous from the unrolling of the pre-shrunk fabric to the bolting of the shrunk fabric ; it takes place without enclosing any part of the fabric during the process . Enclosed continuous steaming is a system in which the fabric is steamed , dried , and cooled in enclosed chambers . Such systems give tighter controls on the processing conditions . The Gessner Continuous Steam Sponging Machine is an example of this process ( see Fig . VII-3 ) . An enclosed continuous steam system for shrinking is superior to other steam systems because it permits the tightest controls over the five factors which determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of moisture impregnation ; ( 2 ) the temperature of the moisture ; ( 3 ) the temperature of the drying atmosphere ; ( 4 ) the velocity ( cfm ) of the drying atmosphere ; and ( 5 ) the temperature and cfm of the cooling atmosphere . Continuous shrinking equipment , London , or steam , designed to give a range of controlled shrinking conditions must have indicators and regulators for the following factors : ( a ) temperatures of steam and air flows ; ( b ) velocity of steam and air flows ; ( c ) temperature of water ( London ) ; ( d ) steam pressure ; ( e ) humidity of air flows ; and ( f ) press pressure : psi ( London ) . Buck presses may sometimes be used to test fabrics in order to determine the best single or double sponging conditions with respect to the following : ( a ) pre-steaming , ( b ) sponge steaming pressures , ( c ) sponge steaming time cycles , ( d ) vacuum drying effects , and ( e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irons may he introduced to test reactions to a hot plate phase .  | The number of superposed plies of fabric cuts placed on the buck should be varied to determine the affect of the fabric ply count on the sponging condition . Any fabric that must undergo a molding operation which includes steam should be tested for steam shrinking before it is manufactured into its product . This applies to all fabrics regardless as to whether or not the fabric is pre-shrunk . The fabric should be tested with the same steam conditions to which it will be submitted in the molding operation(s) in the manufacturing process . The fabric 's stability with respect to shrinkage and finish should be tested in order to determine whether its quality and the molding operation(s) are mutually acceptable or whether one of the two must be changed in order to procure the desired finished product . Thermostatic and strip-chart controls can be applied to sponging processes in the same manner in which they are used to govern London shrinking processes . Steam-pressure control is the most important factor in controlling quality in sponging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose . The method for calculating the man-hours required to service a sponging process is similar to that used for determining the labor requirements for London shrinking . The same applies with respect to the labor requirements for a decating process . 12 . Compaction Shrinkage Shrinkage in woven fabric can be caused by one or more of four phenomena which take place after the fabric is woven : relaxation of tensile stresses present in the fabric yarns , swelling of the yarns , felting of the fibers , and fusion-contraction ( see Section 31 of this chapter ) . These four phenomena can be induced in woven fabric by the application of moisture , heat , and/or mechanical pressure on the fabric . Compaction shrinkage is the process of shrinking a bolt of woven fabric ( before the fabric is cut , sewn , or pressed in apparel processing ) primarily with the aid of mechanical pressure . Steam and/or heat . is used only as a means of preparing the fabric for the  | mechanical forces which shrink the fabric . In the three basic shrinking processes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three previous sections , the primary shrinking force is moisture and the preparatory or finishing forces are heat and/or mechanical pressure . Although the first industrial compaction-shrinkage machines in this country were developed by Richard R. Walter of Boston and the Fabric Research Laboratories of Dedham , Mass. ( the machines were built by Riggs and Lombard , Inc. , Lowell , Mass . ) , Moncrieff refers to a similar process developed in 1940 in England by Wrigley , Melville , and Kellitt ( p. 63 of Moncrieff 's Wool Shrinkage ) . These machines shrink the fabric by submitting the fabric to linear compression stresses parallel to the warp . This compression is induced by passing the fabric between two parallel rollers rotating at different speeds . Before the fabric : passes between the rollers , it passes through an acute angle formed by the plate which services the fabric into contacting the upper roller , which is the faster of the two rollers . This , plus the roller speed differential , creates a force which compresses the fabric between the juncture of upper roll and service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fabric is steamed before it is serviced to the rollers and it is dried after the compaction . The steam plasticizes the fabric to make it more susceptible to linear compaction ( shrinkage ) by the linear compressing action between the rollers and service plate . Figure VII-4 presents schematic drawings of this type of compactionshrinkage machine . Tables in " What The New Compactor Can Do " by Dr. Kenneth R. Fox , in Modern Textiles Vol. 37 , No. 6 , June , 1956 ( Papers of the AATT ) list the result of compaction shrinkage on a variety of fabrics . Although the paper does not give the construction details of these fabrics and the " before " and " after " appearance and characteristic values , the paper does state a mere tabulation of shrinkage data only tells a portion of the results . " It is only by seeing the fabric and judging the hand and surface that a full understanding of this process capabilities can be ap-  | preciated . " It is interesting to note that four fabrics in these tables indicated growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two fabrics had growth in the warp with no corresponding shrinkage in the filling . These facts and other growth values in the table may be an indication that it may be possible to use this process to create new desirable drape and hand characteristics by over compacting fabrics . Figure 13 . Decating Although decating and sponging are very similar in equipment and process cycle , the two terms are not synonymous . In some areas they are erroneously considered to be the same . The prime function of decating is to change hand , tactile , and visual characteristics of the fabric . The prime function of a sponging process is to shrink the fabric . Sponging may have a secondary function which consists of changing the fabric characteristics . I ) c ating is not a shrinking process . If a steaming process is DRY CLOTH p 416 supposed to shrink a fabric , it is a sponging process regardless of how it affects the fabric characteristics . Decating is used primarily to refinish London shrunk fabric . Any water shrinking process tends to give the average fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most fabrics . Decating machines have either one or two steam drums similar to those in sponging machines . In addition to the steam drum(s) , steam box , and bolting spindle , the decater has either one or two leader spindles . A single decater has one steam drum and one leader spindle ( some have two spindles ) , whereas a double decater has two steam drums and two spindles . The leader is a cloth which is wrapped around each ply of fabric as the fabric is wound onto the steam drum . At least one ply of the leader must be wrapped around the steam drum before the fabric is fed into the leader junction on the drum . Hence , the basic difference between a decater and a steam sponger is that the decater has a leader spindle and a leader . A double decater has two leaders , one for each steam drum . Decaters have vacuum ducts inside the steam drum which are used to remove the steam before the steamed fabric is unwound from the steam drum . Wrapping the fabric in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steaming process . The use of a leader requires greater steam pressure for steam penetration through the interlocking layers of leader and fabric . The lower the steam pressure , the less the moisture and the less the possibility for shrinkage . If more moisture is required for changing the characteristics , the steaming time must be increased or the pressure must be raised . The quality of a decated finish is correlated to the steam pressure , steaming time , vacuum pressure , vacuum time , leader characteristics , and the winding speed . The important leader characteristics are its steam permeability , dimensional stability to steam , thickness compressibility , abrasiveness , and the tension with which it wraps the fabric around the steam drum . Abrasive leaders with high winding tensions tend to produce lustrous or  | firm finishes . High vacuum pressures or long vacuum periods also tend to yield firm and/or lustrous finishes because the vacuum action compresses the fabric , thereby increasing the fabric density . Increases in density generally give greater firmness. 14 . Steamers Steamers are molding machines that use only steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are four major types of steamers : steam jets , steam guns , steam puffs , and steam chambers . These devices may be used either to stabilize or form characteristics , or to remove creases or wrinkles from the fabric . All steamers should have steam pressure controls . Some steamers have steam pressure gauges , but they do not have steam pressure controls . A pressure gauge merely measures steam presure , whereas a pressure control measures and controls the pressure . A pressure control maintains the steam pressure between a desired minimum and maximum tolerance of steam pressure . Steam chambers are enclosures with inside steam jets which fill the chamber with steam . The processed item is steamed by the average presSnl ? e of the free steam circulation in the chamber . Steam chambers may be muslin ( led with racks or rotating conveyors . Racks are used for hitchrmittent processing . In the intermittent steam process the product is hung ( or placed ) on a rack in the chamber for a given period of steaming . The rack remains stationary in the chamber during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters the steam chamber on a conveyor that carries the product through the chamber continuously during the steaming time . The conveyor is loaded and unloaded as it rotates continuously through i he steam chamber . The speed of the conveyor is adjusted to enable the operator to load and unload the products while the conveyor is moving . The chamber size , chamber steam pressure , and the sum of the distances to and from the chamber to the loading and unloading points , must be such as to permit the product to be steamed sufficiently during the time the conveyor  | rotates in the work cycle . The equation for the work cycle ( where one operator loads and unloads the machine ) is : Loading travel time + unloading travel time = travel time to chamber from loading area + travel time through chamber + travel time from chamber to unloading area Combination chamber and jet steaming is a system in which the product is conveyed past the jet 's nozzle(s) in the steam chamber with a proximity close enough to enable the product to receive the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pre-steams " the product in the chamber during the trip to the jet nozzle ( see Fig . VII-5 ) . 15 . Steam Boilers , Generators , Transmission , and Return Systems Steam is produced with coal , gas , or electrically heated boilers . It may be that in the not too distant future , scientists and engineers will be able to provide atomic power units of sufficiently small size which can economically provide the steam requirements of the average apparel factory . Every boiler , regardless of its source of heat , has the following basic components : ( 1 ) the boiler frame , ( 2 ) the tank for heating and boiling the water , ( 3 ) insulation materials , ( 4 ) steam pressure gauge , ( 5 ) the heating mechanism or element , ( 6 ) the water intake system , ( 7 ) the steam outlet system , ( 8 ) the water gauge , ( 9 ) the bleeder valve , and ( 10 ) steam safety valve . A coal or gas heated boiler must have a flue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a manual control switch for starting and stopping the current , whereas the gas boiler has a manually operated spigot type valve and/or electrically controlled valve for opening and closing the gas flow . Although oil burning boilers could be used to produce steam , these types of boilers are as yet comparatively rare in apparel factories . The choice of boiler is controlled largely by the comparative costs of the different fuels in the factory 's vicinity , although electric boilers are safest for personnel . The following safety devices should be included in every  | Figure boiler : ( 1 ) low water cut-off , ( 2 ) low-water alarm , and ( 3 ) steam pressure control . Unfortunately , these devices are not present in some boilers . I'he low water cut-off shuts off the heating system in gas and electrically heated boilers . Since practically all coal boilers are min-stoked , these boilers should have low-water sight and stnnid alarms that would notify the stoker of the dangerous  | water level . Low-water alarms may be used for gas and electric boilers in conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boiler outlet to the molding machine 's inlet , consists of steam pipes and auxiliary equipment . Practically all steam pipes are surrounded with insulation to diminish heat loss and condensation during transmission . The smaller the pipe diameter , the greater the need for insulation , because a pipe with a larger perimeter encircles more area per unit of perimeter . This is evident from the ratio of a circle 's perimeter to its area , 2lrT/7rim . Hence , smaller pipes present greater pipe surface for heat dissipation per cubic volume of steam . An efficient steam transmission system meets the following requirements : ( 1 ) it has nlininluln condensation due to heat loss ; ( 2 ) condensation in the transmission pipes are collected in condensation traps , or ( 3 ) the elevation angle of the transmission pipes immediately drains the condensation back to the boiler for reheating ; ( 4 ) it transmits steam in a dry state , without water drops ; ( 5 ) it transmits steam with minimum pressure loss ; ( 6 ) it transmits the correct pressure for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit steam to enter the trap as condensate drips into the trap . Proper pipe sloping and placement of traps prevent the steam from propelling condensate into the molding equipment . Purifiers are installed in many transmission systems to remove mineral matter from the steam . This prevents the mineral matter from clogging the transmission system or the molding equipment when condensation takes place . Pressure reducing valves are the devices which are used to regulate the individual steam pressure needs for each machine drawing steam from a central transmission line . These devices are made with various capacity ranges . Pressure reducing valves permit one to press a variety of garments requiring different steam pressures with the same pressing equipment with a minimum cost of inventory-in-process and production costs ( see Chapter X ) .  | Many types of molding equipment require return systems to the boiler . A return system consists of pipes , pipe insulation , and condensation unit . Boilers and condensation tanks are built in various sizes . The size required to service a given piece or group of molding equipment depends on the steam piessme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is equal to the sum of the pressures and volumes required at each steam emission point plus the additional steam pressure and volume needed to offset pressure losses caused by friction and condensation in the transmission system to the emission point . Kent 's Mechanical Engineering Handbook , John Wiley , New York , contains tables for pipe insulations and pressure losses due to friction and heat loss . The efficiency of a steam generator , or boiler , is measured by three factors : ( 1 ) the cost of generating a pound of steam ; ( 2 ) the time necessary to produce a given steam pressure ; and ( 3 ) the rate of producing a given volume of steam ( or pounds of steam ) at a given pressure . A steam generator is defined as a boiler which generates a given amount of steam pressure in 7 minutes . Some major power sources and the units in which the cost of generating steam is measured include : coal , pound ; electricity , kilowatthour ; gas , cubic foot ; oil , gallon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of power is calculated with the following formula : ( Btu needed for lb . Cost of lb. steam = desired steam pressure ) ( cost per power unit ) ( Btu per power unit ) Hie heat losses in the boiler and the capacity of the boiler will affect the efficiency of the cost ; the greater the heat losses , the less efficient the boiler . The greater the boiler capacity , the greater the time necessary to produce a given steam pressure N it h a given rate heating power ( Btu per hour ) . The time necessary to produce a given steam pressure and rate of producing  | a given volume of steam ( or pounds of steam ) at a given pressure can be calculated with the following data : 1 . The Btu in the power unit . 2 . The weight of a given volume of water at a given temperature . 3 . The weight of a given volume of steam at a given pressure . 4 . The capacity of the boiler tank . 5 . The temperature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Btu per lb. of this dry saturated steam pressure ; the Btu per lb of the saturated liquid of this steam pressure ; and the Btu needed to evaporate the saturated liquid into vapor at this steam pressure . For example , a small portable electric boiler has the following ratings : a 3 gallon tank and a 2 kw heating clement . If the tank is half full and the temperature of the feedwater is 500F. , how long will it take to generate a boiler steam pressure of 75 psi ? 1 Btu = the heat required to raise 1 lb. water 1 degree F. from 32 ? F. to 212 ? F. 1 Kw. /hr. = 3413 Btu 1 cu . ft. water = 62.5 lbs . = 7.48 gallons ( for this problem ) 1 gallon of water = 8.33 lbs . = 231 cu . in. 1 cu . ft. = 1728 cu . in . Using the steam pressure table on p. 465 we find that , a 75 psi boiler steam pressure has the following values : cu . ft. per lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saturated liquid = 290.56 or 291 Btu for evaporating lb. saturated liquid to vapor = 894.7 or 895 Then , ( 1 ) Btu needed to raise the temperature of the tank water to saturated liquid = ( 1.5 gal. ) ( 8.33 lb. ) ( 291 ? ( 50 ? 32 ) ) ( 2 ) cu . ft. of tank remaining for boiler steam pressure =-(231) ( 1.5 gal. ) /1728  | ( 3 ) Btu needed to evaporate equation 2 volume of 75 psi . steam pressure from its saturated liquid = ( Eq . ( 2 ) ) ( 895 Btu ) /5 cu . ft. ( 4 ) Btu generated per hour by the heating element = ( 2 kw ) ( 3413 Btu ) ( 5 ) Hours needed to generate 75 psi . steam pressure in the boiler = Eq . ( 1 ) + Eq . ( 3 ) /Eq. ( 4 ) Equation ( 5 ) gives the estimated time necessary to produce 75 psi . steam pressure in the boiler without any heat loss in the boiler . The ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of the boiler 's heat loss efficiency . The rate of producing the cubic foot volume of a pound of steam at a given pressure is equal to ( Btu produced per hour by the heating element ) ( Btu needed to evaporate a lb. of saturated liquid to steam ) In this problem this rate is equal to 6826/895 = 7.6 cu . ft. of 75 psi . steam produced per hour . However , since the tank has only half its capacity available for steam pressure , the tank has only 0.2 cll. ft. available for steam . Since the heating element produces 7.61 cu . ft. of steam per hour , it takes 0.2/7.61 or % hour or 1.58 minutes for the heating element to produce 0.2 cu . ft. of 75 psi . steam . Hence , the maximum rate for using 75 psi . steam with this boiler is 0.2 cu . ft. per 1.58 minutes . If more than 0.2 cu . ft. of 75 psi steam is used every 1.58 minutes , the boiler will not be able to furnish the demand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vacuum Systems The two basic types of vacuum systems are air vacuum and steam vacuum . A steam vacuum system uses steam to create the vacuum . Air vacuum is a suction air draft similar to that of a vacuum cleaner . The suction is created by a centrifugal exhauster which is operated by an electric motor . Air vacuum units are built in many sizes from that for servicing one piece  | of molding equipment to one for servicing an extensive battery of presses . Vacuum systems for two or more presses ( see Fig . VII-6 ) have the following basic components : ( 1 ) the condenser tank , ( 2 ) the vacuum pipe from the press to the condenser tank , ( 3 ) the pipe from the condenser to the exhaust unit , ( 4 ) the exhaust unit , ( 5 ) the exhaust pipe from the exhaust unit to the atmosphere , ( 6 ) the electric motor that drives the exhaust unit , and ( 7 ) valves for connecting each press to the vacuum pipe leading to the condenser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic construction . Because these units are comparatively small , it is not necessary to have the condensing tank Figure between the press and the exhaust . Since individual vacuums are placed as close as possible to the serviced press , the condenser comes after the exhaust unit . The sizes of the exhaust unit and the condenser make it possible to eliminate the piping between these units . The exhaust and condenser frames are built with pipe extensions which are connected directly in the assembled system . The condenser in the single vacuum often is constructed to function also as a muffler . The condenser tank for most large vacuum systems has a water gauge for indicating the level of condensed water in the tank . Every condenser tank has a draining or bleeder valve for draining the condensate from the tank . The condenser tank  | should never be drained while the exhauster is operating , because this would create a suction draft into the condenser tank through the drain which would suck water into the exhaust unit . The function of the condenser tank is to separate moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condensing steam enters the tank through the side wall , the condensate precipitates to the bottom of the tank while the moistureless air is sucked into the pipe leading to the exhaust unit . The vacuum piping from the presses to the condenser tank should be tilted down toward the tank to permit a free gravity flow of condensate . Water traps should not be installed in a vacuum pipe system because the function of the system is to get condensate out as quickly as possible . Bleeder valves should be installed in junctures or areas where an unavoidable momentary rise of piping may permit condensate to accumulate . 17 . Solid Presses ? General The solid pressure that is exerted in any of these pressing machines would be one of three types : impact , compression gliding , or rolling . Rolling pre.ssure is the pressure exerted by a rotating link that contacts the fabric surface . Glide pressure is the pressure exerted by the flat plane of a link as the plane glides on the surface of the item being pressed . 1w/mci pressu e refers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contact by the contacting , surface of a thrusting pressing link . Ibis occurs the instant the pressing surface of the pressing iron contacts the surface of the material and compresses the material against the surface of the structure supporting the item during pressing ; stuh as the pressing table , or press bucks . The same is t rite if the contact press surface is the surface of the mobile buck in a buck press . Compression pressure refers to the pressure exerted on the item being pressed when the pressing surface is either stationary or continuing its pressure thrust regardless of IN holier the pressing surface is that of a mobile buck , press iron , ele Rucks , press irons , blocks , rollers , collapsible forms , creasing and folding blades are categories of mechanical devices used  | to exert pressure in a pressing process . Pressing machines are mechanical linkage systems which use one or more of these mechanical devices as the pressure link for exerting pressure . on the fabric . A fully automatic steam buck or form press automatically controls the pressure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck pressure ( the release of the mobile buck ) , and the pressure and time cycle of the vacuum . In the other types of steam buck presses ( manual , and semi-automatic ) there are no automatic time controls for pressure time , steam time , or vacuum time . These types of pressure are operator-controlled presses with respect to these three processing time cycles . The work cycle elements in a steam-buck press operation are : 1 . Pick-up f - or pick-up position as one element 2 . Position j3 . Press 4 . Steam f or press and steam as one element 5 . Vacuum ( may sometimes be included in either or both of the former or latter elements ) 6 . Disengage and extract or disengage , extract , and discard 7 . Discard in one element Hence , a steam-buck or form press work cycle may have three or more time elements . The above seven work cycle elements for steam-buck pressing is enlarged for each repositioning . Each repositioning of the garment on the press adds three motion elements to the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vacuum . As to whether pick-up and position are listed as one or two elements on the work study analysis sheet depends on the time length of the motion element . The same applies to press and steam , the disengage , extract and discard elements . Actually , every steam-buck process work cycle has eight motion elements if a vacuum is used : pick-up , position , press , steam , vacuum , disengage , extract , and discard . This adheres to the principles and dimensions to he used for defining a work-study element as it is set forth in Chaplet IX , " rime and lotion , Study . " hi a work-situplifil ; it ion study of , ( Ina ( hint . press operation ,  | one of the prime aims of the study is to reduce the number of work cycle elements in the study . Automatic time controls for press , steam , vacuum , and disengage , reduce these time values to minimums if the pressing machine controls are adjusted correctly . Another prime aim in such a work-simplification study is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the work cycle has only one positioning element . This factor is intrinsically connected to the design of both the mobile and stationary bucks of the steam-buck pressing machine . The major types of solid presses are categorized in Table VII-2 . The classification is based on the difference in the prime dynamic pressure link . Differences in the complementary pressure links are the basis for sub-classifications within a basic class . Machines from two basic classes may have the same com-Table  | plementary pressure links , but they will not have the same prime dynamic links . 18 . Buck Presses Most steam buck pressing machines have the following components : ( 1 ) the machine frame , ( 2 ) a bed buck , ( 3 ) the head Figure  | buck , ( 4 ) buck paddings , ( 5 ) steam distribution system , ( 6 ) vacuum system , ( 7 ) the dynamic buck linkage system , ( 8 ) pressure gauges : steam and/or buck pressure , ( 9 ) the table ( if any ) attached to the machine frame , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck pressure ; ( a ) manual and foot controls , and/or ( b ) automatic controls . The bed buck is the plane on which the fabric or garment is placed and supported during the pressing operation . In most buck presses , the bed buck is the static buck and the head buck is the dynamic or ram buck . When the head buck is the dynamic buck , it has a linkage system which the operator actuates to impel the head buck downward onto the bed buck surface after the garment is positioned on the bed buck . If the bed buck is the dynamic buck , it has the dynamic linkage system . In these machines , the bed buck is actuated upward against the static head buck after the garment is placed on the bed buck . The dynamic buck of a buck press has a vertical stroke regardless of whether the head or the bed buck is the dynamic pressure link . Most dynamic : head bucks are at one end of a cantilever lever . The other end of the link contains weights that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head buck and the amount of force required to actuate the head . The zero pressure point of a dynamic head buck is that point beyond AA hich the head buck can exert an initial impact on the garment . I'he zero pressure point is the plane in which the head buck is as lose as possible to the garment on the bed buck without exerting pressure on the garment . Compression pressure takes place A% hen the head buck presses beyond this point . Ducks vary in shape and contour dimensions . The shape is measured by the length and width dimensions and the contour is measured by the depth variation per unit area . The form of the buck surface , the integrated contour , is usually the exact inversion of the form of its complementary buck . This may be varied to allow for thickness differentials in the garment or for differential pressure during the pressing element . Most  | bucks are classified by an apparel section name , such as collar , sleeve , front , back , or shoulder which describes the basic form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight convex surface across the width of the bed buck and a complementary concave surface on the head buck . The specific size and contour of the bed and head bucks are usually dictated by style and fashion trends . Flat bucks have no curvature in the surface plane of either the head or bed buck . The bed buck of a steam buck press receives its steam from a steam pipe entering either the center or left end of the buck . This placement varies with the shape and function of the bed buck . The position at which the steam pipe passes through the table of the press is an indication of the range of bed bucks that may be used with the machine . A center steam pipe placement requires bed bucks with center steam inlets , whereas a left side steam placement requires bucks with steam inlets on the left side of the buck . The flexibility of a buck pressing machine is also limited by the type and size of the buck-support link . The larger the area of the link parallel to the buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate . If this link can be easily bolted and unbolted from the frame , this increases the range because different size buck-support links can be used . Buck paddings , metal and/or fabric covers are placed over the perforated pressing surface of the buck . They are held in place by either draw strings or springs with hooks . Metal buck covers consist of either perforated sheet metal or grid wire screen frames . These are made of either aluminum , copper , or alloys such as Monel Metal which will not rust . Monel Metal is a silvery white alloy containing approximately 67% nickel , 30% copper , and a 3% mixture of iron , manganese , silicon , and carbon . Metal buck covers may be used for buck covers without cloth paddings . Cloth paddings may be used to cover either metal buck covers or the perforated buck surface without a metal cover . Cloth covers vary in construction ( knitted or woven ) thickness , compressibility , and surface value . Knitted COMM padding generally covers the buck surface . This padding is  | turn covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or plain weave . Most padding covers are made of cotton . The number of plies used in the under ( or base ) padding varies with the type of padding used and the nature of the padding compression characteristic desired . The compressibility of a cloth padding , the total thickness of under-padding plus the cover , may be measured with compression testers similar to those used to measure the compressibility of rubber and synthetic sponge-like materials . Buck-padding has three functions : ( 1 ) to distribute steam evenly to the entire area being pressed ; ( 2 ) to reduce the impact of the ejected steam against the area being pressed ; and ( 3 ) to give a relatively soft resilient surface to fabrics which have low compression coefficients . Many fabrics with low compression coefficients tend to shine readily when they are pressed with high buck pressures and hard surfaced bucks . A good padding acts as a baffle which prevents uneven steam pressures or high ejection velocities . High steam ejection velocities and uneven steam distribution may produce steam spots on the fabric being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high temperature values and/or variations in mechanical impact . Some synthetics , wools and blends are in this category . The steam spots in these fabrics resemble polka dot or moire like arrangements of intermittent dull and bright patches . A common occurrence in these cases consists of a pattern of round bright dots on the surface of the fabric . The dot pattern is correlated to the jet-hole pattern in the buck plate . Shine due to the mechanical pressure of the contacting ram buck can be prevented by diminishing or removing the contact if ram on the fabric . Steam spots and shine can be removed only by reducing steam pressure and/or the rate of ejection ; or ' by increasing the baffle efficiency of the buck padding . Since the late of steam ejection rises with increased values of steam pressure ; it is imperative to improve the baffle quality of the loco k when high steam pressures must be used because of the  | temperature values in these steam pressures . The BishopFreeman Co. of Evanston , Illinois makes a series of buck plates and paddings designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Figure VII-8 , a cross-section of one of these plates which is placed over the surface of a buck , shows the relation of the baffle system to the steam jets in the buck surface . The rate of flow of the steam is diminshed by having the steam streams oppose each other as they flow through the baffle channels . The ejection surface of the baffle in Fig . VII-8 Figure shows approximately 50% ejection area in the baffle 's ejection surface as against approximately 22% ejection area in the buck surface , which has less-even distribution . The tables of most buck presses are made of metal , wood , or formica . The function of the table is to prevent the processed item from contacting the frame during the work cycle and to assist the operator in the handling of the garment during the work cycle . The size and shape of the table will vary with the series of operations or jobs the machine is expected to service . ILL some pressing operations , the table must support part of ! he processed items during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to support a work lot of Tln pressed and/or pressed items .  | At present more and more automatic presses with automatic steam , vacuum , ram buck release cycles are being made . With such presses the operator actuates the entire ram action ( press and release ) and the steam and vacuum cycle with one actuation motion . This permits the operator to service a battery of presses . Automatic presses with bucks , designed to yield the finished contour of the garment in one press , remove the need for repositioning a garment on the same buck or series of bucks . This is the present trend . This present automatic cycle will undoubtedly be improved in the future by the addition of automatic loading ( positioning ) and extraction. 19 . Iron Pressing Equipment There are two basic types of iron press work stations : the iron press machine , and the iron " tool . " " The jump press " is a trade term for one type of iron press machine . The iron press machine is similar to the manual or semi-automatic buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The iron takes the place of the head buck . The iron " tool " work station consists of an iron , power line , bed buck , and iron support system . The three basic irons used in these workstations arc steam irons , electric irons , and steamelectric . The steam iron is heated by steam and is similar to the steam iron in the " julep press . " The electric iron , the dry iron , is heated by a resistor similar to that used in broilers or electric ovens . There are two types of electrically heated irons , rheostat and thermostat irons . The rheostat iron has a control system which permits the operator to control the flow of current manually ; whereas , the thermostatically controlled iron has a thermostat which automatically turns the current on and off when the heat value of the base plate is outside of a given heat range . The rheostat type is practically obsolete . The control scale in a thermostat iron should be marked in degrees Fahrenheit ( or Centigrade ) because this presents an absolute heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , 1 to 6 , " lowtiled i um-high , " or a range of fabrics , such as " rayon " at the low end of the thermostat and " linen " at the high end . These scale*  | are not advisable for good quality control in pressing . These scales can easily be changed with a calibrated Fahrenheit temperature scale . The steam-electric iron is heated by electricity , but has steam channel perforations in the base plate , and a levervalve control system on the iron for controlling steam emission . These irons do not require return systems if the iron heat used will always be higher than approximately 265 ? F. This is necessary to prevent the steam from condensing in the iron while the steam is idling in the storage channels in the iron . If the steam condenses in the iron when the steam is idling in the iron , this condensation will be spewed or sprayed onto the fabric when the steam is released . The exact iron temperature required to prevent water spray depends on the design and size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater the amount of efficiency of insulation needed : wound the hose to prevent condensation in the hose . Some steam-electric irons can not guarantee waterless steam ( dry steam ) unless the thermostat is set at 375 ? F. , whereas the design of other irons permit them to furnish dry steam at an iron heat of 275 ? F. when the steam pressure is equal for both types of irons . The higher the steam pressure , the greater must be the heat value of the iron to prevent condensation . This is so because the higher the steam pressure , the greater the heat value of the steam . For example , 5 lbs . relative steam pressure has a temperature of 227.96 ? F. and 20 lbs . steam pressure temperature is 259.28 ? F. This means that a steam-electric iron must operate at approximately 25 ? F. more temperature when 20 lbs . steal pressure is used in the iron instead of 5 lbs . steam pressure . Thermostatic : ally controlled steam-electric irons are far superior to rheostatically controlled irons . A rheostat fixes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this current flow can in time raise the heat of the iron to that of the iron 's highest heat value . This can scorch , fuse , or otherwise damage the fabric . Hence , in order to use a rheostat iron efficiently with regard to quality control , one must first determine the temperature gain and temperature loss of the iron  | with respect to the time a set current is turned on and off . In some cases it may be necessary to measure the temperature gain and loss functions with the particular fabric surface and a given pressing stroke rate . A thermocouple potentiometer with a strip-chart recorder will automatically make the temperature gain and loss graph line . Such graphs can be charted manually with the temperature readings taken with a small hand potentiometer and a stop-watch . The readings may be taken in fixed intervals such as every 0.10 or 0.25 minute . The results plotted in graph paper show how the iron gains and loses temperature when the given current is turned on and off for given lengths of time . This enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presser should turn the current on and off without danger of having the iron become too hot or too cold . A clock or timer is all the presser needs now to know when to turn the current on and off . A rheostat iron 's current can be turned on and off automatically by putting an automatic timer with a relay in series with the iron . If this is done and the timer device does not demand the same amperage as the iron , then a proper resistor should be put in parallel with the timer . If not , the iron and the circuit will not operate . Flat press irons vary iii weight and sole plate-dimension . Industrial press irons vary from approximately 4 to 35 lbs . in weight , 3 " to 6 " in width ; and 6 " to 20 " in length ( Fig . VII-9 ) . The exact weight , length , and width dimensions are determined by the specifics of the pressing operation , the fabric , the dimensions of the pressing area , and the quality specifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater the need for an iron support system , such as the swivel on " jump iron " machine , the gear drive support , or the chain suspension suppurl . Although press iron bed bucks vary in size and shape in similar fashion to the bucks of buck presses , they rarely vary in surface contour . The surface contour of an iron buck must he flat enough to permit the iron surface it services to be tangent to the buck surface during the iron stroking in the pressing  | Figure operation . Most bed bucks of iron press machines have steam and vacuum systems . Portable bed buck stands for steam and vacuum portable iron units are also available if desired . Most portable bed buck stands do not have steam or vacuum systems in the buck . The efficiency with which a buck may be used depends on the height of the pressing surface . Since the buck height for a pressing operation varies with the height of the presser , portable buck stands should have a telescopic leg system which permits adjusting the buck height to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck paddings in buck machines apply equally to the bed buck of iron press machines and portable bed bucks . 20 . Block and Die Pressing Machines and Equipment Block presses are pressing machines or equipment systems which either stabilize or change the size , surface values , and/or dynamic characteristics of a three-dimensional fabric form with parallel ( or approximately parallel ) sides , such as a hat , cuff , collar , or sleeve . A block press machine consists of the following components : ( 1 ) frame , ( 2 ) the bed block , ( 3 ) the rant  | pressing block(s) , ( 4 ) heating element system , ( 5 ) thermostat heat control system , ( 6 ) the linkage system for the ram press , ( 7 ) the linkage system for the bed block if the bed block is dynamic , and ( 8 ) pressure control(s) for the ram press(es) . Steam systems may be incorporated in a block press . The usual steam gauges and controls would be added if the block press has a steaming system . Collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block presses . The bed blocks in these machinees are sometimes called " dies . " They are not dies and these machines are not die presses in the true sense of the word . A die press or forge press machine contorts a flat fabric shape into a stabilized three-dimensional form . The flat fabric contains no darts , seams , or other structural device which gives the fabric difference in form elevation . Die presses are used largely on sheet plastics and items in the millinery , shoe , handbag accessory , and toy industries . They can be used advantageously in various production phases to other types of apparel and softgoods industries . Figure  | 21 . Form Pressing Machines Form presses are used largely for off-pressing operations , the final pressing operation on the manufactured apparel product before it is packaged and/or distributed to the retailer . Practically all form presses used in apparel manufacturing are based on the principle of expanding a collapsible bag , made in the approximate form of the finished product , with steam and/or air . Rigid form presses such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves can be used but are comparatively rare . The exact construction details of an expansionbag form press varies with the type of product for which the press has been designed . All expansion form presses , regardless of the product , should have the following basic components : ( 1 ) machine frame , ( 2 ) steam distribution system , ( 3 ) air distribution system , ( 4 ) the form bag with size and style adjustments and its complementary forming links , ( 5 ) gauge for steam and air pressure , ( 6 ) a ( Illations for steam and air release , ( 7 ) regulation for steam and " air " pressure , and ( 8 ) timers for steam and air cycles . Many expansion form presses are constructed with individual motors , fans , and heating elements for generating heated air pressure within the machine instead of using air pressure from an outside source . Vacuum systems can be incorporated in rigid form presses , but a vacuum system can not be used in an expansion bag form press unless a complementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without such a support , vacuum action within the bag would collapse the bag completely . ( See Fig . VII-11 . ) Basically , form presses are designed to eliminate positioning and repositioning time in a pressing work cycle . Steam-bag form presses without timers have five phases in the work cycle : ( 1 ) pick-up and position , ( 2 ) steam , ( 3 ) air dry , ( 4 ) extract , ( 5 ) discard . A garment pressed on a collapsible bag steam press is always pressed with steam pressure but not necessarily with the mechanical pressure of the inflated bag . The fabric characteristics and quality specifications of the apparel product are the  | Figure determining factors as to the exact amount of steam pressure , air pressure , bag pressure , and tune of each , needed to yield the required results . 22 . Creasing Machines Creasing machines fold over and press the edges of apparel sections such as pockets , ctins , and collars , in order to prepare these sections for sewing operations ( Fig . VII-10 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creasing machines are used to prepare fabric sections for sewing whenever the total cost of crease-pressing ( capital investment + labor + space + utilities + transportation ) plus the total cost of sewing the pre-creased section is less than the total cost of sewing the uncreased section . The principles and components of all ereasing machines are basically alike regardless of the type or style of the section being creased by the machine . Most creasing Ina ( hines employ steam to help make and stabilize the crease . Some fabrics do not require steam for efficient edge creasing .  | If the fabric does not require steam for efficient pressing , most creasing machines with steam are designed to permit one to operate the machine without steam . The heat in such machines is furnished by an electric heating element . Creasing machines are made in the three basic operating models : manual , semiautomatic , or automatic . The basic components- in a creasing machine with steam are : ( 1 ) the frame or stand , ( 2 ) the steam distribution system , ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the heating circuit , ( 5 ) steam pressure gauge , ( 6 ) steam pressure regulator , ( 7 ) steam release control , ( 8 ) the press bed , ( 9 ) the ram head , ( 10 ) the creaser blade(s) , ( 11 ) the linkage system which actuates the rani head and die(s) , ( 12 ) the ram or section die(s) , ( 13 ) the linkage system which actuates the creaser blade(s) , ( 14 ) the die and blade pressure regulators , ( 15 ) the rani and blade actuator(s) , and ( 16 ) the timing mechanism ( for semi-automatic and automatic machines ) . Creasing machines with automatic timing devices permit one to get the highest degree of pressing quality with maximum efficiency in labor , capitalization , space , and utility costs . A creasing machine with an automatic pressing timer has the same basic phases in its work cycle as the work cycle of an automatic buck pressing or form pressing operation . 1 . Pick-up and position section on the press bed 2 . Crease-press ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 3 . Extract 4 . Discard manual or automatic If a feed hopper with a pick-up and positioning mechanism were added to a creaser with automatic crease-press , extract and discard elements , the entire work cycle for each creasing operation would be automatic , machine-paced . Because of the relatively small size and nature of most creasedpressed sections , the extract and discard are treated as one motion phase in most operations . The ratio of the time of the crease-press to the sum of the pick-up , position , extract , and discard time determines the number of unit or multiple creas-  | ing machines one operator can service economically in gang crease-pressing . The gang operator 's hourly production is equal to 60/x ; when x is the time value in minutes equal to the sum of pick-up , position , extract , and discard time per section(s) handled in this total handling time . The optimum number of machines a presser should service is equal to the next highest number of the sum of the ratio plus one when the crease-press time is the numerator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominator . For example , let us assume that a grease-press operation has the following time values for a threephase work cycle executed on a creasing machine with a timer mechanism : Table  | With a 1.5 ratio the maximum number of machines an operator can service in a gang operation is 3 because 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 and 3 is the next highest number . The operator 's hourly production is 60/ ( 0.06 + 0.04 ) ? 600 pieces because the operator spends his entire time executing phases 1 and 3 . No allowance has been made in this problem for PFD or for the possible increase in handling time because the operator may have to walk or shift from one machine to the other . In an actual problem these two items must be considered when the study is made on one machine . If four or more machines were serviced by the operator there would be no increase in production . The creased section would be in " temporary storage " on each press bed ( or ram die ) for a longer time until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a duce mat him . gang , each creased section waits 0.05 minutes iii the machine before it is serviced by the presser . This 0.05 time factor is true after the first round of service . If the operator serviced a gang of only two machines , the operator would have an idle time of 0.05 on each work cycle . This principle for optimum gang machine operation is basic for all types of pressing , sewing , etc. , gang machine operation . ( See Chapter VIII ) . 23 . Pleating Pleating is the process of setting a series of specific angular or curved folds with pressure , heat , and/or moisture in a flat piece of fabric . The angular or curved folds may be defined as pleating or pleats . Pleats are used for either utility or decorative effects . Utility pleats enable the wearer to have additional fullness for greater freedom of action without enlarging the static perimeter or silhouette of the garment . Arbitrary trade terms , such as accordion pleats , side pleats , box pleats , sunburst , air-tuck , Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the best way to identify or comprehend types of pleating . A geometric approach will be used here to present an objective means of classifying and identifying pleating . This is necessary if the use of pleating is to be expanded as a de ( ma-  | tive device in apparel design . Pleating offers a vast potential for new designs that is as yet untapped ( Fig . VII-13 ) . 24 . Types of Pleating There are two major categories of pleating : angular and round . An angular or knife pleat consists of a specific crease with a linear apex . The round pleat is a fixed corrugated or billowed area in the fabric plane . Table VII-5 presents an outline of well-known types of pleats . An angular pleat is either a side or accordion type pleat . The side pleat is a creased edge which lies adjacent to the fabric surface , whereas the accordion pleats are creased edges which can be superposed parallel onto each other at the creased edges without otherwise disturbing the fabric surface . Rounded pleating does not have the angular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleating types have definite amplitude and length in the curved wave pattern . This factor is the common geometric characteristic of the vertical cross section through the lengths of a series of adjacent round pleats . The sixteen types of pleats listed in Table VII-3 are by far not all the types of existent or possible pleats . For example , graduated or sunburst fluting is not listed in the table although it is possible to make these types of pleats . The same is true about other knife pleat types . Designers , as a rule , have not even scratched the surface of possible distinctive pleat types and designs . As the technology for making pleats improves , the apparel designer will be able to do more in creating and in applying pleat designs in apparel . 25 . Pleating Principles : Heat , Moisture , and Pressure Since pleating is the process of molding folds in fabric , it is important to know what controls the flexibility and rigidity of fiber and yarn shape . Most people are aware of the brittleness in cotton when it is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all animal , vegetable , and synthetic fabrics . Generally speaking , the molding flexibility of animal and vegetable yarns increases as the moisture content and temperat we of the fabric increases from normal temperatures and mois-  | Figure  | Table ture content , provided the temperature is below the scorching point of the fiber . When these fibers are heated at temperatures over approximately 125 ? F. , under humidity conditions that will not permit the fibers to lower their normal moisture content , the fabric becomes supple enough to mold it into desired shapes without rupturing the fibers or yarns . This is most important in pleating , because an angular fold or crease is the greatest molding strain to which one may subject a fiber or yarn . Because of the basic difference between the geometric structures of animal and vegetable fibers , a mold change in animal fiber fabrics takes  | place more easily in the fiber than it does in vegetable fiber fabrics . Mold changes in cotton fabrics take place largely by altering yarn structure . The permanency of the fold or mold will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of heat , moisture , mechanical pressure and time factors in the pleating operation . Permanent pleating is a relative term which must be measured in terms of the life of the individual fabric . In absolute terms , permanent pleating is a pleat which will not lose its fold until fabric areas , not on the fold of the pleat , disintegrate . In true permanent pleating repeated wear , wash and/or cleaning will disintegrate the fabric in areas off the fold before , or at the same time , the fabric on the fold disintegrates . From a fashion view-point , permanent pleating is a pleating which lasts for a given wear , wash , and/or cleaning number of cycles . One rarely expects to wear fashion clothing to the point of fabric disintegration . Such durability is vital only to work , specific utility , or military clothing . The life of fashion clothing is measured by the concept of fashion obsolence . Steam is the best medium at present in which one can raise both the moisture content and temperature of fabrics for molding purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without additional moisture content . Here again , steam is the best medium for inducing higher temperatures without reducing the normal or optimum moisture content of the fabric . Saturated steam will never reduce the moisture content of fabric . In fact , as the temperature of the steam drops , the steam will condense into moisture . It should be obvious that if steam has been used to mold a pleat , the cooling process should never be one which reduces moisture in the pleated fabric below the normal or optimum moisture content . To do so would either remove the mold retention of the pleat ( open the pleat ) or it would tend to hasten the disintegration of the fabric due to the increase in brittleness . When dry saturated steam is superheated it changes from its dry saturated state of  | 100% humidity to less than 100% humidity . The higher the superheating of the steam , the less the humidity . Hence , if a fabric is pleated in superheated steam which has a lower relative humidity surrounding the fabric , then the fabric will tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings . This , too , may lower pleat retention and/or hasten fabric disintegration by increasing brittleness . Since most vegetable fabrics do not possess the same crease retention characteristics as animal fiber fabric , stiffening agents such as starch , resins , or plastics are often used to increase the permanency of pleats and creases in vegetable fabrics . The dye and finishing content of a fabric should be analyzed chemically very carefully before a stiffening agent is chosen . It should be a standard operating procedure to test every fabric , that requires relatively high degrees of heat for pleating , to see whether a dye or finishing agent reacts adversely under the necessary pleating temperatures . Fading , streaking , mark-off , crocking , or objectionable odors may result with undesirable dyes and finishing agents . Mechanical pressure should never be applied in some pleating processes before the fabric has been adequately heated and/or moistened. 11 mechanical pressure is applied before proper heat and moisture conditions are attained in the fabric pleat , the folded yarns may snap and rupture because they were still relatively too brittle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application will diminish greatly the permanency of the pleat . In December 1958 , the Wool Textile Research Laboratories of Australia 's Cominonweath Scientific and Industrial Research Organization issued a report of a chemical method they had developed for increasing the crease retention of wool fabrics . The method involved the use of ammonium thioglycolate which is one of the basic ingredients used in many hair wave lot ions . The method consists basically of three different steps : ( 1 ) spraying the solution onto the garment in the area to be creased ; ( 2 ) setting the crease(s) of the sprayed garment with  | the use of either an autoclave , buck-press , iron , or steam-chamber ; and ( 3 ) drying the crease-set garn'ient in a drying chamber . This spray solution concentrate has been licensed in the United States under the name of SI-RO-SET . The degree of crease retention acquired with this method is controlled by the following factors : ( 1 ) the strength of the SI-RO-SET concentrate solution ; ( 2 ) the degree with which the crease area is saturated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dry saturation , and pressure of the steam being used for setting the crease ; ( 4 ) the mechanical pressure used in setting the crease ; ( 5 ) the time lags between spraying , setting , and drying ; ( 6 ) the time cycle for spraying , setting , and drying ; ( 7 ) the drying conditions : temperature , humidity , and efm of the drying atmosphere ; ( 8 ) the pll factor of the fabric . Report no. 4 of the Department of Science and Technology , The Wool Bureau , Inc. , New York , April 1959 , presents a report on methods developed by them for the " durable pleating and creasing of all-wool apparel with SI-RO-SET solution . " 26 . Pleating Equipment Analysis There are three basic types of pleating processes : hand-pattern pleating , iron or buck pleating , machine pleating . Iron or buck pleating is the process of forming pleats with the pressing action of a pressing iron or buck-pressing machine . This method is often most economical when only one or two simple side pleats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often most economical for making extensive or minute pleating designs , such as crystal , wave , Van Dyke , fluting , or stagger-wave pleating . There are two basic kinematic types of pleating machines : blade machines and complementary die machines . In a complementary die machine , the pleats are formed by molding the fabric with the interlocking pressing action of two circular complementary fitted dies which resemble gears . Elutillti and accordion pleating is often accomplished with these types of machines . The average fluting machine has the following basic components : ( 1 ) machine frame , ( 2 ) two complementary  | rotary fluting dies , ( 3 ) motor , ( 4 ) geared drive from . motor to fluting dies , ( 5 ) variable speed control for the motor , ( 6 ) electrical heating elements for the fluting dies , ( 7 ) pressure regulator to adjust the pressure between the fluting dies , and ( 8 ) thermostat for controlling die heat . The fluting or accordion size is changed by changing both dies . The size of the pleating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the die perimeter . In blade machines , the pleats are formed by the thrust action of a blade ( or set of blades ) on the fabric . The pleats are then set by heat and pressure as the formed pleats are passed and pressed between two compressing rotary pressing links ( mangle rollers ) . Some blade pleating Ina ( hincs have pre-steaming boxes which arc used to steam the fabric prior to the forming of the pleat by the blade . This is necessary for fabrics which require increased heat and humidity values before pleat formation . The range of style potential of a blade machine varies with linkage systems controlling variations in direction of knife thrust , intermittent pressure and velocity control of the mangle rollers , and the changing of blades with different geometric edges . Many fabrics are sensitive to being marked by the blade edge . Fabrics of this type are pleated between two layers of tissuelike paper . The paper acts as a buffer which prevents the blade edge from bruising the sensitive fabric surface . Blade type pleating machines are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles . Pleating machines with a large range of pleating styles must have the following mechanical components : ( 1 ) pre-steaming box , ( 2 ) frame with rack bars for paper and cloth rolls , ( 3 ) blade action regulator which permits the operator to change the blade thrust pattern quickly , ( 4 ) linkage system which permits easy change of different blade designs , ( 5 ) pressure gauge for steam box , ( 6 ) thermometer for steam box surface , ( 7 ) intermittent pressure control on mangle rollers , ( 8 ) velocity con trols on mangle rollers , ( 9 ) heat control for the heat of the man gle rollers , and ( 10 ) motor with variable speed drive or driving system .  | In the hand-pattern process , the fabric is folded between two complementary folded paper patterns . These patterns act as a mold after the fabric has been folded parallel to the confining contour of the interlocking paper patterns . This folded paper mold with its entrapped fabric is constricted tightly by a paper wrapper or tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for steaming . This steaming in the steam box , or autoclave , forms and sets the pleats ; the permanency of the pleats is correlated to the steaming and cooling conditions . Steam boxes have a lower range of pleating potential than autoclaves . When temperatures are desired higher than those one may attain with free steam , one must use autoclaves for the steaming process . The autoclaves used are similar to those used in hospitals for sterilization purposes . The pleating autoclave , however , is built to accommodate much higher steam pressures than those used in hospital autoclaves . Pleating autoclaves are built for steam pressures as high as 75 to 200 lbs . Autoclave steaming is always a better method of steaming because the average autoclave is designed with steam and heat gauges and regulators which permit one to control the steaming of the paper mold ( and its fabric ) within rattler precise limits . An autoclave is a steam chamber with a door that can be hermetically sealed . This airtight feature of the autoclave permits one to attain steam pressures higher than atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be pleated at higher temperatures in an autoclave. 27 . Ovens Ovens are dry heat chambers used to either heat and/or dry apparel products or sections of these products during the manufacturing process . The dryer used in London shrinking is somewhat akin to an oven . Smaller types of ovens are often referred to as drying or baking units . These units consist of insulated chambers with heating systems . The two most popular heating systems are steam coils and encased electric heating coils . Most drying units , such as those used in millinery factories to dry steam felt hats , are heated with steam pipes . The same is true  | in baking units used to disintegrate embroidery backing . It is often necessary to superpose fabric on paper or buckram when embroidery designs are sewed into the fabric . The backing is removed from the embroidery by baking in a dry heat which will disintegrate the backing without affecting the embroidery or fabric quality . Ovens should have humidity gauges as well as temperature thermometers and heat regulators if precision drying and baking must be accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing industries may grow with the introduction of plastic materials and cementing processes into areas where plastic or cementing were not formerly used as a means of assembly or molding. 28 . Manglers or Rotary Presses Manglers used in apparel nm ; nnufactw ing are similar to home and commercial laundry type pressing manglers . Pressing manglers come in two basic types : single rotary mangling link or dual rotary mangling links . In the single rotary machine , fabric is pressed by the roller arm against a static curved link called the ironing shoe . The heating element may be located in the shoe , the roller , or both . In most single manglers , the shoe is heated directly by electricity . The roller is heated indirectly as it rolls against the shoe . The average single roller mangler contains the following components : ( 1 ) the ironing shoe , ( 2 ) the heating circuit , ( 3 ) the mangle roller , ( 4 ) the motor actuating the roller , ( 5 ) the intermediate driving system from motor to roller , ( 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulators for controlling shoe pressure on the roller , ( 8 ) thermostat for heat regulating , ( 9 ) variable speed control for governing roller velocity , ( 10 ) foot or knee controls for ( a ) intermittent pressure and ( b ) intermittent roller velocity . Intermittent speed and pressure controls should be actuated by leg devices in order to keep the operator 's hands free for re positioning the fabric without stopping during the pressing cycle . The important dimensions in a single roller mangler pressing operation are the roller diameter , the roller rpm , the shoe au e  | size , and the clearance area around the roller . The longer the shoe arc , the greater the pressing area during a roller rotation . Hence , a faster pressing rpm is possible with a larger shoe arc . Greater clearance between the roller and the machine frame permits greater flexibility in engineering methods for minimum initial positioning and extraction time values in the pressing cycle . The diameter of the roller limits the diameter of cylindrically shaped products that may be pressed in single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two basic types of conveyor presses with respect to pressing cycle time : continuous and intermittent . In the continuous conveyor press , the garment ( or section ) is pressed as it is carried on a conveyor belt underneath the pressing shoe . The pressing principle involved here is similar to that present in the single roller mangler . Such conveyor presses are used in some knit product off-pressing operations . In most of these operations , the conveyor press is serviced by a team of operators . Some operators fold and/or place sewed garments onto the conveyor belt on the section of the belt carrying the garments under the pressing shoe . Other operators remove and pack the pressed garments from the conveyor belt as the pressed garments emerge on the belt coming from under the pressing shoe . This conveyor pressing equipment consists of : ( 1 ) the conveyor table frame , ( 2 ) the conveyor belt , ( 3 ) the motor that drives the driving mechanism actuating the conveyor belt , ( 4 ) the pressing shoe , ( 5 ) the heating element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls , ( 7 ) the pressing shoe 's pressure regulating Iinkage , ( 8 ) the variable speed driving mechanism that drives the belts . A steaming unit may be incorporated into the pressing shoe if moisture is required during the pressing moment . ( See Fig . VII-15 for continuous conveyor presses . ) Continuous conveyor presses with a buck pressing action could be designed . All that would be needed is a linkage system which would rotate both bucks in a drop oscillation elliptical  | Figure pattern simultaneously on and oll the conveyor belt as the belt moved continuously . 30 . Molding Shrinkage in Apparel Manufacturing Molding shrinkage in apparel manufacturing is often a troublesome problem . At present , all fabrics used in apparel manufacturing do not have uniform residual shrinkage . This is due to the growth in the use of radical fabric construction dimensions as well as the use of blends and synthetics . These fabric changes must increase , rather than diminish , if apparel is to remain a fashion item . In fact , the health of the apparel industries as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations . In order to make the same suit model from fabrics having different residual shrinkage , the clothing manufacturer must do one or both of the following : ( 1 ) change the paper pattern , and ( 2 ) change the production conditions . Many apparel manufacturers solve this problem of shrinkage , during molding , by innumerable " cut and trys . " They resort to random " cut and try " because they are not aware that means exist for calculating the answers with the use of fabric tests before trial garments arc made . These tests eliminate the use of the many " cut and trys . " There are five different groupings of manufacturers with re-  | spect to the type of solution for residual shrinkage which the manufacturer desires . Group 1 desires a residual shrinkage test which will indicate how the paper pattern should be changed to allow for differences in residual shrinkage . This group of manufacturers does not want to change any of their production conditions . Group 2 desires a residual shrinkage test which will determine how the production conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group does not wish to change the paper pattern . Group 3 will change either paper or process conditions depending upon which avenue yields the optimum solution in terms of cost . This group desires a test which indicates the best solution in terms of cost . Group 4 does not wish to change either the paper or the process conditions . They actually desire a given residual shrinkage for given paper and process conditions . Group 5 wants a test to control differences in residual shrinkage among bolts of the same fabric . In practice , the other four groups require , if not desire , this test to some extent . Before presenting the means for satisfying each group , it is wise to analyze the types of molding shrinkage in fabric ; and , the basic principles connected with this phenomenon in apparel manufacturing . 31 . Types of Molding Shrinkage It is imperative to define all aspects of molding shrinkage because there is doubt and confusion in many areas with respect to : ( 1 ) what residual shrinkage is , ( 2 ) the different types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying the particular type of shrinkage . Shrinkage is the decrease in length , width , and/or depth of a fabric when , or after , the fabric has been subjected to change in temperature , humidity , and/or mechanical pressure . Length shrinkage refers to a decrease parallel to the warp ( or wale ) , whereas width shrinkage refers to a decrease parallel to the filling ( or course ) .  | Relaxation shrinkage is a decrease induced by the release of the tensile stress imparted to the yarns during the weaving process . When this tensile stress is removed , the elongated yarns return to their original unstretched lengths before weaving . Swelling shrinkage is a decrease induced by swelling in the yarns perpendicular to the line of shrinkage . Swelling in one set of yarns tends to crimp and shorten the yarns crossing at right angles because these yarns must now displace more depth in order to encompass the swelled yarns . The swelling is usually caused by the tendency that certain yarns have of expanding under given humidity or wetting conditions . Felting shrinkage is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarns . Most different fibers have different tndcncics to felt The structure of the yarn is another factor which controls felting . For example , woolen yarns will tend to felt more readily than worsted yarns clue to the greater amount of protruding fibers i-I woolen yarns . The 1955 Annual Yearbook of the Knitted Outerwear Times , N.Y. , states that many studies indicate that felting in knitted wool fabric varies inversely to the density of loop formation ; the greater the wale and course count per linear inch , the less the degree of felting . Fusion-contraction shrinkage is the decrease in length that takes place in synthetic yarns when they are exposed to temperatures higher than 70 ? F. ( R.H. 65% ) . The tendency of synthetic yarns to fusion-contraction shrinkage is removed in some instances by heat setting the yarn . If a synthetic yarn has a tendency to fusion-contraction and the yarn is not heat set before or after it is constructed into a fabric , this yarn will tend to fuse-contract during apparel processing with dry heat or steam . A fuse-contracted yarn changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decrease due to relaxation of fabric constructional stress ( with an absence of felting , fusion-contraction , or swelling shrinkage ) after the fabric has been pre-shrunk . Any subsequential shrinkage in a pre-shrunk fabric is not resi-  | dual shrinkage if the subsequent shrinkage is due to swelling , felting , or fusion-contraction . Let us now proceed to examine a pre-shrunk fabric , after it shrinks in a steam pressing process , to determine whether the resultant shrinkage is felting , fusion-contraction , residual , or swelling shrinkage . If felting has taken place , a pick glass ( or microscopic ) examination will show that fabric has lost its original distinct pattern of yarn structure . Here and there the fibers of adjacent yarns have interlocked to a degree where one can no longer see the definite line of tangency that previously existed between two yarns . If swelling shrinkage occurred , the fabric should have a greater thickness than it possessed before pressing . This can be verified by microscopic and/or micrometric measurement . Pocket microscopes with powers of 40 and over can often be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some cases this can be determined with a high-powered pick glass . Pocket micrometers , such as the Starett no. 1010 with markings of 0.001 inch , can be used in some situations to cross-check or establish the existence of approximate increases in fabric thicknesses . If fusion-contraction shrinkage occurred , the fabric depth ( or yarn depth ) should be less than the original depth . If residual shrinkage occurred , the fabric must have ( 1 ) its original thickness , and ( 2 ) its original pattern of yarn structure . Fabrics in which residual shrinkage has taken place will have higher yarn counts after steam pressing than the original yarn count of the pre-shrunk fabric before t he steam pressing . For example , if a wool fabric woven with 72 filling yarns per inch shows 3% residual warp shrinkage after the steam pressing , the filling count after the steam press should be 74 because 72 yarns now lie in 0.97 inch and at least 2 or more yarns are needed to complete the inch . Swelling shrinkage ; Ind fusion-contraction may yield increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retention of original fabric depth and yarn dimension with respect to fiber or filament density . Although the CCC-T-191b ( the Federal Specification for Tex-  | tile Test Methods ) lists seven tests for fabric shrinkage , and nine tests for shrinkage in apparel products , this document does not present a concise means for differentiating among the different types of shrinkage that may result in any of these tests . The same applies to the shrinkage tests listed in the CS59-44 , the ASTM Standards , ASA Standards , and TDI standards . 32 . Elongation and Shrinkage There are two other items affecting shrinkage and shrinkage measurement : tensile elongation and elongation slack . Tensile elongation is the increase in fabric or yarn length that results when a tensile stress is exerted on the fabric or yarn . This is measured in pounds per fabric linear inch ( or yarn size ) applied with tensile force that yields an increase in the elongation graph line . Elongation . clack is the increase fabric length that takes place in the fabric below the fabric increase registers on the elongation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a plane structure which is a perfect mathematically flat plane . Every fabric has a waved plane structure which is characteristic to the fabric . This wave structure of the fabric plane has a definite wave length and amplitude pattern . Tensile stress is not registered on the tensil-o-graph until the wave amplitudes have been removed . The yarns do r , ot receive a tensile stress until the wave amplitudes are removed because wave amplitudes may be removed by forces ( pushes ) other than tensile vectors ( pulls ) . Hence , elongation slack is the increase in length which results when the characteristic wave amplitude of the fabric is removed without increasing the length of the yarn parallel to the wave structure . Elongation slack must be taken into consideration toy make sure that shrinkage is not due to an increase in wave am plitude without an accompanying relaxation , swelling , felting . or fusion-contraction shrinkage . Any fabric shrinkage due to all increase in the wave amplitudes of the fabric plane , without au accompanying change in the fabric depth or slackless yarn count , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desires of the five different types of solu-  | tions many clothing manufacturers are seeking , it would seem evident that it is possible to satisfy all with one solution . Namely , pre-shrink all fabrics within the residual shrinkage tolerances such as used for Sanforization . All the manufacturers would be happy if all pre-shrunk fabrics had less than 1% residual shrinkage ( the tolerance allowed for the Sanforization process used on cottons ) . But , would that permit the manufacturers to use the same paper pattern for all fabrics if all fabrics have the same residual shrinkage ? Unfortunately , the answer is no . The inherent elongation slack has a decided effect on garment design and fit . The greater the elongation slack in a fabric , the greater the amount of fullness present in the garment before tensile strain is exerted on the garment . It is obvious that if the same paper pattern is used to make jackets from two cloths with different elongation slack , one of the jackets will have more fullness for ease when the wearer makes a motion which exerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric with the greater elongation slack will have more fullness than the other jacket . Hence , paper patterns for two fabrics with identical percentages of residual shrinkage nay have to be different if the difference between their elongation slacks is greater than the accepted tolerance for fit and design . This is particularly true in areas such as the jacket collar where the curvature of the collar fold may even lead to the necessity of a two-piece collar in order to attain proper fit with some fabrics . 33 . Shrink-grading It is obvious that fabrics with certain differences in residual shrinkages will require different paper patterns for the same sir it model . The logical question now is , " If the residual shrinkage is known , is there a means for calculating the paper pattern ( hanges without random cut and trys ? " When the residual shrinkage of a fabric is known , the paper pattern changes can Ise calculated by shrink-grading an acceptable paper pattern for . mot her fabric whose residual shrinkage is also known . Before shrink-grading the acceptable paper for a fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another fabric with a different residual shrinkage , two other factors must be considered : elongation slack and fabric torsion . Fabric torsion in woven fabric is the degree to which the two or more sets of yarns in the fabric are displaced with given stresses from their original angular relationship and desired limits of fabric wave amplitude . Those who press the roll fold in men 's jacket collars are well aware empirically of the fabric torsion factor . When the collar fold is shaped , the yarn relationship must be distorted from its original linear relationships in order to produce the curved fold in the jacket collar . Fabric torsion has two parameters : parallel displacement and oblique displacement . Adjacent yarns in the same set may be shifted in oblique or parallel fashion . Fabric torsion varies with fiber ( or filament ) , yarn size , yarn construction type , fabric construction type ( plain weave , basket weave , twill weave , etc. ) , fabric construction count , finish and the differentials in yarn diameter between the sets or groups of yarn used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration of these factors . Let us for the moment proceed with the principle of shrinkgrading a pattern for fabric A to a pattern for fabric B. In this situation both fabrics have equivalent elongation slack and fabric torsion , and fabric B has greater residual shrinkage . The residual shrinkage of A is 2% warp wise and 1% filling wise , whereas B has 3% warp shrinkage and 2% filling shrinkage . All are residual shrinkages . Sketches ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of Fig . VII-16 show how these residual shrinkages affect equal squares of each fabric . These sketches are not made in true scale . The scales used here are 10 , 20 , and 30% in order to better illustrate the principle involved . In order to compensate for the additional 1% warp shrinkage and 1% filling shrinkage in B , the paper pattern for B must be increased in this ratio with the same distribution of percent shrinkage for each section of the pattern . Therefore , when t h i s is applied to a back pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VII-14 . Line 1 , the 100% or full width of the  | pattern , must be increased by a length equal to the additional 1% residual filling shrinkage in Fig . VII-16(c) , whereas line 4 , which is 30% of line 1 , must be increased only 30% of the total increase in width . The same principle applies to the other widths and lengths . Line 9 , 100% full length of the pattern , must be increased by a length equal to the additional 1% residual warp shrinkage in Fig . VII-17 , whereas line 6 ( which Figure is 8% of line 9 ) must be increased only 8% of the total increase in length . If line 9 is 311/2 " in pattern A and A has 2% residual warp shrinkage , then pattern A will shrink 0.625 inch or 5/s inch during the pressing operations . In order to allow for 3% residual warp shrinkage in B , 0.3125 inch ( x/16 inch ) must be added to the pattern with the following distribution : Table If one does not desire to have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for line 8 , 1/ " for line 7 and nothing for line 6 . The same mathematical approach would be used for distribut ing allowances for the increased residual filling shrinkage in fabric B. Line 4 would receive 30% of 0.11 inches which is the t ( it al increase necessary for line 1 , the longest filling dimension in the pattern . Since line 4 must increase 0.033 inches , %2 "  | ( 0.0312 ) may be used as a close approximation . One could use if a safety factor is desired . If one were to add %6 " in the length at the bottom of the jacket and approximately i/g " in the width on the side , these allowances would yield a distorted fitting in the pressed piece . The neck , across shoulder , and across back widths would all be 1 % narrower than they should be . If to this , one adds the 1 % shortage in length , it is easy to see how the curvature of the neck would be distorted as well as short . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . Proper shrink grading will yield a jacket with the same pitch and drape as the model made with fabric A. The same approach that is used in shrink grading for additional shrinkage should be used in shrink grading for a fabric with less shrinkage . For example , if fabric C showed no residual shrinkage in pressing , then pattern A must be reduced ( in order to use it for C ) with a proportional distribution , in each . se ( tion , of 2% in the warp and 1% in the filling . Here 0.33 inc h ( approximately % " ) must be removed from the width , and from the length , with proportional shrink-grading . This will  | true the pattern to the finished curves and dimensions desired in the finished garment . 34 . Shrinkage Quality Control Sometimes fabrics do not decrease in length during a pressing operation to the same degree shown by the fabric 's residual shrinkage tests . In fact , some fabrics may even show increases in length during a pressing operation although the residual shrinkage tests showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by insufficient control in the pressing operations . A sufficient change in humidity or heat during the pressing operation will cause improper shrinkage . An increase in mechanical pressure , or in the presser 's tensile manipulations , may remove the fabric 's characteristic wave amplitude . These may prohibit the fabric from having the proper residual shrinkage . If the fabric 's original wave amplitude has been removed or decreased appreciably , the fabric will have lost all or part of its elongation slack . Elongation slack and fabric torsion must be considered before one proceeds to shrink-grade a set of patterns . If the elongationslack is to be removed from the new fabric in order to give it a desired finish in the pressing , it may be necessary to discount some of the allowance one intended to add for additional residual shrinkage present in the new fabric . It may even be necessary to reduce the pattern for the new fabric , instead of increasing the pattern , if the increase due to diminished elongat ion is greater than the additional increase in residual shrinkage . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some fabric or pattern areas while decreasing it in other . eras . This may yield objectionable puckers or cockles . Such sit nations call for strict adherence to curvature values as well as linear dimensions . Some fabrics have high degrees of torsion with low degrees of torsion retention . Torsion retention is the capacity of a fabric to retain the degree of fabric torsion to which outside forces have distorted it , after these forces stopped cicling on the fabric . A fabric may have a low degree of fabric  |p464  torsion ( which is actually a high degree of torsion resistance ) although it has a high degree of torsion retention . It is comparatively very difficult to distort the original yarn relationships in such fabrics ; but , once distorted , the yarns will not return to their original angular relationship unless definite outside forces are employed to realign the distorted yarns . Hence , a new fabric should be tested for elongation slack and fabric torsion , as well as residual shrinkage , before one proceeds to shrink-grade a proven set of patterns ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used for this new fabric with different residual shrinkage . The amount with which one shrink grades the pattern will be the integrated value of the sum of residual shrinkage , elongation slack , and fabric torsion. 35 . Shrinkage with Heat and/or Moisture Although sonic fabrics will shrink when subjected to dry temperatures over 200 ? F. , most fabrics shrink best with moisture and higher temperatures . Pressing is the process with which the fabric is molded with heat and/or moisture into the shape required for the finished apparel product . Steam is used for most pressing operations in men 's clothing manufacturing . Steaming or baking ( dry heat ) is the means with which torsion retention or torsion resistance can be increased in a fabric . In order to control steaming properly in a pressing operation one must be aware of the following : ( 1 ) the affect of temperature differences on the fabric ; ( 2 ) the affect of moisture differences on the fabric ; and ( 3 ) the relationship between steam pressure and its temperature and humidity values . Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationships between steam pressure , temperature , and moisture ( in terms of dry saturated steam ) . The table shows that when a steam pressure gauge reads 65 lbs . The temperature is 312 ? F. and the specific volume of the steam is 5.47 cu . ft. /Ili. of water if the steam is dry saturated steam . Dry saturated st ea n is the water vapor made from water subjected to given tempera tare and pressure conditions . For example , the water iii a boiler containing 80 lbs . of absolute steam pressure ( 65 His .  |p465  steam pressure plus 15 lbs . atmospheric pressure ) will not turn to steam until the water reaches 312 ? F. The water becomes saturated liquid when it reaches the temperature and pressure at which it turns to dry saturated steam .  |p466  Wet steam is a mixture of dry saturated steam and saturated liquid . Lowering the temperature of a dry saturated steam condenses the steam to moisture , which in turn lowers the steam pressure . Hence , in order to prohibit dry steam from condensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible . Superheated steam is a dry water vapor which has a temperature greater than the temperature of dry saturated steam . The superheat is the difference - between the temperature of the superheated steam and the heat of dry saturated steam at that pressure . An examination of the specific volume of dry saturated steam pressures , listed in Table VII-3 shows that the lower the steam pressure the greater the volume of steam needed to impart a desired amount of moisture to the fabric area during the pressing operation . For example , if one wishes to pass one pound of water in vapor form on or through a fabric , 5.16 cu . ft. of steam would be required at 70 lbs . of dry saturated steam pressure , whereas 8.515 cu . ft. would be required at 35 lbs . At half the pressure of 70 lbs . approximately 70% more steam volume must be used to bring the same amount of moisture to the same fabric area . If 75 lbs. , 50 lbs. , and 25 lbs . of steam pressure are selected , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.896 , 6.655 , and 10.498 cu . ft . In this case approximately 36% more steam is required at 50 lbs . pressure , and 116% more steam is required at 25 lbs . pressure in order to equate the available moisture content of 75 lbs . steam pressure . The bringing of a given amount of steam to the fabric does not necessarily mean that all of the moisture in the steam will be imparted to the fabric . The greater the difference in temperature between the fabric ( immediately prior to steaming ) and the steam temperature , the greater the condensation . The speed of steaming and the porosity of the fabric will also affect condensation ; the slower the rate of condensation with which a given amount of steam flows over , or through the fabric , the greater the moisture condensation of the fabric . Appendix S is extracted from the Cleaning Laundry World 's Fiber Identification Chart ( copyright , Cahir Publ ish-  |p467  ing Co . ) . This extraction lists a set of recommended finishing temperatures and the tendency various fibers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not list absolute percentages of shrinkage for the terms , " medium , " " low , " and " high . " Neither does the chart give the conditions under which the listed type of shrinkage takes place . The chart does not state whether the terms medium , low , and high refer to the capacity of these fibers ( or yarns ) to shrink and/or felt . The following data , released by DuPont in Bulletin X-56 ( Textile Technical Service ) , Sept. 1956 , lists certain sizes and types of DuPont synthetic yarns and gives their shrinkages ( in per cent ) at an air temperature of 350 ? F. for an exposure of 0.1 hour ( 6 minutes ) : acetate 75-24-Br , 0.9 ; Dacron 220-50-5100 , 5.9 ; nylon 840-140-300 , 0.3 ; Orlon 100-40-81 S.D. , 1.0 ; Orlon Bdpf , 42 S.D. , 1.4 ; rayon 1650-720-258 , 1.6 ; silk 13/15 Japan , 0.1 . Statistics such as these are indications of what may happen during baking and steaming processes . The exact shrinkage of a fabric , when submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fabric construction and finish as well as fiber and yarn size . Finishes with shrinkage inhibitors , anti-shrink compounds , are one of tlhe means used to diminish a fabric 's capacity to shrink during apparel processing . 36 . Measuring Shrinkage Conditions The previous sections on the analysis of shrinkage contain the basic principles one needs for developing the various shrinkage tests desired by the five groups of clothing manufacturers listed in Section 30 . In order to use these principles one must have reliable instruments for measuring temperature , steam pressure , and humidity ( or moisture content ) . Steam pressure should be measured directly by steam pressure gauges located within no more than 5 ft. of the steam outlet . The piping from . the pressure gauge to the steam outlet should be sufficiently insulated to prevent condensation which affects the validity of the steam pressure readings . The greater the temperature of the outer perimeter of the insulated pipe , the greater the probability of condensation in the pipe .  |p468  Some steaming and pressing equipment have steam pressure gauges and thermometers ( temperature gauges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine immediately whether the steam is dry saturated steam , superheated steam , or wet steam . If the temperature of the steam pressure reads less than the pressure 's dry saturated steam temperature , the steam is wet steam ; whereas , if the temperature reads higher than the pressure 's dry saturated steam temperature , the steam is superheated steam . Since most pressing machines do not have temperature gauges , it becomes necessary to measure the temperature of the pressbucks ( or iron ) with a valid thermometer or potentiometer . Thermocouple potentiometers are excellent instruments for this purpose . Since the thermocouple wire is relatively thin ( the approximate thickness of a pencil point ) , it is very easy to attach the thermocouple to steam outlets , or pressing areas , without disrupting or changing the pressing conditions . Although the moisture gain ( and drying factor ) of a fabric can be calculated mathematically from the temperature readings and other data , it is quicker to approximate this for practical purposes by weighing the fabric before and after the steaming ( and drying ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5 different types of shrinkage problems listed in Section 30 will show that the manufacturers in group 5 have no problem determining the pattern and/or pressing conditions they require for any specific fabric possessing a given degree of residual shrinkage . What bothers them is how to test for piece to piece control . All they want is a quality control test to determine whether each piece of a specific fabric will have the same residual shrinkage under the same pressing conditions . In their experience everything goes well in processing the specific fabric , except that a bolt ( or few bolts ) now and then possesses too much or too little residual shrinkage . This is caused by variations in one or more of these three areas : ( 1 ) variations in pressing conditions : changes in temperature , //  |p469  humidity , or steam pressure ; ( 2 ) variations in the fabric : construction , finish , etc. ; and ( 3 ) variations in the sponging or preshrinking process . It should be understood that the term variation , here , means fluctuations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing conditions is often the cause of faulty piece to piece residual shrinkage . Equipment conditions can be removed as a possible cause by incorporating valid temperature and steam pressure indicators and regulators in the proper place in the pressing equipment . ( The same applies to sponging . Here humidity controls would have to be added , too . ) These devices tell the operator , immediately , when the pressing conditions are incorrect for yielding the required residual shrinkage for the fabric . There are two methods the apparel manufacturer may use for testing residual shrinkage consistency in bolt to bolt of a given fabric : ( 1 ) 100% sampling with a residual shrinkage test ; or ( 2 ) selected sampling : testing only those bolts which have evidence indicating a high probability of a shrinkage differential . In 100% sampling , a tar ion of a yard is tested from every Dolt . Basically , the test sample is pressed with an integrated pressing condition ( time , temperature , and moisture values ) equivalent to the total shrinkage processes to which the apparel product is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from plant to plant if the integrations vary beyond certain limits . For many fabrics the integrated steam pressing conditions , necessary for the residual shrinkage test , will be approximately equal to the steam pressure and pressing time of the steam pressing operation which has the greatest steam pressure and time cycle of all the pressing operations used in producing the ; arnrent . Such tests must also include the drying ( vacuuming ) 1 ondit ions used for this pressing process . I n some cases the test will consist of the maximum steam pressure used for a time equal to the sum of all the steam  |p470  pressing times , regardless of the different steam pressures used in the various pressing operations . In other tests the integrated pressing conditions for the test will be equal to the steam pressure and pressing time of that operation which passes the most moisture into the fabric . Rarely , if ever , should the steam pressure be greater than the steam pressure whose temperature value is greater than the disintegration temperature for the fiber or filament . These disintegration temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Appendix B. This principle is particularly vital when an electric steam iron is the process or test equipment ( especially a rheostat iron ) . The mechanical pressure may be zero in most cases . When mechanical pressure tends to affect shrinkage , this value must be included in tlhe test . After the exact conditions have been determined , these should be applied to a piece more than 20 " square ( approximately 24 " X 24 " ) on which a fine line has been marked in a 20 " square whose sides are parallel to the warp and filling . It is best to make all measurements with a stick rule which has markings in 1/64 inch or less . Measurements should never be made with a rule possessing gradations of more than a 1/16 inch because the margin of human error in reading will be too large . Human error should be reduced by taking at least five differently placed measurements for each value to determine whether the standard deviation denotes a consistent average value . If not , the sample size for the measurement should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistically . The percentage of residual shrinkage is equal to ( length before pressing ) - ( length after pressing ) X 100 ( length before pressing ) In some cases a 10 " sample may be used . However , the measurement rule must never have gradations less than 1/U4 inch for such cases because 1% of 10 " is 0.1 inch . This indicates that  |p471  precise measurements for residual shrinkage of 1% , or less , require measurements of %/6 inch and less . All measurements should be made on a hard , flat surface which is in a vertical position . If possible , the measurements may be made when suspended between the jaws of a tensile testing machine . ( Few such machines , however , will accommodate a 24 " length . ) The elongation slack should be measured before and after pressing to see whether this changes appreciably . Since many manufacturers would loathe cutting a fraction of a yard out of a bolt in order to test residual shrinkage , this can be avoided by testing an exposed section of the fabric when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section approximately 5 to 10 yards inside an unrolled end of the bolt . Greater precision and objectivity in measurement is possible with a cut piece because elongation slack and torsion can be tested precisely on tensile testers with chart recorders . Pick glass and micrometer measurement ( for determining whether felting , swelling , or fusion-contraction shrinkage occurred ) can be done in less time on the cut piece than on the bolt . Total testing cost will be the factor which dictates the exact test procedure for any 100% sampling . A typical shrinkage testing machine consists of two principal units , the electrically heated press and the wringer . The fabric to be tested is covered by a damp press cloth and pressed in the heated press . Previously to this , the press cloth was wetted and w rung through the wringer to insure a given saturation throughnc t the press cloth . This is checked by weight on a scale attached to the wringer unit . The bed of the press has a grid of fine grooves at right angles to each other to permit fluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press cloth consists of 2 pieces , the fabric to be tested is placed between the pieces . ) A 20 " square is measured on the dampened and pressed test fabric before it is pressed . This area is measured after the test ' cloth is pressed and dried . The effectiveness of this test depends of course on the correlations that exists between this pressing pro-  |p472  cedure and the integration of the pressing operations the fabric is submitted to in apparel processing . The integration value for the pressing in the apparel processing can be changed in this machine by varying one or more of the following values in the test : ( 1 ) the moisture content in the press cloths , ( 2 ) the heat of the press , and ( 3 ) the mechanical pressure of the press . 38 . Mathematics for Residual Shrinkage Sampling Mathematical analysis is the basic means used for selected sampling ; the process of testing only those bolts which have evidence indicating non-acceptable residual shrinkage . From the viewpoint of the apparel manufacturer , two bolts of cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finish are not equivalent if their reactions to the same apparel prodmction conditions ate different . " phis should be as axiomatic to the fabric producer as it is to the apparel producer . " 1 " lie problem now is to determine tolerance levels in the u ile rn.led value of fiber(s) , yarn(s) , construction and finish , which indicate the limits for equivalency from the viewpoint of the apparel producer . This is particularly important since every one of the four enumerated fabric factors is actually a variable and not an attribute , in terms of measurement . When does an 18 oz. /56 " wool serge cease to he an 18 oz. /56 " wool serge ? What are the plus and minus tolerance levels beyond which the fabric is no longer 18 oz. /56 " wool serge ? Any deviation in sponging or residual shrinkage , beyond certain limits , is an indication that there was a lack of required consistency in the cloth 's fabrication and/or in the sponging conditions ( assuming the apparel producing conditions are constant ) . For example , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oz. /56 " serge is 5% in the warp and 2 " ; , in the filling in order to yield a desired residual shrinkage of 2% warp shrinkage and I% filling shrinkage ender given pressing conditions . The tolerances for the sponging shrinkage and the residual shrinkage is ? ' ! u " J , for each . Therefore , the total shrinkage after the sponging and pressing are ( 5 ? - I/I ) per cent  |p473  + ( 2 ? Y4 ) ( 95 ? 4 ) per cent warp shrinkage and ( 2 ? % ) per cent + ( 1 ? ) 4 ) ( 98 ? % ) per cent filling shrinkage . For illustrative purposes we will simplify this by approximating the warp shrinkage as 7 ? 1/% , and filling shrinkage at 3 ? 1/2% . This means that if a bolt sponge shrinks 4%% ( warp ) and press shrinks 1%% ( residual warp ) , the total warp shrinkage is 61/2% ; whereas if another bolt sponge shrinks 51/. % and press shrinks 21/1% , the total warp shrinkage is 71A% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits permit a pattern with a sponged 32 inch warp length to finish 31.44 inches long with 61,20/o total shrinkage and 31.28 inches long with 71/2% total shrinkage . The difference 0.16 is slightly less than is " . This is the difference in shrinkage between two equal pattern sections cut from two bolts which have these different shrinkages . These are not suggested tolerance limits . They are used merely to illustrate the principles for setting tolerance limits . Different firms may have different tolerance limits because their marketing and/or production policies differ . When a fabric that is exactly 18 oz. /56 " sponge shrinks exactly 5 ? J , warp and 2% filling , its square inch weight of 0.00893 oz. changes to ( 1.0 ( 1959 . II this weight ( 0.00959 ) is given a tolerance of *3% , the limits for this mean reight becomes 0.00930 for the minimum value and 0.00988 for the maximum value . Any yield per square inch in sponged cloth outside these limits should be tested because there is a strong probability that the fabric has not been sponged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic approach can be used for calculating the probability of different shrinkage potentials in the sponging process . 39 . Shrinkage Sampling Procedure Therefore , the mathematical procedure for determining which bolts should be tested is as follows : I. Calculate the mean weight per square inch of the sponged bolt .  |p474  2 . Calculate the tolerance limits of the mean weight per square inch of the sponged bolt . 3 . Calculate the weight per square inch of a sponged bolt which was sponged within the tolerance limits for length and width . 4 . If 3 is higher or lower than 2 , the bolt should be tested for residual shrinkage . Let us tabulate the shrinkage values of the extreme tolerance limits for an 18 oz. /56 " serge which has pre-sponging acceptance tolerance limits of 18 oz. ? 2% and 56 " ? % " . In this case any bolt lighter than 17.64 oz. /561/2 " , or heavier than 18.36 oz. /55% " , can not be accepted as an 18 oz. /56 " fabric . Table VII-4 lists the minimum , mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinkage specifications of 5 ? 1/4 % warp sponging shrinkage and 2 ? 14% filling sponging shrinkage are required . Although the acceptance limits for bolt weight per yard of a full width is ? 2% ( which is tighter than the 3% tolerance for the weight per square inch ) all bolts which have square inch yields of less than .00930 and more than 0.00988 should be tested for residual shrinkage . If a ? 2% level was accepted for the mean weight per square inch of sponged cloth , the acceptance limits would be 0.00940 and 0.00978 . Assuming that the sponging conditions are constant , this procedure presents a means of selecting those bolts which have  |p475  the highest probability of being akin to " watered stock " in one way or another . These are fabrics which do not have a true weight per square inch with respect to fiber content , yarn size and/or yarn count . The original presponged fabric may have the required weight and width per running yard , but it may be a false weight , a " watered stock " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yarn dimensions in such measure as to fail in yielding the desired consistency in weight and tension when submitted to prescribed sponging and pressing conditions . The principles presented here and in Sections 33 and 38 , which were applied to solving a problem in woven fabric shrinkage , hold true with respect to shrinkage in knit fabrics . In problems on knitted fabrics the terms wale and course would be substituted for warp and filling when used in these sections . 40 . Types of Residual Shrinkage Tests Test for Group 1 This group of apparel producers does not want to change production conditions . They wish to press all fabrics with the same steam pressure ( if possible ! ) . Hence , the test for this group is one in which the fabric must be tested for residual shrinkage at the apparel manufacturer 's steam pressure . The variable in t his test is time . This test consists of a series of time tests designed to determine residual shrinkage with respect to time . When the results of five or more well spaced time tests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other for related shrinkage , the resultant graph line will indicate the exact time heeded to yield the required residual shrinkage with the constant steam pressure used in the tests . In some cases residual shrinkage , under constant steam pressure , may be correlated to changes in mechanical pressure as well as time . In these cases the same graph technics can be employed for locating the necessary mechanical pressure . . The conditions , listed for test piece size and measurement in test no. l for group 5 , should be used for this test series ..  |p476  After the residual shrinkage ( elongation slack , etc. ) is determined , the acceptable pattern for a previously used fabric with known residual shrinkage can be adjusted with shrink- , grading . If the residual shrinkage for the previous fabric of the acceptable pattern is not known , this can be determined by testing the sponged fabric with a test equivalent to the proper integrated pressing conditions ( see test no. 1 for group 5 ) . Test for Group 2 This group does not wish to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will indicate how the production conditions should be changed in order to yield the residual shrinkage for which the pattern was made . Here the desired residual shrinkage is known . II it is not known in absolute terms of percentages , this can be ( letcrumined easily ( see group 5 , test no. 1 ) . ' phis group must use two tests . The first test is the same graph test recommended for group 1 , in which time ( and possibly mechanical pressure ) is the tested variable . In the second test series , steam pressure is added as a variable . The required pressing conditions for the desired residual shrinkage can be read from the two graph lines ( or a composite of both graphs ) . Test for Group 3 This group will change either paper or process conditions depending on which yields the optimum solution . Hence , this group would use both tests presented for group 2 . The graphs of these tests must be evaluated to determine which set of conditions is the optimum solution , with respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utility costs . Test for Group 4 This group does not want to change either the paper pattern or the pressing process conditions . Hence , this group wants all fabrics to have equivalent residual shrinkage , elongation slack ,  |p477  and fabric torsion for a given set of pressing conditions . The test conditions for this group is equal to the given set of pressing conditions . 41 . Dimensional Stability Dimensional stability is the degree with which a fabric retains its physical dimensions under varying conditions of heat , moisture and/or mechanical forces . Some fabrics may swell , shrink or elongate , or wrinkle after being submitted to a set of prescribed sponging and pressing processes which yield the desired residual shrinkage . This lack of dimensional stability is often due to the fabric 's reaction to severe changes in climatic condition : temperature and relative humidity . This is true of fabrics which have exceedingly high degrees of hygroscopicity or desorption . The increase or decrease of moisture in these fabrics often alter their plane structures ( wave amplitude ) and elongation slack . This changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during processing was correct . Such latent dimensional instability under severe climatic change , can be prohibited by treating the fabric chemically , or with heat setting , to diminish the hygroscopic or desorption powers of the fabric . The May 12 , 1 ! ) 59 issue of the Daily News Record , p. 22 , reports that in the opinion of the Swedish Institute for Textile Research ( Gothenburg , Sweden ) the use of chemicals instead of hot water or steam , in the setting treatment given woolens , would be one of the most progressive steps the wool textile industry could take in competing with other apparel fiber trades . The Institute maintains that current experiments being condoeted there show that this treatment should be applied at the textile mill level rather than in the clothing factory . The results from these tests are said to show that such chemical treatment iniproves the crease resistance of wool , reduces shrinkage , and prevents deterioration of the fabric following contact with rain . It is suggested that the best chemicals to be used in the setting process for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thioglycolate . These are by no means the only usable chemi-  |p478  cals . It was found that better results were obtained when these chemicals were combined with an anti-felting treatment . 42 . Wash and Wear Shrinkage Tests Wash and wear garments are garments that retain original pressed-in creases and are wrinkle free after repeated washing and drying . These garments do not require ironing after washing because the garments did not possess creases or wrinkles after washing or drying . A wash and wear shrinkage test should not include ironing or pressing , whereas a laundry shrinkage test should include ironing or pressing before the dried garment is measured for laundering shrinkage . Although the ASTM Standards on Textile Materials , the CCC-T-191b , the CS59-44 , and AATCC Tests , list many laundry shrinkage tests , they contain no specific wash and wear shrinkage tests as yet . The " Good Housekeeping " Institute laboratories has its own test for measuring " wash and wear " claims before it accepts such advertising . They list four types of wash and wear tests . At present , wash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability in regard to freedom from wrinkles and unprocessed creases after launderings : ( 1 ) laundered garments requiring no ironing after drying ; ( 2 ) laundered garments requiring little ironing after drying ; and ( 3 ) laundered garments requiring touch-up ironing after drying . " Little ironing " here applies to ironing sections of the garments without seams ; whereas , " touch-up " ironing applies to ironing sewed sections of garments , such as seams , hems , lapel and collar edges . There is a distinct difference in garments requiring " little ironing " and those requiring " touch-up " ironing . Before discussing these differences and approaches for ' treating such problems , it is necessary to examine what a fabric needs , to be called a " wash and wear " fabric . There are three kinds of wash and wear fabrics with respect to the drying action : drip-dry , hang-dry , and spin-dry . In dripdry wash and wear fabrics , the fabric should be such that the weight of the saturated dripping garment should be sufficient  |p479  to pull out wrinkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Failing this , this fabric should be such that its characteristic is not only crease resistant , but also wrinkle resistant in a wet state as well as a dry state . In hang-dry fabrics , the weight of a damp garment should be sufficient to free the garment of nonprocessed wrinkles and creases . If this fabric does n't possess this capacity , it too should have a finish and construction which makes it crease resistant and wrinkle resistant in either a wet or dry state . Since spin-dry garments are never suspended for drying , such fabrics must have a construction and finish which is crease-resistant and wrinkle resistant in either a wet , damp or dry state . We can now classify these fabrics into two major groups : 1 . Those which are crease-resistant and wrinkle resistant in a wet , damp or dry state . 2 . Those possessing a finish and construction which permits unprocessed wrinkles and creases to be " pressed-out " of the garment by gravity tensile force when the garment is suspended freely in a wet or damp state . These two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods : a . Coating or impregnation finishing treatment ? the fabric is treated and coated and/or impregnated with a resin , silicone , urea or other similar type finishes which gives the fabric a resilience that resists crease-wrinkle formations in the average wearing situations and laundering operations . With this finish the chemical structure of the fibers and yarns are not changed ; their physical characteristics are changed by coating or impregnating their physical structures . l . Chemical change finishes ? the fabric is treated with helnicals which alters the chemical composition of the fiber . The fiber is not coated or impregnated ; it takes on a new helnical structure such as mercerized cotton . c . Fiber and yarn treatment ? the fiber or yarns is structured in a manner which imbues it with the characteristics necessary for wash and wear fabrics . At present , this means is employed  |p480  mainly for man-made fibers , but in time chemical or electrical or mechanical processes may be developed to change the natural physical characteristics of plant and animal fibers . Regardless of which method is used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stiff fabrics with little resilience will crease and wrinkle . Such fabrics require more precise working conditions for sewing and apparel processing . For example , a lack of precision in processing conditions tends to produce large percentages of yarn severance , puckering , and/or gathering in sewing operations . This is due to two factors : stiffness and low coefficient of friction . Fabrics with such finishes often have low coefficients of friction correlated inversely to the degree of stiffness . ( The method and approach for removing yarn sever , Mt e , puckering or gathering in wash and wear fabrics is no dilferent than that used for any other fabic , sec ( ; halter V. ) Garments requiring . touch-up ironing " have puckers or cockles which must be pressed out . These eruptions can be caused by inappropriate thread , linings , and/or trimmings as well as faulty sewing . The linings , trimmings ( lace , zippers , tape , etc. ) , interlinings , and thread in wash acrd wear garments must possess the same degree of laundering residual shrinkage as the wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by differences in shrinkage . The need for " touch-up ironing " is often an indication that the sewing thread , zipper tape or lining used at the seam shrinks more than the fabric in laundering . When zippers or linings are seamed to the wash and wear fabric they will cockle the fabric if they shrink more or less than the fabric . In cases where cockling is not caused by a difference in shrinkages , the cockling is due to one or more of three factors : ( 1 ) faulty sewing : gathering or puckering , ( 2 ) pattern design : uneven seam lengths which call for gathering , and ( 3 ) the fabric 's stabilized wave length ( see p. 286 ) . Sometimes the gathers or puckers are made in the sewing but they are pressed out during the manufacture of the garment . This pressing does not always flatten them permanently . When the gar-  |p481  ment is washed , the water plasticizes the fibers and yarns . The addition of water to the compressed area and the plastic state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pushed and spread into their original gathered position . " Touch-up " pressing dries and remolds them back to flat position pressed in during manufacturing . Probably the best example for illustrating the controversial nature at present of wash-and-wear testing are two reports in the Daily News Record of Nov. 30 , 1959 ( pg 1 ) and Dec. 1 , 1959 ( pg 1 ) . In Nov. , 1959 , BAMA ( Boy 's Apparel and Accessories Manufacturer 's Ass'n. , Inc. ) issued specification and test methods for wash-and-wear fabrics for its members . The Nov. 30 news report stated that TEA ( Textile Fabrics Ass'n. ) opposed the BAMA wash-and-wear rules . TFA suggested instead the standards " should be established under the auspices of a federal agency , such as the Federal Trade Commission . " The Dec. 1 news report stated that BAMA maintained the TFA attitude was " completely contrary to the point of view expressed by numerous outstanding prime sources in the textile and finishing fields who have commended BAMA for its program , purpose and method . " The biggest controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring the smoothness of the fabric 's appearance , the property old being wrinkle-free . The tests for this used by BAMA , AIL , and other groups rely on subjective human judgment for comparing the fabric 's appearance to a set of rated photographs of fabrics possessing varying degrees and types of wrinkles and creases . In 1959 Scrn fo7 ized , a division of Cluett , Peabody , R Co. , announced the development of a testing machine , the Electronic Smoothness Evaluator , for measuring the wrinkle factor in a fabric objectively . 43 . Direct Heat Sealing The advent of sheet and film plastics in the apparel and allied industries expanded the use of heat sealing as an assembly jrrocess in these industries . When plastic film was first assembled by scaling ( instead of sewing ) , direct heat was used as the means  |p482  of fusing together the adjacent plies . The plastic films were heated by contact with heated metal surfaces . The plastic films which were to be bonded were sandwiched between two metal , surfaces ( called platens ) which were heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or high electrical frequencies . The surface heat of the platens melted the adjacent plastic films . The pressure of the platens on the plastic films was designed to give the melted films sufficient proximity to enable them to fuse together as one when the melted plastic cooled . In some cases , where comparatively narrow fusing areas were desired , wires were used as platen surfaces . The sealing time is equal to the melting time plus the cooling time . This sealing time is governed by eight factors : ( 1 ) temperature of the platen surface , ( 2 ) temperature of the plastic immediately before the platen is applied , ( 3 ) the melting point of the plast(f) the thickness of the plastic , ( 5 ) the pressure of the platens , ( 6 ) the temperature and humidity of the work place , ( 7 ) specific heat of the plastic , and ( 8 ) the area of the seal . Electric current with thermostatic controls are the best means for heating direct heat platens . Thermostatic controls and the ease with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design of electrical systems.which give even distribution of temperature , with tight tolerance limits on the platen surfaces . It is for this reason that electrical heating systems have displaced flame , gas , and liquid heating systems in heat sealing machines . Direct heat sealing has some disadvantages for certain types and thicknesses of film . It is difficult to get uniform melting in thick films . This may cause distortion on the outer surfaces of the films due to excessive melting on these surfaces which are adjacent to the hot platens . This distortion is compounded when the platen pressure exceeds the pressure needed for film contact . If the adjacent fihns are compressed by the platen then the melted plastic at the platen surfaces will tend to exude out from under the edges of the platen . When heat is transferred directly from an electrically heated  |p483  platen or electrode to the plastic film , the plastic does not acquire the heat quickly . Also , the presence of the heated platen prevents the melted plastic from cooling rapidly . Comparatively long heating and cooling times are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing systems were designed to lower the heating and cooling time necessary for heat sealing . 44 . Electronic or High Frequency Sealing High frequency heat sealing is the process of melting the entire thickness of a plastic film simultaneously by setting up a high frequency current uniformly throughout the entire thickness of the plastic film . It is believed that the high frequency electrical energy develops heat in the dielectric material , the plastic being sealed , by means of molecular friction . The electric field , alternating its polarity millions of times per second , subjects the molecules of the plastic to a pattern of friction stress which develops sufficient heat to melt and fuse the agitated- area of the plastic . The metal platens become electrodes from which a high frequency current is set up throughout the film thickness . Two facts make high frequency heating an ideal system for sealing plastic films together : ( 1 ) plastic films tend to be poor electric conductors and therefore the dielectric losses in the film will develop heat uniformly throughout the film ; and ( 2 ) most metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this permits the platens to refrain from heating up dangerously during the application of current . This enables the comparatively cold electronic platens to take heat away quickly from the elect conically heated plastic and then to transfer the heat into the air . Since plastic has relatively low heat conductivity , electronic heat sealing is much faster than direct heat sealing because the plastic will heat and cool quicker . This factor is the reason why it is easier to seal 3 or more plies of thin film than two thicker plies of the same film whose combined thickness is equal to the 3 or more plies . The greatest losses occur where the plies meet ; the greater the number of ply junctures the greater the  |p484  opportunity for heat to transfer from the film to the air and/or electrodes . The quality of a heat seal in a given plastic film is governed by three factors : ( 1 ) heating frequency and current , ( 2 ) the time during which the current and frequency is applied , and ( 3 ) the pressure of the electrodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic heat sealing can be estimated with the following equation : Sealing time = W X F X H 3413XK where if = the weight ( lbs. ) of the area of the sealing seam ; F = the required temperature rise in ? F. , the difference between the plastics melting and fusing temperature and the temperature of the plastic lust helm ( ' the scaling process ; H = the specific heal of the plastic , the Btu 's necessary to raise the temperature of I pound of plastic . I ? F. ; and K = the kw of the electronic sealing machines power generator . When 3413 , the Btu 's per kw hour , is used the answer is in fraction hours . If the answer is desired in fraction minutes , substitute 57 for 3413 . This equation does not allow for heat losses , hence one may have to allow for heat losses incurred by conductors or radiation . The greater the current the greater the heat developed . The choice of frequency depends on the characteristics of the plastic . Since heat loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often difficult to seal exceptionally thin films ( 0.003 or less ) . In such cases buffers , which have low heat conductivity and high melting points , are placed between the electrode platens and the film to prevent the heat in the film from dissipating too quickly . Bakelite and silicones are two of the popular buffers . Since insufficient pressure does not yield sufficient contact between the plies , and since excessive pressure leads to estrusiou at the edges of the seal and platen , the spacing between the platens when pressure is applied should be equal to the depth which is slightly less than the sum of the thickness of the plies  |p485  being sealed . The exact dimension of this depth will equal the compression factor of the plastic . This is the degree to which the density of the plastic thickness can be increased by mechanical pressure . The current and time used in any sealing operation will vary with the length and width of the seal as well as the characteristics and thickness of the plastic film being sealed . In order to determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing a given plastic , the minimum and maximum pressures should be determined first . The median pressure between these two points should be used as the first trial pressure . Using the smallest power input as a constant , the time factor should be increased to determine the heat-sealing time for the minimum power input . The next step is to heat seal with time ( smallest time unit possible ) as a constant and power as the variable . An examination of values for the both sets of trials will show which series contains the optimum sealing conditions . Uneven thickness in the ply of a film , foreign matter between the plies , and air gaps between platen or film surfaces , will cause arcing between the platens or through the film . Rough platen surfaces and sharp platen edges are also a source of arcing . These causes of arcing can be eliminated by smoothing the surfaces or rounding of the edges with fine abrasives such as emery cloth .. 45 . Electronic Heat Sealing Equipment There are two basic types of electronic heat sealing equipment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat-sealing equipment , and continuous or rotary feed heat scalers . The continuous sealers , such as the Singer 248-2 , are similar to sewing machines with respect to feeding principle , whereas the bar sealers are akin to buck presses in feed principle . A continuous rotary feed electronic sealer is a machine in w hich a pair of rotary feeds act as the electrodes instead of a stationary electrode and a complimentary oscillating foot elect i ode as in the Singer 248-2 . Isar sealers are the same , electronically , as the Singer con-
