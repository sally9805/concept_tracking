Since men first started slinging stones at one another , the most tried and true of all military maxims has been : take the high ground . Today , that high ground exists even beyond the earth 's atmosphere . <P> Last week , as Russian Cosmonauts Popovich and Nikolayev sang patriotic songs while whirling about in outer space ( see WORLD ) , they provided new evidence that the Soviet Union is deadly serious about seizing control of the new high ground . <P> American reaction to the Soviet spectacular ranged from grudging admiration to scoffing irrelevance . President Kennedy congratulated the Russians for their fine " technical feat . " NASA Director James Webb insisted that Americans would still be the first men on the moon . Dwight Eisenhower , who recently deplored " the mad effort to win a stunt race " to the moon , seemed removed from the troubling reality : " I do n't admit there is aspace gap . I 'm a little tired of that word . I 've heard enough of it . " A Different Feeling . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the benefit of space exploration will come from extending man 's scientific frontiers ; despite the advice of the nation 's military leaders , the Government 's top civilian officials have been denying that space travel has any realistic military application . Obviously , the Russians feel differently . While they are eager to make use of all the scientific and propaganda by-products of their space exploits , they leave no doubt about their military hopes . <P> Thus , last week . Soviet Defense Minister Rodion Malinovsky crowed : " Let our enemies know what techniques and what soldiers our Soviet power disposes of . " Beyond question , President Kennedy has taken a much more serious view of the space competition than did President Eisenhower . In his May 1961 speech to Congress , the President committed the U.S. to the moon race , added $500 million to NASA 's budget for that purpose . In the current fiscal year , total space expenditures will run to about $5.5 billion . For advanced man-in-space projects , Kennedy has boosted funding from $6,000,000 in 1961 to $863 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment , it is still the unhappy truth that the Saturn C-1 booster- the U.S. 's answer to Russia 's big rocket-is still in its test stages . And it is all too symbolic of an American attitude that even last week , while Popovich and Nikolayev were holding the high ground , a handful of striking electricians at the Huntsville , Ala. , Space Center stopped Saturn construction dead . <P> The U.S. space program has been described by Government officials as a " maximum orderly effort . " If it is , then maximum needs a new definition . The space program could certainly use more money . But much more important , it requires a new direction of purpose . Scientific advancement is fine ; so is the international prestige that comes with space achievement . But only at its peril can the U.S. forget that old maxim about the high ground .
