She dwells in a world of beauty , yet no one has ever called her pretty . She likens other women to swans and skylarks , but finds herself described ( by such an expert as Designer Cecil Beaton ) as " an authoritative crane . " Though she is a generous flatterer of the physical attributes of others , even her own admiring friends must strain to return a compliment ( " Well , " said one , straining , " she has a strange and marvelous spine " ) . Her walk has been described as a camel 's gait , her nose as something stolen off a cigar-store Indian . Yet thousands of women cut their hair because of her , cream their skins , shorten their sleeves , and belt their coats , all at the iron whim of a woman whose face is as rarely photographed and widely unknown as the moon 's other side . <P> Her name is no more familiar . But Diana ( pronounced Deeann ) Vreeland is better known than her anonymity tells ; as the new editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellwether to a certain special clique of chic . She has long been a flamboyant and energetic tastemaker ; designers have been known to tremble at her nod , customers at private showings to pick purely what she picks , manufacturers and merchandisers to watch her every move with rapt fixation . She is , in fact , probably the single most fabled , venerated and respected backstage fashion force in the world today . <P> Leopard &; Incense . It is a role she adores , and she plays it to the hilt . At close to 60 , she moves with supersonic speed . She does n't walk , she strides ; she does n't talk , she broadcasts . She surrounds herself with the calculated and the outlandish , paints her Manhattan office walls adulterous red , covers the floor with simulated leopard skin , burns incense through the day . She invents cliches and talks in capital letters , whether dismissing a contender for the best-dressed ranks ( " On her , EVERYTHING looks like a chandelier " ) or praising a swatch of material ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India " ) , with the sort of outrageous rhetoric that has reduced hardened fashion types to awed obeisance . <P> Mrs. Vreeland took over Vogue 's helm only four months ago on the retirement of longtime ( 30 years ) Editor Jessica Daves . Other editors , such as Harper 's Bazaar 's thoughtful , tranquil Nancy White , function in an atmosphere of relative calm ; not so Deeann . In her 27 years at Harper 's , most of them as fashion editor , she had already established her legend as a human maelstrom . She tore in and out of offices , trailing hats , belts , secretaries and photographers behind her , churned around designers at work , doing a touch of pinning here and there , patted on makeup and cut models ' hair herself . It was while she was at Harper 's that she originated the now legendary " Why Do n't You ? " column , peppered with such items as " Why do n't you bring back from Central Europe a huge white baroque porcelain stove to stand in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your bed made in China ? . . . Why do n't you wash your child 's hair in champagne ? "
