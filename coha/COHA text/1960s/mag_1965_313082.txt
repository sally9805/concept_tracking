" Gantung Aidit ! " demanded the crudely painted slogans on Djakarta 's downtown walls . That meant " Hang Aidit ! " - the pro-Peking boss of Indonesia 's 3,500,000-member Communist Party . The wily Red was nowhere to be found , so the rampaging mob last week had to make do with less . They sacked one of Aidit 's four Djakarta homes and burned his furniture , then headed for the offices of his cocky Communist Youth Front . There , at the starting point of many a raid on the American library or embassy , the rioters administered poetic justice : the Red headquarters went up in flames . <P> Other symptoms of rampant anti-Communism and hatred of Aidit 's Peking masters abounded throughout Indonesia last week . A mob of 800 stormed the Chinese-run Republika University in the capital , wrecked and burned a two-story building , then invaded the dormitory with knives and submachine guns . Chinese shops in East Java were ransacked , and a newspaper editorial ranted ferociously against the " CIA " - meaning the " Chinese Intelligence Agency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to President Sukarno 's friendship with Peking , it seemed odd indeed that Red China could be so viciously maligned . There was nothing really odd about it , for the anti-Chinese campaign simply marked the determination of the army under Defense Minister Nasution to wipe out all traces of Aidit and his Partai Kommunis Indonesia . Nasution would probably succeed , for he and his generals seemed in firm command of the country . <P> This did not mean that the army was broadly anti-Communist or pro-West , since Marxism and Communism remain respectable among most Indonesians , including the military . Indeed , with Nasution 's obvious approval , Sukarno last week set about salvaging what he could of his beloved Nasakom-the tenuous blend of nationalism , religion and Communism on which political control in Indonesia has long been balanced . Part of the salvage plan : formation of a " new " Communist Party based on nationalism and Indonesian self-interest rather than Peking 's influence . Aidit , who was believed still hiding out in Middle Java , was branded " a renegade and an outlaw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean toward the Soviet orbit rather than the Chinese . " The President will settle the upheaval , " assured a Sukarno aide with typical Indonesian optimism . " If you eliminate the kom from our Nasakom then the balance has been destroyed . That is not practical politics . But you can eliminate the kom that is against you and create another in its place . "
