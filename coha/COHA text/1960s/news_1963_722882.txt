txt President de Gaulle 's Government is prepared to hold out against mounting allied pressure for a more flexible attitude on Britain 's entry into the European Economic Community , qualified sources said tonight . Nothing has transpired at Brussels in the last two days to alter the French conviction that the United Kingdom is unready , politically and psychologically , for membership in the E.E.C . The sources insisted , with every appearance of conviction , that France was doing Britain a favor by trying to keep her out of the E.E.C . at this juncture . The French President was quoted tonight as predicting Britain 's ultimate entry into the E.E.C . after his own term of office has expired . President Is Quoted Le Monde , an exceptionally well-informed newspaper , quoted the President as telling a group of deputies : " Either the English will sign or they will leave Brussels and think it over . One day they will enter the Common Market but no doubt I will no longer be here . " When a deputy insisted that Britain had gone a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Gaulle said that " in , reality " the British " have been multiplying the exceptions to the Treaty of Rome at every turn . All this has lasted long enough . There is a treaty and it ought to be accepted . " A spokesman for the French // French Firm on Barring Britain Entry // Foreign Ministry denied that France wished to break off the talks . The Government 's position , he said , is that Britain should find a means of applying the whole ? treaty rather than search for exceptions that Would delay application . The French views have not budged Western diplomats from the assumption that France 's opposition to British entry has created the gravest crisis in European affairs since France rejected the European defense community a decade ago . Most diplomats see the present dispute as a conflict between unity and division for the Continent . Germans Alerted The talks between General de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer , which open here Monday , now have assumed paramount importance . West Germany has a key role in the resolution of the present differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aging chancellor must balance the advantages of the new , intimate relationship between France and Germany against his 14-year-old fidelity to close military and political ties with ' the United States . German diplomats are aware that although outwardly the clash at Brussels is between France and Britain , the United States is deeply involved . The Bonn Government has been told repeatedly and emphatically how much the United States trade program for Europe depends upon the early evolution of an E.E.C . that includes the United Kingdom . Apparently it has not been necessary to tell the Germans that a restricted Europe , trading behind a high tariff wall , would force the United States to review its overseas commitments . German understanding of this situation may well lie behind the assurances of Bonn 's diplomats that the West German Government will continue to support Britain 's full membership in E.E.C . The key question is whether Dr. Ad e n a u e r , presumably prompted by Washington , will be able to convince General de Gaulle that his present course is ruinous to European unity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continent 's military welfare . Diplomats here apparently have no doubts that the West Germans ultimately will come down on the side of United States policies in discussions on a new Europe . All of Dr. Adenauer 's possible successors as chancellor , it is emphasized , are more pro-American than pro-French . The possibility that , at the worst , the present conflict over Britain 's entry could end in France 's isolation from her partners in Europe as well as from the ? United States does not appear to worry the French in the slightest . Another impression from conversations with French sources of utmost reliability is that the Government 's attitude toward both Britain and the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is colored to a remarkable degree by the past . The French appear to think of Britain as she was in the past , the Britain of 1940 when she still could call on the support of a world-wide empire . There is a tendency to attribute to the present British Government habits of mind that , although relevant to Sir Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this is coupled equally strongly the belief that the Americans and British are op. erating today on the same basis as they did then . To French officials the trans-Atlantic alliance appears far more formidable and intimate than it does in Washington and London .
