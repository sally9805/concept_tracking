75 THINK OF GREEN a story by Seymour Epstein Icould , I suppose , zero in on the year , and perhaps even the month , when 1 first met Ted Stern , but I 'd rather not rearrange my memory in that way . There 's a magnetic pole in personal time , and that 's where Ted is fixed . It begins in the school yard where the two of us were fooling around with a basketball , dribbling. lay-up shots . There 's question about the season . It was summer . My eyes almost squint at the glare . I feel a chill at the sun-scorched emptiness of that school yard . I think of it as an excavation opened by archaeologists in which I am about to be shown the evidence of an ancient civilization where I once lived . We had nothing else to do . Whether we had arranged to meet there , or had just wandered in , each on his own , driven by the boredom of those moneyless days , I do n't remember . I do remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I tried harder than Ted . He was n't interested in basketball , or in any sport , and his indifference was always a source of annoyance to the kids who took seriously . I think he would have made a fairly good basketball player had he wished . He was tall even then , had the right kind of shoulders and hands , moved otherwise with a limber grace . He just was n't interested . We kept at that playless playing like two figures portraying a Greek punishment . When we stopped , we would spiral down the endlessness of a summer day . It was Ted who finally stopped , and we 76 THINK OF GREEN walked out of the yard and into a candy store , where he ordered lemon and lime sodas . The store owner served us the sodas in large glasses like inverted bells . Ted leaned his arms on the counter , his chin propped on his hands , and he peered into the pale green enchantment . I do n't remember the words . How could I ? What I invent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Why not ? " I asked . " Just look , " he said . " Just look at the color , the green , and keep thinking about it . Do that . " I did . " Now . " he said , " if you keep thinking about green , a tiny green spot will appear in the center of your brain . And it will spread " ? his voice taking on the intonations of a medium ? " through your brain and through all the veins of your body . You will feel the greenness in your stomach , and in your fingers , and in your eyes . Your brain will drink in the color , and you will no longer be thirsty . Look at it ! And think ! " I looked and I thought and my mouth longed for that sweet , cool greenness . No tiny green spot appeared in my brain . The more I looked the more 1 wanted that soda to irrigate my parched mouth . " You 're not thinking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm thinking , " I said . And I did begin to think . I thought of that greenness , thought of nothing but greenness , and something finally did happen . The color of green distilled itself from the soda and let fall a drop of its essence into my being . It spread like a stain . My thirst was gone . Then the store owner  --  whom I remember just now  --  moved from where he was standing into our circle of concentration . He wiped a damp rag over the marble counter , drawing semicircles of moisture around our glasses . I looked up at him , and I remember that his eyes , too , were fastened on some inner vision . I know now what that vision was : his profound certainty that no folly or miracle happening on the other side of the counter could release him from the penny-doomed prison of his days . The man 's eyes restored my thirst , and I picked up the lemon and lime soda and drank it , thirstily , greedily , drenching senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Caught in That Music , " which bore out the promise of his earlier " Pillar of Salt " and other fiction . He will be on the fiction staff of the Bread Loaf Writers ' Conference at Middlebury , Vermont , this August . denial . Ted left his soda untouched , rising from the stool . " Are n't you going to drink it ? " I asked . He said nothing ; gave no sign of having heard . He walked to the door , and as I made to follow I saw the candy-store man pick up Ted 's glass and pour its contents into the sink . " Why did n't you drink it ? " I asked again . Ted walked on , as though alone . I followed , growing resentful of his silence . I said some-thing about not being crazy , throwing a nickel away for nothing , that I was thirsty , and so was he , and he was just showing off anyway . But Ted walked on , and I followed , until I felt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jerked against being pulled along , I was incapable of tearing the leash from his hands . Of course he did n't say anything to explain his action . We were about thirteen or fourteen . He could no more define than I could understand the reason for such an action  --  and though I have satisfied thirst every day of my life , many times a day , that glass of lemon and lime , Ted 's glass , remains standing on the counter , the glowing emblem of thirst itself , and no amount of drinking has diminished its quantity . Did I say we were friends ? I 'm not sure we were . We lived on the same block , went to the same high school , but we did not maintain the level of contact that friendship at that age requires . It was not I who stayed apart . Ted did . I see him walking past a game of stickball , punchball , his narrow head tilted back , and from that plane of vision acquiring a privacy that mystified and irritated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented him . I was hurt . I made no effort to break away from the pleasant , brainless round of street activity and join his isolation , but I felt he owed me an explanation . I regarded it as a defection on hi ; part that he did not recognize my difference and pay tribute to it by an occasional sign . I have learned since that these vibrations never go unnoticed , but at the time I thought Ted was as oblivious to me as he was to the others . The sense of neglect I felt bridged the time between the lemon and lime and the next season I remember . Which was spring , when the boys during lunch hour would bring their sandwiches out to the grounds around the school , and after eating would play a quick game of handball or just sit in the sunlight . For some reason , Ted and I did n't see much of each other at school . Different schedules , I suppose . On this day , I was sitting in the embrasure of a double doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage cans heaped with coal ash lined one side of the school building . An occasional gust blew off a plume of fine gray powder . It was a cool day , but I was sitting in a protected corner . 1 felt the sun strong on my face and hands . I saw Ted approach . He held several books clamped against his body , beneath one arm . His hands were in his pockets . I was able to measure his growth . His narrow head tilted back , but now I could see the prominence of his Adam 's apple . The man he would be was evident in the bony looseness that ambled toward me . Do I pretend to recall for the sake of this thing 1 am writing ? I do n't think I would believe someone else telling me that he remembered exactly what he felt from such a distance in time . But I do remember . I felt at once the sour phlegm of injured pride and a quick , melting forgiveness . He had come to make amends , to redeem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted . He stopped before me and looked down from that familiar angle . " Do you happen to have any money on you ? " he asked . " Some . Why ? " " Could you lend me a dime ? I thought I had some change , but I do n't . I want to get some milk . " " Sure . " I gave him a dime . " Be right back . " He went into the school and came back shortly with a container of milk . Then he sat down beside me . He had a sandwich in a brown paper bag . It was a cheese sandwich on white bread , and I who was daily tempted with slices of beef trimmed of all fat , with the white meat of chicken , with fresh seeded rolls and dark rich pumpernickel , felt a surge of pity for Ted because of that pathetic sandwich . Stupidly I said , " Jeez , that 's not much of a sandwich , " He smiled and looked down at it . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a slice of bread . Little white clumps of dough clung to the yellow cheese , " Nauseating , " he agreed , humorously . " Want to trade ? " " No , thanks . But you can have one of mine . My mother always makes two . I do n't know why . I never eat two . Here . " " Your mother make your sandwiches ? " he asked . " Sure . Does n't yours ? " a story by Seymour Epstein 77 " I make my own , " he said . " My mother has n't got the time . She has to be at work by eight-thirty every morning . " " Your mother ! Work ! What 's your father do ? " " He does n't do anything . " " Unemployed ? " " Dead . " " Oh . " " Say , do you ever read ? " he asked me . " Read ? Sure I read . What do you mean ? " " Not school books , " he said . " Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted told me like what . A torrent of authors spilled from him . Ralzac , Dickens , Walpole , Conrad , Poe , Stevenson , Cooper , Sabatini , Dumas . . " You read them all ? " I asked . " I 'll tell you the ones I like the best , " he said . I knew he was offering me something in exchange for the sandwich , the dime , the life I had known up till that moment . I accepted the offer . There is one more scene to recall from that time . It was winter , the year of our graduation from high school . We were in the library . It had just begun to snow when Ted and I entered the library , and when we came out big , artificial-looking flakes were swirling around the doorway . We remained there for a few moments . " Are you going to college ? " Ted asked me . " Yes , " I said . " Are n't you ? " " It does n't look that way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to lend me the first year 's tuition , would you ? pay it back first chance I get . " " Where would I get the money ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " he said , looking up into the snow , leaving me with the impression that getting the money was my affair , and , by a connection could not repudiate , my responsibility . " Why should I lend you the money , even if I had it ? " I asked , prying open with a smile one edge of the conversation . Never absolutely sure of Ted 's meaning , I had learned to leave a necessary margin through which things could pass as a joke . " Somebody should , " he replied . " I 've heard of guys working their way through college , " I said . " Oh , that 's all right if you want to be an accountant , or something like that . " " What do you want to be ? " " A writer , " be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had given me this information countless times in the past . I do n't remember what 1 said to that . The scene stops there , and we are left standing in 78 THINK OF GREEN the doorway of the library , Ted wearing a leather jacket , and the large , irregular snowflakes imprinted on the air . Now I must tell you something about myself . I am not a wealthy man , but my yearly income is large enough to satisfy all reasonable needs and some unreasonable indulgences . Like most men my age , my history comes in two parts  --  before the war , and after . I began college with the end of Munich , and finished with the beginning of the Marshall Plan . I went on to become a lawyer , and I had no thought but to remain a lawyer the rest of my life . But as sometimes happens with lawyers , I became involved with one of my clients to the extent that he thought it prudent to offer me a partnership instead of a fee . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , have two children , a home , two cars ... There was a time , shortly after our first child was born , when Irene asked me , " Do you love me ? Do you still love me ? " I said something about postpartum depression , and I may have been right . At any rate , I 'm sure the question would have disappeared entirely but for the next day 's occurrence . I happened to be in Herald Square , waiting at the corner for the light to change , when I saw Ted Stern . Heard him , rather ; thought the voice sounded familiar ; turned ; and there he was . He was standing beside me , head tilted , prominent Adam 's apple . He had changed , of course , but only in the way of accentuating what I remembered . He was Ted Stern in bold face . And it was summer again . He was wearing a sport shirt and a pair of slacks . I hesitated  --  not because I thought it unlikely that he would remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt affected by a sudden doubt . There was the whole landscape of that time projected in my mind like a picture on a screen , but I could n't find myself in the picture . Who had I been ? Who was I now ? I was not overwhelmed by a loss of identity , but suffered rather , the social embarrassment of having forgotten the name of someone I meant to introduce . I think I would have allowed Ted to continue on without greeting him , but he moved at that instant , and I caught a glimpse of the girl beside him . She had very dark hair and very light blue eyes  --  and Irene 's fading question , " Do you still love me ? " received an infusion of permanent dyes from that girl 's hair and eyes . I moved a little closer and said , " If you concentrate on green , that traffic light will change color . " Ted turned and looked at me . I did n't remember that he had bad skin as an adolescent , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by an English Air Force girl that that kind of blemish on the right kind of face can be very exciting , sexually . " Well , " he said , " I see you 've survived . " The light changed , and the three of us began to cross the street . " This calls for something or other , " I said . " Would you both join me for a drink ? " We reached the other side . Ted looked at the girl , and there passed between them a look so fraught with the complicated intimacies of a love affair that I have never been able to approach that corner since without experiencing a little flurry of excitement , whose vicariousness T immediately recognize , but accept anyway , as I have accepted the shame and exaltation of other acts I did not commit . " Do we have time for a drink ? " Ted asked her . " I have n't , " she replied . " But if you ? " Ted turned back to me with a slight gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps some other time . But tell me something about yourself . What do you do ? " " I 'm a lawyer , " I said . He pondered that for a moment , lifting the head that had lifted to receive the snow in the doorway of a library . He gave a little laugh . " I do n't know whether that 's strange or not , " he said . " Why should n't you be a lawyer ? " " And you were interested in writing , " I said . " Did I ever mention that ? " he asked , looking amused . " You did . " " Well , i am a writer . " He turned to the girl . " Myra , am I a writer ? " The girl closed her light blue eyes over the question as a lovely tropical fish would close its mouth over a crumb of food , swimming on in bright silence . " I wish you had more time , " I said . " Yes  --  well  --  so do I. Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his hand in a vague salute , and the girl gave me an even vaguer smile . Less than a year after that meeting , T came across Ted 's picture in the book-review section of the Sunday paper . It was in a box ad in the back pages , quoting somebody who had said that Theodore Stern 's novel was " . . . a brilliant achievement by one of America 's postwar generation of writers . " I showed the picture of Ted to Irene , who was lying an arm 's length away , sharing with me the slothful habit of getting back into bed after breakfast to read the Sunday paper . " I know that fellow , " I said . We lived on the same block . We went to school together . " Irene took the paper . " Theodore Stern , " she said . " I never heard you mention him . " " I do n't believe I ever did . Funny thing , I met him about a year ago , near Mary 's . He was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that either , " Irene said . " Is that another one of your secrets ? " " What ' secrets ' ? " " You know what secrets . Your iceberg life . The nine-tenths you never tell me . " " Irene , do n't be ridiculous . How the hell could I conceal nine-tenths of my life between my business and my family ? " " What were you doing on MacDougal Street on Wednesday night ? " " Oh , for the love of Cod ! W alking ! " " You were supposed to be at the New Yorker Hotel , at that convention . " " I was at the New Yorker Hotel , at that convention . And then I left . And then I took a long walk . How do you know I was on MacDougal Street ? Who told you ? " " Does it make a difference who told me ? " " Does it make a difference that I was there , walking ? " " Yes , it does make a difference , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know a soul there . No one . I went for a walk there because it 's colorful and noisy . " " Is that what you want , color and noise ? " " A little , sometimes , yes . " " That means you 're unhappy . " " It does n't mean I 'm unhappy , Irene . It does n't mean anything . Old men in Mexican villages walk through the marketplace just for the sake of the color and noise . " The next day , I went to a bookstore and asked for a copy of Ted 's book . The salesman looked reflective , said yes , he thought he remembered the book , but he did n't have it in stock . He 'd be glad to order it for me . I said not to bather , I 'd look around . I found it in another bookstore . It was not displayed among the stacks of recent fiction . A saleswoman came across a single copy shouldered among other exiles on the shelf below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only took a few hours . It was not a very long book . But it was a good one , I thought . it was about a young man in college who falls in love and has an affair  --  the other way around , actually  --  and finally enlists in the Navy . I know one is not supposed to assume a writer 's life from the fiction he writes , but I felt a story by Seymour Epstein 79 sure after I had finished the book that Ted had been to college and that he had served in the Navy . But I was n't at all sure about the affair . There might have been something , but I did n't believe that Ted had experienced love in that way . That same night , I wrote Ted a letter in care of his publisher . I said that I had read his novel with great enjoyment , congratulated him , wished him success in the future . I did n't expect a reply . Nor did I get one , immediately . About three months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He apologized for having taken so long to reply . He had been away , and when he returned he had had to work furiously on his new novel . Could we have lunch ? He proposed the day , the hour , the place where we could meet . Obviously he was known in that restaurant . The hostess murmured something to him as she showed us to a table . The waiter nodded to him familiarly . We sat in a booth , Ted opposite me . His narrow head tilted back , and he looked at me from that angle whose precise measurement 1 have kept all these years . " Well , " he said , " and now tell me about yourself . " The telling did n't take long . He was no more eager to hear than I was to relate circumstances that only the closest personal tie could make interesting . " And what is your life like ? " I asked him . " Are you married ? " " Not any more , " he said . " I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What girl ? " " The girl I saw you with on Herald Square . Black hair and blue eyes . Myra . " Ted smiled and shook his head . " No , " he said . " Good God , no . Myra is married . To someone else . .. . Did you really like my book ? " " Very much . " " I think my new one is better . I know damn well it 's better . " He hitched himself forward and was about to say something else when the waiter came and began to fuss with plates . When the waiter left , I waited for Ted to press forward again , but the interruption had thrown him off that delicate timing actors and gamblers depend on . He was silent . He began to eat . I said , " I suppose I would have heard about your book before , had it been a best-seller . " " Yes , 1 daresay , " Ted said . Then he did press forward . " Look , I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . It 's owed to me , you see , but I 've got to finish before I can collect . 80 THINK OF GREEN I get fifteen hundred dollars when I turn in a completed manuscript . Now , you 're a business-man ? " " How much do you need ? " " Five hundred . Five hundred would pay the rent and buy the groceries until I finish . I 'd be glad to sign a note . I 'd insist on signing a note . There 's really no risk . . " There was no note . Women claim a sensitivity to marital conditions far beyond the most intelligent man 's perceptions . I have heard Irene say , " Things are n't going so well between Ralph and Anne , " and when I asked if the woman in question had confided in her , Irene said no , that was not the case , that she had made it out from watching Ralph and Anne one evening . I have also heard women comment on a couple scarcely known to them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or some deviation from the temperature of contentment . I never trusted these judgments . I still do n't . There 's too much accident and attitude to accept what one sees as sure evidence . A wrong word about parking the car that evening may have touched off a squabble just before the visit . Later , inflamed by hours of inattention ( perhaps playing on that inattention for the stimulative value they had learned was in it ) , they might passionately join their guilt in the guilty car . Others may smile and touch all evening in talismanic gestures against a jealousy that is destroying their lives . I do n't know how women can assume knowledge from such charades . Styles in marriage change like styles in dancing . A waltz may seem perverted to a generation that has grown up on separate frenzies . My knowledge is based on more than intuition . When Irene and I had our crisis , we lived apart for a time . I took a room in a residential hotel in the city . Friends naturally found out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me and told me about other crises and adjustments , or crises in perpetuity , or unhappiness seeking a crisis . And I would n't vouch for these confessions either . Some people feel the need to console and instruct , even if they have to fabricate the means of doing so . But it was during this time that I learned something about Ted 's life . ( Oh . he paid me back the five hundred all right ; and then borrowed again , and again , offering the publication of his book as collateral each time . ) He had an apartment exactly where I expected him to have an apartment , on the Lower East Side , a dirty , quiet street . Two rooms , a kitchen , a bath , and a special odor whichis , I guess , the cachet of all bachelor quarters whose owners are neither well off nor fastidious  --  a kind of moldy staleness , such as one might smell in a third-rate hotel room from whose window one can see minarets and hear the wail of pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , for me , resembled the motions of the moon . One half I was permitter/ to see , but only in phases , in degrees of illumination . He would invite me over occasionally when he was having a party , but where he went and whom he saw when be left his apartment remained cosmically concealed from me . It was from these outer journeyings that he gathered the people that I came to know . His friends  --  or at least those who came to his parties . Some were , like himself , writers ; some wanted to be writers ; some had to do with writers , in one way or another . Like the girls . The young and beautiful girls who came and sat on the floor , heads tipped , hair flowing this way and that in the faint tides of their interest or boredom , I never knew which . There was Carol , who smoked cigarettes through a short ivory holder , and who moved in with Ted for a short time . She bought a new bedcover , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of the rooms . Suddenly she was no longer there . The plants withered , the odor returned , the bedcover remained . And there was Barbara , and Rose . and Jill . And Harriet , with whom I fell in love . " Why do n't you take her home ? " Ted said to me one evening , after a party . " Whose home ? " " Yours . Hers . What difference ? " That was my one affair , a brief and strange affair . Harriet and I were like initiates of an order founded to contemplate the mysteries of Theodore Stern . We talked about Ted  --  his accomplishments , his character , his potential . That 's really all Harriet wanted to talk about , and I took part in these devotions because I knew it would keep our involvement at the needful remove . We were both so patently headed in different directions that the few weeks we had together seem now like a maneuvering to say goodbye . Iwent home . I wanted to . Irene wanted me to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I wanted was too ill-defined . Besides I no longer held Irene responsible for my complete happiness . What a simple discovery  --  the limit of responsibility  --  but I know very well there 'll be no including it among my children 's wedding gifts . Si Ted 's second novel was published , and this time I was aware of its critical reception . It was prominently reviewed in all the important papers , and the reviews were good . I had already received an inscribed copy from Ted , along with a check for the amount he owed me . I read the book , thought it no better than the first , but was pleased that it was receiving so much more attention . I wrote another note , congratulating Ted , and again received no reply for about a month . This is how I expected it would be  --  I telescoping into my life , he into his . But again he surprised me with a note saying there would be a cocktail party at his place , please come . The writing was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ever-present , ever-helpful girl , who was glad to serve the cause of Theodore Stern . It was one of those parties that makes itself heard two floors below . The door of Ted 's apartment was open , the air blue with smoke , dense with talk . I looked around for the hero and spotted him talking to a red-faced , important-looking man whose gray hair curled about his ears . Ted 's narrow head was tilted back , and he regarded this new horizon from the unchanged angle of his privacy . Then he saw me and raised an arm , pointing one finger to the table where bottles abounded . I recognized faces  --  men and women I had seen before . Harriet was there , serving drinks . " Is n't it marvelous ? " she said . " Marvelous , " I agreed . " Have you had a chance to speak to him yet ? " " Not yet . " " Have you heard about the reprint sale ? " " No . What about it ? " " Large . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's talk of a movie . " " My God . " " He 's leaving for Europe in a few weeks . " " Well . " It was rather like the stateroom of an outbound ship , this room . There was the excitement of departure . The stale moldiness was gone . The world had finally come to Ted Stern , bringing dimes and extra sandwiches  --  possibly enough to last a lifetime . But if by chance this contribution to Ted 's fate does n't last a lifetime , I 'm certain he 'll find someone who 'll feel the obligation as I felt it , It was not Ted 's need that compelled it , but my own . For how many things do we remember ? Hot school yard , library doorway , glasses of lemon and lime . I drank mine , and I know its taste . Ted 's remains on the counter , containing eternally the taste of a life that is not my own .
