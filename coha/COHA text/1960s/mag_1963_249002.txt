From end to end , the starting line averages 239 lbs . per man . The fullback runs the 100 in 10 sec. flat , and he is only the third fastest man on the team . The four backs , between them , have accounted for 25 touchdowns . It is the best college football team in the U.S.-but it exists only on paper . All season long , perched in some remote corner of the stadium , immune to the blare of the band and the frenzy of the fans , the professional football scout sits with notebook and binoculars , looking for tomorrow 's men among today 's boys . Last week , as they prepared to back their choices with cash ( and lots of it ) in the annual players draft , the scouts of both professional leagues took time out to compile their dream team of the nation 's top prospects . TIME 's pro-picked 1963 All-America : <P> QUARTERBACK : Roger Staubach , 21 , Navy , 6 ft. 2 in. , 190 lbs . At first , the pros were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's a scrambler , a rollout quarterback , " said one . " He does n't play the pro game . " But 1,738 yds. and 15 TDs later , Roger is the No. 1 choice of 17 out of 22 pro teams . Says Coach Buddy Parker of the Pittsburgh Steelers : " For his position , the best college player I 've ever seen . " The " book " on Roger : " Very accurate , shifty , strong , great peripheral vision , unmatched at hitting secondary receivers . A perfect pro quarterback . " There is one catch : Staubach may never play pro ball . He has another year to go at Annapolis and four more in the Navy . Sighs one pro scout : " It 's too bad we ca n't get him married off so he 'd have to quit the Academy . " Muses another : " Maybe he 's got flat feet ? " After Staubach , who ? In the year of the quarterback " it 's a tossup , " says one scout . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 21 ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 205 lbs . ) . " A winner all his life , " reads a report . " Capable of throwing the bomb . " Scouts fret that Miami 's George Mira , 21 ( 5 ft. 11 in. , 180 lbs. ) , may be too small , but he will be a high draft choice ( " He 'll have a lot of money waved in his face " ) , as will Boston College 's Jack Concannon , 20 ( 6 ft. 3 in. , 200 lbs. ) , " a Paul Hornung-type back . " <P> HALFBACKS : Mel Renfro , 22 , Oregon , 6 ft. , 195 lbs. ; and Paul Warfield , 20 , Ohio State , 6 ft. , 178 lbs . " The days of the pony back are over , " says one scout . " And by pony I mean everyone weighing much under 200 lbs . With these big defensive lines , you have to run big , fast bull elephants . " Oregon 's Renfro is just what the zoologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.7-sec. dash man , plows into tacklers " with reckless abandon and no regard for his personal safety . " Ohio State 's Warfield will have to put on pounds , but he is " the complete pro prospect-with the instinctive savvy to do the right things and be in the right places . " Pittsburgh 's Paul Martha , 21 ( 6 ft. 1 in. , 184 lbs. ) , is almost certain to be drafted in the first round as a flanker or a defensive halfback.
