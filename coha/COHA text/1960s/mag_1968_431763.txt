 | THE NEWS ON TV AND HOW IT IS UNMADE Show business economics and the logistical problem of " getting the picture " have made the star commentator the centerpiece in a parasitic form of journalism which has little use for real reporters . Television 's most impressive and predictable spectacle is the coverage of election night . In one generation TV has transformed the anxious , allnight ritual into an incredible display of electronic virtuosity . It has dazzled , and not always pleased , the voters with its ability to tell them who won , before some voters have even gone to the polls . The public is still mystified and a little annoyed that there is no longer any " horse race . " There never was , of course , except in very close elections . Old-fashioned reporting techniques merely created that pleasurable illusion . Illusions of a different sort are created by TV . For its journalists are enmeshed in a system that looks upon news as another commodity , which sells or does not sell , attracts audiences or does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reworked , and manipulated , or simply dropped . There is , however , one factor that distinguishes news from almost everything else the networks transmit : prestige . Thus , for example , on June 14 , 1967 , NBC 's local station in New York published an advertisement in the New York Times to promote the Eleventh Hour News and its anchorman . Jim Hartz . The program had earned considerable public following in several years of competent reporting but that was n't good enough for the PR men . " Jim and the Eleventh Hour Staff pore over thousands of reports compiled each day by NBC News correspondents in 75 countries to bring you New York 's most meaningful late-evening report , " the advertisement said . It is true that NBC News employs a large staff in the United States and up to a dozen correCopyrightO 1968 by Robert MacNeil spondents overseas . But they do not compile " thousands of reports " each day ; they compile very few . As do the other networks , NBC bases the bulk of its news service on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and Reuters . The networks also have interlocking arrangements to exchange news film made by other broadcasting organizations . On occasion , the services of " stringers " or parttime correspondents employed by a newspaper or wire service are called upon , though more often for radio than for television . At the particular period of the advertisement quoted , in fact , WNBC had introduced an economy wave . The budget of the Eleventh Hour News did not permit it to pay for as many fresh reports from around the United States each evening as it had customarily used , so there was less " poring " than usual . Since 1956 , NBC had boasted that it ran seven days of news , treating Saturday and Sunday with the same importance as weekdays . Although both the Saturday and the Sunday news programs found themselves repeatedly pushed off the air by sports programs , that claim had some validity . Then in the spring of 1967 , NBC told its affiliate stations that it had contracted to carry ten doubleheader football games that fall , which meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news programs , would disappear for ten weeks . A discussion took place among top executives of the network ( not the News Department ) as to whether the Sunday news program should be dropped altogether if it was going to be lost for ten weeks . An NBC executive later said the question around which the discussion cen- tered was what the " public relations effect would be of dropping the McGee show . " One executive involved was asked how the network would handle the loss of prestige if it took the McGee show off the air just when the Public Broadcast Laboratory was inaugurating a series of Sunday evening programs intended to demonstrate the inadequacies of commercial network currentaffairs programming . The reply was that the Experiment in Television series NBC had run for nine weeks in the 1966-67 season had shown how easy it was to get prestige . " We put on nine hours , " he said , " and the critics raved over every one . " On May 25 , 1967 , NBC bought a full-page advertisement in the New York Times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday 's satellite from Europe ? Too bad . " It referred to a new venture in network journalism , a scheduled news program ( The Frank McGee Report ) using regular reports from Europe and Asia by space satellite . The idea was to bring the capitals of the world as close as cities in the United States . The advertisement continued : " But you 'll get another chance to see and hear Europe live this Saturday . And next Saturday . And Saturday after Saturday after that . " The very next Saturday the program did not appear , having been preempted by a baseball game . This frequently happens to news programs on weekend evenings during the baseball and football seasons . Sports are more profitable than news and if the two conflict the news gets bounced . Advertisers are more easily drawn to sports than to news , not only because the audience is bigger ( sometimes it is not ) , but because it assures , in Variety 's words , " an upper economic class male audience " which is lost to the networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience can be demonstrated by the rates advertisers are willing to pay to reach it . A one-minute spot on the CBS National Football League schedule has sold for as much as $75,000 . Scheduled news programs on weekdays are usually safe from casual preemption because they have developed large enough audiences to be valuable . But even weekday programs occasionally get pushed aside by sports . On June 5 , 1967 , an announcer on WNBC-TV . New York , came on the air at 5:30 P.M. and said : " Because of the Middle East crisis , the Sixth Hours News is beginning half an hour early tonight . " In fact , the change in schedule had nothing to do with the Middle East crisis . The NBC network salesmen had persuaded the program schedulers to let a baseball game begin at 7:00 P.M. That meant pushing the Huntley-Brinkley Report out of its usual place to a position half an hour earlier , and WNBC 's local news program was also pushed back . Eighteen million people are said to rely on the Huntley-Brinkley Report most evenings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen to get home early that night or to turn on their sets sooner than usual , there was no news on NBC . The time segments allotted to journalists on the air and the amount of money they can spend are controlled by the profit considerations of the entertainment , mass-advertising end of the industry . The simple rule is more money for news when times are good and short rations when profits go down . The only qualification to that rule is the prestige consideration . For example , CBS Evening News was expanded from fifteen to thirty minutes in September 1963 . Newspapers deduced these factors as contributing to the decision : prestige ? CBS had won critical acclaim for its coverage of the 1962 off-year elections and wanted to keep up the momentum of being first in news ; ratings ? to step up the battle for the prime-time-entertainment audience after the news programs ; money ? more revenue from more commercials ; quality ? the opportunity to cover the news in more depth . NBC immedidiately made the same decision with the HuntleyBrinkley Report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . The CBS program Eyewitness to History was dropped at the same time , while two valuable weekly series on NBC , David Brinkley 's Journal and Chet Huntley Reporting , were both cut back and eventually allowed to wither away . Network profits mounted without interruption through the prosperity of the 1960s until economic uncertainty in 1967 caused a falloff . A poorer showing in profits for the second and third quarters caused immediate repercussions in the news departments . Plans for political coverage in 1968 , including the primary elections and the national conventions , suffered budget cuts in all three networks . " What 's Going on Down There ? " In 1963 , when Governor George Wallace tried to prevent the integration of Alabama 's schools with his " stand in the schoolhouse door , " NBC correspondent Tom Pettit , covering the story there .  | phoned a producer in New York , who started telling Pettit how to handle the story . " There 's a good story in the New York Times this morning , " he said . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Well , the night lead of the AP says ? " " We do n't have the AP . " " Never mind . The UP 's got a pretty good angle on it ? " " We do n't have the UP either , " Pettit said . The producer said , " You do n't have the UP ? " " No . " " You do n't have the AP ? " " No . " " Then how do you guys know what 's going on down there ? " To be sure , newspapers like the New York Times and the Washington Post are also dependent upon some wire-service and syndicated material , but a high proportion of their material still originates with their staff reporters . The chief difference between television and newspaper journalism lies in their respective attitudes to the function of the reporter . Television news has not found a central role for the reporter . Preoccupation with the logistical problems of getting " picture " have made the TV reporter secondary , while show-business economics have replaced him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Entertainment TV disposes the audience to be attracted by personable stars . Viewers develop their loyalties and habits by identifying particular programs with particular stars . From the beginning , the industry handled news in the same way . Huge audiences for news grew as star commentators became centerpieces . It has proved so difficult to fit reporters into this pattern that they often have been reduced to a form of window dressing . The incentives of success are also different from those in print journalism , for the system of rewards belongs to the entertainment industry . During a strike in April 1967 by the television artists ' union ( AFTRA ) , Chet Huntley corn-@# plained that it was demeaning for journalists to be members of a union of " singers , actors , jugglers , announcers , entertainers , and comedians . " Demeaning or not , it has a certain logic because TV newsmen are paid in the same manner as singers , actors , and comedians ? by the appearance . With some recent exceptions , network newsmen make their money from fees paid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news shows receive fees ranging from $25 to $150 for each item used on a program containing commercials . A man may spend three or four days quietly digging for facts to support a story , only to find himself receiving a fee of $50 if his story is used ? or nothing if the story does not pan out . His colleague , meanwhile , may use the same amount of time rushing to snatch an interview here and put together a few superficial facts there , may place ten separate pieces on the air , and may as a result pocket $500 . Obviously the system discourages methodical pursuit of information . The object is to get each story on the air and move on to something else . What a " Star " Reflects The commentator is the pinnacle of a system which glorifies him at the expense of the reporter . Once the broadcast journalist has made the grade and is found to have attributes desirable on the screen , he is rewarded by being taken out of the field . He is given regular commitments as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentator presenting a five-minute daily television news program on the network receives an additional $400 a week . Preparing and broadcasting a fiveminute radio news program once a day for five days a week pays $250 . Fees for longer , . news programs are negotiable , and because they are paid in the manner of show-business personalities , network newsmen find it necessary to hire agents to bargain for them with the employers . For commentators who are much in demand , annual incomes of $50,000 to $80,000 are common at the network level . For the biggest stars , such as Huntley , Brinkley , and Cronkite , the figures are much higher . Incomes of $40,000 to $50,000 a year are regarded as routine for local-station anchormen in good markets . It has been reported that Jerry Dunphy , anchorman of the news program on KNXT-TV , Los Angeles , receives about $70,000 while Floyd Kalber has been said to have ne- gotiated a contract with WMAQ-TV , Chicago , in 1967 , that started at $120,000 a year . To put it in its worst light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism . He either rewrites the news from the wire services or , depending on the importance of the program and the magnitude of his stardom , he has a team of writers to do it for him . It is as though the rewrite man on a newspaper were elevated to the salary and prominence of a managing editor , and his byline placed over most of the stories . Those who remain in the field as reporters , either by professional choice or because the networks did not think them star material , can be frustrated men . For example , the NBC London correspondent may attend a briefing at 10 Downing Street with the press secretary of the Prime Minister . Yet he will not be the one who tells Americans about it . Chet Huntley will do it . What Huntley says , in all probability , will not even be taken from the notes of the NBC correspondent , but from the notes of the AP or UPI reporter who also covered the briefing with him . Only if the whim strikes the producer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either very expensively by satellite , or , with a day 's delay , on film . Occasionally , star correspondents go out to cover a story , but their fame often attracts more public attention than do the events themselves . During the 1964 campaign , David Brinkley went to a shopping center in California to watch Nelson Rockefeller on the stump . There was a sizable crowd around Rockefeller but , when Brinkley was spotted , it melted and massed around the bigger attraction , the TV commentator . The same thing happened to ABC 's Howard K. Smith , traveling with Barry Goldwater in New Hampshire . Sometimes the stars are prodded by the networks to go out when surveys show that their credibility as newsmen is slipping . On these occasions the commentator travels not simply as a working reporter but as a potentate with a retinue . He is scheduled as tightly as a politician so as not to miss too many air commitments in New York . Someone else does the basic digging for facts . He does not have the time to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask the necessary questions . He has no time to do that essential mulling over which stirs the accumulated facts in a reporter 's mind into significance . His time is worth too much money to the network to let him " waste " it . At the worst . on these forays , the stars are like vacationers who briefly stop to be photographed , showing their heads through cutouts of muscle men and bathing beauties . The alternative is for the star to do his reading and fact-gathering at long distance , carry his prepackaged conclusions with him to the scene , hop off a plane at the scene of the spotnews story , deliver his views onto 16-millimeter film , and get back on the plane . Although some commentators do acquire the imperiousness of stardom , most of them are embarrassed by the phoniness of such procedures , and therefore go out very seldom . NBC has recently made a major effort to correct this weakness by adding four permanently featured reporters to the Huntley-Brinkley staff , but it still has not significantly increased the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it economically feasible to employ enough specialists who can cover particular kinds of stories ? say scientific ? with expertise . The reason for this basic shortcoming of TV journalism ? its neglect of the true reporting function ? is partly economic ; but it also stems from a particular view of the news . Walter Scott , the NBC board chairman , whose public utterances are remarkably unpretentious for a network executive , has said , " Because television is a visual medium , it may scant the background and significance of events to focus on the outward appearance ? the comings and goings of statesmen instead of the issue that confronts them . " The comings and goings make easy pictures ; the issues usually do not . Obviously , most of the energy and organization of television goes into getting pictures . The logistics of doing that are so formidable ( and so expensive ) that they overshadow everything else . Consequently , from its inception television news has been criticized for a tendency to let pictures dictate the story . Television newsmen can not be blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when this preoccupation overrides news judgment , it encourages emphasis on action rather than on significance and the playing up of trivial or exciting occurrences simply because they can be covered by cameras . That has been the burden of complaint about TV 's vivid , and often heroic , coverage of the Vietnam war . Shooting Bloody in Vietnam By the end of 1967 , NBC and CBS were each reported to be spending two million dollars a year on covering the Vietnam war , and ABC . one  | million . Each network maintained a staff of two dozen or more people in Saigon and the film shot in jungle battles had appeared prominently on the news programs virtually every night for two years . Much was written about " the first television war " and the probable political effects of having a war which so divided the nation brought so vividly into American homes . No one is certain what that effect has been . Morris Janowitz , a University of Chicago sociologist , has said that television coverage had " hardened and polarized public sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptical of the war now have a vehemence in their skepticism . Those who are for the war see Americans being killed and they do n't want those sacrifices to be in vain . " Other observers have echoed that view . Another point of view suggests itself , however , if the nature of television 's coverage is considered . Overwhelmingly , what has been seen on the home screen has been battle action . Camera teams and reporters in Vietnam found that no matter what they filmed , the networks wanted action footage . At CBS . Vietnam hands used the expression " shooting bloody " to describe the filming they had to do to get on the air . It was not that they were ordered to shoot only war scenes , but when they shot a political story or the progress of the pacification program as well as war scenes , it would be the action film which the program producers selected . Night after night for two years , American families have seen badly wounded Americans , sacks of dead Americans being loaded for shipment home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are those who believe that this portrayal of horror has sickened Americans and turned many against the war , which has seemed increasingly pointless . Yet the horror has been heavily edited , and that may also have had a political impact . By exposing the mass audience to more vivid and horrible battle events than have ever been brought into American homes before , but by cutting out what is most unbearable , it may be that television has built up a tolerance for the frightful , a feeling that war really is bearable . The grisly truth has been shown in the screening rooms of the network news departments . There would be close-up footage , with sound , of a young soldier , whose leg had been shot away a moment before , screaming obscenities at the medics , pleading with them in desperation to stop his agony . As someone who believed before 1964 that this war was a futile and stupid waste of American energies , I often wondered as I watched this uncut footage at NBC Whether we should not be putting on even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . We did not because , as one man put it , and not facetiously , " We go on the air at suppertime . " He said that one afternoon when we screened a story showing American soldiers cutting the ears off dead Vietcong as souvenirs . A U. S. sergeant took out a straight razor and the zoom lens followed him in . The ear came off like a piece of soft cheese , and the sergeant put it away in his pack as the party went crunching off through the forest . The NBC reporter explained in a careful commentary that this barbaric practice was not uncommon . The story was referred to an executive in the News Department , who said not to use it . We were divided on whether we wanted to , in any case . Again , to have shown such an incident would have said a good deal about the brutalizing effect of the war . Six months later , a CBS crew filmed a similar scene , which was seen on the Walter Cronkite program . The effect of TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may have been to inculcate a spirit of pained but loyal tolerance of the war . It is also possible that because audiences have been conditioned to the staged violence of television serials the emotional impact of the Vietnam footage has been diminished . Real violence often seems curiously tame and insignificant compared with fictional horrors . It was remarked at the time that Lee Harvey Oswald 's shooting by Jack Ruby , as carried by TV , looked amateurish ; the action occurred too quickly , there was no buildup . All these factors have helped dilute the impact of the nightly war coverage . It was not until the sudden reverses of the Tet offensive in February 1968 that a majority of Americans seemed decisively moved by events of the war . Then television appeared to be moving with public opinion rather than leading or molding it . Until the Tet offensive raised the rate of American deaths to over five hundred a week , television had not treated the story as a crisis or a national emergency . There were a few attempts at longer treatments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part not when a majority of the television audience was around . NBC ran a Vietnam Weekly Review for over a year at midafternoon on Sundays , but finally took it off in 1967 when no sponsors could be interested . The program was hastily resurrected after Tet . ABC Scope was a weekly series of halfhour programs , also run at odd weekend hours , and discontinued for financial reasons in January 1968 . Though the United States was by then en- gaged in a major war , the nation 's most important news medium was not even reviewing the war week by week . It is interesting to consider what effect there might have been on the Administration if one network had decided that the war needed greatly expanded coverage and deserved at least one hour of prime time on a weekday evening . Assuming that the other networks would have followed suit , the impact might have been very great . For example , Morley Safer 's piece on the Marines in Vietnam ( CBS-TV ) showed Marines setting fire to the huts in a village with cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to pressure CBS into removing Safer , who is a Canadian , from Vietnam . Perhaps it is significant that the one piece of television war reporting which notoriously went against the grain in the Pentagon appeared on a network which had no affiliations with large defense contractors . Stealthy Cheerleaders The Vietnam war obviously presented the television networks with a dilemma . It is the best and most exciting story going and therefore merits vivid coverage . At the same time it has seriously divided the country . The industry has reacted in a manner that is now habitual : it has covered the action , done a minimum of explaining , and taken no moral stand until very late in the day . One wonders how television would have treated the second world war . Presumably because the nation was almost unanimous in support of the President 's policy , television would have acted as a cheerleader for the country . That is closer to the natural inclinations of the industry than frosty detachment . Thin bits of cheerleading can even be heard through the coverage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House wanted it said or not , Vietnam had obviously become a national emergency for the United States by 1967 . The best-known TV commentators were by no means neutral in their own minds . Yet there was a curious reaction . Those who were inclined to be hawks let their hawkishness come through on the air . Listening to Chet Huntley , for instance , over many months , one would have little doubt that he was in agreement with Administration policy . David Brinkley was , apparently , opposed to the war , but little evidence of that came across in his broadcasts . In June 1967 , Brinkley told TV Guide , " We I should stop the bombing ? there is not much evidence that it has ever been as effective as the Air Force thinks it is , in this or any war ? and I think we should take the first settlement that is even remotely decent and get out without insisting on any kind of victory . It was a mistake to get committed there in the first place , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , survive it , and go on to something else . " If a man with David Brinkley 's following had said precisely that , at that period , on nationwide television , it would have created quite a stir . The question arises whether a man who is a communicator of such stature should not communicate what he believes when the issue is so important , Why could Brinkley say it in print and not on television ? TV Guide has an enormous circulation . Why is neutrality necessary in one medium and not in another ? It is not a question of compromising the credibility of a news commentator . Comment can easily be separated from what is reported as fact , and even when it is not clearly labeled , a good deal of contraband comment slips through anyway . If a commentator wishes , he can make his attitude known in a multitude of subtle ways by varying his expression or intonation . More important , however , are the facts the commentator chooses to use and the form of words used to report them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after night , it is possible consistently to accentuate the positive elements in the news and to give less emphasis to the negative . Simply by beginning each story with the American initiative that day and the number of Vietcong reported killed , you can create a sense of American achievement and progress . By beginning our story with an account of the enemy 's initiative , you convey the opposite impression . This is putting it crudely , and I am not imputing to all well-known TV commentators a deliberate attempt to slant the news . Personal attitudes and emotions are a factor in how a story is told . My complaint is that it took television so long to tell the American people frankly how disastrously the war was going . By the time the industry did , and then almost to a man , in February 1968 , the evidence was so overwhelming that a good proportion of the public had made up its mind anyway . The Vietnam war is a good case over which to argue the morality of television 's refusal to take an editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorials , chiefly on local issues . The networks do not , but it is time they did . What tended to happen , at least over Vietnam ,  | was that stealthy editorializing in support of the Administration slipped through , but criticism did not . There was implied cheerleading in the nightly preoccupation with battles and body counts and often cursory treatment of Congressional debate . Television does not have to come on with flags waving to appear in agreement with the Administration . It takes that side by default . If the networks argue that they have no business editorializing , when they serve some two hundred diverse affiliates , that is an argument for changing the system . The Reassurance Syndrome Television journalism often appears anxious to sell the chief commodity of entertainment TV ? reassurance . Apart from a tone of somewhat deeper unction on occasions of sadness , as during coverage of Martin Luther King 's or Robert Kennedy 's assassination , the heavily stylized mode of delivery ? half sung , half chanted ? of many news broadcasters makes most of the stories sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , coupled with the tendency of newscasters to punctuate their performances with smiles , conveys a false geniality which drains the news of meaning . Research into audience preferences in New York and Los Angeles has revealed that newscasters who could reduce the anxiety level of audiences and present the news in a context of reassurance had tremendous appeal . The most successful personalities on the air were those who could take the edge off what was unpleasant . On the other hand , programs like HuntleyBrinkley and Walter Cronkite have certainly increased public awareness of current events over the past ten years . Millions of people who were not avid newspaper readers now have some appetite for serious news and a fleeting familiarity with the world . However , electronic journalism cares more about form than content . Leslie Slote , who is Governor Rockefeller 's press secretary and who has been dealing with TV newsmen for years , repeats the frequently uttered criticism that " one of the ingredients lacking in TV news coverage is the why factor : it is superficial . " His particular concern was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York State to explain Rockefeller 's Medicaid program : " They get so involved in the controversy that they never reported what the program was all about and what it was supposed to do . " In May 1967 , when the late Martin Luther King , Jr . was protesting that the Vietnam war was immoral because it interfered with civilrights progress at home , the Huntley-Brinkley Report carried a curious item . It began with Brinkley saying that King had alienated himself from other civil-rights leaders and from the Administration by his campaign against the war . He then introduced what was called an " interview " with Hubert Humphrey in which the Vice President , more in sorrow than in anger , chastised Dr. King . No questioner was ever shown or identified . One only saw Humphrey standing against a wood-paneled background , talking . The circumstances of the interview , or at whose initiative it was given , were never mentioned . It is a fundamental rule of journalism that you must give the circumstances of an interview or statement , for otherwise there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneous . This story left a viewer with the strong impression that the Administration had something to say about Dr. King and that NBC had accommodated it in making a gratuitous attack . Taken in isolation , such technical matters are perhaps not important . Television news programs are not habitually so careless about journalistic standards . What appears more damaging to television news credibility is the atmosphere of outside pressure in which TV journalists must work , a pressure not always overt but of the sort that suffuses one 's thinking so delicately that a person writing a story or broadcasting it may not even be aware of how careful he is being . Buried somewhere in his professional psyche is a feeling of caution put there by years of " politic " judgments by his superiors . There is yet another aspect of television journalism which lends it common identity with entertainment programs : it does not want to offend anyone . When Pauline Frederick , NBC 's United Nations correspondent , once interviewed General Maxwell Taylor rather aggressively on the Today show , Hugh Downs later felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her questions : a few people had written in to complain . At the beginning of Meet the Press each week , the announcer reminds the audience that the questions the panelists ask do not necessarily reflect their own points of view . Only in extreme cases ? as in the period of disillusionment about Vietnam in the spring of 1968 ? do network commentators burst through the blandness . The television news departments offer what sounds like a respectable defense for their avoid- ance of controversial stands . They operate under the restraints of FCC regulations , which require them to present both sides on matters of controversy . When they do examine controversial matters they are fair , but sometimes fair to the point of irresponsibility . William S. Paley , defending Edward R. Murrow 's broadcast on Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954 , said that fairness can not be reduced to a mathematical formula . He went on , " And it must be recognized that there is a difference between men , ideas , and institutions : some are good and some are bad , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what will hold up democracy and what will undermine it ? and then not to do the latter . " That was powerful stuff in 1954 . It would be today . Unfortunately , today only the critics complain about the absurdity of mathematical fairness , not the broadcasters . Indeed , one gets the impression that they prefer to use the Fairness Doctrine as a shield rather than as a weapon . @# Here is an example which involved me personally : Late in 1966 . I began working with Fred Freed , one of NBC 's more spirited producers of documentaries , on an hour program about gun laws , to be called Whose Right to Bear Arms ? Freed had researched the subject very thoroughly and we were both convinced that the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to the need for federal legislation to restrict the sale of firearms . It was calculated that 17,000 people would die in the United States by gunfire in 1967 . No other civilized people has such a high homicide rate . The issue seemed beyond argument . Every conceivable eminent and qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police chiefs , judges , and criminal psychologists wanted tighter laws . Countless bills had been introduced in the federal and state legislatures in recent years but almost none had passed . In Washington , they had not even come out of committee . The reason was a powerful and well-financed  | lobby led by the National Rifle Association , which had mounted successful campaigns to kill guncontrol legislation . By playing on the fears of millions of Americans who use guns legitimately for hunting or target shooting that their sport was in danger and their constitutional rights threatened , the NRA had successfully blocked all efforts to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals , narcotics addicts , the insane , and minors . As We Saw It Our purpose , as we saw it , was not to go over arguments which had already been well aired , but , after demonstrating the need for new laws , to expose the motives of those opposing them . We were not precisely breaking new ground on television . CBS had handled the subject in a relatively forthright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction by a poll , commissioned by NBC from the Gallup organization , which showed that 61 per cent of Americans wanted stricter laws concerning rifles and shotguns , that 75 per cent favored a law requiring registration of rifles and shotguns . The percentages were even higher for handguns . As the word got around that we were doing such a program , there were interesting reactions . Freed received a letter from Democratic Congressman John D. Dingell of Michigan , a member of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce , which oversees broadcasting . The letter could only be described as an attempt to intimidate us . Dingell said that , as an active sportsman , he took a considerable interest in commentaries involving firearms , and threatened that , if our program actively pressed for a particular legislative position and did not give full expression to the views of opponents of anti-gun legislation as the Fairness Doctrine required , he might find it necessary to bring the matter forcefully to the attention of the FCC and the chairman of the Commerce Committee . Dingell 's interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? was wrong . Shortly afterward , the advertiser who had intended to sponsor the program withdrew , but the documentary was completed and shown to NBC network and News Department executives at the customary pre-air screening . The final one-third of the film was devoted to a searching interview , conducted by Walter Sheridan and myself , with the executive director of the NRA , Franklin Orth . It was designed to bring out very clearly the inconsistencies ? in fact , the hypocrisy ? of the NRA position , which pretended to support measures to limit misuse of firearms but in fact worked diligently against them . The interview succeeded in doing that . Orth dodged , but the truth did emerge . The program was to end with a brief summary by me , concluding with the opinion that it was up to Congress to throw off these pressures and pass a bill . Shortly after the screening the word came down that the program would have to be reedited . The instructions came from the NBC lawyers and were ostensibly based on the need to observe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to have to testify in forthcoming Congressional hearings on broadcasting and did not wish to be under any cloud of disapproval when they did so . The instructions were resisted by the NBC News Department , whose President , the late William R. McAndrew , thought the program was strong and should be aired as it was . However the wishes of the network prevailed and the film was reedited . The effect was to soften considerably the impact of the argument and to weaken the case against the NRA . In particular , the lawyers considered that we had been too tough on Franklin Orth . Passages embarrassing to him were cut out and passages were inserted which either put him in a better light or permitted him to filibuster .
