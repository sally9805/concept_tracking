The old lady is 79 ; the old man is nearly 70 . They have been courting each other every spring for the past 34 years . But to tradition-steeped Bos ton , the match is as youthful as ever . The town turns out when the red neon sign atop Symphony Hall blinks Pops , Pops , and Conductor Arthur Fiedler signals the first , firm downbeat to his first love , the Boston Pops Orchestra . <P> On the gladiola-banked Pops podium last week , the silver-maned maestro , who is celebrating his first half-century with the Boston Symphony , proved once more that in a city which demands the best in music , his fizzy Pops concerts are the perfect spring tonic . The formula is familiar : two parts classical and semiclassical to one part popular-plus a dash of the unexpected . <P> Fiedler puts things together with an unerring knack for creative programing and a repertory of close to a thousand selections from Bach to Chubby Checker . With exuberant ease , the maestro and 90 members from the Bos ton Symphony Orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Pops . <P> Headier Stuff . Shoehorned into green-and-gilt chairs at dime-sized tables , last week 's audience snacked on ham sand wiches , strawberry sundaes , champagne , beer , pink " Pops punch " and Fiedler 's musical buffet-everything from a glass-rattling Sousa march ( " to get everybody 's attention " ) to a Mendelssohn concerto , a Strauss waltz , a Weber overture and a splash of lushly orchestrated show tunes . For surprise encores Vaudevillian Fiedler uncorked a brassy , off Beatle I Want to Hold Your Hand complete with handclapping and nasal chorus of " Yeah , Yeah , Yeah " from the string section , and a breezy Hello , Dolly ! punctuated with the wheeee of a child 's slide whistle and the oooga oooga of a Klaxon horn . <P> " You 've got to give people a program that has easy appeal , " explains Fiedler , " something for everybody , a great variety of the best music played with love and kisses but never over-gooed . You ca n't really enjoy something if there is no fun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so much fun that they are booked solid up to a year in advance by such diverse groups as the Democratic Women on Wheels and the Boston Police Department . " Fiedler could conduct six nuns playing the cello and it would be a sellout , " claims one Pops musician . <P> For all his high jinks , though , Fiedler liberally laces his joy juice with headier stuff from Handel , Frescobaldi , Poulenc and Stravinsky . He delights in proclaiming , " I 've been accused of making more friends for music than any other conductor . I have no use for those snobs who look down their noses at everything but the most highbrow music . I 'm a serious musician , but I do n't want to be classified . I 'd be bored doing only symphony music . "
