On the rosters , it is called the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry ( Airmobile ) Division . But to Viet Nam veterans who keep up on their casualty rates , it is the " hard-luck " battalion . And the hardest-luck platoon in the hard-luck battalion is the 3rd Platoon of A Company . Last January all of its men were killed when their C-123 crashed near An Khe before Operation Masher . Last week the unlucky 3rd got it again . <P> One afternoon the 26-man platoon was airlifted to a tiny landing zone in the northern Ia Drang Valley near the Cambodian border , where a North Vietnamese regiment had been spotted . No sooner had four of the six choppers unloaded than an enemy ambush opened up from the surrounding jungle . Most of the men were cut down in their tracks . Three overran one enemy machine-gun nest , only to be chopped up by another . " Sergeant Shockey , " the platoon 's first sergeant called out , " the commander 's dead , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Sergeant Leroy Shockey himself was felled . <P> Then , as suddenly as it started , the shooting stopped . As the North Vietnamese moved among the bodies lifting wallets , ammunition and weapons , Shockey played dead-through no fewer than six searches . Other North Viet namese fanned out through the jungle , looking for the five men who had slipped through the fire . " Come out , G.I.s , " they shouted , " we want you . " As a heavy rain swept down and the shouts drew closer , the five made a pact . " We wo n't surrender , right ? " whispered Sergeant Willie Glaspie . " To the finish , " agreed Sergeant Francisco Pablo . But the North Vietnamese gave up the search and cleared out . <P> The next morning , the rest of A Company arrived after an all-night march . " I cried when I saw them , " Glaspie recalls . " And I cried when I saw our dead . " Of the 26 platoon members , only Shockey and seven others survived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special Mass . " The smell of death was still in the air , " Pablo recalls . " Spent shells were all around . And the blood had been rain-washed pink . " Two days later , Pablo and Glaspie volunteered for another helicopter-infantry assault . " We ai n't unlucky , " Glaspie shrugged . " This is just war . "
