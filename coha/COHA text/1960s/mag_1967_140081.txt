THE WEST // 1 . UCLA ( 14-0 ) 2 . PACIFIC ( 12-3 ) 3 . BRIGHAM YOUNG ( 10-5 ) // It did not take long for the word to get around the Western AC : New Mexico is fair game for a zone defense . Now everybody is using it against the poor Lobos . UTAH tried it , but Coach Jack Gardner had some doubts when Mel Daniels beat his zone for 28 points and New Mexico led by 11 with four minutes to go . But the Utes stayed with it , rallied and Walt Simon 's running hooker caught the Lobos at the buzzer 66-64 . Next BRIGHAM YOUNG came up with a sagging zone that thwarted New Mexico 's favorite patterns , and the Lobos were unable to adjust . Sophomore Kari Liimo threw in 22 points , 6 ' 11 " Jim Eakins got 21 and BYU won big 89-73 . So now the Cougars , who also smashed Wyoming 97-75 , are the class of the WAC , with Utah , a 93-83 winner over the Cowboys , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coed in a mini-skirt when UCLA went up against Portland and Santa Barbara . Lew Alcindor and his friends , especially backcourters Lucius Allen and Mike Warren , simply demolished the visitors . Alcindor scored 27 points and Warren 21 in a 122-57 trouncing of Portland that set a Bruin scoring record . Allen piled up 37 and Alcindor 34 as UCLA pounded Santa Barbara 119-75. // Seattle learned the facts of life-on-the-road . UTAH STATE , with a quick man-to-man that put pressure on the Chieftains at mid-court , forced the tourists into 23 turnovers  --  16 of them outright thefts . Jim Smith got 27 points , Les Powell 24 and Shaler Halimon 21 as the Aggies won 103-91 . At Ogden , WEBER STATE jammed up Seattle 's inside game with a tight man-to-man , Dan Sparks and Nolan Archibald got 31 points between them and the Wildcats ran off with the game 86-72 . With Seattle faltering , Utah State was the area 's ranking independent after beating Colorado State 83-70. // THE SOUTH // 1 . NORTH CAROLINA ( 12-1 ) 2 . VANDERBILT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida 's hopes for its first SEC championship suddenly got bogged down in TENESSEE 'S smothering " quicksand " defense . The persevering Vols , playing Coach Ray Mears 's combination zone and disciplined ball-control game , caught the Gators twice , 66-53 and 56-42 . At Gainesville , Tom Hendrix , Ron Widby and Phil Justus shot over Florida 's big men . At Knoxville , the Tennessee hustlers took the boards away from the tall Gators and gave them only 34 shots . // Vanderbilt moved into first place , half a game ahead of Tennessee and idle Mississippi State , but getting there was not all that easy . Auburn gave Vandy a tussle before losing 71-65 . The most bizarre game of the week , however , was in Athens . While Kentucky 's Adolph Rupp fretted , GEORGIA held the ball and the Wildcats were ahead 8-6 at the half . Then the ' Dogs began to move . Jim Youngblood shot seven for seven , piled up 20 points and Georgia took Kentucky 49-40 for the first time in 17 years . " It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baseline and a guard at the top of the circle  --  for Auburn , and it got the ' Cats their first SEC win , 60-58 on Bob Tallent 's jump shot with seven seconds to go . Georgia , meanwhile , lost to old rival GEORGIA TECH 79-53. // The killer instinct finally emerged in WESTERN KENTUCKY . The Hilltoppers , who had been piddling around for weeks , took out after Morehead like a pack of avengers . Clem Haskins led the assault with 25 points , and Western rolled 100-69 . CLEMSON , after a 68-48 whacking from MARYLAND , stormed back to beat Furman 82-67 and Virginia Tech 70-68. // One player who was exciting the pro scouts was Earl Monroe , a 6 ' 3 " gunner who is averaging 44.2 points a game and shooting at a 63% clip . He is the nation 's top scorer , can play anywhere and has led WINSTON-SALEM to a 14-1 record . Last week Monroe got 42 in a 103-94 rout of Elizabeth City Teachers and 38 more in an 87-85 win over North Carolina A&amp;T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he thought he was the best in the country Monroe wanted to know , " Including the pros ? " What do the pros think ? " A sure No. 1 draft choice . " // THE EAST // 1 . PRINCETON ( 13-1 ) 2 . BOSTON COLLEGE ( 10-1 ) 3 . ST . JOHN 'S ( 12-1 ) // Most of the East 's big teams were off last week , but La Salle was not that lucky . The Explorers , a washout all season , tried desperately to make a run at WESTERN KENTUCKY . With sophomore Larry Cannon playing superbly ( he had 26 points and 25 rebounds ) , they even led Western by a point in the second half . But the Hilltoppers ' foul-shooting skill  --  they made their first 20 and 21 of 23 in all  --  pulled them through 95-86 for their 14th straight . " We lost it on a thousand missed layups , " grumped La Salle 's Joe Heyer. // Just when ST . JOSEPH 'S was beginning to have trouble with Penn , sub Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He finished with 20 points , Cliff Anderson rattled in 31 and St. Joe 's won 85-78 . VILLANOVA was looking better , too . Xavier never did figure out the Wildcats ' tricky combination defense and went down 75-59 . ST . JOHN 'S , although far off its usual form , still beat Pitt 95-66 . Pitt 's Bob Timmons had a plausible explanation for the Redmen 's bumbling . " How the heck can you get a team up for us ? " he asked sadly . // Penn State , which can hardly win anywhere but at home these days , upset West Virginia 102-99 for its 31st in a row at State College . Improved HOLY CROSS defeated Springfield 70-64 , but Canisius lost to MOREHEAD 63-62 . CONNECTICUT edged Fordham 67-66 , CORNELL rolled over Columbia 74-40 and army trounced Dartmouth 74-44 . But there was some consolation for Coach Dave Gavitt 's team . DARTMOUTH surprised Harvard 67-63 to end a 19-game Ivy League losing streak. // THE MIDWEST // 1 . LOUISVILLE ( 15-2 ) 2 . CINCINNATI ( 12-3 ) 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen when we get to Boulder , " predicted Kansas Coach Ted Owens . " Ol ' Sox Walseth will come by the motel the morning of the game , he 'll bring all his family , we 'll have coffee and he 'll cry and cry about his team . " Actually COLORADO 's Walseth did have something to cry about . Regulars Lynn Baker and Chuck Williams were out with injuries . But Walseth shifted his Buffs into a " guards special " offense  --  the guards cut off a double post  --  instead of their usual shuffle , and Colorado had the Jayhawks in a 59-59 tie with one second to play . Then Kansas ' Roger Bohnenstiehl foolishly fouled Steve Rowe . Rowe made his first shot and missed the second , but Bob Bauers tipped it in and the Buffs won 62-59 . KANSAS , however , recovered to beat Iowa State 72-65 and tie Colorado and KANSAS STATE , a 75-50 winner over Oklahoma State , for the Big Eight lead . // Louisville had just thumped independent Dayton 65-50 , and the Cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runaway . CINCINNATI had lost to BRADLEY 64-59 and seemed like easy pickings . But the Bearcats ' sagging defense held Westley Unseld to 16 points , Butch Beard had trouble getting 13 ( " We just played them belly to belly , " explained Coach Tay Baker ) and Gordon Smith , a 6 ' 2 " sophomore guard , plunked in a little jumper from inside the foul circle to win for Cincy 59-58 . That put Cincinnati back in the running , behind Wichita State and Tulsa . But Wichita State hardly looked like a contender against tough " little " SOUTHERN ILLINOIS ( page 19 ) . The Salukis tied up the Shockers with a zone defense and whipped them 77-55. // Life in the Big Ten was just one upset after another . It did not seem likely that MICHIGAN , in last place with three straight losses , could possibly beat Michigan State . But the Wolverines , frolicking under the boards as in the old Bloody Nose Lane days , shocked Michigan State 81-59 . Ohio State got it , too , from MINNESOTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against Iowa 's frenzied press . // Undefeated TOLEDO , 10-0 after beating Villanova 72-65 in overtime , was beginning to worry about MIAMI of Ohio in the Mid-American . Coach Tates Locke 's runty Redskins whipped Ohio U. 68-56 , Kent State 77-47 and were 4-1 in the league . Among the independents , DAYTON trounced DePaul 81-65 , while XAVIER routed Memphis State 's good defense to win 88-78. // THE SOUTHWEST // 1 . HOUSTON ( 14-1 ) 2 . TEXAS WESTERN ( 12-2 ) 3 . SMU ( 10-4 ) // The way OKLAHOMA CITY 'S droll Abe Lemons tells it , playing the touring Swedish Nationals was an exercise in semantics . " We played international rules , with all that kickin ' and scratchin ' , " Abe explains , " and early in the game , before the officials caught on that the visitors could speak some English , one of their players let loose with a naughty word . The referee pointed an accusing finger at one of our boys and charged him with a technical . ' But I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedish player walked away chuckling . " Eventually the officials did catch on . When Swedish Coach Ralph Telkin and his team erupted in a rage over a call one player was thrown out of the game , and the visitors were hit with three technicals . Oklahoma City went on to win 97-92 in overtime , and Lemons was philosophical about the whole thing . " Well , " he said , " I guess I 've done my bit for international relations . " His domestic relations improved , too , when the Chiefs routed West Texas 128-103 as Gary Gray , a slim 6 ' 1 " sharpshooter , fired in 55 points . // Houston was idle , but TEXAS WESTERN thoroughly deflated Weber State . The Miners , playing diligent defense , shut off Weber 's fast break , " Big Daddy D " Lattin threw in 17 points and TW won easily 72-38 . While TCU , the Southwest Conference leader , was busy with exams , one challenger gained ground and another lost some . SMU beat Arkansas 69-59 , but Texas was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
