Christmas dinner for the poor , to most American charities , is turkey army style , some nice wholesome oranges , and above all , no booze . From this proposition Chicago 's Roman Catholic Little Brothers of the Poor dissent in every respect , except that the main dish must be traditional . Last week they started their dinner for 350 of the city 's aged and indigent by serving hot rum punch . They embellished the meal itself with lobster salad , cake , and compote of fruit flamb , expertly cooked by the Little Brothers . They served French champagne , and the 117 dozen roses used as table decorations were given away to the guests afterward . <P> The Little Brothers believe that nothing is too good for those who have nothing .

The 50 permanent members of this " pious union , " who get financial and other aid from 1,000 associate and auxiliary members , are all Catholic laymen , although they take monastic vows of poverty , chastity and obedience .
