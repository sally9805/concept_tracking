Four years ago Hector i'vlotroni was a be- wildered lad of twelve , groping about in a confusing new world . With his mother and brother , he had just left Cuba to begin a new life in the United States . Hector 's father was dead . His mother had been supporting the family on twenty dollars a week . Cuba was wading deeper into political chaos . Surely , the Motronis figured , there was more hope in the States . They moved into a New York City neighborhood that some would call a melting pot , others a slum  --  a neighborhood crowded with Puerto Ricans , Negroes , Chinese : people of many creeds , and a variety of immigrants trying to find their place under the sun . Someone assured Hector that there is a treasury of hope in the United States , but that education is the key to it . So while Mrs. Motroni supported the family on a new fiftydollar-a-week job as a garment worker , Hector concentrated on studies . But like thousands of other youngsters in the big-city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't understand anything , " he recalls . " In Cuba we learned everything by memory , nothing by understanding . And my English was horrible . I thought I could never learn English . " Intelligence tests indicated Hector was " normal , " but his language and family economic problems were such that he might easily have drifted in mediocrity until he quit or was pushed out of high school . But Hector is not drifting in mediocrity today . He is one of the top juniors at Manhattan 's George Washington High School . Hector 's enthusiasm and determination enable him to achieve at a level far greater than youngsters with no language handicap who score several points higher on I.Q. tests . He gets grades of ninety-five in English and is almost a cinch to go to college  --  on a scholarship and on the money he earns working weekends . Hector Motroni does n't hesitate when you ask how he was helped . " It was the Project , " he says . If you stay around George Washington long enough , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A pretty , slender girl whose parents divorced when she was seven says , " The Project got me out of the candy store where I wasted a whole year ; it talked my father into putting his foot down and making me straighten up . Now I 'm going to be a lawyer . I 'm real grateful . " A dimple-checked Negro girl says , " I had a real inferiority complex , I guess . I figured I was so uncultured . The Project took me to operas and Broadway plays . Now I can meet In the gra duet ing class at George Washington last summer , there were lifty recipients of academic degrees who are living proof of this . These college-bound youngsters had entered George Washington from a ' problem school " that in the days before Higher Horizons was noted primarily for sending dullards and disciplinary problems on to high school . As early as March , schools like Amherst , the University of Michigan , Hampton Institute and New York University had accepted sonic of them . One , a Negro girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the board of education : Dear Mr. Schreiber ; Last month 1 won a four-year college scholarship to any college I wish to go to . I won it by making a speech , " Freedom Moves Forward Through Education . " I represented New York and competed against girls from other stales . Wish you were there . You talk with these youngsters , as I did , and weigh their accomplishmentR against the background from which they came , and you are tempted to think in terms of miracles . But Higher Horizons is no miracle . It is simply a double measure of instruction in the areas where it is most needed , and a program which exposes the youngsters to something more than the ugly world of apathy , frustration and cruelty that is all many of them ever have known . Few people who have not lived in the world of deprivation understand how unpalatable algebra can be on an empty stomach , or how difficult it is to diagram a sentence while a drunken father harasses six brothers and sisters in a dingy three-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in a slum neighborhood to understand the simple courage that sometimes is required for a youngster to display an open interest in learning or culture . " They would call me a sissy because I got good grades , " a Puerto Rican boy told me . " She wants to be white , " was the candy-store taunt hurled at a Negro girl because she pronounced " either- as " eye-ther " and " neither " as " nye-ther . " Trim , vivacious Barbara Blondell , whose neighborhood she describes simply as " not the best , " says she took a fierce ribbing when she first began to go to the opera and on other cultural jaunts arranged through the Project . " The kids would make fun of me , use my initials and say , Here comes B.B.-the Big Brain . ' The ones teasing me were mostly boys who already had quit school . They seemed to have a block against anything educational , " explains Barbara . " They really razzed me about the opera . Then I brought home the libretto of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood were fascinated . Now I 've got practically the whole neighborhood going to the opera . " This young woman , whose parents were divorced when she was a first-grader , asserts confidently that her neighbors " respect me much more now  --  far more than if 1 had wilted under their teasing and accepted the anti-culture standard of the pack . " Ironically , Higher Horizons was begun because of a United States Supreme Court decision that most people seem to think applied only to the Deep South . After the 1954 ruling outlawing enforced racial separation in public schools , New York City was challenged to end what was in fact a form of segregation as rigid as anything in Dixie . Because of residential segregation , not only were Negroes and Puerto Ricans attending segregated schools , but an investigation showed that the education offered them had deteriorated steadily for twenty years or more  --  as evidenced by a disastrously rapid turnover of teachers , the high percentage of substitute teachers , the paucity of classes for the gifted and the aged buildings with their obsolete equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York long had operated under the " good riddance " policy that is being employed in most big cities . Under this policy , **27;1887;TOOLONG laws are discreetly overlooked in underprivileged neighborhoods and youngsters are promoted whether they learn or not  --  just to get them out of the school as quickly as possible . The board of education set up a special Commission on Integration , and New Yorkers became involved in bitter debate over proposals to rezone some school districts so as to provide a greater measure of physical desegregation . But some commission members were worried about a more fundamental problem . They were aware that the youngsters going to college from New York 's public schools arc not necessarily the brainiest or most gifted to pass through the classrooms . They are the youngsters with the wealthiest parents , who live in the best neighborhoods , and who inherit a tradition of higher education . Few children from neighborhoods of economic deprivation go on to college , and the percentage completing high school has been disturbingly small . Richard L. Plaut , president of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general educational picture has been so bad in minority-group neighborhoods that a child with a measured I.Q. of 105 in the third grade is likely to drop back to 95 or even 90 by the seventh grade . After a survey of the graduating classes in thirty-two northern schools in which a third of the 10,400 graduates were Negroes , Piaut and an associate reported that in terms of class standing , white students did fifteen times as well as Negroes , and that only twenty-four of the 3300 Negro students  --  less than one out of 100 ? were fully qualified for college admission . Racialists use statistics of this sort to support theories of capabilities and supremacy according to color of skin . Henry Hillson , the principal at George Washington high , explained the situation at his school : " Our enrollment has been multiracial for years , but I 'd be lying if I told you that our Negro students have been truly integrated . Negroes coming in from academically inferior junior high schools in substandard neighborhoods have been testing an average of twenty I. Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to four years behind them in reading . " We could integrate our students in the band or on athletic teams , but not in the classroom . You just ca n't teach a group in which there is that much difference in background and ability and do justice to anyone . So it is obvious that merely to give these Negro youngsters the same education as whites , even in the same school , is not the answer . These deprived children need more . " Hinson was quick to assert , however , that " talk of racial inferiority is trash  --  pure nonsense . When kids come from the kind of community Harlem is , where the // level of education is so low , where there is hostility between adults and children , where family conversation is about matters that are so routine , where parents have no appreciation of achievement , it is inevitable that instead of a child 's experiences ' becoming enriched they get poorer . " It was obvious that the schools could n't change Harlem very rapidly . Could they change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their horizons beyond Harlem ? Dr. Morris Krugman , director of the city 's Division of Educational and Vocational Guidance , argued that the schools ought to try , and he spelled out a pilot project . Dr. J. Wayne Wrightstone , director of the Bureau of Educational Research , Plaut , and several others were equally enthusiastic . They recommended that the board of education " sponsor jointly a demonstration project in early identification and intensified continued guidance of able students " from underprivileged neighborhoods . In March , 1956 , both the Commission on Integration and the board of education gave their approval . Guidance was not a brand-new idea , of course , for the New York schools already had such a program . But New York had only one full-time counselor for each 1200 students , a glaringly inadequate situation similar to that existing in most other big cities . And virtually no one was taking the trouble to talk to parents or ministers , or to visit homes and try to solve student problems at their source . This the project aimed to correct . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas than money . But the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students and the College Entrance Examination Board agreed to share the initial cost , and a search was begun for the right pilot school . Educators wanted a junior-high school with an interracial student body of boys and girls from lower-class neighborhoods , with an outstanding principal and counselor and with access to a good academic high school . It was agreed that fifty-year-old Daniel Schreiber was the right principal and that his Manhattanville Junior High School ( J.H.S. 431 , at 129th Street and Amsterdam Avenue , more than met the requirements . Its student body of about 1500 was 45 per cent Negro , 40 per cent Puerto Rican and 15 per cent White and others . Many of the youngsters were illegitimate ; an appalling number came from broken homes ; some , of course , were from solid lower-middle-class homes . But almost all bore some mark of that curious tangle of pathos that is the ghetto . Of one graduating class of 470 , a mere eighteen wound up in full-time college attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackboard jungle . " Several " 43 " teen-agers were involved in the 1957 gang wars in which an innocent polio victim , fifteenyear-old Michael Farmer , was stabbed to death . The " umbrella man " of the horrible New York murders in the summer of 1959 was a former " 43 " student . From J.H.S. 43 , project students would go to George Washington , a high school that was built as a showplace in 1924 when it catered so exclusively to the elite that it became known as " the country club . " Some 85 per cent of its graduates once went on to Harvard , Amherst and similar institutions . Time and migration had made it a melting pot , and now its 5000 students represent fifty nationalities , about 30 per cent of them American Negroes and 10 per cent Puerto Ricans . Some observers concluded that looking for " lost potential " at J.H.S. 43 was like digging for gold in a sawdust pit , but in the fall of 1956 the project team moved ahead boldly . Full-time counselors were added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; funds were provided for a part-time psychiatrist , psychologist and social worker . Extra teachers were assigned to remedial arithmetic and reading , to foreign languages and one to the area of " educational and cultural enrichment . " Arrangements also were made for a Puerto Rican co-ordinator and an attendanceand-behavior counselor . Then the staff selected 717 pupils  --  about half the student body  --  who showed signs of undeveloped potential . These would be project students for the rest of their stay at " 43 , " and then for three years at George Washington High and other schools . The first weeks of the experiment were eye openers , more so for the experts than for the students . Counselors learned that many pupils could not read because they came from homes where no one had ever bought a book . Many students had entered school not knowing how to hold a book right side up , or whether to turn the pages left to right , or vice versa . A surprisingly large number simply had trouble seeing  --  and no one apparently had cared enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Social workers discovered appalling family problems . One girl was walking three blocks each morning to get milk from the refrigerator of a friend because the relative with whom she and her mother lived decided during a spat that they could not store food in the relative 's refrigerator . Many students had never seen a ball game , a college campus , Times Square , a Broadway play  --  or anything else outside their own squalid world . Teachers donated their time to take youngsters to the opera , the theater , to Brookhaven Laboratory and to such campuses as those of Hofstra , Yale , Rutgers and Columbia  --  at the project 's expense if free tickets or transportation could not be arranged . Often the shy , terribly insecure students had to be coaxed to attend cultural events . Occasionally a parent wanted to know , " What the hell 's so important about seeing a Broadway play ? " and a social worker would have to convince the parent that the child needed to see that play more than the parent needed a helper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant battle against the poverty-nurtured attitude of parents that a boy ought to get out and get a job at sixteen instead of " loafing and wasting his time in some school . " Fifteen-year-old Sarah Rodriguez , whose family came to New York from Ecuador in 1946 , speaks eloquently of the " culture trips " and her realization that she need not go through life being ashamed of her family 's financial status , or of the neighborhood in which she lives , " My neighborhood always had a bad reputation , " Sarah said . " Just about any time you could hear of someone getting a rock thrown at his head . But if I had my choice now , I 'd still choose that neighborhood because I like living among all kinds of human beings . That 's what helps you to grow up . You really learn the difference between good and bad when you live in an area where you have a choice . " I had been living in a nutshell . ! did n't know anything about the world around me because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little circle . The project has taken me places I never could have dreamed of going on my own . " Sarah says her father , a sewing-machine salesman with a family of six to support , never could have afforded to send her and her brother  --  who was graduated in June as one of the top three students at George Washington  --  to the cultural and educational activities that the project put within their reach . When the first project group was graduated to George Washington in 1957 , Hillson made sure that the cultural and academic " lag " of these children did not become an excuse for setting up segregated classes within a desegregated school . Two of the things the Negro and Puerto Rican youngsters needed to learn , Hillson knew , was that they could do good schoolwork , and that the fact that they had failed in the past had nothing to do with their ethnic background . So project youngsters were matched with white students from other junior high schools  --  boys and girls who exhibited the same level of ability , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the real test of what special help could do , and it would provide some valid clues as to whether training rather than biology was responsible for the lack of achievement . The fantastic success of Higher Horizons can be demonstrated in a hundred ways . Perhaps nothing is more revealing than a comparison of a pre-project class that went from Mahattanville to George Washington in 1953 with the classes that have made the transition since the project began . Of the 105 students in the 1953 group , only five passed all their academic courses in their first year at George Washington . Only two had averages of 80 per cent or better . Of the 148 students in the first project class in 1957 , thirty-eight passed all their majors , eighteen averaging 80 per cent or better . Of 111 students in the 1958 group , forty-three passed all their academic courses , sixteen scoring over 80 per cent . Of 101 students in the 1959 group , fifty-eight passed all their majors , twenty-eight with averages of 80 per cent or higher . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered about the intelligence of their charges . Educators long have assumed that I.Q. scores are a steady indication of native ability  --  that is , that a child with an I.Q. of 100 in the fourth grade will score 100 in the eleventh grade , barring some abnormal pattern in his development . But look at what happened to 105 project students . In February , 1956 , just thirty-two of these youngsters scored 100 or above and only seven had I.Q. 's above 120 . The median I.Q. for the group was 92.9 . These 1956 tests were given as a normal part of the school program . The results were cited as evidence of the need for such a project . When retested last May , sixty of these youngsters scored 100 or above and fourteen were at 120 or above . The median score had risen almost ten points to 102.2 . The rise in I.Q. leads New York School Superintendent John Theobald to conclude that " We just did n't know how to measure the potential , the intelligence , of these deprived youngsters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the effect of the project on school discipline . In the subway elevator at 191st and St. Nicholas an olive-skinned teen-ager may sing , " Sweet marijuana , sweet marijuana , birds need seed and I need weed , sweet marijuana . " But inside George Washington there is order and a sense of purpose . Hillson says students from J.H.S. 43 once were a disciplinary headache , and that 80 per cent of the troublemakers were Negroes and Puerto Ricans . " Since the project began , we have n't had a single student from ' 43 ' involved in a disciplinary problem , " he reports . This becomes credible when you hear Hector Motroni explain that " The project is like a big net under which we all are brothers . We understand each other 's problems . One member helps the other . We are all very sad now because Jose , a very smart boy who had to work from five to twelve P.M. every school day , finally had to quit school this year . " Higher Horizons also tries to guide to useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . Prior to the project , youngsters who could n't pass their academic courses were practically ignored . If advanced algebra , chemistry or English so disillusioned a lad that he decided to drop out of school , so what , if he was past sixteen ? He was just one more " knucklehead " to whom teachers would n't have to devote precious time . Now the laggards are shifted to programs in which they can continue to learn and retain a sense of achievement . George Washington is operating two special courses designed primarily to prepare the youngsters enrolled in them to secure and hold a job that will enable them to maintain their self-respect and to stay off the public relief rolls . Fr.hruary 4 , imti It is significant . Hillson says , that 25 per cent of the first project group will go to college . Just as significant , perhaps more so , he asserts , is the fact that of all the project students to enter George Washington , only about 25 per cent will have dropped out or transferred before graduation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Manhattanville students not in the project and a senior-high-school dropout rate of almost 40 per cent for the city as a whole . As Hillson and I stood in the corridor of George Washington , talking about the project , he nodded his head occasionally as students passed by . " Hello , Mr. Hillson , " smiled a Puerto Rican lad . I was told that this boy originally had scored 77 on an I.Q. test . He had a tremendous language handicap and had been put in the " F " category , the lowest level of the project . An English teacher gave him special help , starting with the rudiments of the language . The day I saw him he was in the " C " group , the highest level of the project , and his counselor said he " is reading Billy Budd and making every effort to understand it . " A Negro boy stopped to ask Hillson if he could chat with him later . Hillson explained that this lad had extremely irresponsible parents , but he had been taken in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street gang in which he was a " big shot " before he got involved in Higher Horizons . " I thank God for this project , " said Hillson , " for it would be a pity to waste these youngsters . I am constantly amazed at the strength of human beings  --  that these youngsters can overcome so much . " But it must be reiterated that Higher Horizons is working no miracles . The 25 per cent who went to college this year are at least a 500 per cent increase over pre-project classes . But that still leaves 75 per cent of the youngsters at a level of achievement far below what the educators had hoped for . In fact , some have continued to slide backward . Mrs. Helen Powers , a social worker , says that in some instances there are ignorance and indifference " which almost certainly could have been prevented had we gotten to these youngsters earlier . " But Higher Horizons got a big vote of confidence last year when the school board extended it to the third and seventh grades in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About $500,000 of this was provided from local funds , and another $350,000 was received under the National Defense Education Act . Both the board of education and the city Board of Estimate approved an additional $300,000 for this year when the program was expanded to include the third , fourth , seventh and eighth grades in sixty-three schools . Schreiber says the plan is to continue adding grades each year until elementary and junior high schools are blanketed , and then to go to work on the high schools . Hillson says that he is delighted to see the project operating as early as the third grade because " we can get some of these youngsters before it is too late . " He adds , however , that of the roughly 190,000 senior-high-school students in New York City , 100,000 could be helped immensely by the project if art extra $250 a year per pupil were available  --  this would total an extra $25,000,000 a year , or 5 per cent of the New York school budget  --  to give them the kind of help that project youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching with the knowledge that New York 's problem is their problem . Negroes and Puerto Ricans make up 70 per cent of Manhattan 's elementary-school enrollment . Negroes comprise a whopping majority of the school population of Washington , D.C. In Philadelphia , Detroit , Chicago , Los Angeles and other cities the city fathers are taking new looks at the education 89 to the United States tomorrow depends on what we do with school children today . Morc than half of our kids are below middle class . " History shows that the strength of today has come out of the immigrant group of yesterday . " If we cast youngsters aside as if they have no ability , or under a **39;1916;TOOLONG philosophy , we are going to have a weak nation . If we lift these youngsters to their potential , we are going to have a strong nation . It 's as simple as that . "
