Once in a blue moon is North Dakota 's timetable for electing a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives . In 74 years of statehood it has happened only in 1958 , when now-Senator Quentin Burdick pulled a stunning upset . <P> Thus the state 's Republicans were not exactly frantic when they learned that the Democrats were running a politically untested university professor in last week 's special congressional election to fill the seat of Representative Hjalmar C. Nygaard , who died last summer . It would , the G.O.P. thought , be a snap . <P> As it turned out , the Republican candidate won-but not easily . <P> To lead the expected rout , the G.O.P. picked-over two more conservative possibles-Moderate Mark Andrews , 38 , a Fargo farmer and Republican national committeeman . The Democrats had Dr. John Hove , 47 , English professor at North Dakota State University and a down-the-line Kennedy man . <P> <P> But what neither Republicans nor Democrats had reckoned on was the energetic ire of an ultraconservative , Birch-barking farmer from tiny Gilby ( pop . 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money Andrews was entirely too liberal , and two weeks before the election Scott suddenly jumped into the race as an independent " to test conservative strength . " <P> Drawing support from such far-out groups as the Birchers , Scott advised voters to " shoot the works " by sending him to Congress and his political idol , Barry Goldwater , to the White House . He dismissed Democrat Hove as a " fuzzy , liberal , socialist egghead , " concentrated his fire on Fellow Republican Andrews . " The middle of the road has shifted to the left of center , " cried Scott of Andrews ' moderate views . " The center line on the highway is dangerous ground . " <P> All this proved mighty worrisome to North Dakota Republicans who feared Scott might siphon off enough G.O.P. votes to give the race to Democrat Hove . Appealing to " alarmed Republicans , " the party organization mounted a massive get-out-the-vote drive , brought in moderate Senator Milton Young , who labeled Scott a " far-right liberal . " <P> <P> The clincher came when Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews : " Your views on fiscal responsibility , less Government interference and a firm foreign policy are in accord with the sentiments of all Americans . " When the ballots were finally counted , Winner Andrews had 47,068 to Hove 's 42,479 . Third-Runner Scott showed up with only 6,018 , less than 7% of the vote . <P> All of which seemed to indicate that , at least in North Dakota , the radical right produces more sound than power-generating steam .
