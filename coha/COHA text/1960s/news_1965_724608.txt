txt , Senator Robert F. Kennedy , Democrat of New York , was accured today of trying to promote , while he was Attor , ney General , a magazine expos ? of James R. Hoffa . The attempt was said to have occurred while 111offa , the Teamsters Union tiresicient , was in legal trouble - ; with the Federal Government . The charge was made by Thomas A. Bolan of New York , a lawyer . He said that as Attorney General Mr. Kennedy had sought to have Life magazine ; publish an interview with Sam Baron , a disgruntled teamster ' official . The effect of the article would presumably have been to prejudice public opinion against Hoffa while he was having legal difficulties with the Government . Senator Kennedy promptly denied the charge , saying that he had not attempted to " plant " a story about Hoffa with the magazine . He said that Mr. Baron had " been in fear of his life and got in touch with me . " Mr. Bolan made his charge in testimony before a Senate subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . He appeared with Roy M. Cohn , who was chief counsel of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953-54 , while Senator Joseph R. McCarthy was chairman . Mr. Kennedy was then the minority counsel of the same subcommittee . Mr. Bolan was counsel for Mr. Cohn , now a lawyer in New York , when Mr. Cohn was tried and acquitted last year on 10 counts of perjury and obstruction of justice . Both lawyers had been put under Post Office Department mail covers , through which mail is under surveillance to detect possible wrongdoing . While Mr. Cohn was under indictment , Mr. Bolan testified , Life magazine published an article about him . In seeking to determine whether the Justice Department had had anything to do with it , he said , he caused the Life files on the article about Mr. Cohn to be subpoenaed . It was in this file , he said , that he found the reference to the Hoffa case , apparently included there by a clerical error . At the time Mr. Kennedy was said to have encouraged the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Detroit banking executive had been charged by a Federal grand jury with misusing for personal profit $500,000 in union funds for the development of a retirement village for teamsters ' union members in Florida . ' On July 13 , 1961 , all 12 counts of the indictment were dismissed by Federal Judge Joseph P. Lieb in Orlando , Fla. , because of a defect in the selection of the grand jury . In support of his charge , Mr. Bolan presented what he identified as a copy of a memorandum dated March 6 , 1961 , It was from Henry Suydam , then Washington bureau chief for Life magazine , and was addressed to E , K. Thompson , a Life editor in New York . " Last Saturday , " it read , " I got a call from Bob Kennedy asking if I could drop whatever I was doing and come to his office . I did , and when I got there he closed the door and told me the following : " In a back room was a high official of the teamsters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization since 1953 . He was particularly knowledgeable about Hoffa . " The man had been working directly with Kennedy and in secret fo " the last two years . He was now so disillusioned and disgusted with the corruption he saw all around him , particularly as concerns Hoffa , that he has just about decided to make a public break with the union . " Kennedy said he had suggested to this man that he make his break via an article in Life in the form of a personal expos ? of Hoffa . " Kennedy asked my personal word that for the moment only you and I would know of this matter . " The teamster official in the back room was identified as Sam Baron , of the warehouse- ! men 's branch of the teamstersj He was said now to be connected with " some blue-collar , workers ' union. - In March , 1962 , Hoffa was , arrested in Washington on an assault charge . He was accused of beating up Mr. Baron in a dispute at the union 's headquarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing convictions in two other cases , one on a charge of jurytampering in Nashville last year and the other on charges , of fraud in Chicago . Another memo , dated only ' " Thursday . " and signed " Hank Suydam , " said : " I told Ker.nedv of your ; high interest and he is ! delighted . 11 " He makes the suggestion that the piece go into Baron 's background and philosophy , to help explain his disgust with , Hoffa and his motive for breaking with the teamsters . Bob agrees that a ghost writer makes good sense . " ' In denying Mr. Bolan 's charges , Mr. Kennedy said that Mr. Baron had suggested an article in Life . " If he was killed , " the Senator said , " he wanted to he able to tell his story . through Life magazine . I put him in ' touch . The story was not to be published unless something hap- ! pened to him . " At this time , Mr. Kennedy said , Mr. Baron was a witness ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Justice.1 Asked whether it was not un- ! usual for a Government official ' to pass a witness on to a magazine , Mr. Kennedy said : " Not really . " The Senator pointed out that no article had appeared in Life until after Mr. Baron had bro- ' ken with Hoffa , and that it ' then was a different kind of article . " This was about 12 or 18 months later , " he said . " I simply made sure that the ! information he had was available to the magazine . While was Attorney General no information was furnished to any . publication about anyone under indictment . At that time Life magazine contacted the Justice ' Department , but no information ' was furnished directly or indirectly by the department . This was something purely between , Mr. Baron and Life magazine . " ' in discussing with the coin mittee the mail cover that was ' applied while Mr. Cohn was under indictment , Mr. Bolan , said that he had learned accidentally that his mail was under surveillance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a substitute , in deliver- : ing his mail at home , also ' delivered the order for coverage . Dated March 29 , 1963 , it ' bore the warning to the post-man : " Confidential ? submit all first class mail to supervisor . Do not reveal this to addressee or other unauthorized person . " " It was like an act of God , this delivery of the cover order , " Mr. Bolan said . He explained that with its aid he was able to get the cover canceled . Federal Judge Archie Dawson , who issued the stoppage order , described the surveillance as being " shocking , " he said . Mr. Cohn said that two covers had also been put upon his mail . One , he said , was obtained by I the Internal Revenue Service , the other by the office of the United States Attorney , Robert M. Morgenhau . In addition , Mr. Cohn said , his clients underwent interrogation , he was asked to provide a list of the telephones he used , and relate conversations he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of questioning , Mr. Cohn said , he answered all of the 4,851 questions put to him . Both Mr. Cohn and Mr. Bolan protested that the surveillance through mail covers and other actions had seriously handicapped them in preparing the defense for Mr. Cohn 's case . Senator Edward V. Long , the Missouri Democrat who heads the subcommittee , called Mr. Bolan 's testimony " shocking , " and said he would forward the transcript of the testimony on this phase to the full Judiciary Committee , of which the subcommittee is a unit . " There is a question of jurisdiction in this matter and I would like the committee to rule on it . It is obvious that the Department of Justice was attempting to try cases in the press . To me that is a very serious charge . " Kennedy Called ' Correct ' Reached at his home last night . Edward K. Thompson , the Life editor , said that " Senator Kennedy 's statement on this matter is basically correct . " " As far as I understand , " Mr. Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine and was introduced to Suydam by Bob Kennedy . Beyond introducing us to Baron , that was the last we heard of Kennedy .
