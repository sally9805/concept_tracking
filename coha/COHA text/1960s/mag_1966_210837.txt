There was little question about the quality of the movies that Robert A. Klor intended to produce . In 1964 , he hired a couple of models named Candy Bunch and Lori Lorianne to " star " in two films , each of which depicted a single nude woman in poses that the Los Angeles prosecutor described as " invitations to sexual activity . " After playing their parts , Candy and Lori became suspicious about Klor 's plans for the films , and they called the cops . Three officers entered Klor 's home under authority of an arrest warrant charging him with an overdue parking ticket , then asked to see his " lewd " films . Klor willingly displayed his motion pictures , but wisely stated : " These are not ready for distribution through the mail . They need to be edited . " <P> Despite that disclaimer and the fact that police were unable to prove that he had ever before peddled smut , Klor was convicted of violating a state law banning the distribution of obscene matter . Had he actually done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to show that he had even planned to , ruled California 's highest court as it reversed Klor 's conviction . Basing its reasoning in large part on the Supreme Court decision affirming Eros Publisher Ralph Ginzburg 's five-year federal sentence for sending obscene matter through the mails , the California Supreme Court held that obscenity cases should turn more on the objective conduct of the defendant than on a judge or jury 's subjective opinion about the content of his product. * <P> Whether or not Klor 's films were really obscene , said the court , the California antismut law does not forbid " mere preparation of obscene materials . " Instead , it penalizes " dissemination or intended dissemination . " Not only had the prosecution failed to prove that Klor intended to distribute his unedited films in their allegedly obscene form , but worse , said the State Supreme Court , the trial judge had misconstrued the law and wrongly " communicated to the jury the idea that it need not find ' an intention to distribute ' if it concluded that defendant had prepared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gratuitous unconstitutional reach " that might well encourage lower courts to penalize " matter produced solely for the personal enjoyment of the creator . " Construing Ginzburg , the court stressed : " No constitutionally punishable conduct appears in the case of an individual who prepares material for his own use " or who " intends to purge the material of any objectionable element before distributing or exhibiting it . " To hold otherwise , the court said , " would pose grave technical difficulty for the unconventional artist " and " tend to suppress experimental productions that might become , in finished form , constitutionally protected communication . " <P> <P> * An argument that Ginzburg himself has finally turned to . Last week a U.S. appellate court stayed his sentence for two months to allow him to hone a new appeal claiming he was not personally responsible for trying to mail his products from such " titillating " addresses as Intercourse , Pa . As Ginzburg now tells it , the mailing company he hired devised that ploy without his knowledge .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
