At least one quaint custom of British education has not changed since Tom Brown 's Schooldays : the tradition of " six of the best " for misbehaving pupils . Although the cane and the strap are still essential equipment for every self-respecting headmaster , public indignation against corporal punishment is on the rise , and the Labor government would like to abolish it for good . <P> The outcry against caning stems largely from two recent cases involving brutality in the application of corporal punishment . In May , Headmaster William Michael Byrd of Britain 's Cholderton College was sentenced to five years in prison for forcing schoolboys to lie naked across a bed , then beating them brutally with a stick . Last month Home Secretary Roy Jenkins ordered the closing of Court Lees in Surrey , a so-called " approved school , " which handles potential juvenile delinquents , after its headmaster and an assistant were accused of caning boys " with excessive severity . " Recently , the Royal Navy abolished its traditional caning of youthful sailors after a Parliamentary inquiry revealed that 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Ever alert to a lively controversy , British newspapers have turned up several other cases in which the rod was not spared . Two Southampton schoolboys were given 21 strokes because they incorrectly spelled " meringue . " A teacher admitted beating a seven-year-old girl " red and raw " because she was " work-resistant . " Three girls were caned because they forgot to bring semolina to a cooking class . <P> Never Naked . Although such clear cases of excessive beatings may be rare , there is no doubt that caning in British schools is almost as prevalent as it was during the 19th century . One survey by a London School of Economics professor turned up more than 350 beatings in just four schools last year ; in one of them , the boys averaged two beatings each a year . The approved schools in England and Wales listed 2,968 beatings last year . Local education authorities have the legal right to inflict corporal punishment in Britain , and the Home Office even provides some rules on how it should be done . The cane must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick . A boy can not be beaten with his trousers off or with his shirt tail pulled up . <P> Despite a recommendation by a national advisory council that corporal punishment be abolished in the state primary schools , many British educators stoutly defend the practice as essential to classroom decorum . Of 3,000 delegates at a National Head Teachers Conference this spring , only two voted against caning ; only one delegate did so at a national conference of schoolmasters . And a Gallup poll showed that public protesters are still outnumbered by those who favor the cane and strap . When the new school term opens this fall , British buttocks again will burn .
