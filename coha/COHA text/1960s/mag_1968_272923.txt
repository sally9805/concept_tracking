Some two years ago , Wall Street whiz-bang Meshulam Riklis assigned himself a Herculean task . He aimed to take over Schenley Industries , Inc. , one of the nation 's biggest distillers ( 1967 sales : $518 million ) , through a merger with Glen Alden Corp. , part of the $1.4 billion sales complex that Riklis , 44 , has shuffled together . <P> Riklis took first aim at Schenley 's eccentric founder , chairman and controlling stockholder , Lewis Solon Rosenstiel , 76 . The prospects hardly seemed promising . Rosenstiel had declared that ' I will probably never retire , " and had exploded other merger deals . By last week , Riklis was closer to his goal than many an observer thought he ever would be-though ultimate control of Schenley was still much in doubt . <P> Riklis began his most recent push ast month when he went to Miami to make his case at Rosenstiel 's winter lome . His offer was one that not even Rosenstiel could turn down . For 945,000 Schenley shares owned or controlled by Rosenstiel , Riklis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million-or $80 a share for stock hat had been trading for around $65 . Last week , with the Rosenstiel stock in hand , Riklis was readying an offer , valued at $410 million , for the remaining Schenley stock . <P> " Effective Nonuse . " Should it succeed , the Schenley takeover would cap a comeback for Riklis , a Palestinian immigrant whose seesawing fortunes have fascinated observers on Wall Street for years . Riklis came to the U.S. in 1947 , taught Hebrew and sold stock in Minneapolis until the mid-1950s , when he was struck with what he now calls " the effective nonuse of cash " - or the technique of using borrowed money to buy undervalued companies , whose assets could provide the leverage for still larger takeovers . <P> Backed initially by a group of Minneapolis investors , in less than a decade Riklis spun together a retailing empire under the Rapid-American Corp. , which controlled McCrory Corp . whose 1,500 stores ( McCrory-McLellan-Green , National Shirt , Lerner ) racked up $554 million in sales in 1962 . By then he was vastly overextended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stock tumbled and Riklis ' entire colossus seemed headed for collapse . " God , " wailed Riklis at one point , " has added to our agonies . " <P> Scrambling for survival capital , Riklis sold off Rapid-American 's businesses ( paint , printing and clothing ) , leaving it a mere shell . McCrory , too , came in for a paring . Riklis then bought control of Glen Alden Corp. , a conglomerate with interests in coal and leather goods ( which he sold ) and textiles and R.K.O. theaters ( which he retained ) . By 1965 , such shufflings yielded some $50 million , which Riklis soon put to work . Since early 1966 , Glen Alden has bought into building materials , B.V.D. clothing , and only three months ago , the diversified Stanley Warner Corp. , whose interests include Playtex bras , movie theaters and throat lozenges.
