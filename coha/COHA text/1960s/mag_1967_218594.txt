" Neither the State nor any subdivision or agency thereof shall deny , limit or abridge , directly or indirectly , the right of any person , who is willing or desires to sell , lease or rent any part or all of his real property , to decline to sell , lease , or rent such property to such person or persons as he , in his absolute discretion , chooses . " <P> The language of Proposition 14 on the 1964 California ballot appealed to the voters . According to the California Real Estate Association , it left the state " neutral " in real estate dealings . Its terms were the terms of personal freedom in the use and disposition of private property . It also wiped out the provisions of the Unruh and Rumford acts , which banned racial discrimination in the renting of apartments and in the sale or rental of private dwellings containing more than four units . By an overwhelming vote of almost 2 to 1 , the electorate approved Proposition 14 , which became Section 26 of the California constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to sell or rent to Negroes or Japanese or anyone they chose . But it also left them free not to sell or rent for racial reasons , and this , charged Negroes , amounted to state-sanctioned discrimination , in violation of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. <P> Constitution . Last year the California Supreme Court agreed . " When the electorate assumes the lawmaking function , " said the court , " the electorate is as much a state agency as any of its elected officials . " <P> When the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court last fall , the California decision was endorsed by the state attorney general as well as by U.S. Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall , who argued that Section 26 " is an exercise of state power in support of discrimination . " He felt that it was particularly dangerous because it was not enacted as a simple statute , but was embodied in the state constitution . To put it there , Californians resorted to the basic democratic principle of initiative and referendum . To remove it would take a similar referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you do n't get referendums without hard-earned cash and plenty of it . In no state do minority groups have statewide power . " <P> Last week the Supreme Court upheld the California decision . Speaking for a narrow , five-man majority , Justice Byron R. White declared that in its decision the California Supreme Court had not forbidden Californians either to repeal fair-housing laws or to enact laws making the state " neutral . " All it did was to " reasonably " conclude that Section 26 affirmed discrimination as a state-guaranteed freedom . " We are dealing with a provision which does not just repeal an existing law forbidding racial discrimination , " said White . " Section 26 was intended to authorize , and does authorize , racial discrimination in the housing market . "
