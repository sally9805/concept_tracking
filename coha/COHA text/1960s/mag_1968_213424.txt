Like many scientists before him , Metallurgist William Buehler was blessed with serendipity , the gift of finding something valuable without actually looking for it . Assigned by the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Maryland to find a nonmagnetic and noncorroding material for tools that could be safely used in dismantling magnetic mines , he finally hit upon 55-Nitinol , a nickel-titanium alloy . During further experiments , however , he discovered that the alloy also had a strange and mysterious quality in the realm of science fiction : It had a " memory . " <P> During laboratory tests , Buehler and Physicist Frederick Wang reported in Ocean Engineering , they fashioned Nitinol into a complex shape at a high temperature , then cooled it and crushed it beyond recognition . When they heated the alloy again , it magically regained its original shape , " remembering " every curve and angle . <P> The explanation , the scientists say , is that the Nitinol alloy was heated and shaped above its " transitional " temperature range - the temperature at which there is an atomic shift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cool . No matter how they then distorted the alloy when it was below its transitional temperature , the atoms dutifully shifted right back to their original positions as soon as the alloy was heated above that temperature again . <P> Why the same phenomenon does not take place in other alloys , which also undergo atomic shifts during temperature changes , is not yet clear . <P> Although the theory remains vague , the potential uses of Nitinol alloys seem apparent enough . Goodyear Aerospace Corp . has already demonstrated that a complex Nitinol satellite antenna crumpled up into a small ball before launching can be restored to its original form simply by heating it in space . The same procedure has been proposed for orbiting a radio telescope as large as a mile in diameter . " All we have to do , " says Buehler , " is put these large structures into suitably compact packages on the ground and then kick them into space and let them unfold from solar heating . " <P> The transitional temperature of these structures and of all Nitinol alloys can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Buehler explains , either by varying the percentages of nickel and titanium or by substituting cobalt for some or all of the nickel . Instead of going to the trouble of assembling structures under the sea , for example , Buehler suggests prefabricating them out of Nitinol set below seawater temperatures , cooling and compressing them and then airdropping them-still cooled - into the water . Raised above their transitional temperature by the water , they would unfold and remain rigid on the ocean bottom . <P> Nitinol 's habit of springing back to its original shape when heat is applied also suggests to scientists that it can be used to convert heat energy to mechanical energy . Thus , say Buehler and Wang , it could be used in fire-extinguisher activators and circuit breakers . " The beauty of Nitinol , " says Buehler , " is that it 's something you load ahead of time . Then if you put it in the correct temperature range , it pulls the trigger itself . "                @ @ @ @ @
