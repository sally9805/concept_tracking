WHAT really happened in the Tonkin Gulf during the early days of August 1964 is a question that historians may ponder for decades . All the details will probably never be established . For present-day Americans , the knowable facts are of more than academic interest , since the events of those days set off a chain reaction , beginning with the Tonkin Gulf Resolution in Congress , which has sent more than a million U.S. troops to battle in South Viet Nam . The following account is based on the Defense Department 's official report-much of which was secret until last week-and an exhaustive Associated Press reconstruction based on interviews with officers and enlisted men aboard the U.S.S. Maddox and Turner Joy . <P> Maddox , a 2,200-ton destroyer , left Yokosuka , Japan , July 23 on what seemed to be a routine mission to observe North Vietnamese naval activity in the Gulf of Tonkin . Stopping at Taiwan , she took aboard a " black box , " about the size of a moving van , crammed with electronic gear , and about a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? Defense Secretary Robert McNamara insisted at first that the equipment " consisted in essence " of normal radio receivers that gave the ship " added capacity " to detect indications of possible attack . In testimony released at week 's end , however , he admitted that , far from being routine , the electronic gear was designed to somehow " trigger " North Vietnamese radar so that the U.S. would know the frequencies of Northern radar installations . Then , in an amazing turnabout , the Navy disputed its chief , insisting that the equipment was indeed only standard gear . <P> With the new equipment-whatever it was-Maddox took up patrol , with orders never to venture closer than eight miles to the North Vietnamese mainland , or closer than four miles to any Northern islands . How close she did go , in fact , has not been disclosed . McNamara maintains that Hanoi never officially announced its claim to a twelve-mile boundary until Sept. 1 , 1964 , so that , as far as the U.S. was concerned , Maddox was always within international waters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol boats ( the night of July 30-31 ) shelled the Northern islands of Hon Me and Hon Nieu , staging points for Northern infiltration to the South . Did Maddox help the Southerners by diverting Northern attention from the attack ? McNamara says no , but he acknowledges that the U.S. was aware that the islands would be bombarded . <P> Grave Consequences <P> On the morning of Aug. 2 , Maddox saw three North Vietnamese torpedo boats near Hon Me . Later that day , three PT boats closed on Maddox within clear sight of her lookouts , and kept closing , despite warning shots . The battle was on . By the time it was over , one boat was dead in the water and presumed sinking ; two others were damaged by F-8 Crusader jets , called in from the U.S. aircraft carrier Ticonderoga . Maddox suffered minimal damage . The Pentagon has pictures of the action , and no one questions this part of the story . The destroyer Turner Joy , a 2,850-tonner , was sent to reinforce Maddox , and the patrol-now known grandiloquently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug. 4 , at 7:40 p.m. , Maddox radarmen spotted what they reckoned to be five torpedo boats 36 miles to northeast . Task Group 72.1 began preparing for action .
