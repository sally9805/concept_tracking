Jim Hoffa built a great mountain , His enemies started cavin ' in Jim just smiled , and shook his head . <P> " That 's just my teamsters rollin ' in " Lawd , Lawd ! <P> " That 's just my teamsters rollin ' in . " <P> So proclaims a song called Hoffa 's Blues , on sale on records last week in the lobby of the Miami Beach Auditorium . Inside , the 1,845 delegates to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters convention indeed rolled in for President James Hoffa just about all that he could wish-with the possible exception of his tormentors ' heads . <P> Yelling , stamping , cheering , the Teamsters elected Hoffa , 53 , to a third five-year term . By acclamation , they gave him a $25,000 raise , to $100,000 a year . They voted-with just one local representative opposed-$1,277,000 in union funds for the legal defense of criminally indicted officers , notably Hoffa himself . They also voted an amendment to the union 's constitution that creates a general vice-presidency and provides for automatic succession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the post : chubby , cheerful Frank Fitzsimmons , 58 , Hoffa 's loyalist supporter among the union 's international vice presidents and his protg of 30 years ' standing . <P> Dead Putsches . The most amazing fact about the whole convention was that Jimmy Hoffa continued , despite everything , to exert his iron hold on the Teamsters . After all , Hoffa was convicted in 1964 for conspiracy and fraud in the handling of Teamster pension funds . That year he was also found guilty of attempting to suborn a jury in a 1962 trial in which he was accused of accepting a bribe from trucking operators . Hoffa was sentenced to 13 years in prison , remains free while the cases are under appeal. * He has been ostracized by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , been hit by Government investigations and prosecutions and by numerous revelations of abuses of the rank and file 's rights . <P> There is ; of course , sonic opposition to Hoffa within the Teamsters : a local Teamster official provided the crucial testimony at the jury tampering trial , and a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of union funds in Hoffa 's legal defense , a move that has so far succeeded . For the most part , though , opposition to Hoffa is divided and weak . Potential putsches die aborning for lack of courage or of a rival leader strong enough to attract wide support . <P> Despite his brawler 's background and pugnacious mien , Hoffa possesses Stalinesque talents for political maneuvering , deftly dividing adversaries and concentrating authority in his own hands . Fitzsimmons ' election is symbolic of how Hoffa has retained power ; it gives him a fighting chance to continue his rule , from behind bars if necessary . <P> Defensive Circle . Most of all , Hoffa has made the Teamsters prosperous and powerful in his ten years as union president-and they know and appreciate it . While the A.F.L.-C.l.O. has become sluggish , the Teamsters have expanded ( to 1.7 million members , the nation 's largest union group ) , enjoy steadily improving wages and benefits . One of the laudatory messages to the convention came from Tom Buckley of Maiden , Mass. : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200-a-week truck driver . Continued success and best wishes . "
