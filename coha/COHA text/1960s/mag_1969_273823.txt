A common complaint among many Negroes-and more than a few whites - is that U.S. justice is all too often far from colorblind . Three recent criminal cases , all involving youthful Negro defendants and all leading to harsh sentences , have prompted black and white citizens alike to protest the severity of the courts . <P> &gt; In Harrisburg , Pa. , three Negro teenagers pleaded guilty to the charge of shooting a 64-year-old man to death during a bank robbery last December . Despite the guilty <P> plea , which normally enables the accused to avoid the death penalty , Samuel Barlow , 18 , Foster Tarver , 17 , and Sharon Wiggins , 17 , were sentenced to die in the electric chair for first-degree murder . To be sure , the three had not shown any mercy to George Morelock , a bank customer who was shot six times when he advanced toward Sharon after being ordered to stand against a wall . " This was a murder in cold blood , " said one of the three judges who handed down the death sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convicted teenagers argues that execution is unjustified in view of the offenders ' youth and the fact that they had thrown themselves on the mercy of the court . The Rev. Frank Horton , a Negro minister who heads the committee , asks : " Would three white youths have received the same punishment ? " <P> &gt; On the day Martin Luther King Jr . was buried in April 1968 , five young Negroes in Benson , N.C. , set fire to a rundown service station that was known as a Ku Klux Klan hangout . Damages came to less than $100 , but last October the five youths were sentenced to twelve years apiece in prison . A month ago , Judge William Bickett frankly confessed that he might have been guilty of " bad judgment " in the cases of Percy Valle Barfield , 17 , Frederick Lockamy , 18 , Leo Stewart Jr. , 19 , Dubois Scotty Gather , 20 , and Jesse Jones , 21 . Bickett noted that a race riot had broken out in the Benson area before the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " deterrent . " <P> Probably hoping that Bickett himself will recommend a reduction in the sentences , Governor Robert Scott has yet to act on a plea for executive clemency . A biracial group called the " Committee for Equal Justice " is circulating petitions on behalf of the imprisoned youths . <P> &gt; In a Connecticut court , four Negro boys were convicted by an all-white jury in October of raping a 14-year-old white girl named Donna Papineau . One of them , 16-year-old Gary Palmer , was sent to the state reformatory at Cheshire . His two brothers , 17 and 19 , along with a 19-year-old cousin named Arturo Palmer , a college-scholarship winner , were given prison terms ranging from nine to 16 years . The only eyewitness was Donna , who testified that the boys forced her into a car in Stamford and took her to an apartment where all four beat and raped her . Gary did not take the stand , but the other three defendants testified that they had not had intercourse with Donna . One of the brothers said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had quarreled with her mother for " fooling around " with Gary . The defense also introduced a letter from Donna inviting Gary to her home and promising that " nobody will be there . "
