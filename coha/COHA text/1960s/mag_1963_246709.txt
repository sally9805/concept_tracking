En route to the U.S. , where TV pundits were already vying for guest interviews , photogenic Mme. Ngo Dinh Nhu stopped over in Paris and more than lived up to her newspaper billing as " the Liz Taylor of politics . " Chic and seductive , South Viet Nam 's first lady did a bit of shopping , had her hair done at Carita ( " I hope my husband does n't notice I had my hair cut-he hates that " ) , and claimed that at heart she was just a little homebody . " I am always presented as a political animal , " she complained . " I like home life very much , and I cook very well . " <P> But at a press conference , Mme. Nhu reverted to type and told reporters that the whole purpose of her trip was to clear up some of the " calumny " aimed at her homeland . She denied that her husband was head of the secret police , said that he has always helped the government without any compensation . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communists , she said , but the first Buddhist monk who had burned himself alive had been drugged and the second clubbed into submission by fellow priests . Mme. Nhu also claimed that she had been misquoted when she allegedly called youthful U.S. military advisers in South Viet Nam " soldiers of fortune , adventurers , and saboteurs . " What she had really said , she maintained , was that a country like the U.S. , " with over 100 million inhabitants , had among its lower officials some adventurers who did not hesitate to betray the official policy of their government . " <P> Asked about her troubles with the U.S. press , Mme. Nhu said that " my trip is a sincere effort to determine if freedom of expression is a reality in America . " While demonstrators outside tossed eggs at her car , one reporter asked if she was frightened going out in Paris . Milady 's unruffled reply : " No . The only thing in the world I am afraid of is long hairy caterpillars . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
