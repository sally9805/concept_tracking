Early Sin in the early ' thirties W HEN I was young I thought I was in love with Eileen Sommers , but it was her mother I was really in love with , and she was a policewoman . Unlike her daughter who was dark and silent , Mrs. Sommers was light-hearted and spirited . She relished every moment of her bounteous life and appeared eager to share it with anyone . She wore excellent clothes , tailored suits mostly , but she never looked mannish . There was always a frill around her neck or at her cuff . It was hard to imagine that this chic , gay woman was a tough officer of the law . She owned a collection of expensive purses and invariably carried one of them with her . They were gifts , she said smiling slyly , for services rendered . What these services might be I could only guess at , but of one thing I was certain : I knew that within the purse lay that silvery passport to splendor , adventure , and sin -- a police badge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask if I would care to go dancing with Eileen . I said that I would . We met that evening on the corner of Ninth Avenue and Fifty-third Street . The policewoman and her daughter were waiting for me beneath the " el " which ran along Ninth Avenue at that time . Mrs. Sommers was on night duty and Eileen had been forced to tag along with her mother . Mrs. Sommers seemed more than happy to have me join them . I would keep her daughter company while she went about her duties . The policewoman , a divorcee , was forever rounding up known prostitutes . She handled them with a kind of rough affection . That evening Mrs. Sommers stopped in at several evil dance halls looking for prey . While she transacted her business with the sharp-eyedproprietors of these places  --  Italian , Spanish , and Irish  --  her daughter Eileen and I danced . The last stop of that night tour was a dance palace at Fourteenth Street and Third Avenue , up one flight . We came into a huge ballroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make out the girls dancing with their partners  --  sailors in white uniforms , soldiers , and many foreign-looking men in shirt sleeves . Though there was a band playing on a stage beneath red and blue light bulbs , the ballroom seemed supernaturally still , entranced , as though a seance were taking place . There was no laughter , no buzz of conversation , only the rhythmic shuffling of feet . The dancers , fixed in their poses , revolved slowly about the dark hall in deep concentration . I was about to lead Eileen on to the dance floor as I had in the other halls , but Mrs. Sommers said , " Uh-uh , Eileen , not for you . Just go and sit down . Wait . " Pouting , but obedient , Eileen went and sat down on a bent wood chair against the wall . " You go on and dance if you want , " the policewoman said to me . " Hey , give the boy some tickets , Mamie , " she called to an aged peroxide blonde who sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seasoned customer I sauntered over . The cashier gave me a gold-toothed smile and handed me a strip of tickets . " What do / do now ? " I asked . " Just go pick out what you want and let yourself go , Sonny . " She nodded toward a row of girls who sat motionless against a wall . I knew that Eileen had her eyes on me . I knew too that I was undergoing some sort of test that evening . It was the first time I had been out on duty with 6G EARLY SIN IN THE EARLY the policewoman and she was watching my reactions carefully . if my behavior pleased her knew I would he invited out again . It was important to me that I impress her favorably . I reached the row of waiting girls , and stopped before the nearest one . I did n't want to offend any of them by presuming to have made a choice . Silently , without looking up at me , the girl reached out her hand . I placed my ticket in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she got to her feet . Still she did not look at me . She stood waiting , chewing gum languidly , gazing beyond me at the entwined , silent couples on the dance floor . The girl was astonishing looking  --  her lips lacquered , her eyelashes drooping with mascara , not a line to be seen in her face , and the only movement there was the slow rhythmic rolling of a jaw . She came into my arms and a shiver of fright went through my body . She clung to me effortlessly . I had never before known such utter intimacy . We slipped into the silent stream of revolving couples and moved about the room . The girl was silent , and I was too shocked by the new sensations I was experiencing , too absorbed in them to open my mouth . Now I knew why the dance hall was so silent . Now I understood the reason for that intense concentration which I had sensed upon entering the dimly-lit room . Out of the corner of my eye I saw the policewoman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thrust the bottle away from her mouth in a moment , gasping like a child and blinking her eyes , shouting with laughter . " Wow ! " she cried . The music stopped . The girl and I separated . There was no applause . In a moment the hand started playing again . " Would you like to dance some more ? " I asked cautiously . The girl shrugged . " Gim me another ticket , " she murmured . I handed her another one of the tickets . She put it into her pocket and moved back into my arms . It was as though she had never left them . Again we slowly circled the ballroom . I saw Eileen sitting gloomily near the cashier 's cage watching us . She was twisting a curl of her hair around her anger and staring at us . As the dancing-girl and I passed Mrs. Sommers , she laughed knowingly . " All right , that 's enough now , you , " she called . I laughed too , a little uneasily , and excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately and took a place in the frieze along the wall . When Mrs. Sommers , Eileen , and I reached the street , Mrs. Sommers said , " Well , my boy , ' THIRTIES you 've just been in the wickedest dance hall in town . and you 've just danced with Maureen . " " She 's a wonderful dancer , " I said . " Yeah . I got her sixty days in Jefferson Market Court last year for dancing naked at a stag party , She 's behaving herself though . Boy , she 's a " She 's horrible , Mother , " Eileen said . " And I just hate coming to these places . " " Oh , do n't he a goof , " Mrs. Sommers said . " I thought it was a very interesting experience , " I said . " Oh , you shut up ! " Eileen cried , turning on me . " I saw you enjoying every minute of it ! " " Why should n't he ? It wo n't hurt him none , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do ? " " You ! Why you danced in every Goddamn stinking dance hall ? " " Mother ! " " Well , she just makes me so mad , " the policewoman said turning to me and laughing apologetically . " I forget my language . " I laughed . " See , " she continued , looking at me with admiration , " he does n't care about my language . Eileen 's going to college but I could hardly get through high school . " " Mother , you 've been drinking . " " So what ? " She turned to see my reaction to this . I smiled . " See ? " Mrs. Sommers said , " he 's a good kid . He can come out on the rounds with me anytime . As for you , young lady , do n't go trying to compare yourself to a man , and what he enjoys . Come on , let 's hop this cab . " She stepped out into the traffic and flagged a taxi . My heart swelled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , treated me not as the high-school boy I was , but as a man . In the dark taxi Eileen sat glowering and silent but Mrs. Sommers kept up her drunken chatter and when at one point she patted my hand , I knew I had passed the test . I ATE in August , Mrs. Sommers invited me 4 to lunch with Captain O'Hurley of the police department . The policewoman had often talked of him , but I had never seen him . He was Mrs. Sommer 's best friend and , I gathered , her guardian in the department , and now by the end of summer I had somehow earned the right to meet him . We were to pick him up in his police station in lower Manhattan . I went up the steps that Saturday noon , opened the door which was flanked by two large green lamps , and found myself standing before a cop lolling in a swivel chair behind a varnished railing . I had never been in a police station before . In the Brooklyn circles in which I ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked the cop for Captain O'Hurley . " He knows you 're coming , " he said , pressing a button on his desk . I heard the policewoman 's healthy laughter corning from behind a closed door . She came out with Eileen and in a moment we were joined by a short , asthmatic man . A golden badge glistened on his blue uniform . He swatted the policewoman affectionately on her backside , shouted a good-natured command to the cop in charge , and ushered us out of his domain . " So you 're Eileen 's boy friend , " he said to me as we went down the steps to the street . " She thinks the world of you , this one does . " He smiled up at Mrs. Sommers who was quite a bit taller than Captain O'Hurley . " Well , where do you want to eat , honey ? " he asked her . She mentioned the name of a restaurant and we started walking downtown , passing the Municipal Building and City Hall and entering Park Row . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a long flight of wooden steps to a landing . We lined up before a metal door . Captain O'Hurley pressed a button . A slot in the door slid open and a suspicious eye peered out . In a moment the eye brightened and the door opened . We were enthusiastically greeted by a cheerful man with an Italian accent . He led us to a large table at the rear . The place was crowded . Mostly they were newspapermen , Captain O'Hurley said , good fellows who liked to drink . It was in the days of Prohibition , and the Captain announced proudly that this restaurant was one of the nice places in town where you got drinks openly with meals . Wine was n't served in thick coffee cups but in regulation wine glasses , and you could even place a bottle of whiskey on your table without fear . The Captain thought Prohibition a crackpot law . He would have nothing to do with its enforcement .

There was wine for Eileen and myself , poured out of a bottle encased in a raffia net , and there were large tumblers of straight whiskey for the policewoman and the Captain . We ate and drank for an hour , and after dessert a box of cigars was brought to the Captain . He took a fistful , stuck one in his mouth and the rest in his pocket . Then he glanced at his watch and said , " Well , what should we do this afternoon ? How 'd you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped . I had no idea what a fan-tan was , but that it was something sinful , I had no doubt . When I expressed my eagerness , the Captain laughed and left the table . He returned in a little while . " Well , " he said , " I just phoned . It 's all set . Let 's go . " We stood up . I realized then that no one was going to pay for the spectacular lunch we had just consumed . Instead , the short , waddling Captain O'Hurley led us down a corridor of smiling waiters . At the door , he offered the proprietor one of the cigars he had taken earlier . The man accepted it , thanking him effusively and said , " You come again soon , Captain , hah ? " When we reached the street , Captain O'Hurley said , " We 've got to get over to Chinatown .

All New York belonged to them , the upper world and the underworld , and they had the power to show its sinful , secret wonders to me . Eileen and I followed behind them giggling with excitement like kids going to the circus with their parents . We left Park Row and plunged into the shadows of the Bowery . At Chatham Square we turned into one of those twisting streets in Chinatown . A " Black Maria , " clanging its bell , came down the street . I was a little frightened , and yet the emotion was pleasurable . I knew I was safe . After all , I was a guest of the law . I had visions of police hacking down a door , breaking in on an evil opium den . I would be present as the police ripped the deadly fan-tan from the mouths of the addicts .

" Now is n't she the sweetest thing , that woman ? " the policewoman said , laughing happily . " Oh , I tell you , people in this town , there 's no one like them . " There were tears in her eyes . She had had much to drink . One of the shoulder straps of her dress had slipped down , and she looked voluptuous and abandoned . She shouted a good deal and waved her arms at passers-by . Eileen remained silent , staring out across the room , somber and pouting . Suddenly it occurred to me that Eileen did n't like her mother , nor , indeed , any of us . She sat next to me , rigid and withdrawn , as though she were rebuking us . I wished she would go away . She was chilling the noisy , festive atmosphere around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite drunk now , leaned over and kissed the policewoman , Eileen rose quickly and said she had to go to the powder room . I hoped she would never come back . I sat watching the Captain kissing the policewoman , thinking how wonderful it was to he grown-up on a New Year 's Eve in New York . When Captain O'Hurley released Mrs. Sommers , her laughter soared above all the other noise in the room . She leaned over and offered her cheek to me , which I kissed . " What 's a matter with you ? " Captain O'Hurley shouted . " Let him have it good , Marie ? " Mrs. Sommers turned and raised her lips toward mine . I hesitated a moment . ' ' Go on , boy ! " the Captain shouted good-naturedly . " You got ta learn sooner or later . " I kissed the policewoman on the lips . Eileen came back to our table . The policewoman saw her daughter first . " It 's twelve o'clock , honey , " she said laughing , looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearie , " she added , poking me . I got up and tried to kiss Eileen on the lips but she sat down abruptly . " It 's only half-past eleven , " she said . " Oh , what the hell , " the Captain said , pulling the bottle out from under the table and pouring a drink for each of us . At the next table , the party had got wild . They were throwing streamers and confetti at one another . Only the tousled-haired matron sat silently , weaving unsteadily in her chair . She had become almost regal ; there was a fixed , detached little smile on her face as she looked around at the New Year 's crowd in the restaurant . Without warning , she rose and came over to our table . She stood next to Captain O'Hurley and addressed him apologetically . " I 'm Mrs. Johnson , " she said thickly . " I live up there on Madison Avenue , very nice house . ' THIRTIES I would be pleased you and yours do me the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , fixing a somber eye on me , she continued , lowering her voice , " I know who you are , Your Highness . You 're traveling incognito . " All of us were stunned as she sank to her knee before me , lifted my hand and kissed it . Captain O'Hurley and Mrs. Sommers whooped with laughter . The Captain wiped the tears out of his eyes and said , " That 's all right , toots . " " You 're here to guard him , of course , " Mrs. Johnson said , rising and addressing the uniformed Captain . " Sure thing , " the Captain said laughing , his stomach heaving jovially . " That 's just what I 'm doin ' . " " Guard the prince well , " the woman continued drunkenly . " I have always been a friend of the Russian royal family . " She turned abruptly and went back to her table , where she plopped down into her chair . Everyone around us laughed . The policewoman shouted in an incredulous tone of voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eileen suddenly broke into tears , pushing the large napkin into her face , covering it completely , smothering her sobs . At that moment the band broke out with " Auld Lang Syne . " It was midnight . While people all over the restaurant were kissing one another and horns were blowing , I tried to soothe the weeping Eileen . " I do n't know what 's the matter with me , " she said , over and over again . " I do n't know what 's the matter . I 'll be all right . " " You should n't have given her that hard liquor , John , " the policewoman said . " You feel like throwing up , Eileen ? " " Just leave me alone , " she screamed above the noise of the horns . " I 'll be all right . " " Well , let 's you and me dance , Prince , " Mrs. Sommers laughed , rising . I was glad to escape the weeping girl . I took the policewoman in my arms and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I saw the policewoman and her daughter . 1 went out to the Midwest to college and made no attempt to see them again , nor did they ever call me . As for Captain O'Hurley , I read in the newspapers sometime later that he had been demoted , and transferred to a post where the opportunity to receive graft and bribes from " clients " were slim indeed . He had been made an ordinary foot-cop and now patrolled the Brooklyn Bridge . I viewed their departure with sorrow and wondered who now would show me the face of sin in my city . TELEPHONIC MNEMONIC Felicia Lamport T ELEPHONE books have become so vast that it strains the wrist to lift them , the eye to scan them , and the patience to handle them . The relatively small compendia of Numbers Most Frequently Called are of use only at home , and not much even there  --  the telephone company has induced most of us to overextend in acquiring extensions with the result that we are always leaving the phone book next to the instrument we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . Clearly the time has come to develop some sort of system for remembering telephone numbers with a minimum of strain . The device of logomorphisni seems the most practical for a word-oriented nation like ours . The game of changing numbers into words has worked admirably for me and endowed me with a splendid reservoir of unexpended time and unexploded temper . Let me offer a few examples to illustrate the technique . 6681 is my own number . For some reason it seems to be difficult to memorize or even to repeat accurately  --  it usually comes out 6881 . It can , however , be immutably fixed by the story of the missionary who went to a small island inhabited only by six cannibals . Nothing further was heard about him until a message was transmitted by drum-semaphor : six sick ; ate one . The number 9429 suggests the somewhat exotic mnemonic of a coy German girl with an imperfect command of English who , on being asked for a date answers : Nein for tonight . It should be noted for the benefit of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect ; it must only identify the number . 2282 requires that Caesar 's death scene be padded by having him identify two old friends among the conspirators before his eye falls Brutus . Caesar then says : " To , to , et tor fixing the number with unforgettable drama . Similar numbers need not produce related logomorphisms. 2242 is brought to mind not by any reference to Caesar but by invoking the image of a set of Siamese twins who , on deciding to study the ballet , go to a costumer to order the appropriate four-leg-holed garment : a tutu for two . Visual imagery of any kind is most helpful . Consider the number 0415 in the context of a scoutmaster who tries to organize a parade with music , but on finding that his troupe is composed exclusively of drummers , cries plaintively : " 0 for one fife ! " Ideally the number should not only be etched on the mind but tied to its particular subscriber , as in the case of a lady who , immediately after her divorce from an extremely unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felicitous comment on her free , fortunate state . Equally apropos is the number belonging to an amiable couple who serve delicious food , but never more than one drink , and a weak one at that . To recall their number , 4425 , one has only to remember the need to forefortify oneself when going to their house for dinner . Certain numbers seem so startlingly apt that one is moved to wonder whether the telephone company administers some sort of subliminal Rorschach test to subscribers and then matches the numbers to them . Consider the poignant description embodied in 2621 , the number of a hypochondriacal acquaintance who takes positive pride in always being too sick , too wan . All of which ought to be enough to introduce the elements of the logomorphic game . It is eminently simple and practical , and remember : any number can play . PETER F. DRUCKER The Almost Secret Art of Being an Effective President The last in a series of articles on Politics for a New Generation . . . and on the unexpected tasks awaiting the next occupant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign orators , our next President will he a wondrous man . Above all , he will be a statesman . He will also be a first-class administrator , dedicated to efficient government . His political philosophy will be sound . ( Either soundly liberal or soundly conservative , but in any case sound . ) To hear them tell it , he may even be suffused with that elusive quality , " greatness . " These are the terms in which we always discuss our candidates  --  and , indeed , it would be nice for all of us if November 's winner actually proves to be endowed with these blessings . But they are not the things which will decide whether he is going to be a success or failure . That will depend on something else , seldom mentioned during any campaign : his effectiveness . All our experience tells us that a President needs , above all else , to be effective . No effective President in our history has been a failure  --  whatever his convictions or his personal stature . No ineffectual one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how right his policies . Polk and McKinley , for example , were hardly great men , but they made fairly effective Presidents . Herbert Hoover , a much bigger man , did not . Neither did John Adams , though he was a truly great man and a statesman to boot . Mr. Truman , on the other hand , never considered himself a great man ; but he learned to be a highly effective President . This is something that any reasonably intelligent man can hope to learn , for it is about 80 per cent system . Our history indicates that an effective President always does three things . First , he organizes his work so that he can concentrate on his decisive job  --  which is not administration but political leadership . Second , he focuses American politics on the issues that are relevant to the situation  --  not on those which fit his program or his political convictions . Finally , he takes such a big view of his own office and of the American people that he never tries to " sell " anything ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation : a new organization of the President 's job and work . It did not work out . Eisenhower , the man , enjoyed from the first tremendous popularity . Eisenhower , the President , did not really become effective until he had lost Sherman Adams and John Foster Dulles , his two " theater commanders " or " general managers . " Their loss forced him to become a political leader instead of the non-political administrator he had tried to be . The man did n't change , but his role and impact did  --  thus proving again that Presidential effectiveness depends on system rather than personality . There is nothing mysterious about this kind of system . All our effective Administrations have organized their work pretty much the same way , from that miracle that built a nation , George Washington 's first term , to the first " New Deal " term of Franklin D. Roosevelt . As far as the office of the President goes  --  his role as chief of state , head of government , and commander in chief  --  the requirements for effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no substitute for the
