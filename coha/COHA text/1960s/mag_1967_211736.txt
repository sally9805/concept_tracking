Ever since the Berlin Wall went up , East Germany 's Communist government has been pressuring the country 's Evangelical Church to break its ties with Protestantism in West Germany . Last week , in a remarkable act of defiance against their Red bosses , East German Protestant leaders unanimously voted to maintain the union-and then went on to join with their West German counterparts in electing a new chairman of the All-German Church Council . <P> <P> Both actions took place at the annual synods of the two churches , which met under difficult conditions . In the past , the two branches of Protestantism have gathered in different sectors of divided Berlin , and some West Germans have been allowed to visit their brethren in the east . This time , Communist officials forced the East German synod to meet at Fiirstenwalde , 20 miles from Berlin-and made it clear ahead of time that they expected the meeting to end in a formal schism ( TIME , April 7 ) . <P> Strength from the Lord . Their hopes were bluntly disappointed . Addressing the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krum-macher of Greifswald warned : " If Christians , who are limbs of the one Lord , and who belong together as limbs of one church , are no longer allowed to be mentioned in one breath , it is no longer an institutional question but a matter of the unity of faith in one Lord . " <P> <P> Inspired by this proclamation , the 42 delegates issued a statement of policy , asserting that " the 28 Evangelical dioceses in the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic stand together in the spirit of united Christians . " To renounce unity because of political differences " would have the church serve the goddess of the state . " The manifesto concluded : " We therefore have no reason to sever our bonds with the community of the Evangelical Church in Germany . The Lord who forgives us our trespasses will give us the strength to serve him in ever greater freedom . " <P> <P> Equally defiant of Communist hopes was the synod 's participation in the election of a new council chairman , Germany 's top Protestant post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact formally proposed by the Fiirstenwalde session . Regarded as a moderate on the question of East-West relations , Dietzfelbinger was chosen over the pre-synod favorite , Hannover 's Bishop Hanns Lilje , who is more closely identified with Germany 's political controversies . Dietzfelbinger succeeds Bishop Kurt Scharf of Berlin-Brandenburg , who hopes to return to East Berlin , from which he was expelled in 1961.
