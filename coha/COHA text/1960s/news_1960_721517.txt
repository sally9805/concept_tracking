txt deleted first page WASHINGTON GETS A NEW FRANCHISE Senators Go to Minneapolis , but Another Team Will Operate in Capital // so many angles to be considered , such as ball parks and what- to do regarding players , that I can not make any comment until I have talked to the people involved officially . " However , the American Leaguers already appeared assured that ball parks would offer no problem even if the new ownerships in Washington and Los Angeles remained a secret for a few more weeks . The Senators will move into Metropolitan Stadium in Minneapolis , which was built in 1956 and has a seating capacity of 22,000 . However , the Twin Cities organization already has started increasing this to 40,000 for the 1961 football season . Some new seats should be ready for the baseball season . Washington already has started work on a new stadium , a Federal project that will be completed by September , 1961 . It will seat 40,000 persons and is near the National Guard Armory , only about five minutes by cab from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Washington club will play at Griffith Stadium , which up to now has been the home of the Senators . Cal vin Griffith , the Senators ' owner , will retain ownership of the , park for the present . He said ) he would rent it to the new . club . In Los Angeles the situation is less settled , although Cronin said everything would be worked out satisfactorily well before the opening of the 1961 season . Los Angeles Prepared It is presumed that the American League- entry in Los Angeles will play in the Coliseum , now the home of the National League Dodgers . If this can not be worked out , Wrigley Field is available , according to Del Webb , the chairman of the American League expansion committee . Whether the new club eventually will move in with the Dodgers when the latter 's Chavez Ravine stadium is completed can not be answered at this time , said Webb . Immediately after the meetine- , the general managers of the eight clubs went into another session to draw plans that will help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis-St . Paul club will be manned by the Washington Senator players of 1960 . The player plans will be submitted for ratification at another league meeting on Nov. 17 . It is possible that the league will make additional expansion announcements at that time . For in disclosing the new tenclub set-up , Cronin called it " only the first step . " " The American League is considering other fine baseball cities , " said Cronin , " for a possible future expansion to twelve clubs . " It was , in all , a bewildering day . Scrapped , apparently , and with no attempt made to explain why , was the so-called commitment made by the two leagues to the defunct Continental League last summer . A joint expansion committee of the two leagues assured the Continental League then that each league would absorb two Continental cities if the Continental League dissolved . However , none of the Continental League groups figured in yesterday 's moves . Minneapolis-St . Paul does get a bail club , but it will be operated by Griffith 's organization . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been optimistic about gaining entry to the American League . However , there seemed to be no hard feelings . Eliminated but Elated " We are elated over what has happened , " said Wheelock Whitney of the Twin City Continental group . " Our major object has from the first been to get the Twin Cities into a major league . Now that that is assured , we are ready to do everything possible to help Griffith make a success of his new move . " Griffith had tried for many years to get into Minneapolis but the American league had always balked him . He said he wanted the shift for the " betterment of our corporation . " The Twin Cities organization , Griffith said , was guaranteeing him 1,000,000 attendance for each of the next five years . Revenues from radio and television also will be substantially higher than in Washington . " In Washington . ' ' said Griffith , " our radio-TV brought us about $180,000 . Our new contract in Minneapolis should bring us about $500,000 annually . " Although no vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Washington had been approved by 6 to 2 , just enough to make it . The vote was unanimous on the franchise for Los Angeles and the new ownership for Washington . The identity of the new owners will likely remain a mystery for at least two or three weeks . However , the Washington group will not include Hank Greenberg , who had frequently been mentioned as a possible buyer . Greenberg is the vice president of the Chicago White Sox . Greenberg , who attended the meeting , declined to commit himself on whether he might he involved in the Los Angeles venture , Webb also has been mentioned frequently in connection with the Los Angeles club . Though Webb is a Yankee coowner , most of his other business interests are in the West . He said yesterday , however , that there was nothing to the reports that he was interested in a Los Angeles operation . Although disappointed that for the present they had been sidetracked , the Dallas - Fort Worth group , headed . by Amon Carter Jr . and Joseph A. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American League was n't stopping at ten clubs . Another indication of how strikingly sure the American Leaguers were of themselves was the fact that they never even bothered to advise the National League in advance of their plans . " We did n't feel it was necessary to discuss it with them , " said Cronin . " They made their move last week , today we 've made ours . We made our move ! into Los Angeles with the as , surance from Commissioner Frick that he was declaring Los Angeles an open city just as he did New York . " In Cincinnati , Warren C. Giles , the National League president , appeared to show no resentment over the American League action . " I still think it more practical to expand to ten clubs in 1962 , as we 've announced . However , they know what 's best for their league , " he said . This marks the fifth time the American League has shifted its field , with this one the most drastic .
