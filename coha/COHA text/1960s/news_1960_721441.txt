txt Senator John F. Kennedy made his first major stumping tour of New York City yesterday and put in eight hours of whirlwind campaigning within a square mile of midtown Manhattan . Hitting hard at every stop , the Democratic Presidential nominee called for a " march toward peace to replace the drift toward war . " He said perils abroad , as much as the needs at home , ! dictated a change in administration at Washington . Promising leadership to " the new and better world beyond the New Frontier , " he declared : " We have the capacity  --  we have the resources ' - we have the courage and the vision . But we need leadership ,  - -  and that is why I ask your help in this election . " Senator Kennedy stressed that the new national leadership must be dedicated to liberalism . Cheered by Liberals " Only liberalism can repair our national power , restore our national purpose , and liberate our national energies , " he declared . " The basic issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign is whether our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether we will move ahead in the liberal spirit of daring and doing . " The candidate made one of his appeals to 2,000 cheering guests at a Liberal party dinner at the Commodore Hotel at which he accepted the party 's nomination for the Presidency . The Liberal nomination , given to him by acclamation Monday night , could be decisive on Nov. 8 in winning the state 's fortyfive electoral votes , which have been in the Republican column since 1948 . Flanking the Senator as he accepted were Paul R. Hays , David Dubinsky , Alex Rose , // Adolph A. Berle Jr . and others in the top leadership in the party . Adlai E. Stevenson , the Democratic-Liberal nominee in 1952 and 1956 , former Senator Herbert H. Lehman and George Meany , president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations also were present . They voiced strong and enthusiastic support for him in speeches .

Perhaps as many again saw him as he went in a fast-moving motor caravan , followed by three busloads of newspaper men from stop to stop . No attempt was made on this first of six days of campaigning he plans in the city to establish mass contacts . His itinerary took him from a Democratic women 's luncheon at the Commodore Hotel to a labor-sponsored senior citizens ' rally at the City Center . Then he swung over to the WaldorfAstoria Hotel for three events and wound up at the : Commodore for the Liberal party dinner . At every stop the burden of his appeal was the same  --  to end eight years of drift and substitute action . He said America 's defense posture must be strong enough to " convince any potential aggressor that war would be a mistake  --  his mistake . " But he stressed that America must be " planning , preparing and striving for disarmament , " that it must simultaneously build strong ties of friendship , commerce and mutual respect with free nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious issue and before the Liberals jibed at the Republican platform as representing " The Power of Positive Thinking . " This was in obvious reference to . the Rev. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale , the author of a beok by that name , who had questioned a Roman Catholic President 's ability to withstand church pressure . The Democratic candidate , a Roman Catholic , brought laughter and applause with this remark , He was interrupted seventeen times during his speech by applause and a number of other times by laughs . Stresses Peace Theme In his luncheon talk , the senator told an audience , made up preponderantly of women , that his program would take the United States far on the pathway to peace . More than 2,500 women attended the luncheon , sponsored by the Women 's Divisloe of the Democratic State Committee , : The candidate 's wife was at his side at this and several of the other meetings .

An overflow audience of more than 4,500 retired trade unionists heard him appeal for Democratic victory to assure passage of a medical plan for the aged tied in with Social Security . Mayor Wagner and Representative Aime Forand of Rhode Island , sponsor of the bill the candidate backs , heard him tell the warmly applauding audi-ence : " We failed by five votes to pass that bill at the special session and some described that as an ignominious defeat . I do not think so at all because that defeat will bring us victory in January . " The old folks , who jammed even the lofty second and third balconies , broke in on the Senator 's five-Minute speech at least five times with applause . One old lady , grasping his sunbronzed hand as he pushed through the crowd , kissed it . " I do : We you win , young man , " she said fervently , Fund Raisers Busy The Senator then rushed with his party to the Waldorf , where , in quick succession , he attended a fund-raising cocktail party , sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 5,000 in the grand ballroom , sponsored . by Citizens for Kennedy and a ' private fund-raising dinner hover which Mr. Stevenson presided . Donations totaling $163,500 were received at the Stevenson party and incomplete reports from the other event , where former President Truman joined the candidate , indicated that almost as much was raised there . The Stevenson meeting tapped fund sources not customarily available to the ' regular organization . Before the . Senator could . go to the Citizens for ' Kennedy rally , he left the hotel to greet thousands who waited outside with crudely lettered signs pledging support to him . Police estimates on the size of the crowd inn as high as 5,000 , but reporters figured there were less than half that number . He talked to the crowd , lined up on both sides . of Park Avenue , with the aid of a batterypowered hand amplifier . The candidate had to fight his way through hundreds more in the hotel lobby before he could get to the Citizens rally , where he receives a tumultuous welcome .
