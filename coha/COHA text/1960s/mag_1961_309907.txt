The 1961 girl vintage looks promising . It has some of the heavy and full-bodied characteristics of the ' 52s and ' 57s ( Monroe , Bardot ) , a hint of the dry classicism of certain ' 37s ( Vivien Leigh ) , and may even show some of the sparkling ambition of the ' 53s ( Grace Kelly ) . Sample tastes : <P> <P> SUSANNAH YORK , Alec Guinness ' freckled daughter in Tunes of Glory , will certainly reach stardom on her own in Loss of Innocence , the film version of Rumer Godden 's novel The Greengage Summer , which Columbia Pictures will release in the U.S. in the fall . With a trim , sylvan body , winter-sky-blue eyes and jonquil hair . 22-year-old Susannah is one of the few English girls who can seem equally natural nibbling strawberries in a May-fairy frock in The Players Restaurant at Wimbledon or sprinting eastward in a bikini on the beaches of the Mediterranean . Born in London and raised in Scotland , she met Actor Michael Wells at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unfashionable part of Chelsea among half-dead flowers and half-dry socks . " I 'm scruffy by nature , ' ' she admits , but she is also an expert actress whose look and gesture redeem her ingenuousness with a suggestion of bitchcraft . Her next role should give her ambivalences full play . In John Huston 's Life of Freud , she will be the young , tormented Cecily , Subtile Sig 's first patient . <P> BRIGID BAZLEN , who first won fame at 14 as the lightly tripping , Peabody-awarded Blue Fairy of a Chicago kiddies ' TV program , is now 17 and has come quite a distance from the imitation mushrooms of the Loop 's Blue Forest . Black-haired and hazel-eyed , Brigid went to Spain last summer and , without veils , took the role of Salome in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 's King of Kings ( ready for October release ) . With a creditable performance in The Honeymoon Machine , released last week , she has moved on to Paducah , Ky .. to play a tough-talking frontier girl in How the West Was Won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago American Gossip Columnist Maggie Daly Bazlen , Brigid is compared by flacks to Elizabeth Taylor and described by associates as a " woman-child " with " something inside her that is 30 . " In How the West Was Won , she ends up hanging from a tree limb because she lures Old Trapper Jimmy Stewart into a cave , goes for his pelt and tries to kill him . When she is really 30. she 'll probably get her man .
