The President arrived at ten in the afternoon . At the airport to greet him were his able Vice President ( who combines the baleful glare of Sonny Listen with a Groucho Marx mustache ) and the fat , 5-ft. - tall head of the Youth League ( who wears mammoth gold stars and carries his money in bulging sacks ) . During his stay the President was entertained by native dancers who balanced pickaxes , shovels and barrels of mortar on their heads . He supped on cherry pop and sponge cake while solemnly touring a gallery hung with photographs of Mao Tse-tung , Lenin and Lyndon Johnson . He visited a poultry farm , later addressed a mass rally while cows grazed on a nearby golf course and goats gamboled on a cricket field . <P> Though the script read like a rejected passage from an Evelyn Waugh novel of black Africa , it did indeed happen-to Julius Nyerere , last week in Zanzibar . <P> Imperfect Merger . Eight months ago . President Nyerere signed the articles of confederation that united his mainland nation of Tanganyika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time , Zanzibar had just gone through a far-left coup against the ruling Arab minority . African Leader Abeid Karume had been installed as President , and his regime seemed about to slide under Peking domination . The union forestalled that , and Karume reluctantly agreed to serve under Nyerere as a mere Vice President of the newly formed nation known as Tanzania . Last week , as Nyerere paid his first state visit to the territories he had hoped to assimilate , it must have struck him that Tanzania could scarcely be zanier . <P> The island runs on Swahili time-a full six hours behind the mainland-hence it was still morning on the afternoon Nyerere landed . Vice President Karume is still known as President on Zanzibar . Island officials obstinately control their own customs and immigration affairs , maintain and jealously censor an independent cable and wireless network , and conduct external trade and finances through their own ministries . The tough , green-uniformed troopers of the People 's Liberation Army-composed mostly of Communist-leaning hoodlums who had led the anti-Arab coup-still stalk the streets armed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolutionary council , a gang of malcontents led by Peking 's pal Abdul Rahman Mohamed , better known as " Babu , " probably East Africa 's ugliest and brightest politician . <P> Delicate Balance . If the union 's two components are having trouble balancing each other , Nyerere and Karume apparently are trying hard to balance East and West . In the receiving line welcoming Nyerere , U.S. Consul General Frank Carlucci was neatly played off against East German Ambassador Guenther Fritsch . To demonstrate their nonalignment , Nyerere and Karume spoke Swahili with both the American and the East German ; Carlucci answered them fluently , while Fritsch , wincing behind his sunglasses , used an interpreter .
