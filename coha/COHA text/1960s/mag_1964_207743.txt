" He rises with the sun and stands on his head . I ask him upside down what he wants for breakfast , and it 's the usual oats , wheat , fruit , yogurt . Then he 's off and running . He does n't have a schedule-it 's a palimpsest . " <P> Diana Menuhin was not exaggerating . More like an Olympic sprinter in training than a 48-year-old violin virtuoso on tour , Yehudi Menuhin stays religiously in trim with yoga and health foods . Not that he is in any danger of getting fat . The busiest , fastest-moving musician on the international festival circuit , Menuhin has performed in some 50 concerts from Tel Aviv to Glasgow this summer , has also fulfilled a dizzying round of recording , teaching and conducting engagements . The crescendo comes each year in June and August , when Menuhin presides over two top-notch festivals , at Gstaad in Switzerland , which he himself inaugurated and directs , and Bath in England . <P> Rare Fare . Menuhin insists that his supercharged summers are actually periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long winter rounds of touring with standard repertory . This year Menuhin , who totes around a suitcase crammed with untried compositions , has performed a wide range of pieces that he has never before played in public , including several world premieres . At last week 's Gstaad Festival , held in a picturesque village high in the Swiss Alps , capacity crowds jammed a 17th century church for a program of rarely heard Spanish chamber music , which Menuhin and a handpicked chamber orchestra performed from a scaffolding around the baptismal font . <P> The success of his festivals comes from Menuhin 's determined attempts to keep them from succeeding in any conventional sense . Performers are scantily paid , audiences are limited , and the programs are the rarest of musical fare . They are holidays for strings . He regards the meeting of musicians at Bath and Gstaad as " private festivals for Yehudi and friends , with the public tolerated-it 's very much a family affair . " <P> A Guru , Too . Performing with Menuhin and rehearsing at his $150,000 chalet at Gstaad were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yaltah , Brother-in-Law Joel Ryc " ( Yal-tah 's husband ) and Son-in-Law Fou Ts'ong , 24 , who defected from Red China in 1959 and married Yehudi 's daughter Zamira two years later . Also present at the get-together : Menuhin 's favorite guru , B.S.K. lyengar , from Bombay . <P> Despite Menuhin 's disregard for audiences , the Bath and Gstaad festivals are more popular than ever . " People are ready for such a novel approach , " he says . " Besides , it 's the only thing that prevents musicians like myself from getting stale . " Menuhin is brimming with new projects , most notably London 's Yehudi Menuhin School for musically gifted children , which he founded last year " to preserve our species from extinction . " Last week the itch to move along was upon him again . Gazing up at the snow-veined mountains , he mused : " Pretty soon we will be traveling again . . . linking , bridging , weaving .
