At Long Island 's Brookhaven National Laboratory , Physicist Raymond Davis Jr . is designing one of the most extraordinary instruments known to modern science . When completed , it will be a swimming pool full of cleaning fluid , and will be installed in a deep mine to X-ray the sun . <P> Scientists have long been fascinated by the sun 's center , where all the energy originates that supports life on earth . But the only practical way to observe this arcane spot is to study the neutrinos that are a by-product of its fierce thermonuclear reactions . The ghostly particles pay hardly any attention to matter . All except one in a billion of them pass through the sun 's dense material and escape into space . <P> Rare Reaction . Dr. Davis estimates that about 54 billion solar neutrinos hit each square centimeter ( .155 sq . in. ) of the earth 's surface every second . They have no effect that is normally detectable , but if they happen to collide with atoms of chlorine 37 , a small fraction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it occurs , this rare reaction gives Dr. Davis a chance to count solar neutrinos . <P> Backed by funds from the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Davis plans to set his 100,000-gal. tank in a mine at least 5,000 ft. deep to protect it from cosmic rays . Only neutrinos will reach the tank 's supply of perchlorethy-lene , a cleaning fluid containing about one quarter of chlorine 37 . Dr. Davis estimates that out of the countless trillions of solar neutrinos that will be passing through the tank , between four and eleven per day will react with chlorine 37 atoms . <P> Firmer Figure . To detect these few hits , a stream of helium will bubble through the tank , sweeping any argon 37 and carrying it to a charcoal filter . Then a special instrument will count the argon atoms by means of their radioactivity . Their number will be in direct proportion to the total number of neutrinos emitted by the sun . <P> First thing the neutrinos will measure is the temperature of the core . Astrophysicists now estimate it at 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firmer figure because the nuclear reaction that produces solar neutrinos is favored by high temperature . If Dr. Davis counts more neutrinos than current formulas predict , astrophysicists will know that the temperature of the core is higher than they have guessed .
