CLEA ( 287 pp. ) - Laurence Durrell-Duffon ( $3.95 ) . <P> In this new novel , the fourth volume of a quartet , Author Durrell continues his absorbed investigation of contemporary Alexandria , the 2,000-year-old Egyptian seaport that he calls the " royal city and the anus mundi . " Durrell delightedly wanders Alexandria 's dust-tormented streets , blinks in its lemony sunlight , and pokes curiously through its stews , brothels , and hysteric festivals . Keeping him company is a clutch of God-haunted characters who live , love and die with tautly stretched minds . <P> Here again are Durrell 's ravening women : handsome , black-browed Justine , a nymphomaniac with a neurotic need of intrigue ; large-eyed , blonde Clea , who , when stripped , looks as " naked and slender as an Easter lily " ; and blind Liza , still dotty with love for her suicide brother Pursewarden . Here , too , are his strangely ineffectual men : Nessim , the Coptic millionaire , in trouble both with his wife Justine and the British government ; Dr. Balthazar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Darley , the Irish schoolteacher , who tries to put together the carnal jigsaw puzzle of his friends . <P> Contradictory Truth . In the three earlier books , time stood still as Novelist Durrell sought to prove how any single event can be variously interpreted by different participants . In Justine , Purse-warden 's suicide is attributed to acedia , or boredom with life ; Balthazar suggests that the suicide was caused by his failure as an artist ; in Mountolive , the motive becomes purely political ; and now in Clea , it seems established that : " Truth is what most contradicts itself . " <P> In Clea , which opens several years after the events of the first three books , time marches forward again . After selfexile on an Aegean island . Irishman Darley returns to Alexandria , still asking questions , still getting dusty answers . Justine , the great intriguer , has grown older and suffered a stroke : a drooping eyelid gives a leering expression to her rouged and overpowdered face . She climbs again into Darley 's bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone , and he turns to blonde Clea . Her words after they make love are the same ones spoken by Justine in the first volume of the quartet : " I am always so bad the first time , why is it ? " And Darley makes his very same answer : " So am I. " <P> Contrived Melodrama . Some echoes of the earlier books are intentional , but Clea has about it a curious air of repeated conversations , slapdash structure , and contrived melodrama . The cruel Memlik Pasha , who in Mountolive " never smiled , " is brought onstage in Clea " smiling gently . " A girl named Fosca is introduced only so that she may be strangely murdered , , . and Clea herself is horribly and pointlessly maimed by a fishing spear .
