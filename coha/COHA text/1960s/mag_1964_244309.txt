Shown on the opposite page are the works of two potentates of modern art which within the last fortnight won two of modern art 's richest prizes . Neither award surprised the art world , since both artists are well known and transcendently deserving . But if no eyebrows were raised over the choices , a good many doubts have been raised this year over the theory and practice of art competitions . <P> Who Picks What ? The $10,000 Guggenheim International Award , won by Swiss Sculptor-Painter Alberto Giacometti , is supposed to go , explains Curator Lawrence Alloway , to " the great wherever seen . When Harry Guggenheim started the whole thing in 1956 , he saw the prizes as a kind of equivalent of the Nobel Prize , something that was awarded regardless of national boundaries . " Alloway spent a year and a half traveling in 30 countries to choose entries for the 1964 Guggenheim International , and the jury that then picked the winners included Painter Hans Hofmann , Arnold Rdlinger , director of the Kunsthalle in Basel , and Werner Haftmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $2,500 each to Wifredo Lam , a Cuban who works in Italy ; Robert Motherwell of the U.S. ; Spain 's Antoni Tapies and Victor de Vasarely , a Hungarian who lives in France . <P> The Pennsylvania Academy awards , by contrast , are given to established artists invited by the Academy 's jury to enter , and to " over the transom " entries from unknowns as well . The Temple Gold Medal , won this year by Stuart Davis and in earlier decades by such luminaries as Whistler , Eakins and Homer , carries no cash but a mintful of prestige . The aim of the show , according to Director Joseph Fraser , is to " give Philadelphia art lovers a chance to see a cross section of what 's going on in the art world-a look at all the trends . " Juries are composed of artists . <P> <P> The Temple Medal and the George D. Widener Memorial Gold Medal for sculpture rarely go to artists without a lengthy list of works and other awards behind them . But the Widener award this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maywood , III. , who had not been invited by the jury , and six lesser awards went to uninvited works . <P> Who Says It 's Best ? These are both sincere attempts to give art some bests and firsts , but all art competitions are open to criticism for both methods and effects . Because of the sheer size of the task , it is virtually impossible for a jury or a single individual to be comprehensive in selecting entries , and the job is always complicated by the very rules intended to simplify it . Alloway of the Guggenheim was limited to choosing five artists per nation-equating the U.S. with Israel , for example-and also tried to make his choice from among artists born between 1900 and 1920 , a restriction that bars both Patriarch Pa blo Picasso and the pushy princelings of Pop . Finding an unbiased jury is hard enough , and so is the job of the jury-whether to judge an artist on the merit of one submitted picture , or on his prestige , or on the whole body of his work , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other prizes he has or has not won .
