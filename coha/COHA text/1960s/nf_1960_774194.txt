My father does not show his love for Mother by showering her with gifts or other outward signs of affection but rather by sharing all activities with her and spending his spare time with her . Mother is a very affectionate type of person and is always doing minor unnecessary things to add to our comfort and enjoyment . A few years ago our family passed through a major crisis . My mother became seriously ill and was in the hospital for about six weeks . I was only twelve at the time and hardly recognized the seriousness of her illness , but I was not too young to be afraid that she might not pull through . I can remember vividly the grave talks my father had with me in an effort to allay my fears , and my visits to the hospital with him . Going through that serious emotional period aided in bringing the three of us more closely together than ever . The deep warm love that Mother and Father have showered on me has made my life seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do well is necessary beside the anticipation of their pleasure and pride . Any temptation for me to do wrong has been quickly stopped by thoughts of my parents ' disappointment in me . Father is a football and track coach , and through him we have gained our interest in sports . It seems as though there is something added through our mutual enjoyment of these activities . On Christmas the three of us go to a show . Father was very disappointed last Christmas because he did not think that our date would be carried out . Mother and I , however , arranged our activities so that the family could see its annual movie . We have an annual holiday custom . Our Christmas Eve is never shared with anyone ? just family . After going to church in the evening we sit together until the wee hours of the morning listening to the Christmas carols on the radio . We talk over the time since last Christmas , analyze the present situation , and give our expectations of future years . Only after the last carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air do we go to bed . The relationship between my mother and me has been that of sisters . I recognize her authority as a mother , yet we are always doing things together . We often enter into some minor conspiracy against Father , which we always disclose to him later . My relationship with my father has been that of a good pal . My father does not accompany Mother and me on our shopping tours ; however , he must pass judgment on every important purchase before we would consider keeping it . He also gets our approval of his purchases . Our family has always worked on a system of mutual aid . Mother helps Father in planning his schedule for his schoolteaching program . Dad helps Mother with some household activities . I assist Mother for the most part in household tasks , but I also aid Dad in caring for the flower gardens or in such tasks as washing the car . It is not very often that our family circle is broken . We never make trips  | of any distance unless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , but it seemed to be lacking because Father was not there to share things with us . Our family has maintained a close front in its union against outside influences . Many of our talks around the dinner table or in the living room have begun with ? " Now , keep this in the family . " My father 's job has been jeopardized several times by selfish , heartless people . Mother and I realize how this troubles him , and in sympathizing with him and condemning those against him our family ties have been strengthened . Another factor strengthening our family has been our attempt to maintain a certain social level . As a group we have tried to retain some of the culture , etiquette , morals , and standards which seem to be disappearing so rapidly in many of the families of our friends . This has resulted oftentimes in other people setting our family aside as too staid or " different . " In reaction to this we have become a solid family group of three against the others . Unity in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of community control , tradition , authority of the head , or participation in a common economic enterprise , as in patriarchal families . The prominent factors in this family are demonstration of affection ; sharing of experiences ; mutual confiding ; sharing in the making of decisions ; companionship ; reaction to the family crisis of the illness of a family member ; combining as a unit against attack on the father by outsiders ; and common interests in recreation , in religion , and in the maintenance of a superior status in the community . The Nature of Family Unity Marriage as Antagonistic Co-operation . Although Sumner and Keyserling did their writing on the family many years ago , they aid in understanding how family unity emerges out of conflicting forces . For example , Sumner describes marriage as " an experiment in antagonistic co-operation " A woman with a child entered into an agreement with a man , whether the father or not was immaterial , by which they carried on the struggle for existence together . The arrangement must have afforded advantages to both . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Antagonistic co-operation is the most productive form of combination in high civilization . It is a high action of the reason to overlook lesser antagonisms in order to work together for great interests . Sumner implies that men and women enter marriage each with his own interest thereby subserving an interest greater than their own . Out of diversity a higher unity is derived . footnote ' William G. Sumner , Folkways , Boston , Ginn and Company , 1906 , pp. 345-46 , ' 8.  | Marriage as a Tragic State of Tension . Keyserling , in The Book of Marriage , gives what he calls a correct statement of the marriage problem . Seemingly pessimistic , he states " marriage is essentially a tragic state of tension . " More optimistically he continues:1 Just for this reason it can realize the purpose of life as a whole better than any other form can do . For the whole of life is nothing else but a tragic state of tension ; and marriage embraces , as parts of its own constitution , all the specialized forms of tension found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spiritual . But life is not a tragedy in the last resort , and for this reason , in spite of all its drawbacks , it is beautiful ; and consequently , where conjugal happiness is achieved , it outweighs all possible suffering . Marriage , apart from all its advantages , demands daily and hourly selfsacrifice , renunciation , and the shouldering of responsibility and blame . It requires this at every stage , but the difficulties are proportional to the degree of development attained . Why should man in his present undeveloped state desire to accomplish this difficult art ? Is not the risk too great ? Is it worth the effort ? Elsewhere he speaks of marriage as a " relationship of bipolar tension , " thus emphasizing that the achieved unity is in terms of differences , conflicts , stresses , and strains . Both Sumner and Keyserling perceive that the essential problem in marriage lies in the interplay between forces of attraction and repulsion , co-operation and antagonism , integration and disintegration . Summarizing , we may say : i . That a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those making for integration and those making for disintegration . 2 . That the stable marriage is one in which the integrative predominate over disintegrative forces . 3 . Conversely , that the unstable marriage is one in which its survival is threatened by the possibility that the disruptive forces may gain the ascendancy . Marriage as Unity out of Diversity . A chief problem of success in marriage is that of obtaining unity out of diversity . Husband and wife are diverse first of all in the fact that they are of a different sex ; then there are all the other possible differences , those of temperament , of cultural backgrounds , of economic and educational status , of social attitudes and life values . Some of these differences , it is true , complement each other and contribute to the unity of the rela- footnoteAdapted front Count Hermann A. Keyserling , The Book of Marriage , New York , Harcourt , Brace and Company , 1916 , pp. 48 , 47.  | tion , but others are disruptive and imperil its stability . Every marriage is like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repulsion . The successful marriage is one in which differences are so organized that they contribute to the equilibrium , stability , and harmony of the marital relationship . The unsuccessful marriage is one in which differences upset the equilibrium and make ) for instability and discord . Unity Grows out of Interaction . The study of the patterns of personal relationships in any family leads directly to the conception of the family as a unity of interacting persons . The emphasis is on the family as living , changing , and growing through interaction . By contrast there are the notions of the family as a mere collection of persons living together , or as a household of individuals in economic interdependence , or as a legal entity with relationships prescribed by law . This explanation of family unity in terms of the welding together of family members who are interacting with each other has been generally adopted by students of the family . Communication is the mechanism through which ideas , attitudes , and values are acquired by the person and these largely determine his future behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting together of reactions and attitudes of husband and wife which have a history reaching back to the early months and years of each person 's life . These persisting attitudes and values act as a selective factor in sensitizing each person to pay attention to objects , values , and situations similar to those previously experienced . The basic principle , however , is that the interacting persons undergo modification in the process of communicative interaction within the family . This means that through communication , particularly of the intimate type found in most families , there is an interpenetration and fusion of the attitudes of the husband and wife and parents and children , for in their reciprocal responses the members continually modify each other 's behavior . Consequently , an understanding of a given event in a family involves an acquaintance both with the life histories of husband and wife prior to marriage and with their marital experiences . The behavior of families in a homogeneous , isolated culture , such as that of the Polish peasant community of a hundred years ago , will be characterized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family in such a culture will have high predictability , for its habits will approximate the cultural patterns of the community . In a mobile , changing society , such as an urban community , the  | culture will not be internally consistent , but on the contrary will include mutually exclusive and incompatible forms of behavior . A family may be psychologically isolated from the contradictory parts of the culture and develop attitudes which are quite consistent , and its behavior will be relatively predictable . But , if members of a family are in intimate contact with conflicting patterns , their behavior may be inconsistent and relatively difficult to predict . Under the complex cultural conditions of urban life the chances that a husband and wife will have had similar life experiences decrease and possibilities of conflict in the family increase . This is particularly true of roominghouse districts and to a lesser extent of apartment-house areas . ' Factors in Family Unity Family unity may be analyzed into the following components : mutual affection , emotional interdependence , sympathetic understanding , temperamental compatibility , consensus on values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interdependence of family roles , sex , and pressures by the environing society . While the maximum of family unity would exist if there were a maximum of these component parts , there would be some unity if only one of them were present . For instance , a couple who marries on the basis of strong emotional attraction may have a feeling of great solidarity even though there is little consensus on the general values and objectives of life , no tolerance of divergent behavior , little interdependence of family roles , and slight community pressure if they are living anonymously in a rooming-house area . But , solidarity established on such a basis would be of short duration and the family would break up unless some of the other components developed . Mutual Affection . A love affair beginning in courtship and continuing throughout the marriage is the accepted ideal of modern marriage.2 The sentiment of love may vary from an infatuation which may be almost as fleeting as it is intense to a companionship in which two personalities are completely united in a lifelong union . Romantic love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , " " being head over heels in love , " " puppy love , " " infatuation , " and " strong physical attraction , " may actually initiate and sustain an enduring union . It may contribute markedly to the successful negotiation of the early adjustments in marriage . In contrast with blindly romantic unions are those developing out footnote ' See pp. 103-5 , 109-II. 2 See Chapter ii , " Love and Courtship . "  | of intimate association . " Friendship deepening into love " is the way young people put it . The sharing of past experiences , the divulging of inner attitudes , and mutual confiding build up an intimacy that provides a solid foundation for the superstructure of matrimony . In marriage the love of husband aid wife is maintained and strengthened by expressions and demonstrations of affection . While a few couples say that their love for each other has not changed or may even have decreased since marriage , the majority insist that it has grown stronger and deeper . ' Romantic love is in and of itself a unifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because it often leads them to ignore the other factors upon which unity is based , such as the absence of disruptive elements like temperamental incompatibility and marked divergences in interests and ideals . Loveless marriages lack an important element essential to family unity . They may survive even for a lifetime because of the presence of other unifying elements and because of habit , mutual respect , and feelings of duty . Such marriages in our culture , however , are always vulnerable , since the partner who is not in love may perhaps unexpectedly find himself in love with another . How couples typically express their affection for each other is well represented in the case of John and Ethel , from statements secured before and after marriage : 2 ETHEL , during engagement : The things that I 've always considered of paramount importance seem to be of no importance in comparison with our relationship . It 's completely necessary to me . To be without him would be beyond my endurance . ETHEL , three years after marriage : During the first year I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was with him . When he criticized me I thought he could not be as much in love with me . I think I depend on him more than he does on me in daily life . I think our love has found a more solid basis than it had before marriage . If anyone before marriage had asked if I was marrying a good man I would have said " yes . " Since marriage I have found out how much better he is and how fortunate I am ? extremely fortunate . JoHN , during engagement .. I 'd say I 'm very much in love or head over heels in love ? just as extreme as you can put it . I 'd say she means more to me than anything else . I do n't think I 'm blindly in love with her . I think I still have pretty good judgment . footnote1 Ernest W. Burgess and Paul Wallin , Engagement and Marriage , Philadelphia , J. B. Lippincott Company , 1953. 2 Case study from ibid.  | JoHN , three years after marriage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kind . To some extent from romantic to companionship . I think probably she is more in love with me than I with her to some extent . I think she is by nature more dependent . The role of mutual affection in making for the integration of two persons in marriage is revealed in the following statements of a husband and wife : HUSBAND : I think I am more in love . I 'd miss her very much if I did n't have her . It is hard to say whether I could be happy with someone else . It would have to be someone who was very much like my wife . I think she would miss me more . She shows her feelings more than I. It makes me feel awfully good . I show her affection too . I think she is satisfied with the amount of affection I show her . We are pretty affectionate even in company . WIFE : I think our love has become much stronger since marriage because you get to know a person much better . It has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his love for me . It is hard to say which is more in love . I think a break would be harder on him . I feel my happy life is the biggest thing I have gotten out of marriage . It is the complete fulfillment of everything I expected : a home , comfortable living , baby , and above all a wonderful husband . Emotional Interdependence . Mutual satisfaction of personality needs , as will be seen in Chapters 11 and 13 , is one of the main factors in falling in love and in mate selection . Likewise , it is also one of the primary elements in marital unity . If a husband or a wife desires and receives from the other the satisfaction of a psychological need , such as demonstration of affection , encouragement , or sympathetic understanding , the solidarity of the relationship is thereby increased . Common family experiences also make for emotional interdependence by the interlocking of emotional habits which develop through years of intimate communication . With the sharing of confidences , disappointments , sorrows , aspirations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , so that emotional unity is established . As emotional experiences are shared , habits become intertwined with previous habits in the person and with the habits of the other members of the family . Emotional interdependence is revealed in situations where husband and wife have need for sympathy and encouragement : HUSBAND : Jane gives me encouragement . A sufficient amount of it ; it does n't take very much ; just a word or two . Sometimes I build myself up to  | a big letdown when a depressive spell comes . All I need then is a little impetus and then I am back at the grind again . She brings up past performances and shows that everything turned out all right , and I feel better . WIFE : A person wants sympathy and encouragement , but I am self-reliant too . He is fairly good at giving this if he wants to . If I do n't feel good he is sorry and makes it easy for me . Especially now in my condition he takes care of the baby . Will is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interdependent emotional attachments is indicated by their persistence after the disintegration of the family . Waller describes the persistence of emotional dependence of husbands and wives who are separated by divorce : ' The first and perhaps the most potent of the reasons for the persistence of love for the former mate is the real strength of such attachments . Frequently one marries the first person with whom he has a serious love affair , and nearly always the affair that culminated in marriage stands out as the affair in which there was the most complete emotional as well as legal involvement . It is likely at any rate that this affair which was associated with marriage was the one in which the bars were most completely down , the one in which each person made himself most completely accessible to the other person and felt that he enjoyed similar privileges with regard to the mate . A man goes on loving his former wife because she , being the first , was the one who had the opportunity to form his taste ; he must have rare insight who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force so subjective . Waller 's findings are substantiated by our studies of happily married couples and unhappily married , including divorced , couples . We have found not only a high degree of emotional interdependence in the happily married couples but the persistence of considerable emotional dependence on the part of many unhappily married and divorced husbands and wives , particularly where the divorce was preceded by a relatively short period of separation . Apparently they are unable to liberate themselves from the " silken domination of a force so subjective " as emotional interlocking habits . This is illustrated in the following statements by a divorced wife and her former husband , both of whom are remarried to divorced persons:2 footnote1 From The Old Love and the New by Willard Waller . Copyright 1930 Horace Liveright , Inc . By permission of Liveright Publishing Corp. , New York , pp. 136-38. 2 Case secured by Harvey J.

If the stove needs coal or the washtub needs emptying , my present husband will sit and not even notice that I am doing the hard work , but my former man would have noticed that things needed doing and would have helped me without my even mentioning it to him . I certainly got divorced and remarried in too much of a hurry . HUSBAND : You may be walking down the street with two men . One has traits you like better than the other , and the other may have traits you like better . Well , that is the way it is with me and my wives . I liked the former one best in some ways and the present one in other ways . But even though I like my former wife and she likes me , it is impossible to talk to each other . If we see each other downtown we just say " Hello , " for if we did much more than that our present mates would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or empathy , means the capacity to enter into and share the feelings , attitudes , interests , and experiences of others to such an extent that one is able to view these through the eyes of the other . In the family such a close relationship or affinity may have grown up that the members have the ability to take each other 's roles and behave harmoniously with reference to each other 's behavior . The mutual need for sympathetic understanding is one of the strongest bonds in family life . Sympathetic understanding is essential to the unity and even to the survival of a marital union when husband and wife differ widely in temperament and interests and where one or both desire to retain their individuality in marriage : My biggest adjustment in marriage has been living with a person who is of an entirely different nature . For example we have a budget and I have to account for what I spend , and that is not like me at all . Tony likes to spend quiet evenings and I like excitement . We made a bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . In the beginning the adjustment was almost an impossibility . We used to have extensive arguments . Now we rarely have arguments . I feel we have become adjusted to one another . I am very dependent on him . More and more I have come to rely on him . I feel everything I do and feel I have to share with him , or else I ca n't enjoy it . I need sympathy to a certain extent . When I am down in the dumps he works overtime to pull me out . Little things affect me so . I think he understands what I want and need out of life . Not liking the same things I do  --  - company , and going out ? he ca n't supply these completely , but he does the best he can . He never belittles my point of view ? he understands it and he  | tries to do the best he can to entertain me in his own way . His idea of an ideal evening is to stay at home , take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures , and go to bed early . My idea is to go out , see people , have fun and excitement . I always feel we should do what we want to do , not what we ought to do . He says that we should do what we ought to do , even like to do what we ought to do . That 's our difference wrapped up in a package . Difficulties of marital adjustment are due in part to definitions of expected behavior , accepted by the person in childhood , which are in conflict with the way a person would like to behave in the marriage relationship . These ingrained inhibitions are stronger than one 's intellectual idea of the way marriage relationships ought to be . Sympathetic understanding on the part of the mate may result in retraining with subsequent adjustment , as is indicated in the following statement of a wife : I did not adjust easily to marriage . In fact , it has taken me five years to become fully adjusted . I entered marriage with as many inhibitions as a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I did not enjoy sexual relations , and could not respond . I wanted to respond , but it seemed impossible , and the fact that I was not able to respond worried me . I felt guilty that I could not . Jimmie was always very kind and patient with me , though I used to wonder how he could love me . I never dreamed that there could be married life without domination , and I was surprised that Jimmie did not at any time try to boss me . I had perfect freedom in everything . " If you are happy , then I am happy " was his motto . Jimmie tried to destroy my inferiority complex , and if any of it is gone he has been the cause . He told me that I was pretty , a compliment that no one paid me before , and though I could not believe it , the words sounded nice . When I had one of my worrying spells he would have me sit down , with paper and pencil , and write out my good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Sympathetic understanding of the divergent behavior of one 's spouse , even though one would not engage in that behavior oneself , may be a strong bond in family unity . When this sensitivity to each other 's behavior rests upon affection , consensus , or community of interests , it results in unity even where interests are divergent . In an interview with a married couple , the husband said : My wife and I have a good many common interests , but we also have a good many different interests . For instance , she does not play bridge nor p 300 does she gamble . After I come home from an evening of playing bridge at a half cent a point , she may say , " Did you win or lose ? " And , if I have lost , she does not nag or scold me , but may say , " I hope you were a good sport in losing . " Now I think it is wonderful that we can talk things like that over in our family . One interpretation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consensus and emotional attachment had developed so that it was possible for the husband and wife sympathetically to communicate and appreciate each other 's deviant behavior , which in turn increased the feeling of unity . Temperamental Compatibility . ' A unifying element in marriage is the temperamental compatibility of husband and wife . Especially when their temperaments are different but complementary , each feels a satisfaction in the relationship which is absent when there are serious temperamental clashes . Examples of temperamental congeniality of husbands and wives who are widely different in temperaments are where one is optimistic and the other is pessimistic , one highstrung and the other phlegmatic , and one impulsive and the other methodical . Temperamental compatibility may be something to be achieved in the marriage , redounding to the mutual benefit of husband and wife . A happy-go-lucky mate may have a calming effect upon his high-strung partner , who in turn may stimulate the other to greater effort : WIFE : I fly off the handle easily but get over it very quickly . Wesley has been a quieting influence in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has less temper than I , has to be provoked pretty well before he will get a temper . He wo n't take the initiative . I think I am more ambitious , if pushing him on to greater heights means that . He 'd be content to stay wherever he 's happy . HUSBAND : I think our personalities and temperaments have adjusted to each other pretty good . It is not perfect because there are quarrels . Although I am quite stubborn , if I make another person feel bad , I usually give in . Consensus on Values and Objectives . Consensus , as applied to the family , signifies that there has been a shift from dissimilar to common values , objectives , and attitudes . The formation of consensus between husband and wife involves the molding together of behavior patterns acquired in the years before their acquaintance . It also implies footnote1 Temperament nuv he defined as the prevailing or characteristic mood of a person .  | the adopting of family attitudes and values by young children , and later , as the children pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assimilation of these patterns through communication between children and parents . This welding of dissimilar into common points of view , values , and objectives occurs most easily through a certain kind of communication , that which is intimate , personal , informal , and free-flowing . Where family members engage in intimate , personal , and informal communication , they come to understand each other and to share common values and expectations . In primary association one imaginatively rehearses the attitudes , values , and objectives expressed in the behavior of other family members and , if this takes place over a considerable time span , there is an actual fusion of persons into a single unit . Obviously , communication between persons having greatly dissimilar values , objectives , and points of view frequently results in disagreement , conflict , and disunity . But if they continue to engage in primary association , with the passing of the months and years , formerly alien patterns tend to become common . This may represent the victory of one or the other , or a compromise , or even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement to disagree . Two of the outstanding objectives that operate powerfully to unify husband and wife are their common interests in home and children . Other integrating values and activities that may be of unusual significance in certain cases are : religion and church activities ; the career of one or both ; a joint cultural interest , such as art , music , books ; friends and social affairs ; and outdoor activities . Family Events , Celebrations , and Ceremonies . Families vary widely in the richness of their experiences . Certain families have many events such as large family reunions , picnics , automobile trips , and vacations . Holidays like Christmas , New Year 's , Easter , and Fourth of July may bulk large in the experiences and memories of family members . Birthday celebrations , by the festive recognition given in turn to each member , develop family unity . Of great significance for unification in some families is mealtime , when the members tell each other their experiences of the day . ' Although family prayers have departed from almost all homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being incorporated into the family group as he completes his nightly prayer at Mother 's footnotet James H. S.

" The observance of family birthdays , ceremonies , and celebrations expresses and accentuates family unity : Carl is good at remembering birthdays .

We eat with the Family Silver off the soup plates my grandparents bought on their wedding day in 1881 . We all love this . In many families , particularly with a large number of children , celebrations and other family events continue to be important until all the children have left home . Interdependence of Roles . Interdependence of roles refers to the fitting together of different activities of the members of the family to achieve common objectives . In a stable , homogeneous society , ideas of family life and the activities and roles of the husband , wife , in-laws , and children would be rigidly defined , unquestionably accepted , and invariably performed . Jane Addams describes stable family unity based on the fulfillment of expected roles and habitual behavior . After she had lived " for years in a crowded quarter where men , women , and children constantly jostle each other and press upon every inch of space in shop , tenement , and street , " she wrote:1 Every tenement house contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and clothing and pass their sleepless nights in tending and nursing their exigent children , with never one thought for their own comfort or pleasure or development save as these may be connected with the future of their families . . . . Every shop is crowded with workingmen who year after year spend all of their wages upon the nurture and education of their children , reserving for themselves but the shabbiest clothing and a crowded place at the family table .

Under the influence of conflicting conceptions of family life , the modern husband and wife often have different conceptions of the parts which they have to play in their family . Inasmuch as the husband 's role as traditionally defined has been superordinate , he will probably tend under the impress of modern social changes toward minor modifications of traditional roles . Since the role of the wife as traditionally defined has been subordinate , under the impress of the same social changes she will tend toward greater modifications of traditional roles . A wife may conceive of her role as some embodiment of the new woman , and the probabilities are that she will be more favorably inclined toward an equalitarian type of family organization than her husband . The process of family organization or unity consists , in part , of adjusting the conflicting conceptions of activities and roles so that consensus may be achieved by family members . In the following case the husband performs the superordinate role and the wife 's reaction is , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the follower " : I am quite sure I take the lead more often than Kate . She does not even try to stop me . When we were first married we would make decisions together and then she would wonder if she had made the right decision . That is still a source of difficulty . Then , too , about the baby ; I think in the depths of her nature Kate needed the baby but I think I had the reasoning and logical persistence that led to it . I wanted it more but she needed it more . One factor was I wanted her to quit working and I knew she would n't unless she had the child . A wife may resent the fact that her mate does not fulfill her expectations of the husband taking the lead in family matters . She may not mind the actual assumption of responsibility , for she may like to manage things ; but if the husband lets her do it , he falls short of her expectation of what a husband should be and do . ' Interdependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation ago due to the transference of so many activities outside footnoter See case at the beginning of Chapter I8 , pp. 510-rz.  | the home , still continues , even in the city , in varying degrees . Certain rigid legal definitions exist with reference to the duty and responsibility of the father to assume the entire burden of supporting his wife and children . Husbands who desert may be punished ; in divorce cases husbands may be required to pay alimony , and imprisonment may result from failure to do so . That the legal and social definitions differ is indicated by the frequency with which men are imprisoned on charges of nonsupport and the growing attacks on this legal procedure . In many respects current social definitions of economic activities of husbands and wives and children are plural and conflicting . Divergent definitions exist on such questions as the following : During courtship should recreational expenses be paid by the man or shared ? Is a woman 's place in the home or should she work outside ? If both the husband and the wife work , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude , " What you earn is ours and what I earn is mine ? " Should money be contributed to the family when earned by children ? Should children be paid for work they do at home ? Family unity necessitates the adjustment of divergent conceptions of economic roles or the sympathetic understanding of the conception of the roles as held by other members . After an extended period of primary association , accommodation and assimilation may develop , so that within a given family , agreement may be reached concerning the expected and acceptable economic activities of the various family members . In the following case there was accommodation with reference to spending : WIFE : I like to squeeze the pennies and have a big explosion . He likes to spend the pennies and is afraid to spend a lot of money at a time . We always have a lot of fun over that . HUSBAND : Grace likes to save and have fine things . Her joy in life is to have fine things . I am free with nickels and dimes but it is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to adjust ourselves on that point . I have endeavored to be more careful with nickels and dimes and to have a larger appreciation of fine things . Sex Behavior . While interdependent sexual activities ' between husband and wife and the respective roles of the man and the woman probably follow the traditional pattern to a greater extent than do the economic , they may be in conflict in various respects . Terman 's footnote See PP. 319 31. 436-37.  | data ' indicate a trend toward equalitarian premarital sex practices . Moreover , women define sex as something to be mutually enjoyed to a much greater extent than a generation ago . The interrelationship in marriage is much more than the physical contact of two persons . It necessarily involves the conception of the meaning of the sex act by the husband and by the wife and the role which each plays . It may be an extremely sensitive and intimate form of communication , freighted with emotional and symbolic meaning . Satisfying or unsatisfying sex intercourse may be symptomatic of harmony or conflict of interests in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there frequently is a complete severance of intercourse which , in the case of divorced couples , generally occurs some months prior to separation . Three studies give evidence on the relative importance of sex as compared with other factors in marital adjustment . Terman2 found that , while a sex-adjustment test differentiated between broken and , unbroken marriages for both men and women , it was slightly less discriminating than a marital-adjustment test and a marital-prediction test . Another study3 of a middle-class American group reported that sex adjustment had a lower association with marital happiness than other factors , such as affection , consensus , and specific satisfactions . Even where the sexual adjustment left much to be desired , some couples stated that it detracted little or not at all from the happiness of their marriage . Many wives stated that if sex were taken out of the marriage the loss would be small because other factors were so much more important . In another study of a general population group , ' sex was assigned a role in marital adjustment equal , but not superior , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sharing of values and attitudes . For example , of the 17 sex items included in this study , 15 statistically discriminated between happily married and divorced men and 13 for women . ' Of i6 " personality items " for self-judgments , there were 9 which discriminated between happily married and divorced men and 5 for women ; on judgments of mate , there were 14 which discriminated both for men and for women .

The family derives part of its unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Persons contemplating marriage generally do not appreciate the multitude of extrafamilial relationships and associations into which they are marrying and those which will develop around the family during marriage . When one marries , he marries into a person 's circle of relatives and friends , his occupational and other economic relationships , his civic and military obligations , his educational , recreational , and religious relationships ; also he marries into the statuses connected with these various relationships and associations . The pressure for family unity exerted by extrafamilial attachments is illustrated by an incident in a visit to a happily married couple . A neighbor dropped in , and on being briefly informed as to the reason of the interviewer 's presence , remarked : ' Brother , belief in Jesus Christ and God the Father makes for happiness in home life . Is n't that right , Sister Mary ? Now , if one is saved , happiness floods the home and he just does n't think of separating if a little sin comes into the life of the other . Now Brother Ben here used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but through Sister Mary 's prayers and the prayers of our people at the church , he has been saved from his sin . Also , in our church we just do n't believe in divorce . If God is in the house , people will get along all right . The following is a part of the interpretation of the case , written after the interview : " The happily married couple is highly religious as contrasted with the divorced group . Three factors appear to be involved : ( I ) Religion is an indication of conventional and conforming behavior. ( z ) It is significant that the friends of this couple are religious and that their religion is opposed to divorce . Consequently the pressure and support of a circle of religious friends with their expectation that families would stay together determined in part the unity of this family . ( 3 ) In many of these families in which religion is significant , the members engage in praying together and reading the Bible together , and these serve as common activities , which psychologically unite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes is to reinforce each other religiously and thereby create conforming attitudes with reference to the maintenance of the family . " The family in its internal interaction develops a conception of itself , but this conception is modified and adjusted to the conception footnotep. iw.  | which persons outside have of it . The extrafamilial relationships give the family status and support , and to a considerable extent control its activities . Thus the family often is affected decisively for its weal or woe by its relationship to groups and institutions in the community . Differing Degrees of Family Unity Family unity , according to the method of the ideal construction , has disorganization and dispersion of the family members at one extreme and the highest degree of unity at the other extreme . Actually families fall on a continuum of integration from those that are loosely organized to those that manifest a high degree of organization . Selected for consideration to represent different degrees of family unity are : ( 1 ) the " broken family , " ( 2 ) the relatively unorganized family , ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and ( 5 ) the dynamically unified family . In a loosely organized family there is little integration . The habitbound family is integrated on the basis of habitual responses . The highly solidified family is integrated through the subordination of the members to a patriarch , a matriarch , or some conception of family unity such as familism . In the dynamically united family integration develops and is maintained through the voluntary participation of its members in the achieving of a common objective . ' The Broken Family . Families are broken by death , divorce , separation because of domestic discord , and separation for other reasons . ' Census data for 19512 show that those without mates because of death , divorce , or separation due to marital discord totaled 9.9 men for every ioo men married , and 24.5 women for every loci women married . The larger figure for women than men was due , in part , to the fact that there were 2.1 times as many widowed women as men . In addition , 728,000 wives and 1 , o66,000 husbands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonwhites than whites , and in urban than rural areas . In cases of both widowhood and divorce , remarriage frequently occurs . Where there are children by the first marriage , problems of adjustment arise . Family unity is impaired if these problems are not solved . footnote1 See the discussion of the disrupted family , Chapter 2.0. 2 Data from Current Population Reports , Population Characteristics , Series P-.o , No. 38 , pp. a , to , it . For an analysis of 1940 data see William F. Ogburn , " Marital Separations , " American Journal of Sociology , 49 , 1944 , pp. 31613.  | The Relatively Unorganized Family . The members of some families may never have had or developed consensus with reference to values and objectives , or interdependence based on sympathetic understanding , or division of labor for the attainment of common objectives . Becoming man and wife before the law may have occurred on the basis of pregnancy , impulsive behavior , casual sex contacts , or for economic advantage , with little or no prior unity . Marriage in such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases soon ends in separation and divorce . But occasionally unorganized families , especially those of low economic and social status , survive where the integration of husband and wife , at least to an observer , seems slight . Sometimes , as in the following case , an isolated , rejected type of person will strive more to make adjustments than will a person whose family background was superior to the situation he finds in marriage : I was twenty-eight at the time of my marriage . I grew up in a home in which I had two stepmothers ; my childhood was unhappy , and I thought I would do anything to get away from my stepmother . I think I am very lucky in getting a good husband . Yes , I filed suit for divorce , but I canceled it three days later . I decided I would never forsake the man who had been so kind to me although he has done some things of which I disapprove . His biggest fault is periodic drunken sprees . You asked me what I would do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . I do not know , but I do know I would not leave him . This is an example of a person whose background was unhappy and who looks upon her present marriage as filled with " days of sunshine and days of cloudy weather " and who will take the unhappy experiences philosophically , for she knows she will have days of happiness also . The Habit-Bound Family . Many students of family behavior have indicated that intimate , spontaneous communication in a family decreases with the passing of the years , that the roles of family members become fixed , and that behavior toward each other tends to become a habitual , regularizing routine of a more or less automatic nature . ' Waller refers to the " dead level of marriage interaction , " and says that it is inevitable because of the powerful tendency of interdependent habits , when disturbed , to re-form into a new equilibrium . footnote1 Jessie Bernard , American Family Behavior , New York , Harper &; Brothers , 1942. , pp. 18-19 ; Ray E. Baber , Marriage and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 205 ; Willard Waller ( Revised by Reuben Hill ) , The Family : A Dynamic Interpretation , New York , The Dryden Press , 1951 , pp. 331-32 ..  | Lynd and Lynd in Middletown report that for many couples where the thought of divorce may never be considered as a possibility , " marriage seems to amble along at a friendly jog trot marked by sober accommodation of each partner to his share in the joint undertaking of children , paying off the mortgage , and generally ' getting on . ' " 1 While observable expressions of communication may decrease with the establishment of stable interdependent habits , the amount of intimate , personal , informal communication may not decrease , for it is not necessarily determined by the number of words spoken or the time span of the particular association . A slight gesture , a facial expression , a word , or a phrase may have acquired great meaning to the members of an interdependent family . As persons become well acquainted , a glance may signify something on which there is common understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction or the decrease of intimate communication with the passing of the years may be more apparent than real . Moreover , these habitual patterns of behavior allow members to anticipate each other 's behavior in advance and adjust their conduct accordingly . The Highly Solidified Family . Certain families seem to live within and for themselves alone . The persons in these families may be not so much separate individuals as parts of a single entity . In these highly solidified families the emphasis is upon familism and there is disapproval of individuality . These families in our culture , even when they consist only of husband , wife , and children or of just husband and wife , manifest the spirit of familism of the patriarchal family . The degree of unity in some families is so great that it is extremely difficult for a member to break away and form a family of his own . Where there is this high degree of integration and the husband moves into his wife 's home , it may be practically impossible for this " stranger " to become incorporated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close-knit , and I wanted to bring Joe into my home as he brought me into his . Mother just ca n't get used to the fact that I 'm grown up and that I 'm not going to live at home . She tries to " win back , " as she says , my affection . She says that I should have nicer clothes and that Joe does n't support me in the style to which I 've been accustomed laughs . His folks have been wonderful and I 'm very much attached to them . They feel that they have gained a daughter , but Mother says , " I 've lost my little girl . " footnote1 Robert S. Lynd and Helen M. Lynd , Middletown , New York , Harcourt , Brace and Company , 1919 , p. 130.  | In interviewing divorced cases , husbands over and over again say they would marry the same woman but right from the beginning they would refuse to move in with the in-laws . The following case is illustrative of this extreme unity of the parental family which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main reasons why our marriage did not succeed were difference in age and living with her parents . My wife was sixteen and I was twenty-six at the time of our marriage . She was not socially mature . Interference of her mother was almost continuous while living there with them . Her mother had the idea that every man should be economically successful . When the depression came on , I had difficulty in getting work and the mother constantly threw this in my face . These cases illustrate the point that in the parental home there develops a closed corporation structurally organized on the basis of interdependent attitudes and strong attachments . Upon marriage the young man or woman may find difficulty in breaking off these attachments and divorcing himself or herself from the family . The attempt may be made to incorporate the mate into the closed corporation , which frequently involves the young couple moving in with the in-laws . If the mate does not fit into the parental family and follow its practices , irritation and conflict ensue which may result in his departure and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or daughters may have after marriage in breaking the attachments and habits of confiding which still bind them to their parents : My husband , particularly at first , was always running home with whatever troubles or problems we had . It annoyed me . He was always having to consult his mother . He used to go to her about every detail . I suppose it bothered me most because I am more independent in ways of acting and thinking . My husband compares me unfavorably with his mother too much . I did n't cook like his mother or do this and that the way she did it . It seemed like she was always more or less in the background . The Dynamically Unified Family . The dynamically unified family differs from the highly solidified family in one or more of the following characteristics : ( I ) Its unity is based , not upon the authority of the family head , but upon the consensus of its members . ( z ) It empha- footnote1 Harvey J. Locke , ep . dl.  | sizes the individuality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the family , as is the case under familism. ( 3 ) It is characterized by the adaptability of the family and its members in meeting crises , in contrast with the rigid integration of the highly solidified family in a situation of social change . The co-operation of the members of the dynamically unified family in common activities may actually be stimulated by the freedom given to individual expression of diverse interests and by the flexibility and informality of its organization . Certain families manifest in unusual degree the participation of their members in a collective endeavor to which each makes a vital contribution . All members of a family may be united by a common objective , such as buying a home , sending children to college , organizing a family musical quartette , or participating in a family council where the budget and other matters are discussed and decided . Often the participation of the whole family in a career or a project of one of its members is highly unifying . Harriet Beecher Stowe was stimulated and encouraged by her sister-in-law , her brother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her children the climax of the book in the death scene of Uncle Tom . ' Husbands and wives who are engaged in the same profession may be unified by this common occupational interest . Behavior in a dynamically unified family is pictured in the account by a daughter in the case at the beginning of this chapter . Summary and Research The unity of the large-patriarchal family was based on tradition , the mores , community pressure , law , elaborate ritual and ceremony , authority , superordination and subordination of family members , definite roles especially in the division of labor , and rigid discipline . Most of these factors making for family integration are absent or at a minimum in the modern urban American family . Unity in the companionship family develops and is maintained in mutual affection , emotional interdependence , sympathetic understanding , temperamental compatibility , consensus on family objectives and values , family events , celebrations and ceremonies , and interdependence of family roles . Social pressure of the community , particularly that of relatives , friends , and neighbors , still exerts an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , Crusader in Crinoline . The Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe , Philadelphia , J. B. Lippincott Company , 1941.  | In a society in transition from an agricultural to an urban civilization characterized by heterogeneity and cultural conflicts , there is not the same uniformity in family integration as found in a homogeneous society . In the United States at present , varying degrees of family unity are found , ranging from the disrupted family through the unorganized family , the habit-bound union , the highly solidified family , to the dynamically unified family . This latter type is one that deserves special study to discover the combination of integration and flexibility which will contribute to family unity and at the same time will foster the development of differentiated personalities . Other possibilities of research will now be indicated . Factors in Family Integration . Different aspects of the personality significant for family adjustment have been differentiated : ( I ) interdependence of psychogenetic traits ; ( 2 ) similarity of cultural backgrounds ; ( 3 ) common interests , ideas , and ideals ; ( q. ) congruence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony of response patterns . In any given family its unity , integration , and adaptability will be a resultant of the interaction of the husband and wife and of parents and children in these different aspects of their personalities . How psychological motivations and cultural conditions are related in integrating persons into the family structure has become an imperative problem for further study , a problem requiring the research techniques of psychiatrists , sociologists , and psychologists . Affectional and Prudential Marriages . What is the difference in unity of families where strong emotional attachments were basic to the marriage and those where marriages were more utilitarian ? It would be interesting to take a group of marriages where love was at a minimum and utility was at a maximum and investigate the unifying factors and compare these factors with those in marriages where love was at a maximum and utility was at a minimum . What , if any , are the differences by economic status and class ? Family Personnel . There are marked differences in the personnel of such family groups as childless families , families with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home but unmarried adult children living at home , in-laws living with the family , families with boarders , remarried widowed , remarried divorced , families with stepchildren , and various other types . How is family unity affected by these and other differences in personnel ? Parents and Parents-in-Law . In ancient society and Oriental civilizations the parents and parents-in-law were unifying influences because the small-family group was subordinate to the large family .  | Now , where the unit of husband , wife , and children is independent , the parents on one or both sides of the family may be either unifying , disruptive , or indifferent . The problem for research is to determine the conditions under which parents of young married couples act to strengthen or undermine the new union . Several hypotheses may be tested : ( 1 ) antagonism expressed before marriage , particularly between a mother-in-law and her son-in-law or daughter-in-law , is likely to persist after the marriage ; ( z ) conflicts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are more frequent than between mother-in-law and son-in-law ; ( 3 ) conflicts between parents-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an only child . Religion . Religion as a unifying and , under certain circumstances , as a disintegrating factor in family life needs further study . The assumption that disagreement between husband and wife in religious affiliation is more significant for parent-child than for husband-wife relations might be put to the test of research . Also significant for study is the extent to which parents resume religious activities after the birth of a child . The role of militant religious sects in promoting or disrupting family solidarity should be studied . ? ' : The Marooned Family . Even in a community with divergent cultural patterns , a family often succeeds in maintaining its standards and objectives in the ' rearing of its children . Studies of these cases would throw light on the processes of family unity and control . Typical situations for study are : a missionary family in a foreign land , a marooned family in a rooming-house district , a Japanese or Chinese family in an American town , the only Negro family in a white community . The Family Council . The family council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the family . A series of case studies of the actual working of the family council would contribute to our knowledge of how family discussion contributes to unity and under certain conditions may be disruptive . Questions and Exercises i .

Courtship behavior , however , has been in a continuous process of change for over one hundred years . Young people have gained increasing freedom of association . The present generation of youth in their conceptions of love and marriage and in their courtship behavior are being profoundly influenced by the instrumentalities of mass society : the automobile , the motion picture , the radio , and television . Changes in Courtship Behavior The rapidity with which courtship practices are modified is strikingly evident in the following case , which compares the courting experiences of a woman thirty years ago with those of her sister , twenty years younger : I could not go with boys until I was sixteen , and when I did I had to be in at eleven o'clock . Before my mother would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company I had to bring him home to spend an evening . There were those I never was allowed to go out with alone . I took her decisions without any feeling of rebellion because she gave me perfectly good reasons . We went to church affairs , box socials , hikes , picnics , school basketball and football games , and home parties . I never knew what " necking " was , and my intimate boy and girl friends did not " neck . " Of the six men who proposed to me , none of them except my husband ever kissed me . If I had accepted one of these proposals , our engagement would have been " sealed with our first kiss . " The young men I went with had a great reverence for girls and would not think of taking such liberties as putting their arms around a girl or kissing her unless they were engaged . They really thought girls were objects of purity and goodness . I met my husband where we both worked . From this work association 3 ' 5  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our courtship was spent on bicycles or hiking . The first time John kissed me ( I was 17 ) I thought I was a ruined girl and cried most of the night . I was very innocent about sex . My mother never discussed sex with me . My youngest sister never could understand how anyone would propose to a girl whom he had never kissed or how a girl could know whether or not she wanted to marry a man unless she had been " necking " with him . She kissed all her boy friends , and I can remember her saying , " Gosh , when Rex kissed me , I knew he was the real McCoy . " Comparing my dating and courting experiences with those of today , I wondered if my case was extreme . So I started to interview women between forty and fifty years . The first ten I asked were reared similarly and felt much the same . One woman , forty-six years of age , a college graduate , said that when she was going with the man she later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She was frightened to death because she actually thought that she was going to have a baby . Another woman forty-nine years old said that she fell in love with a young man and permitted him to kiss her , but every time she felt like the wanton woman her minister denounced in his sermons . The courtship experiences recounted here are typical of the standards of conduct prevalent in the first decade of the twentieth century . The older woman 's courtship fitted in with the culture of the horseand-buggy days , just as her sister 's courtship behavior corresponds with the era of the automobile . This case may serve as an introduction to the main questions to be asked about courtship : What have been the patterns of courtship in this country ? What is the relation of love to marriage in different times and places ? What is falling in love , the nature of the sentiment of love and its components , and the various types of the love relationship ? Under what conditions did dating and rating originate ? What are the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include all forms of behavior by which one seeks to win the consent of another for marriage . Courtship in the strict sense of the term is relatively modern , originating at first in court circles , as its etymology denotes , and gradually being diffused throughout society . With the decline of parental control over marriage , courtship on the part of young people became the approved preliminary to engagement and marriage . Evolution of American Courtship Behavior The evolution of American courtship behavior has progressed through four periods which are identified by the general type of social  | situation of the period : colonial society , the rural neighborhood , the town , and the city . Colonial Society . Arrangements for marriage with the colonial Puritan family took place without courtship . Parents might dictate the choice of a mate , although in most cases the preferences of young people were followed . The attention of the parents was concentrated upon the pecuniary aspects of the match and upon settling the financial arrangements between the two families . Morgan points out that with the Puritans , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prudential considerations influenced the choices of both parents and children . ' The Rural Neighborhood . Courtship in the rural neighborhood was characterized by the transition from marriages arranged by parents to mutual selections by young people which at first represented little personal freedom of choice . The group code governing courtship was almost as rigid as parental pressure . " Keeping company " or " going together steady " resulted from slight indications of preference and led almost inevitably to engagement followed by marriage . " . ' Falling in love " was the sine qua non for marriage as defined by the mores . In general , at least in theory , the physical aspects of sex were minimized before marriage . The common term then in use for the technique of courtship was " sparking . " Romance in the rural neighborhood was but a brief prelude to matter-of-fact marriage , with all the prosaic routine of farm life . The long hours of rural labor left little time during courtship and less in marriage for social relations . Marriage itself was an economic necessity and partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the operation of the farm . The Town . In the towns and cities marriage tended to be delayed and the period of courtship and engagement extended . With the growing economic independence of youth , their social life became an end in itself . Sex became somewhat more a self-conscious interest , with some freedom in experimentation , conventionally restricted to engaged couples . Coquetry , flirting , and playing at love entered into the social interaction of young people . The term " spooning " was current during the nineties and up to World War I. It designated the permissible and expected , if not altogether approved , behavior during courtship and engagement . footnote1 Edmund S. Morgan , The Puritan Family , Boston , Massachusetts , published by the Trustees of the Public Library , 1944 , pp. 11-15 , 21 , 22.  | The City . During the last fifty years urbanization in the United States has proceeded at a rapid pace . New instruments of transportation and communication have revolutionized social life , particularly for youth . The automobile has broken down the rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social contacts from a radius of five to one hundred miles . In the large cities the neighborhood dance hall has declined , and one or two great palatial dance halls are now thronged with a city-wide attendance . Through the radio and television the outside world has invaded the sacred precincts of the home , undermining familial control and local-community standards of conduct . In the city multifamily dwellings have made more acute the problem of privacy . Courting can no longer be carried on , as under rural and town conditions , at home in the " front parlor , " but takes place in public parks , in parked automobiles , in public dance halls , motion-picture theaters , night clubs , and roadhouses . The art of love as depicted by screen stars becomes the accepted pattern for emulation . Moreover , sexual impulses , freed from conventional inhibitions , find unrestrained expression in fantasy , and so tend to more and more individualized expression . The outstanding attitude of modern youth is one of self-consciousness and sophistication about sex . Young people often rate each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Puritan ban from social dancing . " Petting " and " necking " are popular terms for a degree of physical intimacy between casual acquaintances that was not permitted engaged couples of earlier generations . Instruction in sex , advocated as a solution to the problems created by ignorance , has created others attendant upon both little and unlimited knowledge . Sexual expression and experimentation in varying degrees and in manifold forms , both subtle and overt , have increased . These four periods , in colonial society , in the rural neighborhood , in the town , and in the city , denote stages in the evolution of American attitudes toward sex and romance . Conditions at present in the open country and in the town have been almost as profoundly affected by the automobile , the motion picture , the radio , and television as those in our urban centers . Romantic Love Love before marriage has been tabooed by nearly all peoples in the past and is frowned upon by the overwhelming majority of contemporary societies as foolish , shameful , and even indecent . In  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society does not encourage romance , at least not in connection with marriage . But romantic love outside of marriage is more than one thousand years old and existed in Ancient Greece and Rome . Romantic Love Outside of Marriage . Romantic love , or something closely akin to it , was present in Athenian life , but not in the relations of husband and wife . Indeed , " a wife , " according to Menander , " is a necessary evil . " The hetaerae , skilled entertainers in dancing and music , were frequently friends of statesmen , artists , and philosophers . The origin of romantic love has often been attributed by scholars to the chivalrous knight and the courteous lady of feudal society . But the love of the lady of the castle was not given to her liege lord , her husband , but was bestowed upon some gallant knight , or wandering troubadour , or adoring poet . A more tenable theory , however , derives the romantic love of modern times from the social life of royal courts in the seventeenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and styles for the polite society of Europe . Romantic Love in Marriage . It is in the United States that perhaps the only , at any rate the most complete , demonstration of romantic love as the prologue and theme of marriage has been staged . The explanation lies in the relaxation of parental control over courtship , which has changed marriage into a romantic adventure instead of a serious and responsible undertaking in which not merely the family but the state was concerned . A historian refers to the freedom of marriage from parental control at the close of the Revolutionary War : ' The freedom and sanctity of marriage depends entirely on the will of the parties . They choose the lawyer and the priest rather as witnesses than as means of cementing their engagements . When they meet with opposition from their relations , the two lovers go off on horseback together . The man rides behind his mistress , and in this situation present themselves before the magistrate , where the girl declares she has run away with her sweetheart , and that they are come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rejected , nor has any person a right to give them any molestation . In all other cases the parental authority is extensive . A writer forty years later commented : " Taste and inclination rather guided than controlled by the prudence of older heads form most of our matches . " 2 footnote1 From James Franklin , quoted in Arthur W. Calhoun , A Social History of the American Family , Cleveland , Arthur H. Clark Company , 1918 ( New York , Barnes &; Noble , 1945 ) , Vol . I , p. 3r. 2 Ibid. , p. 3z.  | There seems to be no doubt that from an early period romantic love has been accepted as the sole basis for marriage by practically all classes in this country . Calhoun in his A Social History of the American Family gives quite unmistakable evidence of the " noncommercial character of American marriage " and of " carelessness as to social rank " in American society in the decades after the Revolutionary War . The public appetite is insatiable for news of marriages , with or without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant maid ; of a Harvard graduate with a chorus girl ; of an heiress from New York 's most exclusive social circle with a self-made song writer who grew up on the East Side . The romantic impulse as it finds its expression in love-making and marriage in this country has had a history in which at least three main trends may be distinguished : ( Z ) the termination of romance with marriage and its conversion into conjugal affection , ( 2 ) the formulation of the doctrine that the validity of marriage inheres in the continuance of romantic love , and ( 3 ) a widespread reaction against romantic love and the emergence of a cynical attitude toward courtship and the institution of marriage . In the past , and typically in rural communities , romance paralleled courtship and terminated with marriage . The convention was however maintained that " they live together happily ever afterward . " No one will deny that in the open country and in villages and towns husband and wife , with few exceptions , " lived together ever afterward , " whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early adjustments of married life and remained an enthralling memory in the family annals . The Industrial Revolution , the growth of cities , the increase in leisure time , and the forward strides in popular education had their effect upon marriage and the family . The taking of work out of the home and the consequent economic and social emancipation of women served in one way or another to heighten the emphasis upon romantic love , not only before but after marriage . A popular philosophy arose that love and love alone was sufficient to bring together in marriage the persons best fitted to establish a family . Supreme happiness was to be found in marriage , but only with the predestined loved one . The theory of the " soul-mate " soon was elaborated to include belief in " love at first sight " and in the necessity of meeting and marrying one 's affinity for the fullest expression of one 's personality or the accomplishment of one 's best work .  | Naturally , even where passion was deep and sincere , there was disillusionment when romantic impulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different cultural backgrounds , and different philosophies of life . It became evident that in many marriages , even if respect remained , romance had faded . The affinity theory was modified to demand either the continuance of romantic love in marriage or the dissolution of the marriage . " Incompatibility of temperament , " while not a legal ground for divorce , gained wide popular sanction , especially in cities , as a justification for dissolving an existing union in order to pursue ideal happiness in a new matrimonial venture . Rudolph Valentino , who in his acting symbolized to the public the romantic conception of love par excellence , is reported to have made this confession of his faith:i I set out in the belief that I had achieved union with my ideal mate , and I thought there could be no greater happiness for a man than to be united to his soul-mate . I soon realized that marriage and the artistic temperament could not harmonize and I lived in hell for the days in which I could not adjust myself to the extent of regaining my freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered . You may think it strange that I should have risked a second marriage , but I was under the delusion that it would be different , and for some weeks everything suggested that I was right . This is the way that fate mocks us artists and it was not long until I realized that the second marriage was going the way of the first . The popular philosophy of romantic love was always more or less tempered by common sense . But certain social reformers and advanced thinkers carried this doctrine to its logical extreme of " free love . " Ellen Key , the ablest exponent of these new ideas , rationalized and emotionalized them in support of love 's freedom , " the right of motherhood , " " free divorce , " and " a new marriage law . " 2 The theories and conclusions of Ellen Key and other radical idealists have had little or no influence upon the masses , but they powerfully affected a small but influential group of the intelligentsia . Many individual attempts were made to demonstrate the validity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where social conditions were most favorable for their success , are the most interesting . In Love in Greenwich Village , Dell pays tribute to the enthusiasm , courage , and intellectual conviction with which footnote1 Chicago Daily American , September 11 , 1916 , p. 6 . ' Ellen Key , Love and Marriage , New York , G. P. Putnam 's Sons , 1911.  | these social rebels sought to carry out their unconventional program . ' The Greenwich Village experiment marks the ebb of American romanticism . No environment more propitious for the success of so radical an experiment could have been asked for . Within the foregoing perspective of the trends of love and marriage in the United States , an analysis will be presented of the nature of the sentiment of love and its component elements . The Sentiment of Love and Its Components Love , like the other sentiments , is a complex of feelings , emotions , desires , images , and ideas organized around an object . The sentiment of love for a person of the opposite sex is made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to produce different emotional states ? all of which we call love . These include the love of the son for his mother , of a boy for his sweetheart , of an adolescent for his latest crush , of a romantic couple in love at first sight , of a young man and woman that has gradually developed into an affair of the heart , and of a husband and wife . The term " love " is also applied to states of feeling in which sex does not enter , as the attachment of a child for a pet , the relations of mother and daughter and of father and son , the affection of best friends , and one 's attitude to humanity or to God . In the main , though , of course , not entirely , the sentiment of love is an organization of feelings , attitudes , and values associated with the fundamental wish for response . The chief aspect of response as contrasted with the other wishes is the need of the person for intimacy with his fellows . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following components of the love sentiment : ( 1 ) sexual desire , ( 2 ) physical attraction , ( 3 ) attachment , ( q ) emotional interdependence , ( 5 ) idealization , ( 6 ) companionship , ( 7 ) stimulation , ( 8 ) freedom of communication and action , ( 9 ) emotional reassurance , and ( Io ) status . Each of these will be examined in relation to the role it plays as a component of the love sentiment . Sexual Desire . Sexual desire is defined here as the impulse to have sexual intercourse . It is the physiological component of the sentiment of love . Apart from the other components of the sentiment of love , sexual desire would be , at least theoretically , indiscriminating . Any individual of the opposite sex who was available footnote1 Floyd Dell , Love in Greenwich Village , New York , Doubleday , Doran &; Company , I9zE , pp. 140  --  43.  | would satisfy the sexual craving . The sexual impulse in and of itself , therefore , tends to variety and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by habit or other components that it leads into monogamy . The forms of expression of sexual desire are not innate . They are learned through social experience and are defined by culture . Pleasure in sexual stimulation appears early in the life of an infant , but this behavior on the genital level is repressed in our culture . Permissive , however , is pleasure in the stimulation of other erogenous zones ; i.e. , the breasts and the lips , where physical contact gives sensory gratification as in the embrace and the kiss . Although embracing and kissing are typical behavior in love-making and may in the process of summation be preparatory to intercourse , they are in Western culture often detached from sex desire . As such they have a meaning that is more symbolic than sensual as denoting personal affection in relations of husband and wife , of parents and children , of friends and of lovers . Physical Attraction . A person of the opposite sex possesses differing degrees of sex appeal . For each individual , physical attraction is discriminating and selective . Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal adornment , separately or in combination , are elements in physical attraction . But there is a more generalized personal attraction , as the elusive " it " which is variously designated as " charm , " " fascination , " " magnetism " ? terms which imply a mysterious power of one person to evoke in the other feelings of interest , submission , or infatuation . Coquetry in the female and daring in the male enhance sex appeal . In America and in other societies there are many personal idiosyncrasies in sex attraction . Falling in love may be fixated on some one physical characteristic , such as the color or curl of the hair , the manner of walking , the toss of the head , shapely fingers , a smile , or a look in the eyes . Attachment . Association with a person of the opposite sex may result in one-sided or mutual affection . In the latter case it is called rapport . Attachment and rapport may develop with little or no sexual connotation , as between friends , parents and children , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate association . In the family and to a greater or less extent among friends , it is sustained by demonstration of affection . Rapport denotes a mutual responsiveness of friends , lovers , or spouses so that each is disposed to act upon the stimulus of the other . This mutual suggestibility of two lovers under conditions of absorption in each other and in  | psychological isolation from others may be so heightened as to approximate folic k deux ( literally , " madness of two " ) . Emotional Interdependence . The degree to which the love object evokes and satisfies the basic personality needs of the person determines emotional dependence . If mutual , it is emotional interdependence . The individual demands sympathy , encouragement , understanding , and reassurance . A given person has developed his own particular pattern of personality needs in the early response relationships with parents and siblings . These he seeks to duplicate in later affectional relationships . Emotional dependence upon another , or emotional interdependence , is particularly characteristic of personal relationships which arise in intimate association . Idealization . Idealization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that corresponds more to what the lover imagines and wishes than to actuality . The degree of the distortion from reality in idealization depends upon a number of factors , such as the intensity of love , the extent of lack of knowledge of the other person , and the predominance of romanticism over practicality in the person . The factors making for idealization are subject to social change . The freer association of young people before marriage in the present generation has markedly decreased the degree of distortion of the romantic images with which couples look at each other . It has correspondingly reduced the disillusionment in marriage . Idealization , however , will never be completely eliminated from courtship and marriage , for wherever there is love , some degree of idealization will be present . Companionship . In modern society the companionship of men and women both before and after marriage is upon a plane perhaps never before reached in human existence . It has been made possible by the sublimation of the sexual impulses so that men and women may associate together as equals , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the relationship . Companionship as a component of the sentiment of love may be considered at three levels : ( 1 ) participation in common interests , ( 2 ) exaltation of the sympathies , and ( 3 ) mental interstimulation and response . Common interests , while they may not directly evoke love , prepare a favorable situation for it and tend to sustain and maintain it . Studies of engaged couples indicate that both the number and kind of common interests in which the couple participate make for congeniality and unity . Participation in any common interest involves companionship and develops friendship .  | Outdoor sports are activities which unmarried and married couples may enjoy doing together , but they may contribute little to pair ' unity . Artistic , intellectual , religious , and sometimes political interests seem to have much more meaning for the relationship . The common activities of married life ? the establishment and maintenance of a home , the bearing and rearing of children , and the social activities of the couple ? draw and keep husband and wife together . But failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Disagreements in sports and games are generally less serious than those over morals , ideals , religion , and those that involve children and management of the home . One element in the attraction of the sexes has always been their interaction on the basis of their temperamental and cultural differences . Today with educational opportunity open equally to women , and with greater freedom of association , intellectual interstimulaion and response becomes an increasingly important element in ove and marriage . An educated man values intellectual companionship in a wife more than beauty or proficiency in the household arts . Stimulation . New experience is an active component of the sentiment of love , as evidenced in the excitement , thrill , and adventure of the pursuit in dating and courtship . Interest is keen among young people in the mastery of the techniques of winning a mate and to some extent in older persons in holding a marriage partner . There is the vivid contrast between anticipation and realization before and after a date , particularly a " blind " date . In marriage the stimulation of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions there remains the adventure of exploring the - unknown areas of the personality of the other . Some husbands and wives find this one of the most interesting phases of their relationship , the always unexpected variations of reaction to new situations which they often tend to ascribe to the mysteries of differences in sex . Freedom of Communication and Action . One method of gauging the depth of love of a couple is by determining the extent and intimacy of communication and behavior . In the love relationship the person may experience even a higher degree of freedom of confiding and of acting than in a close friendship . Particularly in the companionship family its members are relaxed and informal in each other 's society . As husband and wife , or parents and children , become constrained or inhibited in the exchange of confidences and formal or distant in  | their behavior , their love tends to diminish or , at any rate , to sustain a change in its nature . Emotional Reassurance . A very real need of human beings is for reassurance and the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development often requires this constant reassurance . The unwanted and rejected child experiences feelings of emotional disturbance which may turn outward in destructive and delinquent behavior or inward into daydreaming and feelings of inferiority and injustice . Engaged and married couples have a strong desire for emotional security . One or both may need repeated expressions of reassurance . A feeling of insecurity on the part of one member is disturbing and is the entering wedge of jealousy which may be disruptive of the whole love relationship . Status . Self-esteem and the approval of others are important ingredients in the sentiment of love . The status of the college man is affected by that of the girl he dates and vice versa . If the girl of his choice reciprocates his declaration of affection , his self-esteem is i inflated . The pride of possession leads to the further expansion of the ego . Conformity to a socially expected and approved pattern of conduct brings with it self-congratulation and in affairs of the heart often the plaudits of one 's group . Marriage bestows a new status upon the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction . A man usually marries a woman of his own class , or , if he is climbing up in the social ladder , aspires to wed into the class above . To marry a wife from a lower class is to become declassed . Types of Love Relationships Certain of the components in the sentiment of love in any relationship may be absent , or slightly , moderately , or strongly represented . For purposes of analyzing the different components of love they may be thought of as a series ranging from physical attraction at one end , with emphasis upon the physiological aspects of sex , to mental interstimulation and response at the other end , with the absence or at least the minimum of sexual feeling . This series may actually be conceived as a continuum from sexual craving at one extreme to the increasing sublimation of sex with the progression through physical attraction , attachment , emotional response , idealization , and affectional and intellectual companionship . Holding in mind the analysis of the components of the sentiment  | of love , it is possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lust , infatuation , romantic love , affection , comradely feeling , and Platonic love . Lust . In lust there is the predominance of sexual desire to the exclusion or to the minimization of the other components of love . Its extreme form , corresponding to the ideal construct of lust , is rape , where the sex-crazed man attacks the first available woman without regard to age or attractiveness . In patronizing a prostitute , the sexual desire of the man is the outstanding component , but selection tends to be made on the basis of physical attractiveness . Infatuation . In love " at first sight , " physical attraction is the strongest single element in the love relationship , with sexual desire often a strong secondary factor , particularly with the male . As the term infatuation implies , emotional reactions are dominant ; the two persons are highly suggestible to each other and are relatively immune to the influence of parents and friends . Where they are of the same social status and sometimes even where they are of different social classes , the affair sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elopement . If the man is of a higher class than the woman , it may terminate in seduction if he quickly recovers from his infatuation . Where either the husband or the wife was not in love at marriage or has ceased to love the other , he or she may be liable to an infatuation which may take the form of extramarital relations or may lead to divorce and remarriage . The triangle is a favorite theme in novels and in plays , in part because the audience makes ready identification with the characters and their problems . Where a husband and father feels affection for his wife and children or is under social pressure to maintain respectability but is at the same time infatuated and deeply attached to another woman , he may secretly establish his mistress in a second home . Romantic Love . The response elements in the sentiment of love may be stressed and idealized to the exclusion or minimization of its other components . In romantic love the emphasis is upon sexual attraction , personal beauty , and emotional response . The assumption is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that love is all that matters . In romantic love , rapturous feelings are predominant : the trembling of the limbs , the palpitation of the heart , the catching of the breath , and the thrill at the approach of the loved one . Glamorous conceptions of romantic love often remain dominant for years in the fantasy life and in the imagination of the person . Typically they are most controlling in adolescence and early youth  | and find manifestation in adolescent love affairs , or in " puppy love . " Generally they have little or no overt expression in the love life of the person except in his intimate diary or in writing poetry . Sometimes , however , almost in the full measure of the romantic expectations , they find realization in courtship and marriage or , outside of marriage , in clandestine relations . Increasingly in America and to some extent in other countries , the philosophy of romantic love is itself a major factor in the dissolution of one relationship and the consummation of a new union . The polarity of the sentiment of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those of unrequited love or of broken engagements where sometimes the individual who is the more deeply involved emotionally may actually attempt to kill the other . This sudden shift from extreme love to extreme hate indicates that negative feelings and attitudes have been held in check by positive emotions , but in so precarious an equilibrium as to be upset by a crisis in the relationship . Affection . By affection is meant the tender feeling and its expression that is most characteristically exhibited in the behavior of members of the family toward each other . The giving and receiving of affection with the emotional security which it symbolizes is one of the basic functions of the family . Demonstrations of affection in our culture include not only the physical reactions of kissing , embracing , and caressing , but the use of endearing terms , expressions of appreciation , and acts of courtesy and helpfulness . Affection within the family has its differentiated forms . There is ' conjugal affection , the love between husband and wife which tends to supersede the romantic love that may have induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the day-by-day associations and experiences of married life . The love of parents for children has its counterpart in filial affection . Fraternal affection , the love of brothers and sisters for each other , develops in their association in the family . It is both the social convention and the family ideal that affectional relations be present and equally manifested toward each member of the family . On the whole , the natural processes of family life effect a close approximation to this expectation . Yet there is always more or less divergence from it . Some investigators find a tendency for the father and daughter to prefer each other and for mother and son to he closer . Two explanations for this have been presented , one by psychoanalysts who point to the preferential attraction of different sexes , the other by sociologists who stress the tendency in our society  | for boys to come in conflict with their fathers and girls with their n others over the control of their activities . ' The majority of adulescent children when questioned profess to love their parents equa I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about two to one , report preference for the mother . There is a slight difference in these responses y sex toward preference by the boy for his mother and by the girl or her father . The physical expression of the affectional feeling , such as kissing , mbracing , and caressing , is typically devoid of consciousness of sexual feeling . Even in conjugal affection , particularly in the case of the wife , there may exist a great desire for demonstration of affection and an aversion to the physical aspects of sex . While the feeling of affection and its demonstration is characteristic of the family , in our society it may and does extend beyond the family and other relatives to embrace close friends . Comradely Feeling . The relation of comradeship , especially between persons of the same sex , is one that is recognized and encouraged in our culture . Comradeship may be defined as close friendship between persons of the same or of a different sex who find satisfaction in joint activities . Familiar illustrations are the best friend , the bosom companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society comradeship plays an increasing role in courtship and marriage . The association of young people in this generation . appears to be more and more designed to find out , first , if they can be friends and , second , if they can be lovers . The process of falling in love is often that of friendship developing into love . Even in marriage , comradeship remains an important , if not the most important , element . In reporting on the gains in marriage , husbands and wives more frequently mention companionship than any other factor . Relations between parents and children are increasingly being placed upon a basis of comradeship . The father no longer considers his role to be that of a disciplinarian but of a pal and a playmate to his son . The mother seeks not to be the voice of authority to her daughter but to be a confidante . Platonic Love . By Platonic love is meant friendship between a man and a woman upon an intellectual basis . It is a friendship which develops out of the exchange of feelings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which theoretically involves none of the other components of love . footnote1 See pp. 116-17 , 366-67.  | Platonic friendships are found in our society , but chiefly between unmarried persons . Where one or both of the parties are married , society is likely to look askance at the relationship , and the married partner more often than not is overtly or subtly opposed to the intellectual liaison . There is also the problem of keeping the relation upon the Platonic level . For one or both it may terminate by falling in love . An Adolescent Love Affair . The way in which several components of the sentiment of love enter into a romantic adolescent love affair is disclosed in the following document : During my second year in high school , when sixteen , I became infatuated with a girl a year younger than myself . A bashful , reticent youth , I had had but little contact with the other sex . But the social life of a high-school boy renders companionship with girls essential . There are house parties , hikes , and dances ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became acquainted with Ann . As she was presentable , unattached , and appeared acquiescent , I gradually grew into the habit of escorting her to and from these affairs . The all-observing eyes of school comrades noted this approaching liaison , and furthered its progress in more or less overt ways . Boys would refrain from asking Ann to parties or other gatherings , assuming that I would take her , and other girls would avoid intimacy with me . Thus the group established our relationship . We studiously refrained from discussing our relationship to each other . This phase of the love affair , of tentative approaches and haphazard attraction , gradually grew into the second and consciously recognized relationship . We went " steady . " And finally , after a year and a half of note writing in classes , of fugitive kisses , and clandestine hugs , we slowly drifted apart . Literally , we outgrew the infatuation . Strange as it seems now , the thought of intercourse with this love object never entered my mind . But though romantic and highly artificial , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since encountered . Perhaps by trying to dissect the factors inducing , continuing , and finally culminating the affair , we might arrive at some clue concerning the motives . First , group pressure : one 's prestige was raised if he had a " girl . " Second , a rather coy , demure , or coquettish air on the part of Ann . Third , imitation of upperclassman behavior . Fourth , the necessity of a female companion for social gatherings . And fifth , timidity ; since Ann was accessible , I escorted her instead of risking the tortures of asking another . The foregoing factors , however , merely paved the way for love . To explain the powerful attraction that manifested itself , it seems necessary to invoke another factor . This , I believe , was the Oedipus complex . Ann was a blonde , had blue eyes , and had much the same temperament as my mother . Unconsciously , I recognized in this girl the image of my mother . The third stage , that of dissolution , was influenced mainly by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a change of attitude on my part , while that of the girl remained the same . I felt the necessity of summation , while social inhibitions restrained her . Second , a new environment that demanded new standards of women and of courtship . And third , the sublimation of energy into study and into work . The dominant component in this adolescent love affair is idealization , with the element of sex desire , except toward the end , completely inhibited . Emotional interaction and attachment are also strong factors . Companionship of the couple appears to have been upon a rather superficial and conventional level . The dynamic element in the relationship was that of the mother-image . The Courtship Process The courtship process in American society will be treated under the headings : ( z ) dating , ( z ) rating , ( 3 ) keeping company and going steady , ( 4 ) private understanding and engagement , and ( 5 ) broken engagements . Dating . Dating is a relatively new phenomenon in American culture . As the term itself implies , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment beyond the expectation that it will be a pleasurable event for both . In American society before World War I , except in the upper classes , even the initial request for the company of a young woman to or from ; . social event was interpreted by the girl , her family , and the community as evidence of the man 's serious intentions . The going 1ogether of a couple more than two or three times was considered " keeping company " and in rural communities generally eventuated in engagement and marriage . The concept of dating , on the contrary , implies a widely different view of the association between the sexes . It involves six points : ( 1 ) an end in itself , signifying no further necessary involvement ; ( z ) the opportunity of having friendly associations not with just one or two , but with a large number of persons of the opposite sex ; ( 3 ) an increased range of contacts ; ( 4 ) a multiplication of the occasions for social engagements ; ( 5 ) the selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum of parental influence ; and ( 6 ) rating or the predominance of the standards of the age group in personal selection . A situation closely approximating the ideal type for the study of dating is that of the college campus . At the coeducational university in the small-town community , all the characteristics of dating just  | described are observable . Our description and analysis will be documented by excerpts from cases from one Midwestern university located in a town of 5000 population . At Midwestern University all but 5 per cent of the students are reported to engage in dating , although only 75 per cent date at all regularly . Even in the latter group there is considerable variation in the degree of dating . Fraternity men and sorority women date much more than do independents . Those who do not date regularly are forced by social pressures to date on important occasions , such as fraternity , sorority , and hall dances . At Midwestern University the students turn every occasion from " Coking " to dancing into a date : There are several kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is used more as a means of getting acquainted than for any other purpose . The students meet at chapel time ; about 2.5 per cent go to chapel , 5o per cent to some Coke joint ; and the other 2.5 per cent walk about the campus . In this half-hour period the students have a chance to meet and to become better acquainted . It may or may not lead to other things . The Wednesday-night date has much the same purpose as the chapel date , but for couples who already know each other it often serves as an interlude in the week and enables them to let off stored-up emotional steam . The ? " petting and necking " is heavier on this night than on any other . Freshman women are not permitted to have dates on week nights except on Wednesday night from 9:00 to io : oo . But to avoid this University ruling the girls sign out to the library , where by prearrangement they meet their boy friends , study until 9:00 or 9:30 , when they start meandering slowly back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on extensively by a large portion of the upperclass men and women . Then there are the week-end dates . On Friday and Saturday nights every fraternity and the men 's dorm have radio dances ; that is , unless they have their formal or informal dance . On Sunday nights the typical date is to take the girl to a show . For big occasions many of the students import dates . These ? " imports " are mostly either from one 's home town or students who have graduated or transferred . Importing is costly and is done by only about 15 per cent of the student body , and only then on very special occasions . The men pay the bills almost exclusively , with the exception of those who have put their pins out , or those who are going steady with a vengeance and sometimes go " Dutch " if the occasion is big and expensive . Rivalry inevitably grows out of dating . In the first place , the rating given a person by the group determines his eligibilit ; ; for dating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by the rating of  | the person with whom one dates . The result is that for many students dating becomes a game , an end in itself , the object being to date as many high-ranking persons of the opposite sex as possible . If a person has little emotional involvement , he may tend to exploit a relationship for his own purpose . The following excerpts indicate the competition associated with dating the top raters of the campus : Top-rating men , if for nothing else than to further enhance this rating , will date the big-name girls . It usually matters little to the man whether or not the girl is popular among the girls ; he cares mostly whether or not she is popular among the men . Top-rating girls may take dates with boys who do not rate simply because they can not get out of it , or in some cases because they want to date them . A persistent boy may get a date with a top-rating girl for small occasions , but she seldom dates him for the bigger occasions . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions . Rating . Thus dating at Midwestern University , as at other similar institutions , is controlled by rating . The rating of a person is his relative desirability for dating assigned to him by the group . It depends upon physical attractiveness , personality characteristics , reputation on the campus , participation in university activities , and the status of a person as determined by membership in organizations : The girl who rates must be a relatively pretty girl , though not necessarily beautiful . She must have a fine personality , but if she has a " line " it is easily detected and her rating goes down . She must be a good dancer and must take an interest in sports , though she need have no athletic ability . She must dress with taste , though not elaborately , except on nights of formal or informal dancing , at which times she must really " strut her stuff " and make herself visible and desirable to males other than her escort . Sorority plus " oomph " is everything . There are two sororities competing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make much difference . However , the lowest rated sorority is far better than being an independent . Exceptional talent is recognized , though , even in independent girls . The first question asked when mentioning a person is , " What is he ? " or " What is she ? " It is relatively easy for girls and boys in top sororities and fraternities to get dates regardless of their own personalities . To rate , a girl must either belong to one of the prominent sororities or be a B.W.O.C. ' by being in a lot of outside activities or otherwise she must be a " personality-plus " girl . ' Big woman on campus .  | If a girl is to rate she must never bring her other affairs with men into conversation . I have heard more fellows complain on this point than on any other . A fellow to rate must belong to one of the best fraternities or be a leader in one of the lesser fraternities . If he has certain other qualities , scholarship does n't take him down any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . The captain of the football team is one of the top men on campus . He must be good looking , a neat dresser , and a good dancer . It is best not to have too obvious a line . The B.M.O.C. ? big men on campus ? have a high rating . Persons are constantly being rated and rerated , particularly following big campus events : Bull sessions are a regular climax to every University dance . Frank opinions are expressed about the kind of time each fellow has had . Blind dates are gone over very thoroughly , and the usual combinations seen at the dance are commented upon . Unless one has sat in on one of these bull sessions , he ca n't imagine the kind of language that is sometimes used to describe a girl , especially a blind date , who did n't make such a good impression . Of course , not all the boys are that way . Keeping Company an Going Stead . Although dating , in itself , involves no further commit , - t-a-ctually under certain circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps there always is involved an appraisal of the other as a matrimonial possibility . The factors that transform dating many into dating one are various . Chief among these are : ( I ) mutual responsiveness and preference for each other , ( 2 ) protection of one 's self-esteem against the risk of being turned down , ( 3 ) the economy of time and money , ( 4 ) group arrangements and expectations which favor pairing rather than dating , ( 5 ) emotional involvement , and ( 6 ) the securing of a higher rating through being selected from all others . Certain of these are illustrated by excerpts from documents : The general practice at Midwestern University is for students who are able to do so to go steady . Many , of course , prefer freedom in their romantic affairs , but by far the larger group would rather go steady if the opportunity arises . Neither is more socially approved than the other , so both are practiced . Some of those who rate can afford to play the field and not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently the reason for " going steady . " This idea of playing the field is all well and good if you can do it successfully .  | An exploratory survey of colleges and universities in the United States indicates that , in general , few students keep steady company during their freshman year , but the proportion increases through the sophomore and junior years , rising by the senior year to include two thirds or more of the students , many of them becoming engaged before graduation . There are , of course , exceptional cases in which practically the entire student body is paired , beginning early in the freshman year . Keeping company and going steady on college campuses generally involve less commitment than in the outside world . Several factors prevent involvement beyond the expression of mutual preference through going together . These include : ( 1 ) the advice of parents to postpone , to the future , serious consideration of marriage ; ( z ) the prudential attitude of being certain of one 's choice through further associations with the opposite sex ; ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of steady company and the apprehension on the part of the girl that emotional involvement may result in sexual intimacies without matrimonial intention ; ( 4 ) the sensitivity of the person to the frank and critical rating of one 's associates which tends to prevent idealization ; and ( 5 ) the fear that emotional involvement will interfere with educational progress in training for and success in a career . The transition from dating through keeping company to going steady is a resultant of the conjunction of the factors making for and against emotional involvement . Keeping steady company signifies mutual preference which may , however , represent only friendship and not love . In fact , there is often a tendency on the part of one or both members of a couple to limit the relationship and refrain from making further affectional commitments . But , in general , keeping company is regarded by the couple and others as a period of exploration in which the couple test their personality needs and satisfactions , temperamental compatibility , common interests , and ideals . Private Understanding and Engagement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go steady passes into the stage of the private understanding . This understanding is sometimes implicit father than explicit . It may be registered merely by gestures , by indit'ect references , by mutual avowals of love , or just taken for granted . But there is usually an overt understanding with a pledge of secrecy . often at this stage the young man and the young woman are introduced to the families of each other . The process of falling in love , culminating first in a private under-  | standing and then in a public announcement , is described by one young man : I met my future " better half " in the autumn as we were doing c'ishes together one evening over at the Co-op . She was pretty as a picture but she was also " outgoing , " friendly , and alert . We soon were properly introduced by a mutual friend and immediately began to exchange good-h ored remarks . She was winsome , she seemed to enjoy working , and she , , looked " domestic " with a dishcloth in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . This particular night , a girl I'deen dating a bit , who introduced us , was having a date with another fellow . Here was my chance to change women , to get to know this girl who had walked into my world . We had a double date , milk shakes at the drugstore . After our double date with the other couple , we saw that two was company in their case , and we felt the same way , so we took our first walk-talk out by the lake . We soon found we talked the same language although hers was from Missouri and mine from Ohio . We knew we had found mutual satisfaction in this first " date . " We began to meet each other at meals , in classrooms , and would take walk-talks along about 9:30 evenings in our old clothes , across the campus , weaving our lives as " good friends . " Within a month we were keeping company . At school affairs we paired off . We began to share our work . We proofread each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly that we had had little time to see each other objectively . So it was with mutual agreement that we planned not to see each other for a time . We stood this being apart about a week and a half . Then she saw me in class , said she had something she 'd like to see me about , and we agreed to a Friday evening " date . " It was on Friday that she confided that after seeing our relation objectively , she was ready to " go steady . " We decided to celebrate the fact by having a dinner date Saturday evening . That evening I kissed her for the first time . She said , " What does this mean ? " We had decided to " go steady " about Thanksgiving time . As we continued to share vital interests , school affairs , and one night a week as coleaders of a youth club , we soon were sensing our mutuality . At Christmas time we knew we were in love and began to exchange tokens of mutual affection . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her my picture . We parted for Christmas vacation . It seemed that being apart , writing daily letters , having " spaces in togetherness " brought us back together with a new rush of feeling , and our relationship emerged onto a new level . At New Year 's Eve we celebrated our new " private understanding . " We toasted our new relationship , wished each other " A Happier New Year , " and exchanged rings . We each had pictured a person of certain qualities , and a quality of rela-  | tionship which we wanted . When we saw these fulfilled and the joy of inn growing affection , we knew we wanted to share the rest of our lives . But I had not definitely , in so many words , asked her to marry me ; but we knew everything moved in that direction . My big brother-in-law came to Chicago for a convention and naturally we entertained him . After having his enthusiastic approval of the young woman as a potential sister-in-law I asked her to marry me . We went first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , visiting first her Big Sis and brother-in-law and then her family . We began to marry each other 's family . We 've been apart this summer . We look forward eagerly to being married next June . In this love affair the emphasis is on personality interaction and companionship . There is a distinct difference between the private understanding and the formal engagement . The former signifies the mutual confession of love with the expectation of marriage . Engagement , however , takes into account parents , relatives , and friends and adds the social to the personal commitment . In general , as indicated by this case , the approval of parents and relatives of the relationship is a secondary , although highly desired , consideration . The engagement period is increasingly utilized by young couples to become better acquainted with each other and to determine if they possess the combination of characteristics favorable for a happy marriage . The nature of marital success and the factors making for adjustment in marriage will be discussed in detail in Chapters 14 and 15 . At this point it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the young man and the young woman the opportunity to make sure of their mutual love ; of their compatibility in personal traits ; of their similarity in familial and cultural backgrounds ; of their common interests , ideas , and ideals ; and of their complementing of each other 's personality needs . Studies show that the longer the period of acquaintance , courtship , and engagement the higher the probabilities of a successful marriage . ' The mere passage of time is , of course , not the significant point . It is only a symbol of the opportunity given the couple to test their relationship and to determine if they have developed an affection and companionship adequate for a lifelong union . The engagement also affords the couple the opportunity to solve problems in their relationship before rather than after marriage . The relatively high proportion of broken engagements shows that many couples find out before it is too late that they are not well matched . footnote See pp. 436-47.  | Broken Engagements . In a study of one thousand engaged couples , 13.8 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken one or more previous engagements , and 14.9 per cent later broke their current engagements . These figures indicate that broken engagements are quite frequent in our society , and they raise the questions , first , of cause , and second , of the reaction of the couple to this event . The discussion of the causes of broken engagements will be largely based on the findings of an unpublished study ' by Charlotte A. Cooper . The different concrete difficulties making for broken engagement may be grouped under five factors , of which the last two appear to be the most important : ( 1 ) superficial attraction , ( 1 ) separation , ( 3 ) parental influence , ( 4 ) cultural divergence , and ( 5 ) major personality problems . The causes of superficial attraction are those where the couple appear to have been drawn to each other romantically but find in the engagement period an absence of one or more of the elements essential for a lasting union , such as deep affection , complementing of personality , temperamental compatibility , or common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more emotionally involved , and the other breaks the relationship . A period of separation is often a factor in broken engagements . Certain of these undoubtedly fall under superficial attraction , since the relationship has not sufficient depth to be maintained during separation . But it also seems that many engagements would have led to marriage if the separation had not occurred . Parental influence is a common factor in breaking engagements . Sometimes its influence is direct , more often indirect , and perhaps most frequently a reinforcement of an attitude shared by the son or daughter . Cultural divergences include those of marked difference in race or nationality , in religion , in economic or social class , and in family background . Too few common interests may be classified here . So also to be included under this head are differences in expectations with reference to having children , to behavior toward each other in engagement , or to plans for reforming the other . A particularly interesting type of cultural conflict described by Cooper may originate when one member of the couple is a person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also as a factor in breaking engagements is the presence of a major personality problem which adversely affects personal ado A manuscript in the files of the Department of Sociology , University of Chicago .  | justments . These personality problems appear to be derived from feelings of insecurity and inferiority with a history that goes back to psychogenic relationships as a child in the family . In fact , they seem to be associated most frequently in cases of a broken engagement with a discordant home environment . Major emotional problems in one or both members of the couple do not necessarily lead to broken engagements if one member supplements the other , supplying strengths to meet the other 's weaknesses , as in a case given by Cooper : A girl who broke an engagement with a man from whom she failed to receive emotional support married a man on whom she can lean heavily . He guides and guards her almost as if she were an infant . He seems to understand and to make allowances for her inability to feel normal emotion . She seems to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she is capable , an inarticulate gratitude . This relationship appears to be completely satisfactory to both . Finally there is the person who might be termed prone to broken engagements from the fact that he seems destined to fall in love with someone with personal or cultural characteristics he does not wish in a married partner . For the person who does not take the initiative , the breaking of the engagement is often a major emotional crisis . First , there is the loss of status in being " jilted , " the problem of facing and perhaps explaining to one 's friends . More emotionally disturbing is the soulsearching of the discarded lover : his feeling of not being wanted , his examination of his own deficiencies . Then in self-defense he may depreciate the personality and the character of the errant loved one , finding defects and flaws where previously he had seen only perfection . These introspective self-questionings , bitter feelings , and expressions of suspicion and revenge which torture the person gradually yield to time . The individual differences in the rate of recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including temperament , the number and importance of other interests , and the beginnings of a new attachment . In retrospect , at least after another engagement which is successful , the person tends to minimize the seriousness of the experience and to be thankful that the break took place . At one time in the United States , engagements , once made , were seldom broken . If broken , suits might be instituted for breach of promise , and damages secured . The aggrieved party could also go to court on the ground of alienation of affections . These legal actions in  | cases of broken engagements are passing out of legal procedure in this country with the recognition that marriage should be based upon love and that an engagement is not a legal contract but a period in which both members of the couple determine their compatibility in temperament , common interests , and ideals . Summary and Research The manifestations of the sentiment of love and the practices of courtship in modern American society are not only different from those of other cultures but are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Among these the most outstanding are : the influence of the automobile in increasing personal mobility and freedom from parental and other forms of social control ; the motion picture , radio , television , and popular magazines with their dissemination of romantic and sophisticated patterns of love-making , courtship , and marriage ; and national advertising with its display and diffusion of standardized and accepted fashions of conduct and appearance with particular stress on those with sex appeal . Dating has become a significant device in mate selection . It greatly enlarges the circle of prospective matrimonial partners ; but , involving no commitment to marriage , it permits young people to determine their compatibility in temperament and their congeniality in interests and values before they decide to keep steady company . Engagement in American society is in transition from a contract enforceable by legal action to an intimate relationship which provides the couple with the opportunity to discover the strength of their affection and their congeniality in temperament , interests , and ideals . Engagement is also ceasing to be a romantic prologue to marriage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation for marriage in keeping with the social changes of the twentieth century . Broken engagements are losing their public stigma . There is a growing recognition that they perform an important function in preventing unhappy marriages . Significant studies of courtship and engagement are in progress . Certain of their findings deal with factors in mate selection which are treated in the next chapter . Other findings indicate the probable fruitfulness of further studies of dating , courtship , and engagement . A Comparative Study of Dating and Rating . Previous reports of findings on dating and rating are from a relatively few institutions . footnote. 1 comparative study involving different types of colleges and uni-  | versities might be made co-operatively . This could be done by securing the assistance of teachers in other institutions in the collection of information according to a uniform schedule . It might be a co-operative venture in which teachers from several institutions would plan and carry out the study together . Differential Courtship Behavior . Studies of dating and keeping company should be made in communities of different sizes , in various regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social class . Differences of dating and courtship practices should be noted for each of these categories . Attention should be given to such factors influencing dating , keeping company , and engagement as sex ratio , mobility , and the effects of the motion picture , radio , television , and popular magazines . A Three-Generation Study of Courtship . An effective method of identifying , comparing , and measuring changes in courtship behavior is by the three-generation technique . Personal documents could be secured from young people , their parents , and their grandparents , by social class and by nationality stock . This would make possible an interpretation of courtship behavior in its relation to the systems of family relations and the community situations of the three periods . Variations by Age Groups . At present there are considerable differences in attitudes and behavior in dating . Significant age periods for study are preadolescence ( confined largely to daydreaming ) , adolescence , youth , early maturity , middle age , and old age . Within these age groups differences in the courtship process should be noted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of broken engagements will throw light upon the relative significance of factors in mate selection , includng propinquity , conception of ideal mate , parental image , and omogamy . Particularly significant for study are cases of multiple roken engagements . A comparison might be made between the reaking of informal understandings and formal engagements .

Very few are inclined to analyze the factors that actually occasion this behavior . When they do , they are likely to attribute it to fate , luck , or Providence . There are , however , determinants for mate selection just as there are for other kinds of human behavior . The Process of Mate Selection Personal documents obtained from young people throw light on some of the factors that enter into the choice of a mate . In the following case the young man was highly conscious of certain influences and somewhat aware of others which determined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a girl who loves the home , the church , the simple things of life ; who likes to be quiet and does n't just " jabber . " She should not be boisterous . She must not enjoy " crude " jokes and stories , but she should enjoy good music , good books , all kinds of games ? both athletic and those in which no physical exertion is required . She should be warm and friendly , not still and reserved . Yet she must have poise . She must love children . She should not be a " career " woman , nor should she be one who does n't know how to work . She should be able to think . She should be able to have fun but should not desire an endless round of movies and dances . It would be preferable if she did not smoke , and she must not drink . She must be honest , fair , patient , and self-controlled . She need not be beautiful , but she must be neat and careful about the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , She should be popular , but not " cheaply " so . She should be well educated . She must have no prejudices , class , racial , religious , or political . I have known girls who fit very well into my " ideal mate " pattern , but they did not reciprocate in their response to me . They considered me a friend , but no more . Often I would examine myself and ask why I could n't have a girl as other fellows did . Girls would be friendly when first introduced .  | Then they would draw up a reserve which meant " you have n't got a chance . " But there were girls who practically " worshiped at my feet , " but even though they might possibly have come up to my standards for the " ideal mate , " they did not rate anything more than my friendship . With the young lady I have learned to know in the last year things are different . To my affection she responds ; to her affection I respond . Little formalities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . If I make a mistake , she understands rather than condemns . Self-consciousness is at a minimum when I 'm with her . I can understand what she means without her having to say a thing directly . She meets up to the ideal standard , but that does n't seem to be too important in comparison with the compatibility of personalities . It seems to me that in her personality there are traits like those of both my parents . In her , too , there is something of me . Of the two parents , she is more like my mother , physically as well as psychologically . She gives me encouragement and understanding . Then , too , our friends give their approval . This builds up a feeling of pride which enters into the process of falling in love . There were causes behind my inability to have " dates " and " girls " in abundance , no doubt . There was something of the monogamous ideal ingrained in me along with the romantic concept that sometime the " one and only " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any other before and after . Certain influences in the process of selecting a mate were clearly recognized by the young man in this case , such as his picture of an ideal mate , proximity , and group approval . He appears to be less conscious of the full effect of such factors as reaction to previous failure in securing response from girls , competition with other young men , and the influence of the resemblance of the girl to his mother . Additional factors were undoubtedly present in the situation of which he was entirely unconscious . Many of the factors in mate selection just mentioned did not and o not operate in other societies where parents are in control of m rriage arrangements . In these cultures the factors influencing the pat nts are considerations of social standing , economic status , and fin ncial return . In the United States , where young people have secur . d almost complete freedom of mate selection , there are still many circumscribing factors , such as sex ratio , circle of acquaintances , and cultural standards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the following heads : ( I ) divergent patterns of arranging marriage , ( z ) the role of intermediaries , and ( 3 ) factors in mate selection .  | Divergent Patterns of Arranging Marriage Before the rise of courtship and when parents still had more or less control over marriage , the patterns of arrangements for the marriage of young people differed widely from culture to culture . Only a few of the many divergent patterns can be presented here . These have been chosen to represent four types of family relationships : ( I ) maternal , ( 2. ) patriarchal , ( 3 ) small-patriarchal , and ( q. ) transitional . Choice of Mates with the Apache . The Apache Indian , with a matrilocal residence , lives in the extended domestic family numbering on the average from twenty to thirty . It is composed of parents , unmarried sons , daughters , husbands and children of the married daughters , granddaughters , and unmarried grandsons . The family group is the one group in Apache society which dictates the reciprocal rights , duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social unit supervises the person 's early training , tests his manhood , determines whom he may or may not marry , and , if he is killed , avenges his death . The choice of a mate is thus described by Opler : 1 In the social dancing it is the girl who takes the initiative . All men who desire to dance stand in one designated place . The girl chooses a partner by tapping one of this group on the shoulder , and the man so selected has no choice but to accept the invitation . In this way the Apache girl is able to indicate her preference for a mate , but she can do little more than hope that her obvious interest will awaken a like sentiment in her favorite . To be sure , her female escort does more than to accompany her to the dance grounds . It is no secret that the guardians of the girl have many pointed hints to make about the sensible choice of a partner . An Apache youth has somewhat more control over the choice of his future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become interested in a girl , he takes the matter up with his parents and their siblings . It is quite necessary to gain their consent , for one of them must act as intercessor for him in obtaining permission from the girl 's family , and the bulk of the presents to be given to the girl 's parents , when the marriage is agreed upon , must come from them . But if the members of his immediate family disapprove of the girl or are unenthusiastic about an alliance with the girl 's family , there is little the young man can do save look for another and more suitable mate .... When the time came to speak , the father or a close relative of the boy would visit the girl 's parents . He took with him the gifts which , in later Adapted from Morris E. Opler , An Analysis of Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache Social Organization , Ph.D . thole , Chicago , University of Chicago Libraries , 1933 , pp. 43-45.  | days , consisted of horses , saddles , and guns . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , I have a boy there who likes your daughter pretty well . I am acting as a messenger , and I want to know if it will suit you to let these two people be united . What is your answer to this offer ? " Then there follows an enumeration of the boy 's good points , a glowing account of the presents which have been brought , and a peroration on the desirability of having the families united . Though the wishes of the young people are not entirely ignored , it can not be overemphasized that marriage among the Apaches is not nearly so much an agreement between individuals as it is a contract between families . Arranging Marriage in Japan . Until recently in the Orient ? China , India , Japan , Korea , and the Philippines ? as in ancient society , arrangement for marriage was even more controlled by the parents than among the Apache Indians . Since the chapter on the Chinese family contains a description of courtship in that country , japan has been selected for the description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In both the upper and the lower social classes of Japan , parents emphasize practical considerations ? social status and economic standing ? and , on the whole , ignore sentiment and the personal preferences of the children . How completely the individual may accept marriage as a family affair rather than as a personal matter is portrayed in A Daughter of the Samurai , the autobiography of a Japanese girl who was betrothed at thirteen . This is her account of the event:l There was a meeting of the family council , the largest that had been held since Father 's death . Two gray-haired uncles were there with the aunts , besides two other aunts , and a young uncle who had come all the way from Tokyo on purpose for this meeting . They had been in the room a long time , and I was busy writing at my desk when I heard a soft " Allow me to speak ! " behind me , and there was Toshi at the door , looking rather excited . " Little Mistress , " she said , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the room where the guests are . " I entered the big room . Tea had been served and all had cups before them or in their hands . As I pushed back the door they looked up and gazed at me as if they had never seen me before . I made a low , ceremonious bow . Mother motioned to me , and I slipped over beside her on the mat . " Etsu-ko , " Mother said very gently , " the gods have been kind to you , footnote1 From : A Daughter of the Samurai by Etsu I. Sugimoto . Copyright 197.8 by Doubleday &; Company , Inc. , New York , pp. 87-89.  | and your destiny as a bride has been decided . Your honorable brother and your venerable kindred have given much thought to your future . It is proper that you should express your gratitude to the Honorable All . " I made a long , low bow , touching my forehead to the floor . Then I went out and returned to my desk and my writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " I did not think of my engagement as a personal matter at all . It was a family affair . In this case the personal preferences of the young people were not consulted . In the Japanese village of Suye Mura , studied by Embree and inhabited by 1663 people , marriage was also arranged by the parents , but not until after the boy and girl had had a preliminary meeting supposed to take place by sheer chance and to have no significance . ' The point may be made that marriages in japan turn out unhappily as indicated by the divorce rate ? at one time highest in the world . This , however , can hardly be attributed to the parental arrangement of marriages . In all other countries of the Orient with the same type of marriage arrangement , divorces are relatively infrequent . The explanation then for this high divorce rate in japan is peculiar to the culture of that country . Matchmaking with the Irish Rural Family . A description has been given of the Irish system of transferring a farm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter 's marriage and under an arrangement whereby the girl 's father turns over a " fortune " to the boy 's father equivalent to the value of the land . Naturally the fathers take a keen interest in the transaction . In fact the couple may not be introduced until the financial negotiations have been practically completed . The marriage itself does not take place until the papers have been drawn up and signed:3 A match usually begins when a farmer casts round for a suitable wife for one of his sons . The son to be married is to inherit the farm . The farmer has full power to choose among his sons . When a young man is on the lookout for a young lady it is put through his friends for to get a suitable woman for him for his wife . It all goes by friendship and friends and meeting at public houses . Getting married is no carefree , personal matter ; one 's whole kindred help , even to suggesting candidates . footnote1 John F. Embree , Suye Mura , A Japanese Village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PP. 2-03-4 , 2-13-14 . ' See pp. 58-59. 8 From Conrad M. Arensberg , The Irish Countryman .

The sharp break from marriage arrangements by parents to choice of mates by young people is illustrated by immigrant groups in this country a generation ago . One particularly interesting situation was that of the daughter of the Italian immigrant family . At an earlier period e might have quit school at fifteen or sixteen , relying confidently u on her father to find her a husband , often much older , and with a g od job . Although Italian sons were allowed to run the streets at n , ght , daughters must be home by nine and properly chaperoned at social affairs . As this Old World pattern disintegrated , Italian girls felt impelled to seek husbands for themselves . This transition from small-patriarchal control of mate selection to opportunistic practices on the part of the Italian girls is described in Greenwich Village : ' The inability of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men by hook or crook . Various places at which dances footnote'Caroline F. Ware , Greenwich Village , 1920-7930 , Boston , Houghton Mifflin Company , 1935 , PP. 405-6.  |  were held were rated according to the kind of crowd ? i.e. , the chances that one might have of finding a good match . In the summertime , beaches and uptown swimming pools were attractive for the same reason . One girl , who thought herself very superior to the neighborhood , gave the situation away in discussing the Sunday excursions which she and her girl friend made to a certain lake in the country . It was a long , hard trip , but they went there rather than to nearer places ? " And you do n't think we go there just for the swimming , do you ? That 's the place where you meet swell men , " and she launched into an account of the Packard car driven by the ones they had picked up the week before . Out of a sample of twenty-two young married Italian women in 1930 , only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that she married , while six more had been out with other men in groups but not alone . Seventeen , however , had gone out with their future husbands before they were engaged . Seven had met their husbands through their families ; six had picked them up on the street , at a beach , or public dance ; three had been neighbors ; two had met at work ; three had met through friends ; and one at a settlement . Seventeen went to the movies , the park , bus riding , or walking with their fiances . Only four reported associating with them at home or at a friend 's home , while one had no association before marriage . These four cases of divergent patterns of arrangements for marriage ? maternal , patriarchal , small-patriarchal , and transitional ? have one element in common ; namely , the almost complete absence of love and of courtship behavior before marriage . There was in these and other societies little or no thought of love as a prerequisite to marriage , which is regarded as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Role of Intermediaries With the decline of parental controls over courtship and marriage two questions arise : ( I ) in what ways do parents still influence the selection of marriage partners for their children , and ( z ) how do other intermediaries function in the courtship process ? Parental Role . At present in the United States every kind of parental role in the selection of a mate may be found . In a country with many heterogeneous cultural groups and in a time of transition , a wide range of divergent behavior is to be expected . But here our attention is not upon the variations but upon the main trends and the emerging general pattern . The most powerful parental influence upon mate selection is largely unconscious : first , by means of family expectations in terms of its culture , class , and conceptions of qualities desirable in a person ;  | and second , through psychogenic interaction in the family which creates the response pattern the young adult typically seeks to perpetuate in a love affair and in marriage . ' This basic role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this chapter under the headings " Ideal Mate " and " Parental Image . " The more overt influence of the parents in mate selection appears to be exerted in the following ways : ( 1 ) by control of the social contacts of young people , ( 2 ) by attempting to break up a disapproved match , and ( 3 ) by the desire of young people to select a mate who will meet with the approval of the family . Particularly in the upper classes and to a considerable extent in the upper-middle class , parents influence to a marked degree the social contacts of their children . This occurs in many different ways : entering their sons and daughters , even when very young , in a select dancing school ; sending them to private schools ; providing them with the social privileges of the country club from which nonmembers and their children are excluded ; arranging social affairs ; establishing organizations such as the junior League for debutantes ; sending their children to colleges from which father or mother graduated or to other institutions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these and other ways parents create situations and build up expectations of marrying within one 's social class or higher . That young people tend to accept these standards as their own is shown by the way in which dating is controlled by pressure of their own age group , particularly when the personal preference of the individual tends to diverge from sanctioned patterns . n the basis of schedules and interviews from 136 young married cou les and of personal documents from unmarried college students , Bat s2 analyzed the indirect and direct roles of parents in courtship . Par ntal influence upon sons was exerted by fathers in 49.1 per cent and by mothers in 79.4 per cent of the cases . Of the women 68.7 per cent reported paternal and 97.1 per cent maternal influence of greater or less degree . The direct participation of parents in the courtship of their children was given as moderate by the majority of cases , rather than weak or extreme . Parents who seek to disrupt a disapproved love affair employ different methods . There is the direct attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthens the determination of many young footnote1 Ernest W.

The indirect and masked approach is generally more effective . Where a daughter seems to be developing an attachment to a young man of a lower class , or with " undesirable " characteristics , the parents may arrange a trip or a visit , or send her away to school , counting upon a new environment to provide new associations and comparisons to bring about a shift in the affections . In the case of a son infatuated with a pretty and charming but uncultured girl , one upper-middle-class mother handled the situation by inviting his fiancee for a visit .

The Closed Primary Group . With young people , even in cities , the primary group is an important factor in facilitating courtship and in accelerating engagement and marriage . Many so-called voluntary associations composed of young unmarried people have as their principal function , though not their formal stated purpose , provision for association of the sexes . These include young people 's societies in churches , organizations for civic and welfare objectives , recreational clubs , and many other voluntary associations . When groups have either an exclusive membership or are otherwise isolated from outside social contacts , they may be designated as closed groups . If these are also primary groups they provide a situation unusually favorable for promoting friendship , courtship , engagement , and marriage . They exert strong social pressure for their members not only to pair but to go steady with each other . The closed group also presents a favorable situation for the study of the factors which determine mate selection ; for example , the extent to which status in the group predominates over personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , as already pointed out , ' secondary contacts tend to predominate over primary associations . The trend for decades has been away from neighborhood to city-wide recreation for youth . The hundreds of neighborhood store-front movies have been superseded by a relatively few magnificent motion-picture auditoriums . The multitude of small dance halls " around the corner " have given way to huge dancing palaces drawing patrons from everywhere in the city . Young people follow the crowd for fun , adventure , Chapter 4 , " The Urban Family . "  | and romance . Commercial recreation becomes a center for contacts and associations that may lead into matrimony . An indication of the role now played by secondary contacts in initiating courtship are the findings of studies of the way in which married persons first met each other . Terman1 found that slightly less than one half of his couples had met as a result of such exclusively primary association as neighborhood acquaintance , home of friend , church , or social organization .

Locke 's study of Predicting Adjustment in Marriage : A Comparison of a Divorced and a Happily Married Group , 1951 . Neglecting the minor variations between the happily married and the divorced , it is apparent that the places in which these people met their mates were radically different from what they would have been a generation ago when most of them would have been living in a rural area . While church and home of a relative ranked first and second , only about a third of the persons checked these two . Neighborhood acquaintance ranked below school , home of a friend , a footnote1 Lewis M.

Pickup , dance hall , and travel were minor places of contact for persons of this study . The so-called " blind " date is an interesting combination of primary and secondary contacts . It could not exist in the old-time village , where everyone knew everyone else . It arises under urban conditions , where those one does not know greatly exceed one 's acquaintances and friends . It retains , however , an essential aspect of primary relations , since the two persons are introduced by a mutual friend . It serves a useful function in enlarging the radius of selection of a future mate . Lonely-Heart Introduction Clubs .

Third , there is an unbalanced sex ratio , as illustrated by a surplus of women in urban areas and a surplus of men in rural areas . Fourth , there is an actual surplus of men without wives in the age group 2.0 ? 34 and a surplus of women without husbands in the age group 35 ? 64 .

' According to Miles , clubs are of four types : ( i ) the correspondence club , generally national in scope , with introductions by mail ; ( z ) the personal-contact club , predominantly local and in a metropolitan center , with introductions by telephone or by a third person in a club , a hotel lobby , or a private home ; ( 3 ) the social club , usually local and in a metropolitan center , with contacts through parties , dances , card games , and other activities through which people can meet informally ; and ( q ) the combination type of club , either local or national , with introductions both by mail and in person , and possibly through club rooms and social activities for clients . While there are approximately Soo active introduction clubs of all four types , not more than zoo enroll as many as zoo new members per month .

First , the resistances of prospective clients must be overcome . Second , there is the unfavorable opinion and publicity regarding introduction clubs . Third , advertising media are severely restricted , making it ifficulr ro get an adequate membership , and some media that are available charge more for club than other advertising . Finally , there are the inherent difficulties involved in the mechanics of operating the club profitably , such as an unbalanced sex ratio , disparity in ages of the two sexes , unrealistic demands of clients , and high operating costs involved in the great amount of detail necessary for the operation of the successful club . Consequently , the length of life of the average club is very short . In certain areas three out of four clubs established fail within the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve Odell , Love is More than Luck : An Experiment in Scientific Matchmaking , New York , Wilfred Funk , Inc. , 1957.  | A reading of the form letters addressed to prospective patrons reveals five types of resistances to be overcome . First , there is the understandable reluctance of the potential client to substitute an impersonal approach by correspondence for the introduction in person by a mutual friend . Second , there is prejudice against patronizing a commercialized enterprise dealing in the intangible affairs of the heart . Third , there is often a prejudice against the type of person who would solicit the help of an introduction service ? implying an inadequacy or a social handicap . Fourth , there is doubt of the honesty and integrity of both club operators and their members , and suspicion of ulterior motives . Finally , there is scepticism about the probabilities of success in such a venture . The promotion literature of the club must be worded to meet these and other objections .

The following excerpts from letters sent to Personal Acquaintance Service , Inc. would be effective in promotional literature : Please cancel my membership . I have met the person whom I have looked for all my life . I am pretty particular . Education , poise , and deep understanding and love are not found easily . I want to thank you for the happiness you have helped bring into my life . Through your club I met D. M. of . He is my ideal in every way .

I am giving you the name and address of my pal , who has seen what a wonderful girl I have found because of your work , and he wants to join , also . Figure 14 shows the geographical distribution of the clients of Miles 's Personal Acquaintance Service , Inc. as of August 1 , 1952 . The active membership is more than 8o per cent urban , as compared with the urban population of 64. o per cent for the United States . figure The general pattern is for each club to attract a greater proportion of members from its own state and region than from any other state or region .  | There are about twice as many men as women members of introduction clubs . Miles reports this is the main problem of his and other clubs : The membership sex ratio has quite consistently been 2. men to r woman , and three times as many men as women have inquired about the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the nation shows the same sex ratio . By giving the women reduced rates and other incentives , a greater percentage of women asking for information has joined , reducing the ratio from 3 to i for inquiries to z to a for members . Women club operators enroll a larger per cent of men than do male operators . The sex ratio of men to women varies with age . For the age group 18 ? 34 the ratio is 32 or 4 to 1 ; for the group 35 ? 44 the ratio is about 22 to 1 ; for those 45 ? 55 the ratio is 1 to 1 ; and for those over 55 there are more women than men , reaching about 2. women to i man in the group of 6o years and over . The cheaply run club attracts persons of lower income , educational , and cultural level , many of whom are handicapped in various ways . The more expensive and better-run club , such as that of Miles , attracts middle- and upper-middle-class persons . Miles reports that 13.2. per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent have had one to three years of college , 46.4 per cent have had one or more years of high school , 11.1 per cent have had an eighth-grade education or less , and 3.2. per cent did not report their education . ' He indicates that the reported median income of men , including military personnel and students , is $300 a month . The per cents in reported occupations for men are as follows : professional , 9.4 ; business owners , executives , and managers , 6.7 ; farmers , 8.1 ; skilled trades , 2.1. z ; semiskilled workers , 11.4 ; unskilled workers , 6.7 ; sales and promotion , 4.3 ; office workers , 5.9 ; military personnel , 10.5 ; students , 1.8 ; and miscellaneous , 13.0 . Women who join lonely-hearts clubs are much older than men . Miles reports that the average age of his men was 38 , with a range from 18 to 78 ; for women , 47 , with a range from 18 to 84 .

Miles , through questionnaires , letters , and interviews , found little exploitation resulting from contacts in his club : Members are screened to some extent , and the ethical club operator educates the client to be wary of possible exploitation and to avoid it . Every member of Personal Acquaintance Service , Inc. , upon joining , has received a small book , Love Is More Than Luck . This book provides rudimentary education on mate selection , gives rules regarding character investigations , and other information . The procedure of matching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed by Miles , is described as follows : Each member , upon joining , fills out a two-page application blank . One page is a personality , or attitude , questionnaire , consisting of 5o questions , which are scored for five specific personality traits of importance in mate selection . Another full page of data on social and cultural characteristics of the person is secured . Each client is given a score of o to 9 points for each of the five personality traits , and a cultural index score from the background data , also ranging from o to 9 . A Remington card is punched for each client , giving information on 35 personality and cultural characteristics , including the index scores . The general principle of homogamy ? like marries like ? is followed in the introductions . Each person is introduced only to other members in his own age group ( io-year maximum differential ) and on his own cultural and educational level . In addition , introductions are selected as closely as possible on the basis of personality traits and preferences , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marital status , attitude toward children , and so on . In matching two persons for an introduction , the electric card-sorting equipment will select for any of 35 characteristics . For example , if a 35-yearold engineer wishes to meet women between the ages of 30 and 37 , who are Catholics , with college education , living in California , under 5 ' 6 " tall , who are not divorced , who have musical and artistic interests , and who are compatible with him on the basis of the five personality traits measured , the machine will sort out all women in the active membership meeting these specifications in approximately 15 minutes . In England and in other European countries there are available more reputable channels of advertising for a matrimonial partner than in the United States . For years one of the evening papers of Berlin had an advertising column devoted to this purpose . Folsom  | calls attention to a long-established British publication which has specialized as a marriage intermediary:1 Since 186o there has been published in London The Matrimonial Post and Fashionable Marriage Advertiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widowers , spinsters , and widows frankly advertise under code numbers their personal characteristics and desires for mates . For example : " Adventurous young woman , left-wing opinions , modern outlook , especially interested in problems of postwar reconstruction , wishes to meet a bachelor with the same outlook and keen to work for joint ideals . " Japan has substituted a somewhat unique introduction service for the traditional pattern of matchmaking.2 It is a government-operated introduction club located in one of the leading department stores of Tokyo . A former student of one of the authors is one of the government experts of this club . A person desiring a mate goes to the bureau , provides a photograph , statistics of sex , age , occupation , and other information about himself , and gives the qualifications of the desired mate to government experts who select possible mates from the files . Girls must have parental consent . The most eligible ages are 17 ? 35 for men , and 10 ? 15 for women . Applicants total more than i000 per month . Marriages are solemnized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marriage Brokers . When Jewish marriages were arranged by parents in the Old World , the shadchan , the matchmaker , was an important functionary . Under changing conditions in the United States , the shadchan has become a marriage broker , arranging marriages for girls and older women who have difficulties in finding husbands . The marriage brokers , including a few Gentiles , are organized in The Marriage Brokers Association of the United States . The Association has a minimum charge of $15.00 and io per cent of the dowry for the service , and investigates the two parties . The compensation of the marriage broker ranges from $ioo to $5oo , according to the size of the dowry . It is significant that the charge of the marriage broker is paid by the girl or her parents rather than by the man . Noncommercial Introduction Projects . In contrast with the commercialized service of lonely-heart introduction clubs and marriage brokers , a few experiments are being made in " introduction " projects . These have the same objectives of introducing persons of the opposite footnote ' Joseph K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family Living , 7 , 1945 , P. 15 . Lei Awls : rims , January 17 , 1946.  | sex , particularly those who have difficulty in making social contacts . Common elements of these projects are registration of the clients , listing of their characteristics , and the attempt to introduce those who may be congenial . Such a project was developed in 1938 in New York City by Joseph Clawson and was called " Introductions by Clawson . " ' His service of matching couples for congeniality and compatibility depended very largely on the findings of a battery of personality tests . The group which participated was of a high educational level , the majority of the men being college graduates , and the majority of the women having at least two years of college . The project was successful in demonstrating its values for the few who availed themselves of the service , but it was a failure financially . A somewhat similar service was established on a self-supporting basis in Newark , New jersey , with the name of " Introduction : A Service of Sociability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable men and women of similar interests to meet each other in a simple and dignified manner ; and , second , to introduce them to ocial organizations in the community . It was recognized as a cornunity agency and had an advisory board composed of leading . ewark citizens and of specialists in the field of marriage and the family from colleges in New Jersey and New York . Another project was the Date Bureau organized in 1943 by the Associated Women Students of the University of Washington . Its original purpose was to afford a means of social introductions between campus coeds and navy and army trainees . Its closing after the war is explained by Hayner of the University of Washington as follows:2 The really basic factor in accounting for the passing of this institution was the change in the sex ratio . During the war there were more girls available than boys . After the war , and I believe that 1945 was the last year that the Date Bureau operated , the men returned and their number again predominated over the number of women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had only been used by those who otherwise would have had trouble in getting dates . With the increase in the number of men the traditional methods for arranging dates returned . It is interesting to note that in the three different methods which have been examined ? lonely-heart correspondence bureaus , marriage footnote1 Joseph K. Folsom , The Family and Democratic Society , New York , John Wiley &; Sons , 1943 , PP. 541-43. 2 Letter of December 5 , 1951.  | brokers , and introduction projects ? a third party introduces the couple . The first two agencies , on the whole , tend to emphasize traits like beauty and money , which have romantic and commercial appeal . Introduction projects , by contrast , stress personal and cultural characteristics , selected with one or two exceptions on the basis of common-sense observations of factors governing the preferences of young people . /Factors in Mate Selection Most popular of the current theories of mate selection is the romantic doctrine of the affinity , or of the " soul mate . " This notion implies that of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other and will find supreme happiness in their union . Another widespread idea is that of a Providence which has decreed the marriage for a purpose , perhaps inscrutable to the spouses . Other explanations are that fate determines the outcome , or that chance results in good or bad luck in mating . These popular and unscientific explanations of mate selection help us understand why many people are averse to finding in science an explanation of why people fall in love . Yet love and marriage are behavior and , like all behavior , are subject to observation and study . Studies of mate selection which have been made or are in progress suggest five factors as chiefly determining " who marries whom . " These are ( I ) propinquity ; ( 2 ) conception of the ideal mate ; ( 3 ) parental image ; ( 4 ) personality needs ; and ( S ) homogamy , or the tendency of " like to marry like . " Propinquity . The theory of propinquity assumes that persons tend to marry those who live near them , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and those with whom they work . Stated in this way the theory merely affirms what is obvious : that marriage takes place between those who have an opportunity to meet each other . Therefore propinquity is only a circumscribing factor in the choice of mates ; it is not , or is only in rare exceptions , a specific factor determining the individual person with whom one will fall in love . Propinquity is a specific factor in mate selection only in the situation of isolation , such as where two Americans meet in an alien culture , or two timid souls are thrown together by circumstances . Although propinquity is , therefore , least important of the five factors influencing mate selection , it is the one next to homogamy on which most research has been conducted . The chief findings of the research studies indicate that there is. a  | positive association between residential propinquity and marriage selection . In a study of S000 consecutive marriage licenses of Philadelphia residents , Bossardl discovered that half of the couples ( 51.9 per cent ) lived within twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent ) resided at the same address . In a study made in 1931 in New Haven , Connecticut , Davie and Reeves , ' using methods similar to those of Bossard , found only 6.4 per cent living at the same address before marriage , but that practically the same proportion as Philadelphia ( 51.3 per cent ) resided within twenty blocks of each other . In a later study of residential propinquity in New Haven in 1940 , Kennedy3 discovered a slight increase in marriages of persons living at the same address , and a considerable increase ( 18.4 per cent ) of those living within twenty blocks of each other , considering only those cases where both parties lived in New Haven . She concludes " that in a vast majority of cases marriage is an in-group affair ; that is , the two contracting parties tend to be of the same race , nationality , religion , and socioeconomic status . Ellsworth , ' in his study of propinquity in the small town of Simsbury , Connecticut , found that " the possibility of marriage between persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them increases but tends J to increase with the number of persons available at given distances . " Studies of three rural counties indicate the predominance of propinquity in mate selection . Of the couples applying for marriage licenses in a Michigan county in 192.7 ? 1937 , 46 per cent gave the same post-office address and 12 per cent different addresses but within the county . ' For Scott and Carver counties in Minnesota the per cents reporting identical post-office addresses in 1919 ? 1939 were respectively 41 and 36 ; and different addresses but in the same county , 24 and 23 . In the latter two counties only 13 and 5 per cent were couples of whom one resided more than fifty miles from the county of residence of the other . ' In the three cases , 58 to 65 per cent of the couples lived in the same county . footnote1 James H. S.

He reported that the degree of propinquity between the residences of prospective mates was about the same at the time of the first date , at the time of engagement , and at the time of applying for the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably is that it is an index of spatial segregation of the population according to cultural characteristics . Marvin , ' studying 49,107 marriages in Philadelphia where the occupation of the bride was given , found that the actual tendency for marriages to take place within a given occupational group was greater than chance expectation . For all occupations the cases of like occupations marrying like was 1.8 times the expected for native Americans , 1. o times greater than chance for the foreign born , and 1.5 times random mating for the mixed group . Intramarriage ran much higher for certain occupations : textiles , 9.3 times chance ; printing , 8.4 ; provisions , 8.3 ; domestic , 7.2 for the native Americans . Marvin assumes that these findings measure the effect of occupational propinquity upon marriage selection . But this is evidently erroneous . The fact that two persons in the same occupation marry does not mean that they met at their place of work . That may or may not be the case . If they first met at work , occupational propinquity would enter as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same occupation met elsewhere than while working , but were drawn together for different reasons , one of which would be a common interest in the same occupation . Consequently , the conclusion is that while residential and occupational propinquity are favorable to meeting , it is a mistake to assume that an identical or a close address or the same occupation is prima facie evidence that propinquity is a positive factor in mate selection . It is only a circumscribing and generally a passive factor . Ideal Mate . The " ideal mate " is the term used to indicate the image which the adolescent or youth constructs of the characteristics of the person he would like to marry . Nearly every young person from his high-school days , or earlier , cherishes in his imagination a picture , sometimes very clear and definite , of his " dream girl " or " dream boy . " This romantic portrait may vividly depict the physical features and appearance of the imagined future mate and delineate desired mental , temperamental , moral , and social characteristics . Alfred C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propinquity as a Factor in Mate Selection , " American Sociological Review , 17 , 1951 , pp. 17-11. footnote ' Donald M. Marvin , " Occupational Propinquity as a Factor in Marriage Selection , " Journal of she Ammon Statistical Association , 16 , 1918-19 , pp. 131-50.  | On the other hand , some persons are not conscious of an ideal mate , but they do employ similar criteria of mate selection , at least in the negative sense of excluding from consideration individuals of a different race , nationality , religion , socioeconomic status , or educational level . In a study of 173 men and zoo women who were engaged , or married less than one year , Strauss ' found that the conception of an ideal mate had eliminated from consideration as married partners individuals with specified characteristics . The respective per cent for men and women were : different race , 49.7 , 65.5 ; different faith , 41.6 , 41.5 ; different educational status , 33.5 , 40.5 ; different social background , z8.1 , 34. o ; physical defect , 17.1 , 16.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; different economic status , 13.1 , 10.5 ; not handsome or good looking , 11.9 , 13.5 ; nonprofessional occupation , 9.8 , 16.5 ; not native American , 11.6 , 15. o . There are some interesting differences by sex in this group of cases . Men seem to pay more attention to the personal beauty of the mate , while women are more conscious of differences in race , education , and social background . Probably these reports represent a minimum of the influence of the ideal-mate conception as an eliminating factor in mate selection . Undoubtedly it functions in this manner more than is consciously realized . The figures do not perhaps indicate the relative degree of strength of the above factors as negative influences in the choice of marriage partners . Case studies indicate that the conception of the ideal mate operates as a more or less conscious instrument in the initial stages of mate selection . In only a minority of cases , and chiefly those of a romantic type , does the person fall in love with and marry his dream mate . Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of more importance in the choice of a life partner , as in the following case : 2 What was my ideal ? Oh , somebody tall , dark , and handsome . With a little mustache and a clipped British accent , and who wore tweeds . Somebody who shared all my religious , philosophical , and political beliefs , and was very serious about the future and the destiny of the world . We were going to go out and conquer everything together . Wait till you hear about Dick , though ? he 's short and blond with a Southern drawl ( she laughs ) . I thought it was going to be one of those soul-mate businesses , that there would be an immediate attraction and a deep understanding of what was hidden inside . Oh , and another thing ? he had to have a social conscience footnotet Anselm Strauss , A Stay of Three Psychological Factors Affecting Choice of Mate , Ph.D . thesis , Chicago , University of Chicago Libraries , 1945. 2 Ibid.  | and be willing to go out and tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I can see . We 've never been soul mates . When we 're together all we think of is each other and we never get around to religion or philosophy or anything like that . This case of disparity between the boy of her dreams and of actuality is exceptional . The great majority of both men and women report , according to Strauss , that the ideal and real mates are " identical , " " very close , " or " close " both in physical and in personality characteristics . The study uncovered the significant fact that when subjects compared the mate finally selected with the one they liked next best , there was practically no difference between them in approximation to the ideal on physical traits , but large differences in personality characteristics in favor of the preferred marriage partner . This difference seems to indicate that physical appearance is an initial selective factor within which , however , selective discrimination takes place on the basis of the desired personality traits . Parental Image . The hypothesis of the role of the parental image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fall in love with a person similar to his or her parent of the opposite sex . A more detailed statement of this theory is as follows : In early childhood a person normally develops a strong affectional relationship with one or more persons in the family circle . In general it is directed in the case of the boy to his mother , or of the girl to her father . Sometimes this fixation may be reversed so that the major affectional response of the boy is to his father and of the girl to her mother . Occasionally the boy or girl feels a strong affectional attachment to a sister or brother . Often the love reaction is not focused on one member of the family , but with the boy it extends to his mother and a sister and with the girl to her father and brother . Or it may in either case include both mother and father . Whatever , then , the actual constellation of response relationships in the family , the adult attempts to continue this pattern or to reproduce it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Case histories secured by interviewing couples both before and after marriage seem to substantiate but not to prove conclusively the above hypothesis . The boy appears to fall in love with a girl who possesses the temperamental and other personality traits of his mother , or who sustains toward him the type of relation which exists between him and his mother . His mother may have been his confidante or may always have given him understanding and sympathy .  | Accordingly , he selects a girl with traits like those of his mother or with whom he can develop much the same sort of affectional bond . Where his relation with his mother as a child was not satisfying , the man may seek a girl with characteristics quite different from his mother but establish with her the kind of relation which he desired as a child . Or if the relation to his father or sister nearest in age was meaningful to him in childhood , he may attempt to reinstate this type of response pattern in marriage . The theory of the parental image would help to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious and prudential influences but by motivations typically below the conscious level . In the following case the girl points out in the interview the resemblances in physique and personality between her father and her fiance : 1 7 My dad and Tom have the same coloring as far as skin , hair , and eyes are c cerned . Similar build , except Tom is a little taller . Tom is n't as good look ng as my dad , but that 's of no consequence . They have very much the same personality and temperament . Both are u erstanding ? kind ? nice to be with . The same hands ? they 're both v ry good looking . They have the same interest in sports and current events . I think the same love of home . Both are excellent automobile drivers . That in itself is more than it seems ? I have confidence with Tom at the wheel ; no matter where we 're going I do n't worry . In general , Strauss did not find that physical resemblance to parents played much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negatively . Similarity of mate to father and to mother in temperamental and ideational characteristics was much more important . The sex of the parent , however , in relation to these traits seemed not to be important in the selection by the son or daughter of a marriage partner . Therefore until there is further evidence it seems more appropriate to speak of the parent image rather than of the father and mother images as a factor in mate selection . Personality Needs . The personality needs of the individual constitute another important factor to be considered in the analysis of mate selection . The hypothesis is that because of certain experiences and situations human beings develop specific personality needs that are best satisfied by intimate association in marriage and family life . footnote1 Ibid.  | Many , but not all , of these center about the wish for response , including the desires for emotional security and intimate appreciation which contain elements , respectively , of the wishes for security and recognition . One process in mate selection is the matching of persons who are complementary in satisfying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in love is the realization by couples ( that they are emotionally interdependent . The need of individuals for sympathy , encouragement , and understanding differs widely . The numerous concrete forms in which engaged and married couples are aware of their personality needs may be indicated by statements from the men and women in a study by Strauss . ' The per cents of men and women expressing various needs which they would like to have satisfied in marriage are given in Table 9 . The figure need for love and a person to confide in ranked highest , and the need ? " to make me feel I counted for something " and for relief from loneliness ranked lowest . In general the sex differences in these responses were not great ; so far as they existed , there was a tendency for women to demand more than men of love , display of affection , confidence , and protection .  | Functioning of Ideal Mate , Parent Image , and Personality Needs . These three factors obviously work in combination in mate selection . The conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciously in narrowing the range of choice . The parent image tends to select a mate who will continue the type of response relation to which the person has become accustomed from early childhood in the interpersonal relations of the family environment . Finally , in association in courtship and engagement the couple finds out to what extent and degree the personality needs of each are fulfilled in the developing relation . To a great extent the conception of the ideal mate , the parent image , and the personality needs of the individual are all products of the common process of the interaction of the person with his family . The co , nception of an ideal mate is in large part derived from the family , Pven if later influenced by his youth group and by the complex of other factors outside the family , shaping his standards of a life parr er . The parent image specifically influences the formation of the cr nception of one 's ideal mate . The personality needs of the person ' derive in large part from the satisfactions received and withheld in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a considerable extent to goals outside the family . Homogamy . Which tendency is stronger in mate selection : for " like to be drawn to like " or for " opposites to attract each other " ? , The first is known as " homogamy " or assortative mating , and the second as " heterogamy . " The common ending of these two words comes from the Greek word for marriage , and their different beginnings signify in the same language " like " and " unlike " respectively . In all probability couples are attracted to each other both by likenesses and by differences . The question then is not if like or unlike choose one another , but which tendency is the more prevailing and what are the determining factors in this outcome . Approximately one hundred studies have been made of assortative mating . Until recently these studies were concerned with married couples . They dealt with characteristics such as age , stature , health , intelligence , temperament , attitudes , and values . In every case , with the exception of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference over chance expectation was in the direction of homogamy rather than of heterogamy . These studies were all open to the objection that the findings on homogamy , especially for psychological traits , might be the result of marriage rather than the cause of it .  | Data on homogamy prior to marriage are now available . In one study , that of Burgess and Wallin , findings on physical , psychological , and social characteristics substantiate the conclusions of the previous studies of married couples . These findings , based on data on i000 couples during engagement and then the restudy of the couples after marriage , strengthen the case for the theory of homogamy over that of heterogamy . The research on both engaged and married couples up to the present shows no characteristics ? physical , psychological , or social ? with a greater than chance tendency for heterogamy . For some characteristics a far greater than chance proportion of homogamous unions is found . This is strikingly the case for age , race , and religious affiliation . Persons in general marry others of about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants , and Jews with Jews . The ratio of actual homogamy to that expected by chance is not as great for other characteristics . Yet in general there is a tendency for people to intermarry at the same educational level , within the same social-economic class , with those of the same nationality , with the same leisure-time interests , and with the same drinking and smoking habits . ' The actual factors determining assortative mating have not been studied . Certain ones , however , have been suggested as possible explanations : ( I ) propinquity , since residential segregation may bring together persons who are like rather than unlike each other ; ( 2 ) group membership , such as in church and other voluntary associations , which select persons of common culture , interests , and values ; ( 3 ) social disapproval of marriage outside the in-group , with persons of different race , religion , nationality , and social class ; ( 4 ) the conception of the ideal mate as tending to exclude persons who are much different from one 's self , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to fall in love with a person whose psychological characteristics are those of one 's parents ( on the assumption that since the child is like the parent , marrying a person like his parent will make for homogamy ) ; and ( 6 ) that homogamy actually determines assortative mating ; i.e. , there exists a tendency of a person to fall in love with and marry another like himself . If all or some of these factors operate to determine assortative mating , it is understandable why the tendency for like to mate with like is greater than for opposites to attract each other . footnotet Ernest W. Burgess and Paul Wallin , " Homogamy in Social Characteristics , " American Journal of Sarolod.7. 49. 1943 . PP. 109 24.  | Summary and Research In mate selection the two poles of an ideal construction would be ( I ) a situation where arrangements for marriage are completely in the control of parents and ( z ) one where they are entirely in the hands of the young people . The closest approximation to absolute power in the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional pattern of Japan , where the daughter did not even ask the name of the young man to whom she was betrothed . Theoretically , courtship in the United States has exemplified the other logical extreme of choice of mates by young people . The materials in this chapter show that while the immEdiate and direct role of parents is greatly diminished in mate select on , their indirect and unconscious influence is vastly increased . Ccjluurtship in the present generation of young people has tended to replace parental standards by those of the youth group and to eNfend the circle of selection by the institution of dating . Increasingly young people now make their choices on the basis of a companionship formed by mutual experiences , compatibility of temperament , personality needs , and common interests and ideals . Mate selection when arranged by parents stressed social and economic considerations and minimized or entirely ignored the sentiment of love and the interpersonal relations of the young people . After the transition from parental control of marriage to the freedom of young people to select their mates , choices at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pairing arrangements , and conformity to parental standards . The enlargement of the circle of potential mates also brings into greater play the operation of more or less unconscious factors , such as the parental image and homogamy . In our secondary society many young people have difficulty in finding mates , especially since parental assistance is no longer available or desired . The result is a great restriction of opportunity for " desirable " contacts with the opposite sex . The range of contact may be so limited that unions of incompatible persons take place . Commercial enterprises called " lonely-heart clubs " have exploited this situation . These services have undoubtedly resulted in many marriages . But , since the acquaintance of the couples was largely limited to correspondence , the chances of mismating are increased , especially since the spouse may turn out to be widely different from representations in the exchange of letters . The significance of the " introduction projects " inheres in their  | attempt to secure a rational mating of couples , at least on the basis of cultural characteristics . The development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing findings on the social and psychological factors which make for success in marriage . These will be considered in the next two chapters . They not only add to our knowledge of personality adjustment in marriage but provide data which can be applied practically by such organizations as introduction projects and date bureaus . Primary Group Controls . The direct and immediate control of the parents and friends over mate selection has greatly diminished in the United States . Yet their indirect and subtle influence still remains . There is the opportunity and the need for systematic research by case-study and questionnaire methods of the control still exerted by parents , and also by the intimate social group of which the young people are members . Differences by social class should also be investigated on the hypothesis that overt and covert influences vary directly with higher class membership . Personality Factors in Mate Selection . Strauss has made a pioneer study of the respective roles of the ideal mate , of the parental image , and of personality need in the choice of a marriage partner . His investigation paves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other factors in mate selection . Homogamy and Heterogamy . Approximately one hundred studies have already been made of the effects of similarity and dissimilarity in selective mating . But these have been incidental to other research and not directly focused on crucial problems . Almost always they have had married rather than engaged couples as their subjects . Among the questions to be dealt with in future research are : the relative frequency of homogamous and heterogamous marriages , the factors determining the actual over the chance frequency of matings of like with like , and the relation of homogamy and heterogamy to happiness in marriage . Sociability Projects . In addition to the introduction projects discussed in this chapter , there are numerous organizations providing social contacts for unmarried persons . These play a role in the courtship process about which little is known . Representatives of different types of these could be studied , including young people 's church societies , Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. , young people 's voluntary social groups , dancing clubs , beach clubs , and widows ' and widowers ' social clubs .

It is often too late to solve marital problems when the husband or wife or both are bent on securing a divorce . In marriage , as elsewhere , prevention is easier , more economical , and more effective than cure . Then , too , many marriages that do not end in divorce are also unsuccessful and cause unhappiness to husband , wife , and children . Herein lies the practical importance of studies of the factors making for success or failure in marriage . Unity Out of Diversity The following case shows the delicate balance of the integrating and disintegrating forces in marriage as reported by the husband and the wife : THE HUSBAND 'S ACCOUNT : As far back as we know , there never have been any domestic breaks in our family . Mother did n't want me to have any trouble of that sort . When Jennie and I had our break , one of the things that made me quite sure that I did n't want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily , was that I did n't want to be the one who would bring open domestic strife into our family . Jennie did not look on divorce with such distaste as I. Before our marriage we both agreed that we would each support ourselves and have our own money , but I insisted that I continue to pay for any entertainment or recreation , just as I would do if I would take care of any other girl . After we were married I did n't feel that we had any difficulty over money . My wife says she would have felt better if I had been supporting her . We discussed such things as ambitions . My wife did want to be a lawyer , but her ambitions changed and she wanted to try social work . Then she got so she did n't know what she wanted to do . Her parents are not religious and she is n't at all . My parents are very religious and I had to go to church and to Sunday school every Sunday  | when I was a child . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and in college and then I dropped out gradually . We did n't have any disagreements on that . On one occasion after our separation she was over at my home with my sister and she called her father up from there . Her father wanted her to come home , bawled her out something awful , and she got to crying and hung up . It was then she realized how much my parents cared for her . They were very nice to her and very sympathetic . My mother called me on the phone and I asked to talk to Jennie . She said she could n't talk because she was still crying so much . Finally I got her and she told me what the matter was . I called up her old man and for once said what I thought . I gave him hell , and he apologized profusely and then I told Jennie what he said . That raised my stock a hundred per cent and then he called Jennie and apologized to her and she called me back and told me what her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she called me and asked me if she could see me . I had already told her that any move for reconciliation would have to come from her because she had decided to separate . Then she asked me if she could see me . Of course , I wanted to see her , but I took on a very businesslike air and told her that a couple was coming over to see me and if she wanted to she could come too . She came along and we had a good time together . This couple had planned to stay all night . We had three bedrooms ; one had a single bed , one a double bed , and the other had twin beds . When bedtime came , I said : " Well , how will we sleep ? " I told her , " You can take the front room with the single bed , or you can take my room and I 'll take that , and the friends can take the room with the twin beds . " She said : " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we slept together that night . That night we realized we wanted to come back together . Her mother , I am sure , is sexually cold and I am quite sure that from the time Jennie was a child , her mother instilled in her the idea of sexual coldness , something that a woman has to submit to . I could sense it somehow throughout the whole time we were married and up until the time we were separated . At first she seemed to enjoy it reasonably well , but by the end of the second year I could notice that she was becoming colder and colder . Since our renewal of relationships she has been very desirous of sex relations . Sometimes even more desirous than I am , although I think I am a little higher sexed than she is . After we came back together Jennie said that she wanted a home , a Ford , a dog , and a baby and she would be satisfied and happy . She says she wants to make a career out of being a housewife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued in college . I felt sort of constrained . My freedom was n't particularly limited , but I felt as if it were . I had become acquainted before marriage with a rather uncon-  | ventional couple who lived in the same building . They did n't like my husband . Our friends simply were n't mutual . Both of us were working very hard and we did n't plan anything to do together very often . We did n't play together . Our interests were too separate . After graduating I went home to Mother . I remember I was awfully tired . At that time I was very nervous and irritable and felt like I wanted to get away from everything . I had thought of separation and possibly divorce . I was n't very anxious to get a divorce , but I wanted to get away and give myself time to do some thinking . I was very unhappy all my last year at school . We saw very little of one another and most of the time that we were together we were rather irritable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rejoin my husband , and take some graduate work . In the fall we still did not get along well and I thought of separation . I was dissatisfied with everything . The college boy I liked before I married came back to visit and I got interested in him . I was over at his friends ' a lot of the time and he and his friends were over at my house . My husband did n't like it . We became rather snappy and actually rude to each other . These friends did n't seem to like the way he treated me and they seemed to blame it on him . I could take my troubles to them and they were sympathetic . Finally , I decided to leave my husband . We talked it over ; we agreed to separate and give me time to think it over . He told me that he was still of the same mind and wanted to live with me , but he wanted me to make up my own mind and decide what I wanted to do . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a room in a hotel . I told her that I was n't getting very far in making up my mind whether to stay separated and get a divorce or to go back . She said : " You are always noticing your husband 's faults . Have you ever thought of your own faults and how they might strike another person ? " For the first time in my life I began to think about my faults . It came to me as something of a shock . I realized that a lot of my friends were influencing me , that I did n't have much ability to make up my own mind , and that I was too much interested in another man , although I never could marry him , because our backgrounds were far too different . You ca n't always be thinking of yourself if you are going to make a success of marriage and I am very anxious to make a success of mine . I very definitely made up my mind to go back and try it again . For some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with my husband . This was during the time that I was interested in the other man , but since our reunion , I get much more pleasure out of it and feel no disgust at all . One time after my examinations I was all tired out and I went to my husband 's family home . My father called up and told me to take the next train and come home . He would n't hear no . I told him I just could n't , but he was very unreasonable . I got to crying and stopped talking to him . My  | husband called him up and for once stood up and said what he thought . He said I was too tired to come and was n't coming . Daddy was real nice when my husband called his bluff . The integration of husband and wife in this case was difficult for diverse reasons , including differences in family backgrounds , lack of vital common interests , conflicts in personality adjustment on a psychogenic basis , and intervention of parents and friends . The adjustments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , marriage . This fact makes possible two appraisals of the success of the marriage : one , in the period of the " trial separation " ; and the other , after the reconciliation . It is evident that any measure of success that might be used ? happiness , adjustment , or integration ? would give different findings in these two periods . Measuring Marital Success In measuring marital success , the first problem is to select a criterion or criteria in terms of which marriages may be evaluated . The criteria considered are those which have already been tried out and others which should be experimented with in the future . Those which have been used in one or more studies to date are : ( I ) permanence of the marriage , ( z ) happiness of the husband and wife , ( 3 ) satisfaction with the marriage , ( 4 ) sexual adjustment , ( S ) marital adjustment , and ( 6 ) the integration of the couple . Those which should be subjected to experimental use are : ( i ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality development of husband and wife , and ( 3 ) companionship . Permanence . Some persons judge the success or failure of a marriage in terms of its actual or potential permanence.They say that successful marriages are those which survive and unsuccessful unions are those broken by separation and divorce , or where husband and wife are seriously considering divorce . To consider as successful those marriages where husband and wife continue living together has two distinct advantages . First , a marriage in modern society might well be rated a success which manages to survive despite disintegrating influences such as economic insecurity , the decline of religious and moral control , the liberality of divorce laws , and the popularizing of the idea of divorce through the example of successive divorces of motion-picture stars and other celebrities . Second , the status of not being separated or divorced is an objective and easily applied criterion of success in marriage . This  | criterion , however , is not sufficiently inclusive . Many marriages that do not end in separation or divorce are as unhappy as those that are broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a marriage is judged by the happiness of the couple . This emphasizes the personal reaction of husband and wife and recognizes the obvious fact that in American society happiness is universally assumed to be the object of marriage and the standard by which it is to be evaluated . Over and above all other conditions implied in the marriage contract is the right to be happy and the obligation of husband and wife to make each other happy : a right and an obligation which emphasize the personal character of marriage in our individualistic society . Accordingly , studies of marriage often include an appraisal of its happiness by the husband and wife , either individually or together . Many objections have been raised to the use of happiness as a way of judging a successful marriage . Because happiness is subjective , how can any two persons agree upon rating the happiness of their own marriage or that of anyone else ? A marriage might be happy for the husband but not for the wife . Will persons be honest in rating their marriage ? Can they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , can persons know whether they are really happy or not ? Actually , studies have found that these doubts about happiness as a criterion of marital success are not justified . Persons readily report the state of happiness in their marriage . Husbands and wives generally , but not always , agree in their ratings of the happiness of their own marriage . A member of a couple and an outsider come close to giving the same rating . In other words , even if happiness is a subjective reaction , it is one of which the person is aware and which those who know him well can rather accurately appraise . But from the standpoint of research there is one real difficulty with happiness as a criterion . It permits of only a five-point or at best a seven-point scale of measurement , because people have difficulty in discriminating smaller degrees of happiness . Terman used a sevenfold classification : l extraordinarily happy , decidedly more happy than the average , somewhat more happy than the average , about average , somewhat less happy than the average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgess and Cottrell and Locke used five degrees : very happy , happy , average , unhappy , very footnote1 Lewis M. Terman and others , Psychological Factors in Marital Happiness , New York , McGrawHill Book Company , 1938 , p. 440.  | unhappy . ' It seems , therefore , desirable to find some other criterion that will be susceptible to more detailed analysis in separate items and subcategories and so make possible a wider numerical scale for measuring the successful and unsuccessful marriages . Satisfaction . A third criterion of a successful marriage , which is used by many couples , is the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the marriage . In most cases , of course , satisfaction with the marriage is associated with its harmony and happiness . Hamilton , in his study of one hundred married men and one hundred married women , used the criterion of satisfaction to determine the success or failure of marriage . ' On the basis of answers to thirteen questions Hamilton classified the degree of marital satisfaction of his two hundred cases into five large groups , graded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , either husband or wife may be dissatisfied in a marriage where there is no conflict or incompatibility , or they may be highly satisfied in a union which has unsolved problems of adjustment . Simply because conflicts are present in a family is no reason to believe that one or both members of a couple are dissatisfied , for footnote1 Ernest W. Burgess and Leonard S.

Moreover , a couple may be satisfied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , a couple may be both harmonious and happy but not entirely satisfied . Satisfaction appears to be a resultant of the correspondence between the actual and the expected or a comparison of the actual relationship with the alternative , if the present relationships were terminated . The status of being a married woman may cause a wife to be satisfied with marriage , even though there are many conflicts in the marriage and she is unhappy . Or the inhibited and shy husband may prefer purgatory in marriage to the hell of the scandal of divorce and of the uncertainties of going from the frying pan into the fire in a second marriage . In the following case , from a low economic class , the wife is satisfied with her husband , although she is frank in stating the characteristics which she likes and dislikes in him and talks freely of their conflicts : The things I liked about Roy were and are . He is good natured , always making jokes , and , whereas he is quick tempered , afterwards he lets me know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is very loving , he always comes in and puts his arms around me ; of course I like that . During the first two years we were together Roy gave me gifts rather frequently ; then for the next two or three years somewhat less frequently ; during the last two years Roy has given even fewer gifts ; he seems to think that I belong to him now . I go out to his home every Sunday , taking all the children with me ; we are going out there Christmas Eve and stay there all day Christmas . He says , " It is more like home when we are all there . " I like Roy to love me , to sit on his lap , and have him kiss me . The things I do n't like about Roy are . The thing that makes me maddest at Roy is that when he comes home he just gets on the bed and reads Western stories . He is always buying them . Then after reading a while he may go to sleep . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes him mad ? he just roars . I will talk to him and he wo n't pay any attention , and then I will say , " Hey , I want you to talk to me . " He will stop in a minute and say , " What did you say ? " He may come by in the daytime and jump out of his truck , stick his head in the door and say , " Are you all right , " and maybe before I have a chance to say a word , goes on back saying , " I will see you after a while . "  | Then he does n't keep his promises . He promised to get me a four-room house three months ago but has n't done it . We are living in with another family and have only one room . I am very jealous and he always teases about girls . He has only stepped out a couple of times . While I know he is only joking , it makes me so mad I could almost die . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into the garage last night and said to one of the men , ? " Hello , honey , " and the man replied , " Hello there , sugar baby . " Roy , as serious as could be , said , ? ? I did n't know that he was your honey . " I told him I was just kidding , but it still made him mad . In the next case the husband and wife have adjusted well in the marriage . But the husband 's dissatisfaction in the marriage seems due to his loss of freedom , while the wife is dissatisfied because her husband leaves her alone while he is away playing poker : HUSBAND : I have not seriously considered separating from my wife . If I were not married , I would quit my job tomorrow and go back down home . I would like to have the freedom of being single . She is a good housekeeper . Meals always on time . Cooks everything I like . She helps me a lot with sympathy , understanding , and particularly encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me along that line ? mostly in connection with my career . The last time I went to a poker game I told her a week ahead . The night before the game I brought up the subject again , and she asked me if I was going . She showed that she did not like it . It took her about four days to get over that . I told her once that she ought to be glad that I am not a fellow who goes out and gets drunk every night . She just does not like to be left alone . WIFE : I am much happier than I was before marriage . He does not argue but believes in passive resistance . It used to irritate me . I think what irritates me most is his poker parties . Then I have to stay alone at night . Sexual Adjustment . Several studies ? those by Burgess and Wallin , Karlsson , King , Locke , Terman , and Terman and Odenhave included items on sexual adjustment in marriage .

' Burgess and Wallin used the Terman items . King selected some of the same items . Locke3 introduced the following new items : no belief , knowledge , or suspicion that the mate had had intercourse with others : ( 1 ) before marriage or ( 2 ) during marriage ; the assumption that the mate did not believe , know , or suspect that the spouse had had intercourse with others : ( 1 ) before marriage or ( 2 ) during marriage ; no intercourse during marriage with others than mate ; no jealousy on part of mate if one dances , talks , or associates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a successful marriage , and one actually used in several studies , is that of the adjustment of the husband and wife to each other . A well-adjusted marriage may be defined as a union where the attitudes and the acts of husband and wife are in agreement on the chief issues of marriage , such as handling finances and dealing with in-laws ; where they have come to an adjust ment upon interests , objectives , and values ; where they are in har mony on demonstrations of affection and the sharing of confidences and where they have few or no complaints about their marriage . Couples with similar cultural backgrounds and compatible temperaments frequently find that they have few adjustments to make either in engagement or in marriage . Other couples with certain differences in past experience , in temperament , and in philosophy of life may make their adjustment during courtship and engagement . Most couples , however , find that they still have adjustments to make inc footnotel Lewis M.

Cit. , pp. 325-27. 3  | marriage , and some never succeed in solving the problems upon which I they disagree . In adjustment , as compared with the other methods of judging marital success , the emphasis is upon the harmonious relations of husband and wife in marriage , upon consensus , upon mutuality of interests , and upon joint participation in activities . The adjustment score will be described in detail in the next chapter . If one single criterion is to be used , adjustment is probably the most satisfactory measurement of success in marriage available at the present time , but it , too , has its deficiencies . An adjustment may be made to marriage or to a marital partner , but that does not mean that the husband and wife will be particularly happy , that the union meets social expectations , or that the personalities will have a chance to develop . Integration . The sixth criterion of a successful marriage which has been used is the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their study of one thousand engaged couples employed the fourteen categories of integration given below in their follow-up interviews with the couples three years after marriage . If two personalities become one in marriage , then the degree of oneness resulting may well be taken to measure the success of the union . tMarital unity , from this standpoint , has been defined as " the integration of the couple in a union in which the two personalities are not merely merged , or submerged , but interact to complement each other for mutual satisfaction and the achievement of common objectives . The emphasis is upon intercommunication , interstimulation , and participation in common activities . " ' Family integration is the process by which interdependence is achieved through the sharing of memories and experiences . The factors making for the integration or the disintegration of the marital relationship are the following : degree and mutuality of II love before marriage ; compatibility of temperament ; emotional dependence , independence , or interdependence ; correspondence of relation with mate to parental image ; sexual adjustment ; attitude 5 towardyhatFing children ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; number and binding effect of common interests ; agreement or disagreement upon friends ; relationship to parents and parents-in-law ; religious affiliation and behavior ; convergence or divergence of philosophy of life ; and economic behavior and financial status . footnote I E. W. Burgess Anti L. S. Cottrell , op. cit. , p. to .  | Each of these focal points of marital integration or disintegration in a given union may be graded as highly integrating , somewhat integrating , neither integrating nor disintegrating , somewhat disintegrating , and highly disintegrating . Burgess and Wallin gave each of these levels of integration numerical values , ranging from zero for highly disintegrating to four for highly integrating . Then by adding the number of points upon each of the fourteen factors , it was possible to assign each couple a total integration score . This method provided a marital-integration scale for the measurement of the relative degree of strength of the marriage relationship of different couples . Case studies of engaged and married couples exhibit great differences in the degree of integration and consequent interdependence . Some couples are so highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no power , even that of death , could endanger the relationship . The members of other couples may be so self-sufficient and so slightly integrated in their sentiments , attitudes , and values that it would seem their union could hardly survive even the minor vicissitudes of life . Between these two extremes falls the great body of engaged and married couples . The highest values of family life in terms of the integration of its members do not arise out of likenesses but out of differences . They do not emerge from harmony but from conflict . They are the result not of joy and well-being but often of pain and suffering . The very difficulties which may disrupt one marriage may be the elements out of which , in the spirit of high adventure and of abiding patience , the most successful union , perhaps , may be forged . In facing and overcoming the adversity of the depression many families . found themselves drawn closer together than they had ever been in times of prosperity . Social Expectations . Another way of judging the success of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social class to which the family belongs . The assumption would be that personal standards and expectations of successful marriage would correspond to the cultural expectations . The social expectation of what is and is not a successful marriage could be determined by finding out what different social classes believe constitutes a successful marriage . Groups would differ as to their definitions of a successful marriage , and , consequently , people would differ on what they conceive to be a happy marriage . The method of judging marital success in terms of social expectations is a difficult one to use . It involves an investigation of the dif-C7  | ferent social classes in our society with their plurality of expectations . Then an inquiry has to be made into the degree of influence of these groups on the different couples whose marital happiness is being considered . Then , too , the cultural expectations of groups do not take into account such facts as the psychogenic traits of husbands and wives , which affect their feelings of happiness and satisfaction in the marital situation . Personality Development . An eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , of wife , and of children . According to this point of view it does not matter so much if the marriage is happy or unhappy , or if the couple is or is not integrated , or how society judges it , or even if it endures or dissolves ; the crucial question is , does the union work for or against the development of the personality of its members ? There is merit in this suggestion . Some persons of great creative gifts were products of unhappy homes , like Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Charlotte Bronte . Also many eminent persons ? e.g. , Socrates , John Milton , Abraham Lincoln , and Havelock Ellis ? were unhappy in unions that did not prevent and perhaps contributed to their greatness . But these may be exceptional cases . In general , unions that are happy and highly integrated with mutual interdependence are the ones which also make for the development of personality . While personality development may be the best criterion of marital success , it is one that is exceedingly difficult to measure . One person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another person . Until there is common agreement upon what constitutes personality development and how to measure it , it will not be feasible to use it in studies of marital success . Companionship . When couples are asked what they have gained from marriage , one of the most frequent answers is " companionship . " By this term they mean intimate association , sympathetic understanding , demonstration of affection , and joint participation in common interests and activities . Typical expressions in terms of this criterion of marital success are : WIPE : The biggest thing in marriage is happiness ; being compatible , doing things together , and having our own home . I think you have a sense of security that you do n't have before marriage . HUSBAND : It is difficult to put into words . The idea of being continually with the person you are in love with ; then , too , the idea of you two together in your home . Spending your evenings together at home instead of running around . I think it is more or less companionship .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual enjoyment out of one another 's company . We have been able to supply each other 's shortcomings . HUSBAND : I would say briefly that my greatest satisfaction is a happiness I could not get single . I got a confidante ? a person to tell troubles and misfortunes to . Before I was very much a lone wolf . WIFE : We care for each other very deeply . I think we are closer since marriage , and the child made us even closer . Now having another child we are happier . We always loved each other , but since the child came we are more attached . We are very dear to one another . HUSBAND : Security , permanent companionship , fulfillment of desire for responsibility are things I like most in our marriage . It is a photo finish between security and permanent companionship . Companionship , as a measure of marital success , should be analyzed into component parts which then might be scored . For example , various degrees of sympathetic understanding might be differentiated : ( 1 ) no understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) understanding by one but not by the other ; ( 3 ) partial understanding by both ; ( 4 ) high degree but not a complete understanding by both ; and ( 5 ) complete understanding , including that of divergent behavior . Other aspects of companionship , such as demonstration of affection , intimacy of association with each other and with children , and joint participation in interests and activities , can be similarly differentiated by degrees so that a total companionship score could be obtained . The Use of Composite and Multiple Criteria . Three studies have used more than one criteria : those by Locke in Indiana ; l Locke and Karlsson in Uppsala , Sweden ; ' and Burgess and Wallin of engaged and married couples in Chicago . ' In the Indiana study there were three criteria : two more or less objective and independent ? lack of permanence of marriage as indicated by divorce , and happiness in marriage as judged by an outsider . In addition , there was a general composite criterion ? a test of marital adjustment . In the Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four more or less objective and independent criteria ? happiness in marriage as judged by persons in the general population , " average success " based on the assumption that a sample from the general population would be average in marital adjustment , footnote ' Op. cir. 2 Harvey J. Locke and Georg Karlsson , " Marital Adjustment and Prediction in Sweden and the United States , " American Sociological Review , 17 , 1951 , pp. 10-17 . Also , Georg Karlsson , op. cit . Op. cit.  | unhappiness as judged by the happily married , and separation while waiting for a divorce . In both studies the marital-adjustment test used several criteria ( including some discussed above ) and combined them into what might be called a composite criterion . The test included questions indicative of satisfaction with the marriage , marital happiness , permanence of the marriage , common interests and activities , consensus or agreements and disagreements ) , sexual adjustment , companionship , and demonstration of love and affection . In the Indiana study the scores secured on this composite test by the divorced group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scores secured by the happily married . In the Swedish study the average scores secured on the marital-adjustment test were significantly different for the four criterion groups . These groups had the following rank order of success in marriage as measured by the test : happily married , general or average population group , unhappily married , and separated while waiting for divorce . Apparently the marital-adjustment test differentiates success in marriage as indicated by independent criteria . Burgess and Wallin used nine different criteria to measure marital success . These were permanence , happiness , general satisfaction , specific satisfaction , consensus , sex adjustment , love , common interests , and temperamental compatibility . A Profile of Marital Success The nine criteria for appraising marital success ? permanence of the union , happiness of the husband and wife , satisfaction with the marriage , sexual adjustment , marital adjustment , integration , social expectations , personality development , and companionship ? are , evidently , not mutually exclusive . In fact , studies , as far as they offer evidence on this point , indicate that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a large core of something common in all these criteria . At the same time , in each one of the criteria there is undoubtedly an independent variable which is important in determining the success of the union . For this reason it is desirable to combine some or all of these , and possibly others , into a single instrument to measure the success of a marriage . This will have the advantage of an all-round representation of the outcome of the union , rather than the selection of only one criterion which may not be significant in certain cases . By a " profile " of marital success is meant the picture secured  | through presenting separately the findings from the use of several criteria . For example , a profile may be constructed to show in a single graph the scores upon the above criteria . In many marriages the profile of marital success of a husband and wife may be similar or even identical . Upon one of the criteria the findings will be identical for the husband and the wife namely , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations ? for this is a judgment upon the couple . On other factors the profile of the husband and wife may differ to a greater or less degree . Terman found , for example , that when 716 husbands and wives gave independent and secret reports of their attitudes upon the happiness of their union , their adjustment in it , and their satisfaction with it ( combined in a single score ) , the Personian correlation was only .59.1 Terman and Oden , in their study of the marital adjustment of Terman 's " genius " children , found a .51 correlation between the happiness scores of husbands and wives . ' Burgess and Wallin , in their study of r000 engaged couples , reported a . S7 between the engagementadjustment scores and a .41 between the marital-adjustment scores . ' Locke found no correlation between the marital-adjustment scores of divorced subjects , and only .36 between the happily married husbands and their wives.4 This indicates that in a considerable proportion of cases a union which is regarded as very satisfactory for one partner is viewed in a quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary of statements secured from a couple three years after the marriage illustrates how husbands and wives may have widely different reactions to their marriage : Mr. and Mrs. Anderson differ in their expressions of satisfaction with the marriage . She reports that she is very much pleased and satisfied , while he states that he is very much dissatisfied with their marriage . Mrs. Anderson is satisfied because her love for her husband is very much stronger than before the marriage , they are very much in love with each other , the marriage is very happy , her husband and she are well mated , she kisses her husband every day , sex has considerably strengthened the union , and nothing annoys or dissatisfies her with the marriage . While she admits that her husband smokes , swears , is impatient , is always wrapped up in his business , and criticizes her , she says none of these things interferes with the happiness of the marriage . footnote Lewis M.
