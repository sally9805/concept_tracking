txt Everett , Wash. , Feb. 9 ( AP )  - -  The maiden flight of the Boeing 747 super-jet , the largest commercial air liner in the world , was cut short today after an hour and 15 minutes in the air . The huge craft returned after the pilot reported wing flap difficulty . The flight was to have lasted 2 1/2 hours but pilot Jack Waddell made the decision to return the super - jet to Paine field , north of Seattle , after 34 minutes in flight . It was another 41 minutes before the 747 landed . Pilot First Elated Until the ' decision to cut the flight short was made , Waddell sounded elated and reported the huge jet , capable of globe-trotting 499 passengers nonstop 6,000 miles , performed " beautifully . " After a flawless , smokeless , and quiet take-off , Wadden reported in radio communications the plane was " very easily flyable . " The landing also was without blemish as the enormous red , white , and silver plane appeared to hover in the sky like a kite approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press conference a short time later that a " minor discrepancy " in the alignment of the fore-flap below the right wing was reported to him by the flight engineer . Waddell said he did not see it , and that it was not detectable on the ground after landing . He said the apparent faulty alignment may have been caused by air pressure in flight , but he said he did not know if this were related to a " bump " which he reported during the flight and just seconds before he said the flight would be cut short . Te plane never reached the anticipated air speed of 300 miles per hour because , during initial flight tests , the crew did n't get beyond checking the flaps with the landing gear still down , Waddell said . Waddell said as far as he 's concerned be 's ready to go up in the big plane again any time . He said no decision has been made on the time of the next flight , bat be added , " Maybe tomorrow ? ' The big jet lumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 1/2 hour test flight . But at 12:08 p. m. , Waddell radioed the plane had experienced " a bump " during tests of its ailerons , control surfaces on the trailing edges of the wings . Stays in Air The situation evidently was not critical , ho'vever , because Waddell consented after radio contact with the ground to stay in the air " until the boss can come up and take a look . " A Boeing 727 carrying members of the press and Boeing officials took off at 12:15 p. m. for an aerial rendezvous with the super-jet . Waddell did not indicate in other radio communications what might have gone wrong . Report of the " bump " came only moments after Waddell reported the 747 was a " very easily flyable airplane ' and " the flaps are pretty buffet free . " Flies Beautifully , He Says Waddell radioed seconds after take-off that the 20 million dollar 355-ton super-jet was " flying beautifully . " The 747 reached a speed of abut 160 miles per hour and roared down 4,500 feet of Paine field runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarfed an F-86 military fighter chase plane as it moved gracefully but slowly away from the field for flight test maneuvers over Puget Sound . The take-off was delayed more than an hour by low clouds , but the cover lifted just enough to permit Waddell to give the go-ahead . The super-jet 's take-off is distinctly slower in appearance than that of the sweeping takeoffs of its Boeing predecessors , the smaller Boeing 727 tri-jet and the 707 four jet liner . 21/2 Times Larger This was the first of many hours of rigid tests the 747 faces before it is approved for delivery to air lines thruout the world . The 747 , carried a crew of three for its initial air tests . In addition to Waddell , 45. there were co-pilot Brien Wygle. 44 , and flight engineer Jess Walich , 34 , on board . The jumbo jet is 21/2 times larger than any commercial air liner in service today , with three times the passenger seating capacity and twice the cargo hold . Pushing the 747 skyward were four Pratt &; Whitney turbofan engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's largest commercial jet presently in service . Weather Delays Test Today 's test flight had been delayed since December by bad weather . Fully loaded , the 747 's gross weight is 710,000 ponds , but for its first flight the plane was stripped to 480,000 pounds . The jumbo jet is 231 feet 4 inches long , and if turned on its tail would stand about 20 stories high . Its wing span is 195 feet 8 inches , and it has a tail height of 63 feet .
