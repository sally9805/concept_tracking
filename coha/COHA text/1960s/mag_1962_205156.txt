GREENMANTLE ; JOHN MACNAB ; THE HOUSE OF THE FOUR WINDS ; CASTLE GAY - John Buchan - Penguin Books ( 85 each ) . <P> Has some scoundrel been fomenting a holy war in Turkey ? Can the dastardly plot to do in the Greek Premier be foiled ? Is the hated Boche all cranked up to subvert Mesopotamia ? Yes , yes , and yes . The thing to do , as many a British reader from 15 to So knows , is call in Richard Hannay . At least that is what old Sir Walter Bullivant at the Foreign Office always did . and with the most heartening results for both the interests of Old England and the greater glory of a sandpiper-sized Scottish scrivener named John Buchan . A soldier , a respected historian , Member of Parliament and , finally ( as Lord Tweedsmuir ) British Governor General of Canada , Writer-Statesman Buchan died in 1940 . But lionhearted Dick Hannay and dozens of other Buchan characters , whose World War I and between-wars exploits fill a score of volumes , go marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. in paperback editions . <P> Out of the Doldrums . Buchan began writing in 1895 and produced scholarly biographies of Scott and Oliver Cromwell , as well as a 1,500,000-word account of World War I. But his apparently secure niche in literary history depends on the oldest storytelling skill in the world : the ability to transport recognizable people to exotic places , place them in jeopardy , and bring them back alive . <P> The schoolboy hero of Buchan 's The Magic Walking Stick finds a cane that , properly twirled by the owner , twirls him from the doldrums of home to far-off times and places . In The House of the Four Winds ( which along with Castle Gay is part of a trilogy about a retired Glasgow grocer named Dickson McCunn ) , Buchan plunks assorted Britons smack dab in the middle of a palace revolution in Evallonia , a small , turbulent European state north by east from Ruritania . <P> Girls , Seldom . In all of this , Buchan is to present-day international-chase writers what Henry Ford was to the mass-produced automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross-country chase in a purring Bentley to the use of arcane skills ( like the ability to get along in colloquial Kurdish ) to extricate the hero from a sticky situation . Richard Hannay , an ex-brigadier and a onetime mining engineer first seen in The Thirty-Nine Steps , speaks Afrikaans and German , turns out to be a dead shot with a captured Mauser , describes himself as " tough as a sjambok . " ( Most Buchan readers know what a sjambok is . ) Hannay 's American crony , John S. Blenkiron , drinks nothing but boiled milk ( to placate his seething " duodenum " ) , bursts out with John Brown 's Body when things look darkest , but is matchless at diagnosing the nefarious geopolitical logic behind any dirty work at the crossroads of the world . Grizzled old <P> Boer and ex-Guide Peter Pienaar. who " could track a tsessebe in thick bush " ( Buchan readers know what a tsessebe is ) , turns out to be most useful in Green-mantle as a messenger . He slithers silently through Turkish lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding the Russian forces . Because it is Buchan , the Grand Duke turns out to have hunted lions with Peter on the veld back in ' 98.
