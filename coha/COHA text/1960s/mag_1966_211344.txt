ABC 's ambitious , costly ( about $350,000 per hour ) new dramatic series Stage 67 has been the mail-order bride of the current season-so lovely in anticipation , so disappointing in actuality . Last week the frump finally combed her hair and put on a touch of lipstick . In a spare , dust-dry dramatization of Katherine Anne Porter 's novella Noon Wine , Adapter-Director Sam Peckinpah in a single swoop revived much of the all-but-dead hope that serious drama can find a regular place in the TV schedule . <P> <P> Noon Wine is close in feeling to Peckinpah 's prizewinning movie , Ride the High Country . A strange , withdrawn , harmonica-playing Swede ( Per Oscarsson ) arrives at the small Texas spread owned by an ignorant farmer named Thompson ( Jason Robards Jr . ) . The Swede signs on as a handyman , and in the course of three years not only tunes up the farm operations to perfect pitch but slides , in his remote way , into the heart of the family . <P> Then , what seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stranger appears , announcing with grinning malevolence that the handyman has escaped from an insane asylum and must return . When the stranger pulls a knife , Thompson kills him . The rest of the play shows Thompson , acquitted by a jury , bleakly , desperately dragging his sickly wife ( Olivia de Havilland ) from one neighbor 's house to another to defend himself and his deed . Then he blows his brains out . <P> <P> Somber as it is , Noon Wine induced a special glow , partly because of Director Peckinpah 's achievement in adhering to the bluntness of the tragedy , partly because of the ungirdled brilliance of his players . Robards , bedecked with a massive home-grown mustache , spread backwoods brio all over the crusty landscape , and Olivia de Havilland , all frailty and flutteriness , tottered after him without losing a step . Author Porter was astonished that show busi ness could be so kind . " After what they did to my poor Ship of Fools , " she said last week , " I was just crushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither did anyone who had previously watched Stage 67 ; but expectations now are downright bullish .
