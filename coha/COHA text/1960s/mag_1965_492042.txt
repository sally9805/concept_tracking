with lyrics by Stephen Sondheim , whose previous hits include Gypsy and West Side Story . " 1 have such a prayer for it , " Rodgers said , as boyishly as if he were opening with Poor Little Ritz Girl in 1920 . He will be 63 this year . Not even the gravest illness has succeeded in keeping Rodgers away from a theater for any great length of time . In September . 1955 , during the rehearsals of Pipe Dream , an adaptation of John Steinbeck 's Sweet Thursday , he was operated on for a cancer of the jaw . He attended a rehearsal on the morning of the day he entered the hospital . Eight days after the operation he went for a ride in Central Park with his wife . The day after the ride Mrs. Rodgers took her husband to a movie . On the 10th day he showed up at a rehearsal of Pipe Dream again and stayed with the show until it opened , despite considerable discomfort . " He 's unhappy when he 's not working , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am resentful of anything that keeps him from writing music . That is what he was put on this earth for . " " Maybe I paid for it all later , " Rodgers said the other day . " I guess I 'll never know . But I have an idea that if I 'd done the usual bit of going to White Sulphur Springs and sitting on the porch after the operation , it might have been a lot worse . I would have concentrated on myself instead of on the show , which was healthy for me . " But as it turned out , he had only postponed matters . Early in 1956 he fell into a depression and began to withdraw . " I was obviously suffering from the shock of realizing I 'd had cancer , " he continued . " I knew it and my wife knew it , but she would n't mention it . " Rodgers is a highly logical man and extremely respectful of rational behavior . " Things reached the point , " he said . " where I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took were simple . I called a couple of doctors , and we decided that I should go to a hospital for a while . Simple as that . I had a room with a nice armchair overlooking the East River . And this is interesting  --  up to that point I had n't read more than maybe three books in three years , I 'd been so busy . In the first two weeks I was in that place " ? he stayed there for about three months ? " I read ten books and everything else I could gel my hands on . That 's how thirsty I was and how much I needed rest . " Less than a year after his self-imposed retreat from the world , Rodgers returned to work . He turned out the television version of Cinderella in 1957 . The musical comedies Flower Drum Song and The Sound of Music , both written with the late Oscar Hammerstein , were produced in 1958 and 1959 . He wrote the score for a television series . Winston Churchill : The Valiant Years , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditional songs , including words , for the motion-picture remake of State Fair , and the same year his newest musical comedy was running , No Strings , for which he did both score and lyrics . No Strings represented the first time Rodgers had ever tackled a musical comedy without a collaborator . He did it , he says , because he could n't find another lyricist at the moment and because Hammerstein 's death had left him " pretty thrown " and not too much inclined to look for another man . " I found out , " Rodgers says , " that I simply could n't face the adjustment to a new personality at the time . " While the critics did not unanimously acclaim it , No Strings did win Rodgers his third Antoinette Perry award for the best musical score of the 1961-62 season . The current show , Do I Hear o Waltz ? , is based on a play of some seasons ago , The Time of the Cuckoo by Arthur Laurents , who had originally proposed the show to Rodgers and Hammerstein in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough time had elapsed since the original 1952 production . and Rodgers was of the opinion that not a great deal of beautiful music could be made over the situation of a middle-aged American spinster hopelessly in love with a married antique dealer in Venice . Early in 1963 , however . Laurents once more approached Rodgers -- after the composer 's long . fruitless try at working with Alan Jay Lerner on a musical about extrasensory perception  --  and succeeded in convincing him . He pointed out to Rodgers that his original intention had been to make his heroine younger . more attractive and quite sophisticated . not a teacher but an advertising executive . Her fate was to be far from hopeless . Sondheim was next approached to do the lyrics , but this time he was not sure there was a musical in the new-old version . Within a matter of weeks . though . his qualms had been stifled . and the three own set to work on what , has since become Do I lira ? li Waltz ? Sergio Franchi is cast as t he Venetian inomoroto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rodgers is remaining in close attendance on every 1 detM1 of the show , sitting through endess rehearsals and auditions and overeeing every last detail of choreography , costume , scenic design an I lighting . c . He is a stocky. round-faced man of medium height , with iron-gray hair , knowledgeable brown eyes and a mod- t manner . It has been frequently said that he looks as little like a composer as custom-tailored suits and shirts will pennit  --  more like the banker or board chairman of sonic highly remunerative financial enterprise , which he is . Rodgers , however . repudiates any inference that he may be a meticulous businessman . He insists that while he knows why to do something , he does n't know how , leaving details of that kind to his staff . Businesslike or not , the chances are that Rodgers is the wealthiest composer of all time . popular or otherwise . His earnings have been estimated to be as high as 8100 million . He is able to compose anywhere at any hour , without a piano . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood of 1,500 , and of these , several hundred have become what the trade calls " standards . " Among them . as a lucrative sample , are Manhattan , Oh , li hat a Beautiful Mornin ' ! and Some Enchanted Evening , The likelihood is that somewhere in the United States , every minute of every day of the year , a Rodgers melody is being played . He is unfailingly gratified whenever he hears one . which is as often as he cares to turn on a radio or go anyplace where music is broadcast , not excluding taxicabs and racetracks . Once a friend lured him to the old Belmont track , having arranged in advance to have the band play nothing but Rodgers 's scores . The composer , a man stunningly without avocations , was not bored for a minute . . Rodgers has made two principal con-tributions to musical comedy , which shares with jazz the distinction of being a uniquely American art form . The first is an unstemmed tide of melody . The mystery of its source is the mystery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick 's got that pipeline to heaven that goes through him . And when something does n't come out , the whole works gets choked up and congested . " In truth , when Rodgers is not working he does tend to look harassed , and his staff has noticed that he is apt to be a lot less expansive than on days when he taps his briefcase upon enter-tog the office and trumpets , " Well . I got my homework in here ! " ) The other great Rodgers contribu-tion lies in the number of innovations he has fostered . In the past . carefree musicals had been put together a is Ziegfeld  --  with unrelated sketches . songs built around individual performers and with striking show girls . Or they had descended reasonably intact from the Victor Herbert variety of op eretta . In 1921i. 1.1 years before billy in Dot k dipped into psychoanalysis , Rodgers 's Peggy . Ion was built around t he Freudian interpretation of dreams . In 193ti , with On Your Toes , he integrated ballet into the plot of a musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section for the orchestra alone . He was also responsible for the first musical-comedy adaptation of Shakespeare , with The Boys From Syracuse , in 1938 . W Pal Joey , in 1940 , he demon- strated conclusively that was Y possible to tell a marvelously amusing story about an unmitigated heel . Oklahoma ! , in 1943 , brought an integration of book and music never heard before on Broadway . What was more , one of the characters got killed . Two years later in Carousel , the theme of which was downright tragic , the hero was killed . Next , Rodgers eliminated the conventional overture for The Sound of Music ; in 1961. he put his No Strings orchestra onstage , the members wandering in and out among the actors . He even had the chorus move scenery ( Where professional stagehands were necessary , he put them in costume ) . Also . No Strings introduced a romance between a white man and a Negro girl . Rodgers 's original gifts have not been confined to musical comedy and television documentaries . He has composed 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet , Ghost Town , for the Ballet Russe in 1939 ? he does n't think highly of it  --  and a nightclub revue in the early days with his first collaborator , Lorenz Hart . Rodgers could pick out tunes with one finger on a piano before he was three . He was composing in his nonage and being produced in his teens , years before he took formal lessons on theory or on the piano . He has never written any of what he calls abstract music  --  music not intended for a definite lyric or idea . " The reason , " he has said , " is psychological but not Freudian . My mother was a first-rate pianist and my father , who was a doctor , was crazy about music . They were both mad about the theater . And they used to go to the operettas. which were so much of musical theater in their day , and come home with the printed score . By the way , I 'm one producer and composer who prints up a score that you can buy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell very well anymore . Anyway , the score used to go up on the piano , and for weeks my mother would play and she and my father would sing . I was so small that I had to be lifted up on the piano stool , and I would try to imitate my mother . Eventually , that was the way I picked up playing . " The fruits of this happy , non-Freudian infancy have not been invisible . Rodgers maintains a large office on one entire floor of a Madison Avenue building . The unbusinesslike room contains paintings by Adolph Gottlieb . Larry Rivers and Pierre Soulages , and a grand piano on which Rodgers plays but rarely composes. since he prefers to write his music away from the office . I le keeps a jar of hard candies on a coffee table , having fallen into I he habil of eating Ihem 18 years ago when he gave up smoking , and he regularly offers them to visitors . The room also contains a good deal of Directoire furniture , as well as a modern couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round Biedermeier table ( an original ) in an Empire chair ( a reproduction ) , and so do his visitors . In a profession given to as much circumlocution as possible , Rodgers is quite direct . Russel Crouse , one of the authors of The Sound of Music , observes that " Dick is n't given to any of the cheap forms of anger , just the more vigorous ones . " On the other hand , Rodgers is not lacking in wit , as when he once whispered discreetly to another man at an audition , " How long does that girl have to read before we know she has bad legs . " Another time he interrupted an actor in mid-audition to announce that he was hiring him . " But you did n't let me finish . Mr. Rodgers , " the actor protested . " Some people , " Rodgers observed , " just wo n't take yes for an answer . " One would suppose that a man of Rodgers 's stature would by now be relatively confident about his work , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was four decades ago . Vincent J. Donehue , who directed The Sound of Alusic. recalls an afternoon when Rodgers was to play a new song at Oscar T-Iammerstein 's house for Mary Marl in , her husband , and Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse , " An hour before the others got there , " Donehue said , " Rodgers was getting fidgety . When they arrived , we started to go down to the second floor , where the piano was . Rodgers said , ' Well , by God , here we go , a fighter pilot taking off on a combat mission . ' " Donehue reminded him he was among friends . " Nobody 's your friend the first time you play a song . " Rodgers rejoined . " The song , " Donehue vividly remembers , " was Do Re Ali  --  certainly one of the most successful in the show . " A musical genius is no more immune to bleeding ego than other mortals , but although Rodgers bruises easy , as the saying goes , he heals quick . Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new show . Do I Hear a Waltz ? , and Rodgers , in due course , produced a tune . Sondheim told him bluntly that he did n't like it . ( " I think Dick is incapable of writing bad music , you understand , " Sondheim comments . " With him , there are only degrees of competence from passable to wonderful to great . " ) Rodgers 's reaction was one of undiluted incredulity . " No one I ever worked with ever criticized a song I %%Tote , " he informed Sondheim without heat . " He was right , " Sondheim said . " No one had . " " I like the music ' whin I wIVlr it . " Rodgers teilects.

Eventually , this piece of music is going to be heard by 1.650 people a night in a theater , and . hopefully , by millions more . " Just as he would like to dispel the idea that he is a lynx-eyed businessman . Rodgers must strive to disabuse people of the notion that he composes painlessly and in a hurry , although to the untutored he seems to . Stories of his speed at work are many , but two fairly recent ones are illustrative . When No Strings was trying out in Detroit . Rodgers decided he needed a duet for his stars , Diahann Carroll and Richard Kiley. lie was having breakfast with his director , Joe Layton. and the two fixed on a Maine beach scene for the locale . They decided that Miss Carroll would sing about how much she liked Maine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mainly , I do like Maine , " Rodgers said suddenly . hnlly bahnillp 111,11111 111 ) 11111.

Another time , when he was working with Alan Jay Lerner on a tentative production , Lerner telephoned him with a suggested song title , nothing more . After hanging up , Lerner got into a shower . A couple of minutes later the phone rang . and he emerged , dripping , to answer it . " The rest you know , " he said , " It was Dick , of course , and he had a whole tune . It 's a charming song .

At one particular moment all these come together , and the artist ' expresses ' himself , " It is noteworthy that when he was working with Hart , Rodgers was in the habit of writing the songs arst and then having Hart put lyrics to them . With Oscar Ham merstein. the process was reverser I and so was it with Stephen Sondheiin for I hi l Heor n Waltz ? Beyond the fact that he voluntarily look himself out of Columbia University before finishing the holds honorary doctorates in music , humane letters and law ) , Rodgers 's early years were singularly lacking in upheaval . Unlike the stereotyped kid from the lower East Side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times where his next meal was coming from , and was constantly encouraged by his parents . Dr. and Mrs. William A. Rodgers . An older brother was equally encouraged to follow in his father 's footsteps and is now a consultant director in obstetrics and gynecology. odgers was born in Manhattan . He has been married for 35 years to the former Dorothy Feiner. a daughter of friends of the family , and the couple have two children : Mary Rodgers Guettel , the composer of Once Upon a Mattress and several scores for television . and Linda Rodgers Melnick , a fine amateur pianist . Mrs. Rodgers is a considerable personality in her own right , an expert collector of art , the inventor of the Jonny Mop for toilets and of a nonwoven , no-stretch material for permanent dress patterns . She is also a gourmet of some standing and the author of an eclectic best seller , lily Favorite Things .

She had once thought she might be a sculptor . " However , " she says , " I knew enough to know I had no talent beyond a certain technical facility so I did n't waste my time at it . Dick did n't have much interest in visual things at first , or , for that matter , in food . He just was n't aware . Now he cares as much as I do . " Rodgers went to Columbia for the express purpose of composing for the varsity shows , which he did in 1920 and 1921 . Both of his principal collaborators , Hart and Hammerstein , were Columbia men , although Rodgers did the varsity shows with Hart . The Rodgers-Hart association continued uncertainly for a number of years with one professional and several amateur productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up with their first big hit . Garrick Gaieties . Rodgers 's collaboration with Hart lasted for 24 years , Hart was a deeply neurotic man , literally difficult to bring to book , but Rodgers stayed with him until 1943 , when . shortly after a revival of their Connecticut Yankee , Hart , who had been in failing health , died . Rodgers had already  --  at Hart 's urging  --  collaborated with Oscar Hammerstein on Oklahoma ! Rodgers and Hart and Rodgers and Hammerstein also put in some time in Hollywood , but the experience left Rodgers unstimulated . Besides the Park Avenue duplex . there is a country place at Southport . Conn. , where the Rodgers go weekends and where the composer will so far unbend as to play croquet . But he has no other hobbies and no preoccupation other than the writing of music . " Each new project becomes a hobby of its own for me , " he told a friend some weeks ago . " I heard a very interesting definition of work last night from a lawyer . Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do .

I 'd find an evening of bridge hard work . because you have to think like hell and at the end you get nothing for it . There is n't anything I wanted to do that I have n't , " he continued . " At the same time , there is n't anything I 've ever done that I did n't want to do better . I would like , if I can . to broaden the possibilities of the musical theater . I think there 's a better Oklahoma ! someplace , a better West Side Story . And I 'd like to be mixed up in it . " ?    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
