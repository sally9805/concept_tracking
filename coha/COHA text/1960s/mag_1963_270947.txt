Castroite terrorists have long made targets of Americans in Venezuela . In the past year the Castroite F.A.L.N. has bombed U.S. oil pipelines , set fire to U.S.-owned warehouses and stores , once boldly invaded the U.S. military mission and then put the place to the torch . " If the military advisers do not go home , " warned the F.A.L.N. in a letter to the U.S. embassy , " Americans in Venezuela are going to be attacked . " Last week the F.A.L.N. added kidnaping to its list of anti-American capers . <P> For the Publicity . The victim was Colonel James K. Chenault , 46 , deputy chief of the U.S. Army mission in Venezuela for the last two years . Leaving his home one morning , he was greeted by four armed hoodlums , ordered into a white 1962 Chevrolet and whisked away . Soon after , a woman called the U.S. embassy to announce : " We just want him for propaganda purposes . We will not harm him . " But then , as Venezuelan police hauled in more leftists , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hostage : the colonel in exchange for 70-odd leftists recently jailed by the government . " Unless our comrades are turned loose , " said the voice on the telephone , " we will not be responsible for the safety of the North American . " <P> Chenault 's kidnaping was only one bang in a string of F.A.L.N. fireworks last week . On the eve of Dec. 1 elections to choose a successor for out going President Rmulo Betancourt , terrorists shot it out with Caracas police , fired on pedestrians , bombed power stations . Gift-wrapped bombs were sent to four of Venezuela 's seven presidential candidates ( all the packages were intercepted ) ; five youths and a girl hijacked an Avensa airliner and forced the pilot to fly to Trinidad , where authorities arrested the hijackers and later turned them over to Venezuela . <P> By the Numbers . But such nasty little showboating stunts to disrupt the elections were not the only things the Castroites had in mind . Last week Be tancourt offered proof that Communist Cuba was sending in heavy arms ship ments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arsenal of three tons of F.A.L.N. weapons : 31 submachine guns , five 60-mm. mortars , 20 bazookas , 28 packages of plastic explosives , 81 Belgian automatic rifles with 20,000 rounds of ammunition . Most of the serial numbers and other markings were ground off . But one rifle still had a number - it turned out to be part of a lot sold to Cuba in 1959 by Belgium 's Fabrique Nationale . Chemical tests on a submachine gun brought up the faint outlines of the Cuban armed forces coat of arms . On other weapons , where the markings were obliterated , the position of the scrapings gave Castro away . <P> Calling in ambassadors of the hemisphere nations , Venezuela 's Foreign Minister accused Castro of " an act of aggression . " He announced that Venezuela would demand an emergency OAS Council meeting , and President Betancourt proposed a concerted hemisphere campaign to oust Castro from Cuba . " Joint action will be necessary , " he said , " to finish with this bridgehead of Communism in Latin America . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
