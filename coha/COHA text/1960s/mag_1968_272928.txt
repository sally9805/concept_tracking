Wal , it 's spring and the sap is runnin ' high at Disney 's . They 've perduced melliferous live-action pitchers ' fore Family Band , but this'n could be cut up and used for flypaper-and mebbe ought to be . <P> It 's Nebraska 1888-election year , git the topicality ? Grandpa composes a real rip-snortin ' campaign song for Cleveland ( Let 's Put It Over with Grover ) and every dang one of his relations accompanies him on a instrument . There 's Mom ( Janet Blair ) , Dad ( Buddy Ebsen ) and eight kids so durn sweet you could eat ' em up , cep'n they 'd cause diabetes . Wai , ' fore you know it everybody 's bein ' as colorful as a cartoon , droppin ' g 's , singin ' passels of ungrammatical songs ( " ' bout you , ' bout me , ' bout us , ' bout we " ) and pronouncin ' just about ev-erythin ' on the fust syllable : Ree-pub-lican , convention , Yew-nited States , till you 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't you know someone 'd turn up and ruin it all ? He 's John Davidson , a singin ' journalist-they 're the wust kind-who finds the shiny-eyed eldest daughter ( Lesley Ann Warren ) to his likin ' . Trouble is , the boy 's a Ree-publican , and Democrat Grandpa finds him ree-voltin ' Eventually Davidson talks the family into drivin ' their folks ' wagon on down to his home in Dakota , but that do n't make no never mind . It 's feudin ' and fightin ' soon 's they git there . The young lovers fall out - but not out of the pitcher , unfortunately . Grandpa gits so riled he wo n't even conduct the family bane no more . The argyments continue up to ee-lection night , when Benjamin Harrison beats out Grover ( hope that do n't spile the suspense none ) . In the end , the couple gits reunited o' course , Grandpa picks up his baton , and it 's choke-up time again , bringin ' tears to the eyes and a lump to the studio . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's somethin ' else . Matter of fact , he 's Walter Brennan and that means his creaky voice is goin ' to turn all s 's to slush . " Be sheein ' ya shometime , " he threatens . If it 's in this kind of shtuff , nineteen-sheventy-eight would be too shoon.
