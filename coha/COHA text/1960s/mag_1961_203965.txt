Ever since Bach , Germany has been considered ( and has considered itself ) the center of the musical universe . No other nation could match its composers , conductors and performers . But recently the tradition has seemed tarnished , and last week German music lovers were examining the problem posed in two newspaper articles with the ominous title : " Will Germany Remain a Musical Country ? " <P> The postwar generation of German composers consists principally of Hans Werner Henze and Karlheinz Stockhausen , two talented avantgardists . Among conductors , only Wolfgang Sawallisch stands out . But the articles ' authors ( Music Instructors Wilhelm Maler , Wolfgang Fortner and Wilhelm Twittenhoff ) are most worried by the lack of instrumentalists . Not since World War II has a German contestant won first prize at a major international music competition , while Russia and the U.S. , they point out , have virtually a corner on the market . <P> In Russia there are 1,800 state-supported primary music schools , 160 four-year technical schools , 22 five-year conservatories , plus an assortment of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. are also impressive . One in six American youngsters plays an instrument , report Maler &; Co. , as compared to one in every 16 German youngsters . The reason ? Most American schools provide two hours of music instruction weekly through the first six grades . Part of the trouble in Germany , say the educators , is that schools do not detect talent early enough . <P> Although the German study contained some greatly exaggerated figures ( it reported , for instance , that a third of U.S. high school students major in music ) , the U.S. record of musical growth is an impressive one . There are about 60,000 music instructors who teach in schools and colleges today , as compared with perhaps 1,500 in 1920 . There are upward of 50,000 school bands , 40,000 orchestras , 150,000 choruses . On one point , however , the Germans can take comfort : all that training has yet to produce the equivalent of even one of the Three Bs.                @ @ @ @ @
