By CHARLTON OGBURN JR , THE BATTLE TO SAVE THE TREES " The generality of Americans . . have an unconquerable aversion to trees ; and whenever a settlement is made , they cut away all before them without mercy . . . . They are looked upon as a nuisance , and the man that can cut down the largest number , and have the fields about his house most clear of them , is looked upon as the most industrious citizen , and the one that is making the greatest improvements in the country . " So wrote an Irishman , Isaac Weld Jr. , of his travels in the United States in the years 1795-97 . In those days , as our visitor conceded , the face of the country was overspread with trees , Nothing could be farther from the truth today , but still on the outskirts of our cities where the New America of the suburbs is coming into being , the remaining stands of trees arc being attacked with much the same zeal that Isaac Weld lamented . He found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun act with such prodigious power , some few trees near the habitations should not be spared , whose foliage might afford a cooling shade ? .. " Today , as I watch the bulldozers clear the way , scrape the landscape clean for new subdivisions , I find it still strange , even frightening . Must we ruthlessly destroy our countryside in order to live in it ? As a member of the Park Authority of one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation  --  Fairfax , Virginia , just outside Washington , D.C. ? I am forced to witness more destruction of the landscape than is seen by the average suburbanite . For example , there was a sixty-acre tract , mostly forest , near a proposed park site in Springfield , Virginia . When I first saw this forest it was an intricate community of oaks , dogwoods , orchids , mosses and lichens , squirrels , mice , woodpeckers and moths ; its spongy topsoil teemed with microscopic organisms . On my next visit , a few days later , nothing remained but some piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center was going in there . Such a scene is characteristic of other developing areas . In California , developers wreck whole hills , encircling them with gouged-out terraces to multiply house sites . An aerial view of the outskirts of any of our expanding cities shows houses laid out like trains of boxcars , in uniform ranks on a denuded plain . From the ground , the bare , bleak vistas of regimented homes with only telephone poles and television aceials breaking the expanse of roofs arc as depressing as the sight of slums , if in a different way . A supplier of kitchen equipment , a man who has built model houses and has worked with builders all over the country , expressed a judgment which few , even in the building industry , would d ispute , when he said , " A good ninety per cent of all housing tracts must be featureless , badly laid out and totally barren . " Why is this so ? Can we do anything about it ? Recently I set out to try to find some answers to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have learned that we do not need to destroy our countryside in order to live in it . We can meet the demand for millions of new houses and still preserve trees and our natural landscape . But I also learned that the problem of curbing the bulldozer is a lot tougher than I had imagined  --  that it is going to take a far wider exercise of vision than is being displayed today . Also , in the long run we face some difficult choices in land use by , and housing for , our increasing population . It is estimated that in the next fifteen years our metropolitan population will increase by 60,000,000 , and of these , 25,000,000 will move into new houses in suburbs . This is just a fifteen-year projection , looking no farther into the future than World War II lies in the past . Will the land for the oncoming developments he scalped and flat-toned , or will the new dwellings be fitted into the existing terrain with minimum destruction of trees and undergrowth , of stream beds , rock outcroppings and contours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important difference in the kind of country we have to live in  --  and in the kind of people we arc . Or so I believe . Let us look first at some practical reasons for saving and living with trees . A thirty-five-foot oak or maple having a total leaf surface of about 4000 square feet will evaporate more than thirty-five gallons of water during a summer day , according to computations by Prof. Paul J. Kramer of Duke University . By evaporation and deflection of the sun 's rays , the Urban Land Institute , Washington , D.C. , points out , a tree will reduce the heating effect of the sun on the area below it by as much as a half . But even more informative than figures is the experience of driving into a wooded park after dark in the summer . City streets , cooked to as high as 135 degrees by the sun , radiate heat all night long . In a tree-shaded area , the temperature drops with the sun . In our country , with its history of rampaging rivers and gullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function of natural plant cover in holding soil and water . The story of erosion and of the siltation of streams and rivers , which destroys aquatic life , clogs channels and causes floods , has been told frequently and well , but generally in terms of bad farming practices . Less well understood is the extent to which the damage is compounded by bulldozing off the vegetation and the topsoil , during the development of subdivisions . The District of Columbia 's famous Rock Creek , which winds through its chief park after draining an adjacent part of Maryland , tends to flood twice as badly as it did twenty years ago . You know why when you read a statement by Harold P. Guy of the United States Geological Survey pointing out how the water-holding capacity of the watershed has been reduced , as for example in a subdivision in Kensington , Maryland , from which " nearly all of the trees were removed and the natural waterways were altered . " After this scalping , each inch of runoff from rain falling on the area carried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty times as much as from an equivalent undeveloped watershed . Further reading tells you that in the Washington area as a whole the streams now move about 1,000,000 tons of sediment a year , helping to explain why game fishing has ' ( Continued on Page 68 ) suffered so severely in the lower Potomac and why experts debate the ways and means of keeping the Washington harbor open in the future . Certainly we do n't need to depend on trees to keep us cool ; we can buy air-conditioning equipment . With money  --  lots and lots of it  --  we can maintain our water supply and control floods by means of reservoirs , levees and similar engineering works . But the most lavishly financed mechanical ingenuity will not manufacture peace of mind or keep us in tune with our environment . Discord and conflict seem implicit when we build habitations which suggest an army of occupation deployed upon a ravaged land . When , on the other hand , our dwellings seem to belong where they are , to be part of their surroundings rather than invaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of having roots . We even gain some of the serenity which is apt to be the scarcest commodity of all in the abundant life . Of course , there are subdivisions which are good by any reasonable standards , and the National Association of Home Builders , with 40,000 members , is encouraging more of them with its Development Merit Awards . Each year the association finds noteworthy examples of developers who are " working with nature instead of against it in land planning " and gives awards to projects which incorporate " the highest standards of land planning , design and development . " Near my home is an award-winning subdivision , Potomac Overlook , built on a steep , forested hillside on the Maryland side of the river just above the District of Columbia . The nineteen houses it corn-prises are fairly expensive ; they sold originally for between 527,000 and 540,000 , but no purchaser is likely to lose on his investment . Potomac Overlook is an exciting example of what a builder with an active conscience can do when working with lots of between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but difficult site . Most of the trees have been saved  --  black oaks and tulip trees soaring thirty or forty feet before branching  --  and so has much of the original forest floor . This , wrapped around the small lawns , ties the human handiwork into the terrain . The contemporary-style houses , although only three years old , look as if they had always been meant to be there . When Potomac Overlook had been just about completed  --  the stage at which some developers might hesitate to tour their creations without police protection  --  the builders and the new homeowners gave each other a party . Subcontractors , county officials and laborers all came to it . Tables were set up in a carport , beer , soft drinks and mountains of fried chicken were served , and musical skits were put on in which each side ribbed the other 's foibles . It was a fair enough demonstration of the good will on both sides . Another subdivision on the outskirts of the nation 's capital , Pine Spring , built in 1952 , shows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here originally were priced at 515,250 to 520,500 . The tract did n't seem to offer much  --  it was fifty-five acres of spindly woods west of Falls Church , Virginia . But each of the 125 houses was individually sited by the architects to make the most of the land and the builders . Luria Brothers , saved every possible tree . The horizontal planes of the lawns and low , ground-hugging houses , opening to the outdoors through floor-to-ceiling windows , contrast with the vertical forms of the columnar pines and oaks to create a somewhat Japanese effect , and a charming one , It is not surprising to find a high degree of community spirit and pride among the Pine Springers . They issue an anneal directory , which includes names and ages of children and interests of adults ; they have taken pains to add further imaginative planting , shrub-screened patios and other inprovements to already desirable properties . When resold , houses in Pine Spring have brought as much as 55000 above their original price . Summing it up , House and Home  --  a magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay a skilled architect than to overpay a salesman . " I talked to one of Pine Spring 's architects , Francis D. Lethbridge , who also had a hand in designing Potomac Overlook . " To save the existing vegetation always takes trouble and almost always costs more , " he said . " The developer can sell all the houses even if he does n't leave a tree standing , so why should he worry ? The answer is  --  he usually does n't . Someone asked one of our big developers if he did n't want to leave any more creditable monument behind him than a spread of subdivisions resembling Siberian penal colonies . His reply was : ' I do n't want any monument except a tombstone . ' " If you 're going to preserve anything of the natural cover , " Lethbridge continued , " you 've got to preserve the contours . Lower the grade a few inches , and you scalp it completely . Raising the grade is just as had . Even the biggest tree is apt to die if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To adapt yourself to the land as it is , you have to visualize the finished product before you turn a spadeful of earth . You have to plan every element  --  location of houses , roads , utilities  --  simultaneously . Everything depends upon having a builder who cares , one who 'd find it hard to live with himself January 28 , trier if he were known for having loused up the countryside , " Indeed , the builder has to care  --  that was the main thing 1 learned from every subdivision in which the natural setting had been carefully protected . Take , for example , Green Acres , a subdivision of 516,500 to $32,000 houses built on a 130-acre tract near Wilmington , Delaware , The forest had been in process of reclaiming the area for the past thirty or forty years . Here the developers , Franklin Builders , dedicated eight acres to public use and preserved belts of woods behind and between the rows of houses . They also left the trees almost untouched right up to the foundation walls , at great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front yard . ) The result is an award-winning subdivision , and one in which the governor of Delaware chooses to live in a middle-priced house . The same care is the hallmark of other award-winning subdivisions , such as Kendallwood near Detroit . where the Thompson Brown Company used curvilinear streets flowing with the contour of the land , as well as retaining walls costing up to 51500 each , in order to limit regrading and to save the trees . Thompson Brown makes a practice of calling in land planners before permitting the first saw on the site . Then , in the Southwest , outside of Tucson , Arizona , is Suffolk Hills , where 195 homes , costing an average of 520,000 , on one-acre lots have been creatively tailored to the landscape . Lusk Homes , the builder , was commended by the N.A.H.B. judges not only for preserving the desert vegetation , including saguaro cacti , and ocotillo , but also for siting the houses in a way that blends the roollines with the rolling terrain . These results were not easily achieved ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted . Before condemning the average builder out of hand , it is worth listening to Edmund J. Bennett , one of the builders of Potomac Overlook , an outstanding subdivision . " I figure we spent a year more on the job than we 'd have had to if we 'd just gone in there and flattened everything . Also by flattening we 'd have got twice as many building sites . We located every major tree on a big topographic map and cranked them all into the plan . Each house was carefully sited . " Bennett also points out that Potomac Overlook ran into man-made as well as natural obstacles , because of its plans to fit houses to the landscape . " To avoid regrading , we had to put in driveways with as much as sixteen-percent grade , " he said " We could get away with it because we were not dependent on FHA financing . ( FHA limits driveway grades to five per cent . ) We had to get a waiver from the Department of Public Works for a stretch of street with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a period of three months . Then there were the sewer lines . The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission says that the floor of a basement may not be more than six feet below the street , which means the first floor must be three feet above the street . But to keep from butchering the land we had to have houses below street level  --  and run the sewers through easements along back property lines in the woods . With all the extra cost of hand labor , the commission hated like the devil to agree to it . " The builder is up against other unyielding facts . There is , probably , a road code . For a secondary residential street twenty-five or thirty feet wide , it will specify a cleared right of way of , say , sixty feet . The permissible grade will be perhaps 10 per Cent . When the street meets rising ground , a cut must be made , and the sides of the cut must not be too steep , perhaps only 30 per cent in grade , So our sixty-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-street parking will add twenty feet . There is also the matter of " sight distances . " The speed limit may be twenty-five miles per hour , but where streets cross , the code may specify leveling the ground far enough back to permit cars doing forty mph to see each other in ample time to stop . Enters now the Federal Housing Administration , If the builder wishes to be able to offer FHA financing with its low down payments , he will have to limit the grade of his driveways , as pointed out . Because buyers generally do not like to climb long flights of stairs to reach the house , bulldozing out a driveway may necessitate cutting off the top of the entire lot . Another regulation specifies that the lot slope down from the house on all sides . That , too , can mean drastic regrading . The FHA was not set up to be either for or against trees . Its sole function is to guarantee mortages , and its concern is with market values . The Veterans Administration , which guarantees mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows FHA 's lead . " I will wager that FHA and VA have received thousands of complaints about poor lot grading , unwanted water from an uphill neighbor or flat spots that do n't drain rapidly , " says Cushing Daniel , director of the Home Builders Association of Metropolitan Washington , " and probably not one thank you for waiving a grading requirement to permit the saving of a fine tree . " As Government agencies do n't want complaints . " they have evolved a pat formula , " says Daniel . " This results in a ' kilo-mold ' type of land plan and the virtual impossibility of saving any original topography . " Many subdivisions are barren not because the builder laid a violent hand on a single tree but because the tract was treeless pastureland to begin with  --  not that lack of trees justifies the destruction of the natural configuration and topsoil . If the tract is not served by a sewer line , the county authorities will probably insist on an adequate septic field , with every tree within ten feet of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compaction of the soil under the tread of heavy machinery can be fatal to trees  --  and the damage may not be apparent for a year or more , when the houses will have been built and the removal of a tree will have become costly . So the builder , who often is responsible , is tempted to get rid of any doubtful cases while he can still do it cheaply . At the end , if the builder has made a burning issue of saving trees , can he be sure his labors will be appreciated ? Take 6g the case of Ralph Schacter of the North American Building Corporation . Mr. Schacter is an ardent tree-lover . When you drive into North American 's 300-acre Fawn Ridge development north of Peekskill , New York , you are warned by a large sign : NOTICE TO ALL TRADES TREES ARE SACRED . TREES MUST BE KEPT IN PERFECT CONDITION . Do NOT DESTROY UNLESS CONSTRUCTION " SUPER . " GIVES APPROVAL . ANYONE GUILTY OF DAMAGING TREES WILL BE PUT OFF JOB . The huge oaks and copses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he points to an oblong oak stump  --  four feet in maximum width  --  standing by the entrance to a newly completed house and exclaims . " The trouble we went to to save that tree ! And you know what the buyer said ? ' Take it away . ' That cost us a hundred seventy-five dollars . " Many of North American 's customers are apartment dwellers buying their first house , and buying in a low price range . These , Mr. Schacter finds , are the least likely to appreciate trees . But he is ready for them . He hauls them into his office and gives them a lecture on preserving nature , illustrated with color photographs . " A year after they 've settled in , they 're all for trees , " he says . " Yeah , " comments another official of the company . " and giving builders a headache by their agitation for large-lot zoning to protect the woods everywhere else . " Growing discrimination on the part of buyers  --  and higher personal incomes with which to back it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices . If buyers pass up the scalped lot , builders will have more incentive to restrain the bulldozer . There are signs that this incentive is working . The Urban Land Institute in its hard-headed Community Builder 's Handbook states : " Healthy existing trees on the development site should be saved wherever possible . A good tree will add greatly to the value of the lot . " Edward R. Carr , a large-scale builder of Springfield , Virginia , whose program of saving trees has been widely praised , says that just by looking at a sales plat he can tell which lots have the best trees ; they are the ones that have sold first . In advising builders on How TO SUCCEED WITH TODAY 'S SERIOUS BUYERS , House and Home points out that the leaders in the industry " are finding that attractive neighborhoods give them a big comparative edge , particularly with second- and third-time buyers . They are laying out lots to take advantage of the land . " FHA could well recognize this trend , and encourage it , by giving greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalping all but mandatory orr hilly terrain . FHA says it will give " maximum valuations " where the builder 's plans call for saving trees , but the differential is small , and the agency shies away from giving an individual lot a higher valuation when trees have been preserved on it . The requirement for virtually level driveways seems to me wholly uncalled-for . We should ask ourselves , 1 submit , whether we are building for motoring or for living . Does it make sense to require residential streets to meet the standards of highways , providing drivers with the opportunity and temptation to go tearing through , to the peril of children and anxiety of parents ? Must we go on sacrificing the human values of charm , beauty , . privacy and peace and fix upon our 70 country that open , bare look fur the minor convenience of motorists ? It is not written in the Constitution or the Ten Commandments that highway departments shall rule supreme . There is nothing , either , to prevent local authorities , particularly planning boards or county engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence for good site planning . ( Nothing , that is , but the political power of unscrupulous builders . ) The town of North Castle , in Westchester County , New York , has adopted an ordinance , typical of those of a growing number of communities , which requires that plans of developments show the areas from which trees will be removed and states that " no live tree exceeding three inches in diameter may be cut down in such areas without expressed consent of the Planning Board . " This is not just a statement of pious intent ; inspections are rigorous , and the Planning Board makes the ordinance stick . Moreover , says Chief Hergenham of the North Castle police with a wry grin , " If you want to cut down a tree along the highway , the garden club will-fight you all the way to Albany . " Conscientious builders would , I believe , welcome tree-saving ordinances as tending to put them on a fairer basis with less-scrupulous competitors . As a matter of fact , a building firm of North Castle has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds stipulate : " No trees of any kind located on the highway or road in front of or adjoining the said described plot shall be cut down , destroyed or removed without the written consent of the grantor , its successors or assigns . " This subdivision of 533,000-570,000 homes is being developed by Edward J , Tobin and Mac Welson on a 1000-acre tract of luxuriant forests , reefs of exposed , lichen-covered granite , specimen plantings of hemlock , beech and spruce , topped off by four ponds . It is , I might add , the most beautiful development I have ever seen , The local pride it fires was demonstrated to me on a guided tour by Chief Hergenham , with commentary : " The builders hold all supplies at the barn and bring them to the site only as needed , to keep from piling them on the vegetation . . . This is the Ales-bergs ' house . How 's that for saving a tree ? It goes right through the overhang of the roof ! " If builders , buyers and public boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . But the melancholy fact is that our worries still would not be over . The larger the lot , the more of the topography the builder can save  --  but large lots present two big problems : 11 ) Many people can not afford them and ( 2 ) the larger the lots , the faster suburbia gobbles up the countryside . li the large-lot mania continues , says Stephen Sussna , a planning consultant of Trenton , New Jersey , " this nation faces a danger that in the near future there will be no suitable residential building sites available . " THE Some innovators have come up with an answer in the form of the " cluster " type of development . This draws houses together in fan-shaped groups fronting on a common garden-and-parking courtyard . It reserves unspoiled , in joint ownership , the land to the rear and between the clusters . It amounts to the owners ' pooling their spare acreage for the common enjoyment . Not only does this conserve more of the lamal setting but it reduces the length of roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Sussna Associates has a partial cluster-type development under way on a seventy-seven-acre tract in Mount Laurel , New Jersey , in which houses have quarter-ere lots , and the project as a whole has over seven acres of park . In St. Louis , architect Roger Montgomery has designed a cluster development for the Ballas Corporation utilizing a rough tract zoned for one-acre lots . By concentrating the houses in nine groups of five to seven each , he found he could reduce street length by a third while serving 15 per cent more dwellings and preserve nearly 50 per cent of the site in its natural state . The most striking development of this kind now under way is in an outlying section of Philadelphia known as the Far Northeast . Here 17,000 dwellings , many in the S11,500413,000 range , are being built on a tract of 1800 acres  --  nearly ten to an acre  --  by private builders in accordance with a plan drawn up by // Edmund N. Bacon of the Philadelphia Planning Commission . Row houses , which are economical to build and sparing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are formed by rows of houses rather than individual units . There are green areas within and between the clusters and in addition some 250 acres of stream valley have been dedicated as parks . In comparison with either treeless city blocks or parkless subdivisions of boxlike dwellings each on its own little plot , the Far Northeast comes out far ahead . In fact , many home designers believe our country will have to go farther in this direction . George Nelson , a New York architect and design co-ordinator for the United States National Exhibition in Moscow , says it is unfortunate that " the possession of the one-family detached house is one of the great American dreams . " He believes that it can not meet our future needs . He maintains that " we are eventually going to have to build towers that can house a large number of families . These towers will not take up much land , and they can be surrounded by parks and gardens that will be for the use of all the families . " Many architects and land planners agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that we give up the one-family dwelling as a norm of our national life . But in any case let us use our heads and our good taste to keep a countryside that is a joy to behold , not a treeless , dreary waste .
