The Andes are young and violent mountains , not yet fully grown or pacified by time . Still-active volcanoes pock the spiny range running the length of western South America . Avalanches rumble down constantly from the 20,000-ft. peaks . And beneath the earth 's jagged crust , fantastic forces grind and churn , producing violent earthquakes-most often in Chile . Of the thousands of big and little tremors recorded around the world each year , about 15% occur in Chile . One quake in 1906 took 3,000 lives . Another in 1939 left 30,000 dead . Five years ago , still another killed 5,000 people . Last week Chile had the shakes again . <P> Rain of Stone . The time was 12:33 on a bright , warm Sunday afternoon . President Eduardo Frei was watching an air show outside Santiago when an invisible force seemed to seize and shake him . In Santiago 's Hipodromo , 3,000 racing fans fled in panic as the grandstand roof heaved and cracked . Terrified swimmers in the open-air pool of the Hotel Carrera watched the water suddenly leap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court and Congress buildings and rained down on the street . <P> <P> The quake lasted for one full minute across an area of 130,000 square miles . At its most severe , it registered 7.5 on the Richter scale ( v. 8.5 for the 1960 quake ) , and for two hours it set seismographs squiggling as far away as central Italy , 7,500 miles to the east . Reports from Santiago told of 200 houses heavily damaged ; amazingly , only four people were dead and ten injured . In Valparaiso , Chile 's major seaport , close to 30% of the buildings were damaged with 15 persons killed . Throughout the central part of the country , water mains burst , buildings collapsed , and whole towns seemed to dance . <P> <P> Most seriously hit was El Cobre , a tiny copper town run by a subsidiary of Baron Guy de Rothschild 's Socit Minire et Mtallurgique de Penarroya . For 35 years the mineowners had channeled their slag into a reservoir behind a 230-ft. earth dam . Just below the dam were the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremors came , the dam gave way , and the thick , muddy waste exploded out across the valley , burying 200 people in seconds . One woman who saw it coming managed to scramble up a slope in time . " I could feel the muck spattering on my heels , " she recalled later . " Behind me there was nothing left , absolutely nothing . Only silence . " <P> Now to Rebuild . President Frei ordered army units into stricken areas with bulldozers , food and clothes . A tent village sprang up outside El Cobre , and the afternoon after the quake Frei himself arrived . " This is terrible , terrible , " he repeated . " Seor Presidente , help us , " pleaded one miner . " That is why I am here , " said Frei , " to be with you . " Army engineers dug for bodies , found 60 . <P> At week 's end the country 's death toll was approaching 300 . Some 18,000 people were homeless , and the total damage was estimated at between $50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mapped out relief and reconstruction programs , ordered an inquiry to determine whether the mining company or government inspectors were guilty of negligence in permitting the miners to live at the base of the El Cobre dam .
