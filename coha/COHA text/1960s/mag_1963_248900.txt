Great Britain 's Great Politics <P> Sir : As an American studying in London , I found the recent prime-ministerial crisis intensely interesting because of its profound implications and its sharp contrast with the American processes of selecting a governmental head . <P> Your excellent article Oct. 25 acutely illustrated these differences and their implications . <P> To me it is utter folly that one should criticize Lord Home 's appointment on the basis that he is an aristocrat and therefore has little knowledge of , and even less compassion for , the problems of the laborer . Franklin D. Roosevelt , the unquestioned champion of the American workingman and a wealthy aristocrat of the first order , would presumably also be considered by Mr. Harold Wilson an " elegant anachronism . " I believe such a label would , in fact , be held in contempt by the vast majority of Mr. Wilson 's own Labor Party . As can be seen by the example of Mr. Roosevelt or that of Mr. Kennedy , wealth and lineage do not necessarily preclude sensitivity and a sense of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRUCE T. LEITMAN London <P> Sir : You say that Lord Home wo n't tolerate nepotism in government . Thanks for warning us that he is against Kennedy-style government . <P> WARREN SNYDER Evanston , 111 . <P> <P> Sir : In your cover story Oct. 11 on Mr. Harold Wilson , you stated : " Laborites accepted the ban on a foreign policy debate at the party conference without question . Asked if Gaitskell would have resorted to such tactics , Wilson replied : ' No-but he would have lost the election . ' " <P> Mr. Wilson made no such comment at any time , and , indeed , the decision to concentrate on home affairs was decided upon by the Conference Arrangements Committee-a body elected by the conference and not by Mr. Wilson . <P> JOHN HARRIS The Labor Party London <P> Sir : Is the Labor Party 's " modernized symbol , " shown on TIME 'S cover , a weather vane ? It is certainly an optical illusion , heralding an East wind or a West wind-depending on which way you look at it . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up of three elements : the spade and pen , representing workers of both the hand and the brain , linked by the torch . The symbol came into being in 1918 , following the formation of a new party constitution , and is thought to have been designed by Jimmie Middleton , who was then general secretary of the party . For that original version , see cut . ) The stylized version of the symbol that TIME used in the background of the Wilson cover portrait was prepared 2 years ago by Jack Stoddard of the Labor Party 's art department. - ED . <P> <P> Mystery Story ? <P> Sir : The " mysterious reason " that you mention in your Oct. 18 article for the detainment of U.S. convoys by the Communists is not so complex as it appears . The Russians , as they have shown the last few months , want a cold war thaw , but they also realize that ' 64 is election year . By creating this incident , they hoped to undermine the American 's confidence in J.F.K. 's foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , inexperienced President . <P> JAMES R.
