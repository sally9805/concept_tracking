" Imperialist beast . Bandit , hypocrite , thief ! " screamed the radios in Fidel Castro 's Cuba , denouncing the U.S. " The U.S. wants to prepare public opinion for military action , " raved Revolution , Castro 's mouthpiece paper , " the same technique as the Alamo in 1836 , the Maine in 1898 , the Lusitania in 1915 . " Said Cuba 's Prime Minister himself : " Those who committed this sabotage are those who were interested in our not getting these arms-officials of the United States Government . " <P> In the week following the explosion of the arms-laden freighter La Coubre in Havana Harbor , the vilification of the U.S. broke all bounds of diplomacy-and even of sanity . Yet once again , in a rapidly deteriorating situation that sees Cuban-American relations reach a new low each day , the U.S. held its temper . <P> Nonsense Talk . At first , Secretary of State Christian Herter offered Castro a diplomatic out for his undiplomatic language , laid the outburst to " emotional strain " over the disaster . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Herter 's patience was tried . He summoned Enrique Patterson , Cuba 's charg d'affaires , to the State Department and read him one of the strongest protests the U.S. has issued in recent years . <P> Said Herter : " The U.S. finds itself increasingly obliged to question the good faith of Your Excellency 's government with respect to a desire for improved relations . " Cuba 's nonsensical answer , delivered by Foreign Minister Ral Roa : The U.S. Secretary of State had personally insulted Diplomat Patterson . " We demand that whenever the United States Government addresses itself to representatives of the revolutionary government , it do so with absolute respect for their official status pursuant to accepted diplomatic standards . " <P> No one knows where Castro 's madness will drive him next . Cuba already has the look of a nation at war . Black-bereted militia drill in Havana 's parks , empty lots , and along the seaside Malecn drive ; children 's yellow-shirted militia go from door to door begging contributions for " arms and planes " ; the government TV station puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . <P> Confiscation &; Forbearance . What is the U.S. to do ? For the time being , the U.S. will continue to grit its teeth and pursue a policy of patience . Secretary of State Herter says that the President is still opposed to taking economic countermeasures , such as cutting Cuba 's sugar quota . The nation is already in difficult financial straits ; its foreign-exchange reserves are down to $88 million , while debts abroad come to between $80 million and $100 million , much of it for the huge arms-buying program . <P>
