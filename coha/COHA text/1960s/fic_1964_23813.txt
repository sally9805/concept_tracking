The Bat Lady A story by Margaret Dursin When Mother and I came back to live in New Amherst with Grandfather and Grandmother , I was very much impressed with being a Winston and , at the malleable age of twelve , hoped that I could grow up and be a credit to the family just like Aunt Fern . Aunt Fern was out West studying physiology in graduate school , and the family talked a great deal about her because she had begun to specialize in bats ' ovaries . The comment was not approving , but I felt that anyone who occasioned as much of it as Aunt Fern must be doing something very important . Grandfather , while believing in freedom of thought and the scientific method , felt conservatively that a female Winston might better have chosen botany as a field for study . Plants , said Aunt Louise , who had married Uncle John , handled their input and output in a much more refined way than did mammals . Aunt Ellen said she had found it simpler to let her friends think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was n't sure but what Fern would be happier if it had been . Grandmother said it was nice that Fern had found something that really interested her . Bats had happened to Aunt Fern by accident . They were not really in the family tradition . Grandfather was professor of Latin at New Amherst University . As a young man he had migrated West from Connecticut , and founded a college in a small town in Illinois where a New Englander could start at the top . After a tussle with the trustees over the relative place of the classics versus domestic science in the curriculum , he hail accepted a silver tea service and a call to teach Latin in New Amherst , Indiana , Grandfather seemed more like a college president than any of the appointees . He had a big white house at the edge of the village , and carved walnut furniture from Connecticut . He had a book-lined library where he passed out Sunday afternoon tea to students , and worked on minor political deals among the faculty members . His Petronius readings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that sexy books , if old , were part of the liberal ideal of education . Officially he said that he had all the fun and none of the work of administering a university . Uncle John said that Grandfather was the first man a new president at New Amherst learned to hate . John and Ellen and my mother and finally Fern all went to the progressive school , the university 72 THE BAT LADY high school , and the university , tuition free , of course . John became an engineer , Ellen married Uncle Bill who was in her class , and my mother taught school for a year and married beneath her . Father was only the third-ranking student in the graduate department of history , and Grandfather warned Mother against a man without ambition . Even when Father became assistant professor of history in an Ivy League college because of his delightful teaching personality , Grandfather prophesied that he would not go far in the academic world . Father died in 1936 , and after that Grandfather always spoke very kindly of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winstons had to marry outside the family , and Aunt Ellen retorted that she 'd married him to get away from that kind of remark . Mother got a job teaching third grade in the New Amherst public school , and cautioned me not to believe everything 1 heard at home , because the Winstons liked to talk a lot . I liked to talk too and , with the ingrained Winston habit of hopcotching between several worlds at once , I mix an what I knew then and know now . What they were talking about then was the - vay Aunt Fern captured the world 's record for keeping 11,1yotis lacifugus alive in captivity . This was academic wild oats , for bats thrive in caves and usually die off in cages . She kept them in the refrigerator for nearly a year . She had taken advantage of the fact that bats hibernate in the winter , living on stored fat like bears . She col1.ected her bats in the fall , and force-ferl them a diet of mealworms , milk , baby food , and hamburger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for a short vacation between summer school and the fall term . Grandfather though ! this displayed the proper Winston spirit , and felt better about having gotten Aunt Fern a fellowship from a university that was located near caves full of bats . The bats were easily collected by cheap graduate-school labor and , as bats required little feeding or care after capture , made excellent laboratory animals . Aunt Fern had already educated the family in ' dl the more elementary facts about the brown bat . Bats have their own system of radar to keep them from bumping into things when they fly . They weigh only a quarter of an ounce , eat live . nseets , and fly around at dusk because that is - .. vhen the insects are most active . People are the worst enemies bats have  --  which is why they do better in inaccessible caves than in barns or houses . Bats have one offspring a year , generally in June . It was this last characteristic that de-aided Aunt Fern on the study of ovaries . A bat ovary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of potential eggs in every ovary . Aunt Fern wrote that she had begun work on the basic problem of why do bats ovulate . Mother said it would be more to the point if Aunt Fern began to wonder why she ovulated . Aunt Ellen said that women who took up unmentionable subjects never got married . Grandfather said she would he famous if she found the answer . Aunt Fern did n't find the answer . She published her doctorate on a series of negative results . Her bats  --  gathered in muddy caves , injected , killed , dissected , the ovaries imbedded in paraffin and sliced thin for microscopic examination  --  continued to behave as nature had planned . Furthermore , Aunt Fern handled her delicate subject in an irreproachably dull manner . The estrous cycle of the bat , as scientifically described by Aunt Fern , left the reader feeling , Mother said , as though she had dealt with the less attractive aspects of the small intestines and the more erudite portions of organic chemistry , and understood neither . Aunt Fern taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until there was an opening in the physiology department at New Amherst , and then she came home . Grandfather liked the idea of two generations of teachers at the university , but Aunt Ellen said she wondered if I 'd grow up with my ovaries intact . As soon as she was established in her new laboratory in the science building , Aunt Fern started to look around for bats to continue her research . Caves were sparse in that part of Indiana . She happened to mention her problem to a man in the publicity department of the university . He made a news item out of it for the Indianapolis papers . The radio picked it up , and by the next afternoon forty-three calls had come for " the bat lady . " Seven of these were from people who had wasps under the eaves . Four more had swallows in their chimneys which they wished to donate to science . Most of the rest were from farmers who had bats in their barns , or from farmers ' wives who wanted the bats removed right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired Although Margaret Dursin insists that her characters are fictitious , she acknowledges that she borrowed from the career of her sister , a physiology major who experimented with bats . Mrs. Dursin , who lives in Pleasantville , New York , teaches Rnglish at , Westchester Community College , and is working on her fourth novel . of explaining that bats were very clean little creatures and didnot attract bedbugs and cockroaches . Grandmother was mortified by a call from a member of her church guild who wanted to know how much Fern would charge to exterminate her attic . " She asked , " said Grandmother , looking sternly at Aunt Fern , " what I did about bugs . " Aunt Fern preferred to regard this as a cultural rather than a personal protest . She said that in some parts of Mexico bats were encouraged in order to keep insect life at a minimum . " I told her , " said Grandmother , that soap and water and elbow grease were the best remedies I knew . " Aunt Fern took me with her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen . I was allowed to go along in the car , together with the more necessary collecting cage and the butterfly net , on the strict understanding that I would not air my knowledge of the ovarian cycle to anyone we met . I remember one visit where the farmhouse was white and spindly next to the huge red barn and the outbuildings , but the farmer 's wife was cordial and looked at Aunt Fern 's delicate features with interest . " You are n't the professor who wants them nasty old birds --  ? I 'll call the mister . He 'll be glad to get rid of them . " " If you 'll show me where they are , I can probably get them myself , " said Aunt Fern . " It 's no trouble , " said the woman . " He 's down at the barn and so are the bats . Cleaning stable today . He 'll be glad of a rest if you do n't mind how he looks . " The farmer not only looked , but smelled . He brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingle with the fragrant smell of baled hay and the dusty odor of straw on the second floor where we stood on the earthen ramp by the open sliding door . A heifer bawled for its mother from below and some heavy animal , perhaps a bull , stamped its feet and shook the timbers . Beside the weatherbeaten man , Aunt Fern looked very childish and pretty in her enthusiasm . She wore her hair in a bun to seem mature , but the blue jeans necessary for climbing among the rafters took ten years off her age . Most girls with Aunt Fern 's figure would have let . the men do the climbing , but she was afraid that inexperienced help would get angry if bitten by a bat , and damage it , or bring down male bats by mistake . She had been bitten hundreds of times , she assured the farmer , but bat teeth were so tiny they did n't leave a scar . She knew just how to catch them . a story by Margaret Dursin 73 The barn was dark inside as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could hardly see Aunt Fern mounting into the dimness . The farmer tested the ladder for a moment and climbed up into the rafters after her . Gradually my eyes became accustomed to the darkness . and I could see Aunt Fern , hanging by one Laud to the ladder , make a sudden swoop with the net and almost lose her balance as the white mesh fluttered . Then she hooked her arm through the ladder , examined the bat , and leaned down to show it to the farmer . I saw the nearly imperceptible shadow of furry wings gliding back to roost . Aunt Fern 's voice rose a little at the farmer 's exclamation of dismay , " Male  --  clean little creatures  --  catch insects . " I noticed the farmer 's wife looking at me . " You must like your aunt a lot , " she said . " Would you like to come and see the heifer . It makes me itchy to watch people on ladders . " After we saw the heifer and a fierce-looking bull , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fern and the farmer . Aunt Fern was in good spirits because she had collected ten female hats , and explained to the farmer 's wife that the best way to get bats out of the house was to open a door a crack and wait for the bat to leave . The farmer 's wife said that she always took a broom to bats after wrapping her hair up in a towel . Aunt Fern said that the bats ' bones were very delicate , and it was better to pick them up gently by the loose skin on the back of the neck . She said she had never met with an authentic case of bats getting into hair , but she suspected the bat would be very frightened at having its feet entangled . The farmer 's wife said she was n't going to take any chances . We drove back to the laboratory so that Aunt Fern could begin the injection series . For a few days she treated her bats as though they were newborn babies , injecting hormones at four-hour intervals , eating , sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain high hormone levels to study the effects on the production of eggs by the ovary . She had a new idea about bats . She thought it would be nice if the ovary could be made to release two eggs instead of one . Aunt Ellen said she knew a woman who had had twins and she felt very sorry for bats , but Aunt Fern explained that the bats would n't really have twins because they did n't live that long , and anyway she did n't keep males around . After a while , the family grew used to Aunt Fern 's negative results , and stopped paying much attention . Periodically , she published her results in the Journal of Experimental Physiology , and stacks of reprints accumulated in her office . The Winstons did n't read them , but Grandfather said that solid research was the backbone of the university and would earn her a promotion in time . If Aunt Fern had announced that she was going to elope with an undergraduate , she could n't have caused more excitement than she did when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboratory after church on Sunday and was late for dinner . Uncle John and Aunt Louise , who had driven over from Fort Wayne , were hungry , so Grandmother served the soup . Aunt Fern came in just as Grandfather was serving the chicken . She sat down , very quiet and glowing . Aunt Louise said that Fern was too young to be an absent-minded professor , and Grandmother added that she did wish Fern would get home for meals on time . Aunt Fern said she had n't forgotten , she was just too busy counting . She had an ovary down at the laboratory that had released either one hundred and one , one hundred and three , or one hundred and four eggs . Every time she counted it came out differently . Another ovary in the series had released seventy . She had to go right back to the lab after dinner and check the rest . Everybody talked at once . Grandfather wanted to know how she did it . Aunt Ellen said it sounded impractical to her . Uncle John said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Axis would do if they could breed like that . Aunt Fern began to speak very fast . She said it was n't a question of breeding anything yet . She must have given the bats an overdose . Two eggs would he of practical interest to cattle breeders  --  that was what she was trying for . And , of course , she had n't proved anything yet , although the series looked very promising . And she did n't know yet how she had done it , because it was very complicated and there were a lot of factors to investigate . She would have to try more bats , and then go on with mice and other laboratory animals . Eventually , she explained , looking at Uncle John , if the results looked promising for human physiology , she had thought of donating an ovary for experimental purposes . Suddenly Grandfather rose in his place and flung his napkin into the gravy boat . " Fern , " he said , " I forbid you to lay eggs . I absolutely forbid you to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He stalked out of the room . Mother remarked that it would certainly be a sensational experiment . Uncle John said he 'd change his name first . Grandmother said that Fern had been carried away by excitement . I was looking at Aunt Fern . Her eyes had gotten very big and black . She looked at everybody at the table as though they were strangers . From her expression , I understood that the family finally meant all the things they had been saying for years . It was n't a joke anymore . She slid out of her chair and ran out of the dining room . As she paused in the hall for her coat , I ran after her . I called for her to wait for me . She did n't stop , but slowed down so that I could follow . We walked in silence down the deserted Sunday afternoon street . At the corner we turned toward the university buildings . I said , " I think one hundred eggs are wonderful . " " I should n't have taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing the matter with bats , " I said . " People just do n't understand . " " They 're connected with witches  --  and superstition . Ovaries / might have gotten by with  --  or just bats by themselves  --  but two queer things are too much . I can see it now I did n't realize I was queer . I thought I was unusual , but not queer . " " You are n't queer . " " Yes , " said Aunt Fern . " Yes , I am . I 've thought myself off the road . That 's one thing the family knows  --  what you can do and what you ca n't do . " " But they should be proud of you . " " I suppose it is sensational from the layman 's point of view , " said Aunt Fern . " I just never thought . Father would hate to have bats ' ovaries and Winstons coupled in the paper . I never thought what would happen if I succeeded . " We turned in at the science building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of her laboratory . " I wish I had n't found anything , " she said , looking at the bats dead in the cage . They were gray and so was the cage . Everything in the lab was some shade of gray or white . It was not very cheerful . Aunt Fern sat down in a chair with her coat still on and just looked . " The thing is , " she said , " how can I stop it ? " " But you must n't stop . All scientists have discouraging times . Look at Reed . Look at Florence Nightingale . You must n't mind what the family says . " " But I 'm family too , " said Aunt Fern . " I 'm a Winston . I do n't want to be a sensation , " " The others do the kind of work they like . Why should n't you do bat ovaries ? " " They do n't really , " said Aunt Fern . " None of them . That 's why they talk so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have married again . John likes construction work , but Louise w'o n't let him travel . Father wanted to he president of New Amherst . That 's why we 're all so respectable . Respectable people do n't have what they want  --  that 's why they cling so to what they have . " " But you can have what you want . " " All I ever wanted to do was to make the family proud of me . I wanted to out-Winston the Winstons , not knock them on the head . " She looked at the slide under the microscope . " And now I 'm stuck with one hundred and three eggs  --  maybe one hundred and four . I never could count . " " Throw it out , " I said . " Nobody knows . " " I ca n't do that , " said Aunt Fern . " Where would science be if a researcher started to throw out facts that were personally unattractive ? " She took off her coat and put on her white smock . " l ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'd better go home and eat your dinner . " The family was still talking when I got home . Grandmother asked where Fern was , and I said , working . Grandfather said that physiology was closely relateC ? medicine , and he thought he could see his way nnancially clear to sending Fern through medical school if she would like that . Aunt Louise said that she understood people did marvelous things with plant breeding , and there was all that land out in back of the house . Mother said that perhaps Fern had n't discovered anything after all ; one experiment could be very a story by Margaret Dursin 75 misleading . Uncle John said , but why leave her in a spot where she might discover things ? Grandmother said that a bright inquiring mind like Fern 's should be able to find many other interesting subjects to explore . I thought then that all the Winstons always had bright inquiring minds , and perhaps , like milk , they had curdled a little from sitting too long . And I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would know what to do better than any of the others , but right then I did not want to get into any conversation at all about Aunt Fern . I was glad my name was not Winston and that I was too young to talk at Sunday dinner . Until Wednesday , Aunt Fern spent all her time at the lab , and only came home to sleep . She came home to dinner that night and announced that she was going to be made an associate professor . She said she had had a very satisfactory talk with Dr. Millser . He was head of the biology department , and titular head of physiology , because it was a small , specialized subject . Aunt Fern had a soft gentle voice , and she had the Winston gift for words when she put her mind to it . She said she had shown Dr. Millser some of her experimental data and explained that , if the results were verified , the problem of released eggs would be more than the physiology personnel should he asked to cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field for experiment , and she thought that it might call for collaboration on the part of many departments in the university  --  social science and animal husbandry , for example . She felt that the biology department was the logical place to direct such experiments . Dr. Millser , she said , had been so interested that she had felt able to explain to him that she had been dissatisfied for some time with the division of the work load in physiology , and she would like very much to have a somewhat heavier teaching schedule with proportionally less research , provided , of course , that she had the professional recognition to go with it . Dr. Millser thought she could be an associate professor if that was what she wanted . Within a week , the family had stopped talking about Aunt Fern 's promotion , because Aunt Ellen had announced that she was going to adopt a baby . Aunt Fern said that if people were anything like bats , which was the premise on which she had based a successful career , then she would mistrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped they would n't want to name it after him .
