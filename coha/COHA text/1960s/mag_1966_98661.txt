There was a great deal of celebrating in Miami last January when the Dolphins announced the names of the players they had chosen in the AFL 's expansion draft . Since the AFL allowed its clubs to freeze only 23 men each , the Dolphins were able to pick up 19 AFL regulars among a fairly solid nucleus of 32 players . On the surface they emerged so much better off than any previous expansion team that some AFL observers claimed the new entry was already superior to Denver , which is struggling into its seventh season . // However , what looks lovely in January can lose its glow by September . Four of the original 32  --  Fullback Jack Spikes , Offensive Guard Ken Rice , Offensive Tackle Jim Davidson and Defensive Tackle Howard Simpson  --  retired from the game . Rice came back but missed much valuable work . Miami gave up Linebacker Ron Caveness to Houston for negotiation rights to Tulsa Quarterback Bill Anderson , who signed with the NFL . Safety Man Ross O'Hanley ruptured a tendon in his thigh and is out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles , not only among the players but with the franchise itself . // Miami , then , seems destined for the same fate as other expansion teams , which is season-long occupancy of last place . The Dolphins catch Oakland , New York , Buffalo and San Diego in their first four games , and it is not until October 16 that they will have a chance to show whether they are as good as Denver . // That does not mean the Dolphins will be a breeze for their other opponents . Miami is going to be forced to fill the air with passes , and any team that does that can be a problem . Miami will be throwing for two reasons , one good and one bad . The good one is that the Dolphins have some fine receivers . The bad one is that they are very weak on running backs . Billy Joe , 235-pound fullback obtained from Buffalo , suffered from double vision as the result of a concussion and has been slow in coming around . In desperation Miami Coach George Wilson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Fullback Rick Casares , a 35-year-old free agent . Wilson has little hope that Casares can help much as a runner . But Casares and Billy Joe are big backs and could help quite a bit by blocking for a quarterback who is trying to fling the ball downfield to someone . If that fails , a 219-pound rookie , Sam Price of Illinois , is a running-back possibility . // But in throwing the ball , ah , that is something else again . At quarterback the Dolphins have Dick Wood , an excellent deep passer , along with rookies Rick Norton , the very promising No. 1 draft choice from Kentucky , and George Wilson Jr. , the coach 's son , who can double as punter . Wood has a chronic bad knee and seems to be boxing the compass in the AFL . But when he has time he can throw the bomb with accuracy , as he proved at New York and Oakland . Wilson has never made it as a regular at Kansas City or Boston , although it must be said in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parilli . Besides being a rookie , Norton also has a bad knee . No Miami quarterback was impressive in preseason games , but that was to be expected , as they were working with receivers who were strangers to them . // Other than the pass-blocking of big backs , the Miami quarterbacks will need protection from their offensive line  --  most likely Billy Neighbors and Ernie Park at guards , Maxie Williams and Norman Evans at tackles , and either Tom Goode or Mike Hudock at center . Evans is the best prospect of the bunch , but Park and Neighbors have played regularly on winners at San Diego and Boston . Depth is the problem . // If the quarterbacks can get the ball away , there are all sorts of able hands to do the catching . The best proven hands belong to Tight End Dave Kocourek , an All-AFL performer at San Diego , and to Frank Jackson , a fast flanker for Kansas City in 1964 . But Jackson has been hurt , and the deep receivers will come from a group that includes Bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SMU . Twilley , the all-time collegiate pass-catching champion at Tulsa , is small but quick and sure . Roderick runs the 100-yard dash in 9.3 and also has good speed in a football uniform , a talent many trackmen lack . // The key to the defense may be in how fast rookie Middle Linebacker Frank Emanuel of Tennessee learns his job . The Dolphins are going to shove Emanuel into action at once and suffer their lumps along with him . Ex-Jet Wahoo McDaniel has been moved to an outside linebacking position where his lack of speed may hamper pass coverage , although he is a hard tackier . Tom Erlandson , once of Denver , has the other outside linebacking job . Defensive End Mel Branch was a star for several years at Kansas City , although at 230 pounds he may find the game outgrowing him . The Dolphins had hoped for much from Tackle Alphonse Dotson , who has yet to live up to his reputation . Ed Cooke is a seasoned defensive end , and Tackles Tom Nomina and Rich Zecher have put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures to be at least adequate . Willie West , a seven-year veteran , and John McGeever are at safety , and Jim Warren and Dick Westmoreland  --  both of whom came from San Diego in the draft  --  are the corner backs . " West is the best we have , " says Wilson . " He 's with the ball all the time . If we can get performances like his all over , we 'll be O.K. in the secondary . " // The Dolphins will be erratic , a trait typical of new teams . Defensive units must play together for a while to become consistent . Quarterbacks and receivers must work together to perfect timing . But there will be days when things will fall into place , and it should not be a surprise if the Dolphins win two or three games .
