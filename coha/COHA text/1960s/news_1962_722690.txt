txt Letters to The Times Justice Black 's Order Law Professors Deny Action Raises Issue of ' Due Process ' To THE EDITOR or ME Nsw YORK Thus : In his column " The Due Process ' Factor in the Meredith Case , " in the Oct , 2 Times , Arthur Krock asserted that the Supreme Court of the United States , acting through Justice Black , " rejected in effect and in fact a pending appeal for the review of the Meredith case by the state of Mississippi " and that the " most unusual , if not unparalleled , procedure " by , which this was done " raises the legitimate question whether ' due process ' was afforded the state of Mississippi . " These implications of impropriety are misleading . The judicial action which produced the " due process factor " in Mr. Krock 's mind was a ruling issued by Justice Black on Sept. 10,1962 . This ruling resulted from a long sequence of events which began with Mr. Meredith 's application for admission to the University of Mississippi in January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Court of Appeals on June 25 , 1962 , directing that Mr. Meredith be admitted . University officials sought a Supreme Court review of this decision by filing a petition for writ of certiorari which in normal course would not be acted upon until the Court convened for its new term in October . Court 's Discretion Whether or not the Court will review a case on petition for writ of certiorari rests within its discretion , and comparatively few of such petitions are granted . It is common for a party who loses the decision in a lower court and petitions for writ of certiorari to ask the lower court to suspend or stay enforcement of the , decision until it can be determined whether or not the case will be reviewed by the higher court . The granting of such stays rests in the sound discretion of the court . In the Meredith case the Court of Appeals refused to grant such a stay . That normally would have ended the matter unless the Supreme Court or one of its justices issued a stay . In the Meredith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acting contrary to the views of his Brothers on the bench , purported to grant several such stays which the full court treated as ineffective and void . In order to clear the record , particularly in view of the fact that Mr. Meredith wished to enter the university in September , his counsel filed the appropriate motion with Justice Black ( the Supreme Court justice assigned to the Fifth Circuit for matters of this kind ) asking that Judge Cameron 's stay orders be vacated . Justice Black 's order granting this motion explicity agreed with the reasons which led the Court of Appeals to deny a stay . He concluded his opinion as follows : " Although convinced that I have the power to act alone in this matter , I have submitted it to each of my Brethren , and I am authorized to state that each of them agrees that the case is properly before this Court , that I have power to act , and that under the circumstances I should exercise that power as I have done here . " Justice Black 's action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as those he dealt with arise very infrequently ; certainly there was nothing irregular in what he did . Customary Procedure Single justices have authority to act upon motions of this kind made when the Court is not in session , and indeed , this customary procedure for dealing with urgent matters is necessary for vacation-time , when the membership of the Court is scattered ; in this case , there was special reason for speedy action since the fall term was about to begin at the university . His consultation with other members of the Court could not in any way prejudice the right of the university and appears to have been dictated by a desire to be certain that those rights were properly protected . Furthermore , his action was not a final rejection of Mississippi 's petition for review of the Meredith case ; it only wiped from the record a stay order of a single lower court judge which that judge 's own Brethren of the Court of Appeals did not regard as valid . There is no justification whatever for the suggestion that Justice Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in judicial procedure . It is regrettable indeed that such an unfounded suggestion should be propagated by the pen of a colum ? nist of the standing of Mr. Krock , particularly at a time when such loose charges might be used to jus- , tify defiance of law .

Citizens Urged to Register New Yorkers Said to Have Worst Record in Nation on Voting To THE EDITOR OF THE Nsw YORK TIMES : I Please accept our congratulations on your Oct. 9 editorial " Time to Register and Vote " and the related news story on Page 31 on the same day . We have been working On the problem of getting unregistered people to register on a full-time basis since the latter part of April of this year . The fact is that the people of our city could have availed themselves of the facilities for central registration at the various borough offices of the Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1962 , but less than 9,000 people did so . Whether this is a good or bad record will be left to others to judge . Suffice it to say that outside of our own small voice in the labor movement there have been very few who seemed to be interested in getting every available citizen registered to vote . If our big business of government were not so big , perhaps some could afford to be apathetic and leave the responsibilities of citizenship to others . If our government did not influence every aspect of our life from the time before we are born until the time after we are dead , perhaps we could afford to be apathetic . The shameful record discloses that the city of New York has a greater number of unregistered potential voters than any other political subdivision of the United States with the single exception of the entire state of California . There are more unregistered people in our city than in all the rest of our state . There are more unregistered in our city than in the ' entire state of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few of the mord populous states . Citizenship is everybody 's business every day . Voting is everybody 's business as a citizen . Registration is , available all year round . It is good to emphasize the periods for local registration as strongly as possible : , We appreciate your efforts to , help us in our goal to get every one of the 2 million unregistered New Yorkers registered this year. !

The Patient Fisherman To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In Topics on Sept. 25 we learn that two scientific expeditions failed to disprove the existence of the Loch Ness Monster . This is comforting news . But the writer goes on to link this topic with that of the fish in the Seine . One never sees any being caught , but who can doubt they are there ? In the best reportorial fashion the writer interviewed one or two fishermen who said of course there were fish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With that he left to write his column , and a good one at that if you do n't mind the basic premise being false . It is less comforting to learn that the writer had not the time to discover with his own eyes that the fish exist . One must he patient . After an hour or so , when one has proved one 's faith and ability to forget less important matters , one is not at all surprised to see flapping on the end of a line a silvery fish , with bloodred edges to the gills , the size of a small perch . I am afraid the writer of Topics has yet to attain that state of blissful inertia where he is permitted to see these creatures . He must strengthen his faith , he must learn to relax and to forget , and he must be patient , very patient . Then perhaps one day he may even see a humped monster rise up out of the waters of Loch Ness . JON W. BRONEER .
