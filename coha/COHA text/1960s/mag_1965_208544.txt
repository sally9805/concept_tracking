The contraption looked more like an inverted flat iron than a flying machine . With two tail fins and no wings , a rounded belly and a flat top , the experimental craft M2-F2 was rolled out last week by Northrop 's Norair division and turned over to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for a series of test flights . M2-F2 is a wingless glider , called the Manned Lifting Body Research Vehicle , designed to be used eventually to ferry astronauts back from space to a dry landing rather than an ocean dunking . <P> Wrapped in an aluminum skin , the M2-F2 measures 22 ft. 2 in. long and 9 ft. 7 in. wide at its broadest point ( the tail ) . To control the glider 's descent once it reaches the atmosphere , the pilot has a rudder on each tail fin for turning , a pair of flaps on the top of the aft section of the body for upward pitch and roll adjustments , and a single flap under the aft section for downward pitch . If angle of descent becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thruster rockets on board . Wings are not necessary to achieve stability and lift . <P> In future space voyages , the lifting body will be orbited separately . When the astronauts are ready for the trip back , they will rendezvous with the M2-F2 , hop in , fire the retrorockets and glide on home .
