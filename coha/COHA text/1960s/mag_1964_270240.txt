As Mexico 's 60th President stepped out onto the balcony of the austere National Palace , the sun burst through the overcast , warming the sea of upturned faces below . But the most radiant face of all belonged to Gustavo Diaz Ordaz , the brainy backlands lawyer on whose slim frame outgoing President Adolfo Lpez Mateos draped the green , white and red sash of office . With arms outstretched in triumph and a huge , toothy grin creasing his dark , homely countenance , President Diaz Ordaz looked as if he would like nothing better than to hug the officials clustered around him . <P> The Fundamental Task . The fiesta mood was well founded . Of twelve Presidents who have taken office since Mexico 's 1910 revolution , Diaz Ordaz , 53 , is the first to inherit a prosperous and united nation that faces no immediate major problems . True to the Mexican pattern of orderly alternation between regimes that are to the left or right of center , Diaz Ordaz , who was Minister of the Interior under Lpez Mateos , is slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the job . As the new President made clear in his inaugural address , his administration , like Lpez Mateos ' regime , will put economic growth above doctrinaire politics . Emphasizing that " there is a vast field in Mexico for both public and private investment , " Diaz Ordaz warned with characteristic caution : " The political and economic stability that we enjoy are not gifts . They are the result of a dynamic society that establishes economic development as a fundamental task . " <P> Diaz Ordaz ' Cabinet appointments suggested that the tough , down-to-earth President intends to handle that task with skill and imagination . His line-up boasts ten lawyers , four engineers , two doctors , two generals , a colonel , an accountant and a professor . In two key nominations , the new President reappointed Finance Minister Antonio Ortiz Mena , who is responsible for sustaining record economic growth along with a stable peso ( 121 to the dollar ) , and for Foreign Minister picked Antonio Carrillo Flores , who as Ambassador to Washington since 1959 had earned the respect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . <P> Solidarity First . The choice of Carrillo Flores , plus reports that Diaz Ordaz detests Fidel Castro , was taken by observers as an indication that Mexico may in time sever relations with Cuba , which , alone among Latin American nations , it persists in recognizing . Diaz Ordaz is unlikely to break with Cuba in the near future , however , lest he be accused of repudiating Lpez Mateos . <P> Nonetheless , Mexico 's new President took pains to dispel any illusion that he will promote a Latino form of Gaullism that would seek to build nationalist prestige at the expense of hemispheric solidarity . Said Diaz Ordaz , " It is unfair to Mexico to be pointed at as wishful of becoming the leader of Latin America . It aspires to be just another member in the group that joins its efforts for common improvement . "
