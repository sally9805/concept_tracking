txt Galesburg , Ill. , Dec. 14-The Kncx college student body , jolted into aroused debate over an article by Willard Edwards in last Sunday 's CHICAGO TRIBUNE , turned out en masse today to hear Edwards ' talk and then subjected him to an intense 11/2 hour barrage of questions . Edwards plainly made a hit In his afternoon talk in a jammed campus theater . Most of the 1,082 Knox students heard the talks in person or over local radio and loudspeaker systems . Classes were suspended . Speaker Wins Ovation In a grueling night session , Edwards faced an obviously hostile audience , . stung by his story of the apparent triumph here of Burton White , identified as a key agitator in a 1960 student riot in San Francisco . But tho the questions remained pointed and critical to the end , the audience gave a loud and obviously admiring ovation to Edwards at the end of the session . Edwards ' afternoon talk was greeted with loud applause and enthusiasm , but the evening session made it clear that this was where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Movie The furor erupted on the campus last Sunday when THE TRIBUNE carried a story by Edwards , veteran Washington correspondent . He wrote of White 's Nov. 7 debate with St. Louis Atty . Henry Marshall over the merits of the film " Operation Abolition , " a House . un-American activities committee documentary on the San Francisco riot . White , 29 , a University of California teacher , was touring campuses under sponsorship of a group that the House committee has said has seven Communists among its leaders . Edwards also wrote that the Knox Student , campus newspaper , carried 3,000 words on White 's argument and only 300 on Marshall 's . Edwards was asked if he wrote his story " under pressure " and if the House committee asked him to write it . Denies Any Pressure " Of course , there was no pressure and I did not write it at the request of the committee , " he said Edwards also said that he felt his story , which said White may have scored one of his biggest triumphs at Knox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it . " This has prompted a wide open debate on a serious subject , " he said . " I would like to check back with you in one year . I am sure you will agree with me then that it has helped your school . " Some student leaders earlier in the evening had telephoned White in Pennsylvania , where he is touring campuses preaching abolition of the House committee . They said he consented readily to student 's proposals to a debate with Edwards here next semester . Ca n't Commit Himself Edwards said he could not commit himself to such a debate because he will soon be busy covering the opening of Congress . But he suggested students invite William F. Buckley as a worthy opponent " who I think can handle White . " Buckley is editor of the National Review , a conservative periodical . Asked what he would change in his story if he had to rewrite it in the light of today 's events , Edwards replied : " Nothing . " He repeated an earlier statement that there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would fight vigorously for his right to appear on any campus and talk on any subject . Students recalled White 's charges that the Rouse committee " juggled " scenes in the " Operation Abolition " film and asked Edwards whether this was true . Juggling of Scenes " There was juggling of scenes and this was indefensible , " he replied . He said the film 's sequences had been changed to make a point , " that is , that the student riots in San Francisco had been taken over by communist agitators . " Who can deny that this happened ? " he said. , " Who can deny that White is pictured among the agitators ? " He said rearrangement of film sequences was not unusual in documentaries and cited several films by Edward R. Murrow , head of the United States information agency , who not only had juggled scenes but also hired actors to , portray starving migrant workers . " The House committee made a mistake in this and White has used it as an entrance to campuses to make his point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could Be Improved Edwards said the House committee could be improved if congressmen would not shy away from serving on it for fear of political loss . Other questions : Q.-Do I have the right to believe an avowed Commu-nist ? A.-Of course . Q.-Will this smear of a student newspaper 's reporting of a controversial subject intimidate others into not writing about such subjects ? would be ashamed of any writer or any college newspaper who lets publicity in THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE make him refrain from saying anything . Q.-Will such stories as yours harm liberalism on college campuses ? A.-The only trend I have heard of in the last year is a strong conservative trend on major campuses . How Story Has Helped Q.-Explain how you think your story has helped Knox ? A - For one thing , tomorrow 's issue of ' the Knox Student , I am told , will show one benefit by printing letters exposing the other side of the White appearance . Q.-Did you deliberately try to smear Knox ? A.-I would not be worthy of the name newspaper man if I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist ? A.-I have no evidence that he is . Q.-Do you think there is a healthy atmosphere on the Knox campus for the growth of communism ? A.-Certainly not . In his afternoon talk , Edwards criticized the student newspaper 's one-sided presentation of the White-Marshall debate , referring to the article of only 300 words devoted to Marshall 's side . New Theory to Journalism " Even this morsel seemed too much for one writer who dismissed him Marshall with the statement that of him there is so much negative to say that it is pointless to say an.ything in the space allotted , ' " Edwards recalled today . " This theory is new to journalism and may perhaps be attractive to some . Why waste space on a speaker with whose views you disagree ? " This comment brought laughter from the students , who had been excused from classes for the event . Edwards , who has been a reporter for 36 years , recalled a similar incident when he preceded Alger Hiss as a speaker at Princeton university several years ago . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus of booing " but that when he told the story of Hiss as a spy and traitor to his country , students responded favorably . Students , he said , will reach the right conclusions if both sides of issues are fairly presented . " I am against ruling off any guest speaker , whether he be Communist or anti-Communist , a member of the radical right or radical left , a bank president , : or a bank robbet , " he said . " I 'll bet on the eventual dig-1 covery of the ' hypocrite , the propagandist , the speaker who covers up his true design . But this requires knowledge sometimes not available on the campus . " Hits Archaic Thinking He said he was dismayed at the " unhesitating acceptance " of White 's contention that congressional investigation of communism was an ' invasion of personal thought . " This is archaic thinking , outmoded by the United States Supreme court 's ruling that the Communist party is not a political party but a conspiracy dominated by Soviet Russia . The court has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . " Edwards , who said he had spent more than 1,000 hours in covering the House committee , said that in its 24 year existence it could have been killed at any time by a simple majority vote of Congress . " If we are to believe Burton White  --  and the Knox Student , the committee is a clear and present danger to the Bill of Rights . " Six Voted to Kill It But , he said , only six of the House 's 436 members this year approved a move to kill the committee . As to charges made by White and others that the committee infringed on personal rights of witnesses , Edwards recalled that considerable abuse had been dealt out in probes of lobbying and racketeering but that the Communists and left wing groups did n't seem to care . " The civil rights groups , so zealous of the 1st and 5th amendments , seem to be stirred to wrath only when embarrassing questions are asked of a man under suspicion as a member of a conspiracy to overthrow the government by force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record straight " on White 's charge that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was a threat to American tradition , Edwards noted that J. Edgar Hoover , its director , was himself a sharp critic of those who indiscriminately label their opponents Communists .
