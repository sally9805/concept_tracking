 | The LightWork Way to an Indoor Garden @# VERY winter morning at seven , F the " sunlight " snaps on in j my bedroom window and suddenly it 's spring . Seeds are bursting through the soil of my indoor garden , tulips are blooming , and there 's the smell of hyacinths . I open my eyes to a " greenhouse " beside me , where a galaxy of plants is growing for me as they seldom do outdoors . Essentially my little greenhouse consists of three steel shelves , one above the other , holding waterproof trays , each lighted by a fluorescent lamp . The whole set-up cost me only about $50 . ( If it had been bought assembled at a garden or hardware store , the cost would probably be more . ) It grows plants that look as if they came from the florist , and it occupies no more space than a small dresser . It can be moved anywhere you want to see the color bursts of  | blooming plants . I use an electric timer to automate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury . This gardening under lights is better in many ways than outdoor gardening . You can do it all year long , day or night . No wonder it has become one of America 's fastestgrowing hobbies . Already there are a million year-round light gardens like mine in operation , plus another six million seasonal ones used to start seeds for planting outdoors when the weather warms . I got hooked on this hobby six years ago , when I plunked down $14.95 for a four-foot , two-tube fluorescent light to start tomato plants . I knew that it was n't good economics . You can buy a lot of tomato plants for $14.95 . But I wanted a certain variety described in the catalogue as a " meaty , ever-bearing hybrid . " Besides , there 's something primitive and self-reliant about starting your own . - I bought a shallow tray or " seed flat , " a bag of sterilized potting soil , and a bag of sphagnum moss at a garden store for a couple of dollars . I spread an inch of soil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and planted my tomato seeds as directed on the seed packet . Then I set my new lamp above the flat . So as not to waste the rest of that slab of " sunlight , " I planted two other flats with petunias , marigolds and morning glories . A week later , I was in business . The seedlings had leaped to their feet vigorously . They did not grow tall and spindling , as windowgrown seedlings do because of lack of light . Nat one fell over and died . Soon they Were large enough to need transplanting. into separate containers . A , this point , I ran out of sunlight , and shelled out another $14.95 for a second light . Still the plants kept growing . Soon the tomatoes alone needed a whole lamp , so I bought another . And that 's how I wound up with a garden in my bedroom . No frost , no weeds , no drought , no cutworms , no dark days to worry about . I can stroll through my fluorescent garden night or day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth the effort and space . It 's that warm-wet , woodsy fragrance that recalls going barefoot , picking wild flowers in the spring or raking the spring lawn . Usually , I have the timer set to flick the lights on at 7 a.m. and off at midnight . With days as long as that , plants grow phenomenally ? the way they do in an Alaskan summer . That first year , marigolds started to bloom within four weeks after transplanting , and the morningglory vines rambled everywhere , over shelves , up light cords . The tomatoes looked like young oaks when I set them outside . No parlor pallor . The second year I grew coleus ? the plant With leaves like Persian carpets . Every last one seemed to germinate . As they matured , they  | took on color ? some yellow , some purple , some red . When they were large enough to transplant , I gently pulled them up with tweezers and dropped them onto moist soil . They did n't even pause for breath , and actually grew to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year I try exotic new plants , but I always keep a plant or two of chives , parsley , thyme and marjoram , to nibble on and to add zip to cottage cheese and salads . Gardening under lights as an American hobby took hold after World War II when fluorescent bulbs became widely available . Before that , gardeners had used incandescent bulbs for house plants , but these had drawbacks . They are rich in red light , but lack light from the blue end of the spectrum . Also they give off heat , not only making plants too hot but sometimes burning the tender seedlings . Fluorescent tubes are cooler , and they supply blue wavelengths , but are poor in red light . Fluorescent tubes containing more of the red waves , aimed expressly at helping to grow plants indoors , have been brought out by Sylvania , Westinghouse , General Electric and Duro-Test . These work very well on such plants as gloxinias and African violets . With other plants you may do as well with regular " cool white " or " warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in combination with incandescent lamps . ( The rule of thumb for such combination use is : two fluorescent watts for every incandescent watt . ) Hobbyists may find that it pays to experiment with the differ . ent kinds of lights . A 4o-watt fluorescent tube four feet long , of the type especially adapted for plant growers , costs about $2.50 . Regular fluorescent tubes cost half that much . Under the special plant light , greens look greener and pinks become irides. cent . For growers with plenty o room who like their flowers to look more natural , if less dramatic , West ? inghouse makes an eight-foot " wid spectrum " tube . A good way to begin your ow garden under lights is with an industria1-type fixture which includa reflector . Hang this fixture fro a shelf or other firm support , above a waterproof tray , and plug in the cord . ( My own lights hang from steel shelving by brass chains , so that I can raise or lower them . ) Then sow the seeds ? small ones can simply be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with plastic or glass until they germinate . Place the flats within four to six inches of the fluorescent lights to start , and while plants are small . Since the effect of the light tubes is weakest at each end , position seedlings toward the middle . If your plants do n't grow with abandon , put the light closer . Wicks of clothes-line rope or fiber glass , from a water jar to your trays , will take care of watering for a week or more . Plants vary considerably in the amount of light that they like , and its duration . For most annuals that  | you will transplant outdoors , 17 hours of light per day make the sturdiest plants . For petunias , 18 hours is better . Fast-growing plants need ample feeding . A couple of light feedings a week of a soluble fertilizer are preferable to heavier feedings less often . Remember that most plants like colder temperatures than you do ? no more than 70 degrees during the clay and around 8 to 14 degrees cooler at night , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or near a window ? where temperatures drop at night . Professional growers know that some plants like chrysanthemums need short days ? no longer than ten hours of light ? before they flower . Poinsettias must have complete darkness for 12 hours a day ; even a minute of light each night will keep them from flowering . Orchids grow and flower well under lights , but need humidity . For me , part of the real excitement in gardening under lights is exploring the way plants grow . You can pamper the weakling of the flat ; sometimes it turns out to be the choicest of the lot . You can study different climates ; create your own steaming micro-jungle by putting a plastic curtain around your light fixture , or omit water to make a blazing desert . You can study the roots of a plant , lifting one out of its pot , soil and all ( this wo n't harm it ) , to examine the way roots grow in search of food . If the roots have struck out vigorously through the soil , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top inch or two , the soil may be too rich . If they keep to the edges and avoid the middle , some plant food may be missing . Some of earth 's profoundest mysteries are still locked within plants . With your own indoor garden , you can observe them firsthand . @#
