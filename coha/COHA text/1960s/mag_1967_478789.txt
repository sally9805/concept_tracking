make of the present emphasis on the collective . For Lenin this was a Party concept , based on the conviction that the sum was greater than its parts . In the Soviet Union today the meaning of the word " collective " is simpler and coarser , and has acquired an institutional context . The emphasis on collective action thus means that people identify themselves not as individuals but as members of a work group . factory , professional group or team , name and address ( or lack of it ) as a primary means of identification , the Soviet equivalent is the collective , which . as it were . constitutes the individual ? rather than the individuals constituting the collective . Is this truly the self-liberation which was the cause , product , and justification of the Marxist revolution ? Standing on the reviewing platform , Lenin would find himself in a quandary . He would be undeniably impressed by the visible effects of Soviet achievement , the obvious permanence of the socialist Soviet Union , but made personally uncomfortable and apprehensive by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and in which he was now a guest . The whole climate would appear extremely conservative . Though not himself especially interested in art and literature , Lenin died at a time when education , science , and the arts were still in the throes of spectacular experimentation . The limits then had been no less than the frontiers of human capacity . Now experiments are no longer designed to test the limits of the possible , but the area of the permissible ; and these are still defined in the main by amended yet recognizably Stalinist eriteria . We may suppose that Lenin would hurl questions at those surrounding him , and that they would reply vigorously in explanation and self-defense . And here the real sense of disillusion would set in . For what would Lenin have to talk about with this present Soviet leadership ? other than ornamental references to the past and revered principles of Marxism ? The difference between one for whom concrete achievement must be the expression of ideology , and those for whom ideology is necessarily the explanation of concrete achievements , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related too closely to physical objects , to statistics , even to facts , no dialogue can be really fruitful or stimulating . The fictional reappearance of Lenin at the 0e-91 more in common . Even in capitalist countries the direct . influence of ownership on production is growing increasingly vague and tenuous as the vital strata of management are interposed between owners and workers . Power and wealth have become disparate dimensions . But beneath these similarities lurk a number of crucial differences . Because success in the Soviet Union can not ultimately be expressed in terms of possessions ( however great the differentiated scale of rewards between the educated and the unskillful ) , the basic approach of Soviet management is entirely different from that in the United States . The ladder of advance in the Soviet Union must remain on a dimension of public and interdependent scales of power , while that in the United States is directed more toward self-sufficient and personal scales of wealth . The relationship of individuals to politics and society is thus much more integrated in the Soviet Union than in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The edges of this distinction tend to become blurred as increasing attention is paid in the Soviet Union to the satisfaction of consumer demands . But in the first . place the Soviet leadership intends to continue to determine the nature of this demand . Khrushchev was all for filling the kitchen pot , but very much against the choking of Russian roads with individually owned cars . The provision of social services ? whether in the strict sense of medical , nursery , and housing facilities or in the wider context of culture ? is more strongly emphasized as part of consumer rewards than in capitalist countries . Above all the whole apparatus of planning focuses productive effort on some future benefit instead of subordinating it to the consumer demands of here and now . Planning will continue to he sacred in the Soviet Union as the only rational way of making economic decisions , carrying them into effect , and ensuring that the resultant product reaches its destination . As society becomes more complex and the consumer more demanding as well as sophisticated there will be more planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as very different from that of other countries . The notion of a " state of society , " and the attainment of personal satisfaction through a generalized attainment by society as a whole , plays a vital part in the Soviet Union . Antisocial behavior and attitudes are much more sharply defined . In the West the boundary between public and private is sensitive and much attention is focused upon it ; the private sector is an area within which room for individual action is left " vacant . " By definition everything that is not illegal is permitted . In the Soviet Union the opposite is true . There has been a hesitant but noticeable retreat from legal sanction , coupled with greater reliance on social prohibitions , to enforce the collective social view of right and wrong . A society nearing the stage of communism is characterized by a growing consensus . The law does no more than put teeth into the enforcement of the social consensus against deviants . The struggle for delimitations of the frontiers of the permissible , particularly in connection with writers and artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to define social norms and the tussle about who shall define them . Human nature being what it is , this retreat from Stalinist methods of enforcement has , of course , produced an apparently startling amount of social ( not political ) deviation . Soviet newspapers abound with complaints against parasites , drunkenness , undisciplined youth , and economic crimes such as fraudulent conversion of public property to private profit . But perhaps the significant aspect of this is the fact that public denunciation and appeals to social conscience have multiplied as a form of collective response to the retreat of the formal agencies of law enforcement . The other important factor which differentiates Soviet elites from those in other countries is the full internalization of Marxism . This may not resemble the sophisticated structure of Marx 's own thought ; it is not difficult to lampoon Soviet thinking as a caricature and vulgarization of Marxism . But obviously any complex view of the world must change considerably in the process of adoption by hundreds and thousands of people , and in its application to the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are convinced that their world view is more scientific , more accurate , and in every way superior to that of other people . This is no longer a matter of debate but ? as far as they are concerned ? a proven fact . The tendency of Soviet citizens to be more approachable , the growth of communication between members of the same profession across national boundaries , and the fact that there has been a general d ? tente in the ideological warfare between capi92 THE SOVIET ACHIEVEMENT talism and socialism , are not due to any decline of ideology in the Soviet Union ( or in the West for that matter ? , but to the irrelevance of debate about these matters . Stalin 's pedagogical monstrosities of oversimplification have had their effect ? and we may suppose that the equally monstrous efforts of Mao will have a similar effect in due course . That is why the things people talk about in 1967 are quite different from those that concerned them in 1922 . We may reasonably assume that a man of Lenin 's intellectual stature would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unfamiliarity ? would he approve and endorse those invoking his name today ? In spite of the substantial achievements , the answer might still be no . The Smell of Nationalism For one thing . Lenin would be disagreeably assailed by the strong smell of nationalism which has developed as a by-product of Soviet achievements . Domestically the hard facts and figures of Russification are undeniable . The demand of integration , the easier access to education by the specific Russian nationalities , and the economic development of the peripheral regions of the Soviet Union , have all contributed to a layer of " Russianness " superimposed on the official policy of equality of cultures , languages , and races . Many of these developments have no doubt been inevitable , but not perhaps their complacent incorporation into official thinking and ideology . Anyone as sensitive to pretensions of national or cultural superiority as Lenin could not ignore the somewhat artificial and folksy nature of the support of local cultures , contradicted by the institutionalization of the Russian language and Russian attitudes as the only acceptable path to a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more become the apparently most underprivileged group today ? the Jews . Their strong representation in the arts , literature , and the sciences has significantly not been matched by a corresponding presence in the administrative positions of the Party . Next door , in Poland , where an extreme antinationalist version of communism had once originated , he would find things even worse ? a " Partisan " group of national communists steadily weeding out Jews from all positions of trust and power . And all this not merely at the top , for ethnic and cultural prejudices raise profound echoes in receptive societies . One assumes that Lenin would arrive at the fiftieth-anniversary celebrations armed with his usual knowledge of what foreign communists were writing ; he could not have helped noticing the references to Soviet discrimination against Jews , the strictures on decades of Soviet arrogance toward foreign com munists . These features of nationalism are matched by a disagreeable identification of revolution with the health and wealth of the Soviet Union tout court . It would not take Lenin long to disentangle the problems of communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispute between the Soviet Union and China . The very idea of a struggle or conflict between two established power centers for the interpretation of communist orthodoxy would certainly be more alien to Lenin than it is to the present leaders of the Soviet Union . On this score he would certainly side with Brezhnev and Kosygin , who inherited polycentrism willy-nilly from their predecessor . But the accompanying and underlying stress on national rights , the dispute about frontiers coupled with the assertion of spheres of influence and control over regions acquired by Russia at a time of Tsarist imperialism , would make Lenin uncomfortable , if not exceedingly angry . There is a clear break between internal and external policies . In foreign policy , " socialism in one country " ? a formulation to cover a temporary period of stabilization in the enemy camp ? has led to the transformation of the Soviet Union from the epicenter of world revolution to just another big power . The attitudes of independence and self-reliance on the part of the other communist states and foreign communist parties can be interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , but as a necessary reaction to Soviet failure to provide adequate support . The Soviet Union has lost interest in foreign countries except in the traditional bourgeois sense of big-power international politics . Lenin envisaged communism as a form of political communion , and the Party as its organized expression . Until social conditions permitted , the Party must not lose itself in the larger amorphous society . A communist had to be instantly distinguishable from all others by his outward behavior and his inner values . The present Soviet leaders do not conform to this pattern . Lenin would never recognize them immediately as communists according to the elemental criteria of personal experience . Apart from anything else , a considerable effort would be required to accept Kosygin , Brezhnev , and Podgorny as the direct descendants of the Bolsheviks who saw their precious Soviet state through its turbulent but exciting infancy . One wonders , for instance , what Lenin would 94 THE SOVIET ACHIEVEMENT tober celebrations is useful in enabling us to confront the state of the Soviet Union with its own past . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contrary to the loudly proclaimed views of historians , prediction is not dangerous or reprehensible ? it may merely prove to be wrong . In fact it is almost mandatory to try and predict . What , then , may we expect from the Soviet Union in the future ? Diversity in the " Bloc " In the present situation in the communist world , there are new problems arising uut of the growing emphasis on national sensitivity . The period of political and economic domination by Moscow came to an end in the mid-1950s . Even though the Soviet Union suppressed the Hungarian revolt and contained the danger of similar action in Poland , these events did not reverse the process of loosening the relationship of the neighboring governments with Moscow . But they changed its direction ; the impulse toward more independence came from above , from the ruling parties , not from below against them . The year 1956 saw probably the last , not the first , direct Soviet interference in the affairs of her " socialist " neighbors . Supranational planning for the socialist bloc as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specializations , continued formally until the early 1960s , and was officially abandoned only at the time when the Romanian government revolted openly against its allocated role of raw-material and agricultural producer . A resurgence of nationalism has swept Eastern Europe as a whole in the last few years , In Romania and more recently in Poland the last years have witnessed the emergence of power groups of a quite new type within Party and state . Almost without a program , not concerned with any specific issues , they represent inchoate nationalist ambitions within the Party and help their supporters to positions of power within Party and state . In some ways they are a form of national socialism in its literal sense ? anti-Russian , anti-Semitic , anti-foreign , anti-intellectual ? associated in Poland with General Moczar , the Minister of the Interior , and the so-called " Partisans . " In Yugoslavia the resurgence of Serb , Croat , and Slovene self-consciousness as national entities with distinct and competing interests has already endangered the cohesion of the federal state , leading to unprecedented experiments and reforms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the Soviet Union Yugoslav communism is disintegrating in a series of spectacular experimental explosions . Yet it is only the greater concessions to national sovereignty and autonomy at the expense of inter-Party discipline and cohesion in these last years that has enabled a workable relationship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia to survive . While Khrushchev still talked to the Yugoslays in a Marxist canon ? albeit a more tolerant one , in which criticism and approval alternated ? the new Soviet leadership has tended to treat the Yugo-slays as outside the communist bloc altogether . Given time , the Stalinist system of control might well have succeeded in shaping these societies in a , uniform pattern based on a Soviet model ? except that Stalin was not primarily interested in that kind of uniformity . But fifteen years was not nearly enough , and the deeply imbedded ethnic and cultural differences were pushed below the surface only temporarily . This diversity is in fact reflected not only in the basic social institutions , but also in a good deal of specific legislation . One example will suffice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abortions are legal in the Soviet Union , Czechoslovakia , and Hungary . They are strictly forbidden in the German Democratic Republic and in 1966 were prohibited in Romania . Similarly the process and facility of obtaining divorces varies considerably from country to country . What the Computers May Miss Easily the most dangerous and bitter conflict within the socialist " bloc " is the Sino-Soviet split . Underlying its ideological polemics is an increasingly deliberate elaboration of national issues and symbols . The search for ammunition on both sides has thus brought to the surface a whole number of questions about frontiers , spheres of influence , and sovereign rights . National postures , once evoked , have a habit of displacing other issues ; it is difficult to envisage where this restructuring of the Sino-Soviet conflict may lead ? especially when a frontier of over two thousand miles is involved . If competitive coexistence vis- ? - vis the United States has coincided with conflict with China , the deductions that might have been drawn for the future have been both confused and tested by the war in Vietnam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its immediate national interests are not involved . Soviet passivity has handed the Chinese endless amounts of rope with which to hang themselves ? a temptation the Chinese have carefully resisted . In one sense the Vietnam war has entered , and has been made to accommodate itself to , the Sino-Soviet dispute . Both the U. S. S. R. and China claim to be assisting the Vietcong to the maximum and accuse the other of hindering their respective efforts . Yet at the same time the war has put both the Sino-Soviet conflict and Soviet-American relations into a state of suspended , purely verbal animation . It can neither resolve the Sino-Soviet split nor widen it . In the last resort the long-standing and deeply ingrained Soviet view of the world as divided into capitalist , socialist , and neutral nations must align the Soviet Union with the North Vietnamese and China . The whole concept of coexistence is based on the assumption that there will be no basic challenge to the existence of either bloc . So far the Soviet Union has spoken of the American threat to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of such a challenge . There has still been some room for maneuver between China and the U. S. S. R. for influence over the Vietcong and North Vietnam , without any risk of total commitment for either . lf , however , such a challenge were to he perceived by the Soviet Union , through the danger of a direct military clash between China and the United States in Vietnam or beyond , this picture could alter radically . An American war with China would involve Soviet interests directly , since it would probably feel itself threatened too ? as a communist rather than as a national or territorial entity . Soviet interests and the interests of communism would quickly become identified as one and the same . For the perception of interests does not take place in a vacuum of unadulterated rationality , but in a cloudy plasma of experience , habit , and ideology . This is where the computers in the Pentagon are likely to miscalculate the " fail-safe " level of escalation . Fascinated By Facts It is of course impossible to predict the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the likely next fifty years of the Soviet Union it is best ignored . Many observers believe that the logic of capitalism , as of communism , in the twentieth century is dictated by the broad social and economic considerations of advanced industrialization , that both types of societies will move toward each other , and finally attain a similar social structure . Others draw the opposite conclusion from the same set of facts . But the odds are on a continuation of the process of convergence . Soviet society has now openly accepted the idea of social and professional domination by the cornpetent and qualified . The Soviet schooling system is more selective in its stress on ability than almost any other . The British , for instance , currently look to the educational system as a means of redressing social imbalances . The Soviet system ? believing as it does that social imbalance has already been removed by fifty years of Soviet government ? selects the best qualified for higher schooling without fear of institutionalizing any existing social privileges . The effectiveness of this argument may he questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own educational system shows clearly that certain groups have easier access to educational facilities than others . Inequality between individuals and social groups ( not classes ) is freely and even officially admitted in the Soviet Union . But it is characterized as due to human rather than social endowment , an inequality of skill not background . And the claim is partly though never wholly true . If middle-class behavior is to be measured in terms of the desire to achieve and a strong emphasis on formal education , then the Soviet Union is as bourgeois as the United States . The Soviets ' view of their society identifies social power with political power , and political power as wholly anchored in the Party ? a Party consisting of the best qualified and most able members of society . An elite , in other words . When the present generation of Party leaders is superseded , the successors may for the first time be technocrats with different professional experiences but with identical schooling in the Soviet Marxist ideology , while Western politicians will in a sense be the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whose schooling and background may differ considerably . The paradox is that the more politics become distinct from other social or professional activities , the more politicians will become professionals . The more directly politics represent and incorporate all other forms of social activity , the easier the access of nonpolitical professions to positions of power . In this regard the Soviet Union may vet come to be a model for the future technocratic or professional democracy which faces us all . But this is a long way off . As the Soviet Union celebrates fifty years of revolution , fact-fascinated , it continues to be primarily backward-looking and to regard the future as an extrapolation of the past . There is growing public awareness of problems to be solved , but they are problems with which people have been familiar , often painfully , for some time . Even so , the self-confidence of fifty years of concrete achievement will certainly stiffen the ideological conviction of certainty and rightness inherent in Marxism-Leninism.                  @ @ @
