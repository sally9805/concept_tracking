After studying nearly 100 years of star photographs from the University of Heidelberg , Dr. Harlan Smith of the University of Texas reported that the light from the heavenly body known as 3C-273 pulsates regularly on a 13-year cycle . Not that pulsating starlight is rare , but 3C-273 is not a star . It is a " quasar " ( quasi-stellar object ) that sends out powerful radio waves as well as light and is believed to be about 1 billion light-years away from the earth . Most astronomers think it is a galaxy in the process of exploding . <P> The astronomers have developed several theories to explain why galaxies can explode , but the 13-year pulsation of Quasar 3C-273 has them stumped . If the thing is really a galaxy , it must be many thousand light-years in diameter ; light must take at least 1,000 years to cross a minor section of it , and according to relativity theory , nothing can move faster than light . <P> What mysterious influence , the puzzled astronomers asked , can make so large an object pulsate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quasars are not galaxies at all , despite appearances . Perhaps in the far-off depths of space unknown physical laws are at work . Perhaps something can move faster than light . Scientists are impatiently searching for answers .
