He loved the Washington social whirl , but complained that parties in the capital end too early . " People . " he liked to say , " begin to tell the truth only after midnight . " Per Jacobsson , international monetary expert , spent most of his life trying to get men and nations to face the truth before midnight-the cold , hard truth of fiscal discipline . With a rare talent for understanding politics as well as economics , he was a master of compromise-and a stickler for principle . When France 's franc was faltering , he told the imperious Charles de Gaulle : " Mon gnral , you spoke about restoring the esteem of France . I do not think there will ever be esteem for a country that has a bad currency . " When he died of a heart attack at 69 in London last week , after seven years as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund . Per Jacobs-son was acknowledged as a chief architect of the postwar world of international finance and mourned as the trusted counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swede , Jacobsson was one of those rare men ( less rare in Sweden than elsewhere ) who served no country , but the world . He began his career as an international civil servant in the 1920s with the League of Nations , later became chief of the Monetary and Economics department of the Bank of International Settlements in Basel-a post he resigned in 1956 to take over at I.M.F. , then a relatively unimportant institution . <P> Vigorous and at times flamboyant , Jacobsson built up the I.M.F . almost by force of personality . By persuading two dozen more countries to become members ( current membership : 86 nations ) , he swelled I.M.F . ' s bankroll from $9 billion to $21 billion . He bailed Britain and <P> France out of currency crises with massive loans , persuaded the ten leading industrialized nations to set up a special currency pool to defend their currencies . He was tough in insisting on fiscal discipline , cutting off help to such nations as Turkey and Brazil when they refused to cooperate . His reputation as a conservative enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking change simply for its own sake . Jacobsson always mistrusted liberal economists , even when he found himself agreeing with them . He once said : " I 'm a bit afraid of any economist who has not seen the inside of a central bank . " <P> Poetry for Rest . As much at home in the drawing room as over a row of figures , Jacobsson wrote mystery stories and read Swedish lyric poetry for relaxation . He was able to combine his love of food , wine and traveling as he crisscrossed the world to check I.M.F . activities , and he dined and negotiated with most of the world 's rulers . The seven-room apartment that he shared with his Irish-born wife in Washington was cluttered with photographs of his three daughters ( one of whom is married to the first four-minute miler . Roger Bannister ) and eleven grandchildren . Behind the fiscal cop was a fond father , a dual role he also played to many of the world 's treasuries.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
