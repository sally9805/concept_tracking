txt  | These gages were next used by Glenn Martin Company on the China Clippers , to their satisfaction . A scratch gage dynamometer was improvised for the Lakehurst Naval Air Station to measure gust loads on the airship " Los Angeles " when attached to its mooring mast through the dynamometer . It was built like a miniature phonograph record player in which the target was a two inch circular disk , chromium plated , turned by clockwork once around every 24 hours . A diamond scratch stylus was attached by linkage to the dynamometer loop to record load versus time , including impacts . This worked so well that several others were bought by the Navy , but they all were lost in the wrecks of the lighter-than-air dirigible ships that occurred in that era . We were getting satiated , A. V. and I , with the excitement produced by scratch gage testing and began seeking new forms of scientific entertainment . One day at breakfast , A. V. announced that he had an invitation to visit Dr. Irving Langmuir in the General Electric Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific curiosities of potential value but not listed for commercial exploitation by General Electric . He suggested that we two make the trip and we did , spending a most intensely interesting day and resulting in subsequent trips to General Electric to seek licenses for marketing certain laboratory curiosities that became useful to my program . One of the things demonstrated by Langmuir was the " monomolecular film , " which would have been difficult to commercialize , though one of Dr. Langmuir 's favorite exhibits . Another thing he showed , however , struck the fancy of both A. V. and me simultaneously . This looked like a candidate for our strain gage team . It was called the Aquadag gage , a graphite emulsion in water that could be painted on surfaces as strain gages , changing resistance with strain . The trouble with this sensational idea was that it was impossible to reproduce at will the paint thickness , the gage length , and the resistance , even with a stencil , and furthermore it was next to impossible to attach wire leads properly to the painted lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Ess Strip variation , though entailing again reversion to carbon strain pick-ups . The Ess Strip , short for Electrical Strain Sensitive Strip , was a Bakelite film impregnated with graphite , with copper screen terminals cast in the ends for lead wire connections . These gages , in use , were surface mounted with shellac and were satisfactory strain measuring devices except for the omnipresent hysteresis. deForest began to study hysteresis behavior intently , including the use of dead weight calibrating apparatus , to see if he could tolerate it in precision work . He had contracts to  | furnish these gages , as he said , in wastebasketsful to NACA ( the ancestor of NASA ) and to the Model Basin of the Bureau of Ships . Ess Strips represented another definite step forward toward the ideal strain gage that can be described as follows : The Ideal Strain Gage must have zero gage length , zero thickness and be sold for almost zero price . It must be preferably electric for remote reading and switching rapidly through parallel circuits , must hug the surface , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unbalance or aerodynamic drag to a part . It must be temperature insensitive yet usable through a wide temperature range from hot to cryogenic and have a gage factor unchanging with temperature . It must have an output signal readable with a minimum of electronic crutches , be easy to install in remote locations , and be re-usable several times . It must have zero transverse sensitivity , zero creep and zero drift , infinite fatigue life at high strain level , high elongation characteristics for use in the plastic range , infinite frequency response and unparalleled accuracy and sensitivity , with exceptional capacity to transfer the IR 2 heat build up instantly to surrounding media , and other things I ca n't think of offhand . The game A. V. and I intended to play , without resting , was to keep inching up to this ideal , item by item , and by little steps to conquer one barrier after another . We would keep looking back to compare our latest forward step with the ideal and see how many impossibilities we could check off . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a game that we felt guilty in taking money for playing it , but money and orders kept on coming in as a kind of disturbance to our absorption in our sport . The Ess Strip was a little step forward . It was electric , it lay flat , it had good output signal , was insensitive to moisture and had pretty good temperature insensibility , remote reading and so on . A. V. would take holidays from the strain gage game when he would occupy himself with a business he had established in New York City in connection with welding engineering and consulting . I recall with pleasure some of the renowned welding engineers who were associated with him in this work , Charley McCune , Comfort Adams , and Mr. Owens of Newport News Shipbuilding Co . Even in this activity A. V. could not divorce himself from thinking along lines of experimental stress analysis , which was not called by such name in those days . He studied strain patterns in whitewash on welded structures , the flaking and cracking in the plastic range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born , which was exhibited to me as a curiosity by A. V. in his MIT laboratory . A. V. was a keen coiner of descriptive names , Ess Strip , Magnaflux , later Stresscoat and Rayflex , and they all stuck . Of course the word Magnaflux  | became prominent and was soon the commercial name of a successful corporation that established magnetic particle testing as a major nondestructive method in which magnetic particles formed along cracks and discontinuities in a magnetized component or part . The " Arsenal of Democracy " could not have done without it in World War II . One thing leads to another , so Stresscoat was next on the docket . A. V. 's thinking moved in a direct line from whitewash to Magnaflux to a brittle lacquer that was to be controllable and would crack at right angles to the lines of strain at some reproducible threshold strain value . He put the search for proper materials in the hands of one of his part-time associates , Greer Ellis , who had approached the idea in a master 's thesis . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when he did open his mouth he was both interesting and amusing . As A. V. said , " The less he talked , the more he thought . " There are quiet people whose silence may be due to their being absorbed in thought , but there are also many silent ones who may not be meditating at all , because they can think of nothing to think about . Greer Ellis was jokingly referred to as the one in our group of professional compatriots who looked most like a professor with his prominent spectacles , his benevolently sour expression and all other traditional trimmings . Greer was as persistent as the Yale bulldog , but he did have low moments of discouragement like most research types . I am sure he would like me to add that he was a practical research type , for he had no patience with excess wordage or over-elaboration of action or false appearance . He bored to the heart of things by the shortest route . Since he accomplished his purposes with the least number of moves it might be said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Ellis Effect " ? or results , not data . When my periodic visits to deForest coincided with one of Greer 's moments of discouragement , A. V. would gently suggest that I take him to the MIT Graduate House for lunch ( at Southwark 's expense ) and give him an injection of hope and new courage ( verbal not liquid ) . I always found myself in the right mood to do this ; I have my low periods , too , but they usually come when nobody is looking . Every normal person has his times of dejection . These " pep talk " luncheons were my main contribution to Stresscoat until the time came to try it on the market . I was given two dozen half-pint cans to distribute to prospective customers for trial . I still have a dozen of them because the report from field tests prompted me to recommend further study . The misbehavior of Stresscoat in field tests was due to its temperature and humidity sensitivity . It would craze when either condition changed ,  | that is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the direction of strain . Humidity and temperature could quickly nullify any good work that Stresscoat could do , like the American Car and Foundry spray-coated box car test , where crack patterns went wild . They puzzled over the box car for days . The solution to this problem was to do all Stresscoat work at midnight when atmospheric conditions are constant . But who wants to work on tests in all kinds of places including climbing up bridge towers at midnight ? I insisted on outdoor tests in daylight . My pleading for improvement in Stresscoat stability had good effect . A whole series of Stresscoat solutions was established to suit different temperature and humidity situations , better methods of spraying and undercoating were developed , and all was packaged into a kit that was turned over to the Magnaflux Corp . to market . The cure defeated the disease on the first encounter . Stresscoat became one of the best friends of the experimental stress analysts , and Greer Ellis went on to develop useful instrumentation for strain gages , under the name of Ellis Associates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The search for a brittle lacquer to suit A. V. 's fastidious taste was long and arduous . Ellis recounts this in a humorous manner , better than ever I could no matter how much space was at my disposal in this book . A technical talk by Ellis on this subject should not be missed . One thing I gathered from listening to him was that after trying hundreds of solvents , the only one that was entirely satisfactory was carbon disulphide , the smelliest olfactory insult that man has ever devised , and a terrible thing to introduce into a laboratory . Until Ellis was isolated he was losing personal popularity fast . Upon my first whiff of this odor upon entering deForest 's lab one morning , I asked what the awful smell was and A. V. answered cheerfully , " That 's Ellis . " But Ellis lived through all the jibes and peddled his odorous Stresscoat until it became a major tool in the art of experimental stress analysis and a valuable companion to the bonded wire strain gage . In passing , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another pathfinder though not directly related to the theme of this story . The Rayflex machine took its name from the fact that it was built by Raytheon Manufacturing Co. and made life tests of materials in flexure fatigue . It tested full size rods , plates and bars of steel in the " as rolled " condition , determining fatigue life , " crackless plasticity , " Young 's Modulus , damping capacity , and toughness , indicating first incipient cracking in fatigue by falling off of the natural frequency of the 36-inch-long , or longer , test pieces . The machine was all-electronic . The test piece was oscillated at its natural frequency by a-c magnets and held on flat supports at the nodes by d-c magnets . By automatic means , amplitude of  | flexure was maintained constant , change in natural frequency was indicated to show crack development , cycles were counted , the effect of surface conditions , mill scale and shot peening on fatigue life recorded , and many other things . Manufacturers of rock drills found it the best yet for determining life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtiss-Wright Co. fatigue tested crankshafts . A. V. 's genius for simplifying things to their lowest terms was activated , after noting the Rayflex success , to devise a Baby Rayflex , which was later built by O. S. Peters in Washington , under license , as a commercial low priced unit for bench operation . Instead of oscillating the " as rolled " or " as forged " specimen as a long simple beam he used a cantilever beam and oscillated the vise holding its end , leaving the free end bumping between rubber corks for control purposes . Such a machine as this sold for a few hundred dollars instead of thousands and , though maximum stress in the test piece was a little difficult to calculate by normal mathematics , nevertheless the little machine was a valuable tool for checking material properties including parts for home appliances .  | The curtain rises now upon the entrance of the chief actor in our drama . ' The scene must change several times while we identify him . I never missed attendance at the annual meeting of the American Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the lifeblood of my technical friendships pulsed . The meeting in June 1938 had a program that looked like any of its predecessors . There was always a Symposium . The dictionary defines symposium as a Greek word meaning " drinking party , " so for the sake of decorum I will use the word " Seminar " which the dictionary says is " a group of students ( usually graduate ) engaged under a professor , in original research . " This time the subject was " Impact " Testing " and everybody who was anybody was there because the subject was controversial . I was there to learn , if possible , but my special interest was to hear Harry Mann 's paper from the Watertown Arsenal , on variable velocity impact experiments for which I had furnished some minor items of equipment . I knew it would start an argument . A paper read by Dr. Donald S. Clark , of which the authors were Clark and Datwyler of California Institute of Technology , on the subject of " Stress-Strain Relations under Tension Impact Loadings " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the load-deformation values and curves reported . One of the leading discussers was my old friend Dr. Tuckerman . I Rs discussions were usually of more technical value than the paper being discussed . I let this all go over my head because I was interested only in one thing and that was the exact mechanism for taking these records from a pendulum hitting a specimen in tension impact at 11 feet per second . It was not very well detailed in the paper . When the seminar crowd had dispersed I sought out Dr. Clark to find out tare about his test methods . He told me to visit him at Caltech and he would introduce me to the man who devised the apparatus for recording the load-deformation in impact , but he could tell me now that the tension dynamometer he mentioned was made with utmost simplicity by winding some filament wire on an extension of the test specimen , cementing it in place 55  | with Glyptal , then connecting the wire to the Y plates in his oscilloscope . The X values were obtained by having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate layers of copper sheet and mica . The copper sheet contacts triggered voltage to the X plates of the oscillograph , providing light spots on the screen while it was being photographed in conventional manner . This sounded like the deForest type of simplified thinking , so I was most anxious to follow this up at Caltech but could not get company permission to make the trip . The usual company reaction to a request for a trip to California was that it was an expense account junket . I will admit that Southern California in 1938 was a more attractive place to visit then , before half the world decided to settle there , but I would not press for it . Instead I took my periodic trip to see deForest at Cambridge about a month after the Impact meeting . I had an idea that maybe he had a hand in that development at Caltech because it was so much in his style , but I was not prepared for the surprise that greeted me at Cambridge . As usual , on these visits we took up new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence if what he showed me was true . He handed me something that looked like a patch of tissue paper a little bigger than a postage stamp kept rigidly in shape by small plastic blocks at each end with a brass bar holding them apart to keep the paper from wrinkling . A filament grid on the paper was almost invisible . He told me that I held in my hand a strain gage that would read to a millionth of an inch ( ten times the sensitivity of the most sensitive Huggenberger Tensometer and the equivalent of the Tuckerman optical gage ) , that it had shown itself on a Rubicon galvanometer to be as accurate as a mechanical gage , that when cemented with ordinary duPont Duco to a metal strip it would follow any vibration frequency that could be imposed on it by any apparatus they had at MIT , even magnetostriction . By that time I was lost , I could not absorb any more wonders . I said , " Where did you get that ? It looks like next to nothing to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Engineering Department developed it for a test project he has on a shake-table , an elevated water tank . " " Where is Professor Ruge ? " I asked , with my bird-dog instincts alert . " His office is in the basement of this building , but I have just asked him to come up , " said deForest , and just then Professor Ruge walked in , looking like a very pleasant , personable professor . Please do not get the idea that I think the average professor is not pleasant , he is usually the most agreeable man you would want to meet , but when one gives the appearance of being especially pleasant and unflustered , I like to note it . Professor Ruge had a mounted gage in which the brass bar handle had  | been removed , and he demonstrated its response on the galvanometer . That was all I needed . " Let us take this down to Baldwin , " I said . ( Southwark by now was Baldwin-Southwark . ) " We will arrange a licensing agreement , start a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is really as good as you say it is , because what you say sounds like the impossible . Of course , I would n't doubt what you say because you have never failed , so far , to produce . Furthermore , " I added , " I believe in miracles . " The next thing I knew deForest came to Baldwin . He had arranged an attractive demonstration . An improvised vise held a cantilever beam about 10 inches long . On the underside , a bonded paper strain gage that you could hardly see was cemented with lead wires running to a Leeds &Northrup; Type S Test Set . On top of the beam was fixed a Huggenberger Tensometer . When the beam was deflected the Leeds &; Northrup instrument indicated movement and the Huggenberger needle also moved . Nobody doubted that the Huggenberger was reading strain , they could see and believe it , so the Huggenberger confirmed that the paper gage was reading the same strain , presumably . Most of the Baldwin and Southwark people looked at this demonstration wearing a " so-what " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( since the merger ) and Ed Hathaway , Southwark 's patent attorney , who was also a bird-dog and an alert protector of Southwark 's interests everywhere . But the official Baldwin reaction was , " We are in the locomotive business , and not going to make postage stamps . " deForest was fast to respond to an off-hand evaluation . He picked up his demonstration equipment and started to move out , saying , " Come on , Frank , let 's build and market these ourselves . " Ed Hathaway was just as fast . " Wait , " he exclaimed , " that is not yet an official rejection . Let us look at this some more . " To this , Mr. Harman nodded approval . Accord was thus established and Hathaway began preparation of a patent application and then began conference after conference in Mr. Harman 's office at which either Ruge or deForest or both were present in the weeks that followed . You would never imagine that it would take so much talking to launch anything so small as a paper strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etiquette and so was Hathaway , while all I wanted to do was to go out and show the gages off and develop a market for them . Things seemed to move very slowly for many months , and my main occupation was visiting Professor Ruge in his basement office and encouragin , him to speed up development of commercial forms . At the next American Society for Testing Materials annual meeting in June 1939 in Atlantic City , there was an instrument exhibit in connection with the meeting . Baldwin-Southwark had a small exhibit table there on  | which deForest had arranged the same demonstration apparatus he had shown ten months before at the Baldwin plant . The reason it was unchanged was that it would have been hard to improve upon as a convincing argument to prove that our paper gage was not some kind of hoax. deForest himself was in the booth the whole time , demonstrating . His presence was an ample drawing card to cause visitors to stop and look , but most walked away again , after brief words with A. V. , all except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom Triplett . He was head of a commercial testing laboratory group located in the Lockheed Aircraft , Burbank , plant , where he specialized in nondestructive testing , principally 100 per cent x-ray inspection of aluminum alloy forgings for aircraft . Triplett took a good look at our exhibit and then walked away so fast that I was moved to follow him and ask what he thought of it and where he was going . He said he was going right back to Southern California and tell his aircraft customers about this , because , he said , it was a " breakthrough . " He did tell his aircraft customers about the paper gage , and very thoroughly too , because we began to get reports through our San Francisco office that there was talk in the aircraft companies about some mysterious new way of testing aircraft components , but it was all very nebulous . At Baldwin-Southwark we had two direct warnings that something was going on . Consolidated Aircraft Corp . of San Diego ( Consolidated and Vultee were then separate companies ) had hired one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gage development . A little later , K. R. Jackman of Consolidated got out a mimeographed report on the " Celstrain Gage " that was mailed to aircraft people and government departments concerned , such as Navy Bureau of Aeronautics and the Army Air Corps . His description sounded like the Ruge gage . You will recognize in the name Celstrain , a contraction representing Consolidated Electric Strain Gage . Permission to visit the West Coast was no longer hard to get ; I was ordered to go there to find out what was going on , and to police it , whatever it was . I stopped first to see Dr. Clark at Caltech . This was August , 1939 . He recalled his promise to tell me more about the way that a load-deformation record was taken on an oscilloscope . He pointed to an old rolltop desk in the corner of his office and said , " The young fellow that sits there , named Ed Simmons , is the one who set up the impact recording apparatus you were interested in . " " Where can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fogg at Consolidated Engineering ; he knows where Simmons lives . We do n't see much of him here because he never comes in before noon and stays till midnight , and he wo n't work any other way . It runs up our electric light bills . He moves in and out like a shadow and he does n't tell us much , " was Dr. Clark 's answer .  | I called on Phil Fogg , who directed me to Simmon 's house . Arriving there , the time was not yet noon , so his Mother said I might as well wait because he would not appear before midday . I am glad I waited . Ed Simmons was a quiet , soft-spoken , and very young man without capacity for show-off or emotion , and he was dressed as though he were going to play tennis . " Come out to the garage , " he said , as though words were an exertion . The garage looked like Dr. Tuckerman 's office , everything at sixes and sevens . He picked up from a rough tabletop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bonded and unbonded , some like Lilliputian stringed musical instruments that could be used and removed for use again , others laid down on old Christmas cards , or filaments spanning plastic supports . When I extracted patiently from Simmons a description of what he had done I could hardly contain my enthusiasm . I told him about the Ruge activities , which were of a more conventional type . I begged him to grant Baldwin-Southwark a license and to let them apply for a patent in his name on his original conceptions , but he insisted he wanted to forget the whole thing , as " anybody could do this kind of thing . " He did not want to he bothered with any complicated business matters . I begged and pleaded ; engineers had wanted something like this since the pyramids were built and if anybody could do it , why did n't they ? It was like talking to the wallpaper , so I left to see Tom Triplett and start my detective work to discover who was doing what with strain gages on the West Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever devising to the growing strength of Ruge 's developments required strategy , and my method was elementary . Having already hinted to him that Dr. Ruge was the dominant figure in the paper strain gage business , which had left him unmoved , I followed up with a few brief news letters about strain gage progress at Cambridge , believing that people do n't develop appetites for things until somebody else wants them , then they are ready to fight for what they originally rejected . The strategy must have worked , because a letter arrived from Dr. Clark saying that he and Simmons were coming to visit Baldwin-Southwark. l Ipon their arrival we arranged for Ruge and deForest to be there , too , and a big conference was staged that extended through the morning , afternoon , and through dinner time at Stouffer 's restaurant , finishing up in a room in the Bellevue-Stratford . Simmons and his spokesman , Dr. Clark , sat opposite to Dr. Ruge and his spokesman , Dr. deForest . Hathaway and Harman of Baldwin-Southwark were in the middle , and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was much talk . Clark explained how Simmons instrumented his tests for Hughes Tool Co. , located in the Southwest , by using some ' river-Harris one-mil constantan wire he had in the lab , cementing it with Glvptal . Then deForest described how Ruge 's team had  | unwound an IRC resistor and cemented the wire in a grid with Duco cement to make his paper gage for use on tests of a model of an earthquake resistant water tower tested on a shake-table , for some West Coast sponsor . But there seemed to be a noticeable absence of notebooks and dates to establish who was first . As the story unfolded from both sides it developed that there was little question but that Simmons had prior art . This meant that Hathaway would have to go to the patent office , withdraw at least part of the Ruge application and substitute Simmons . So much talk made me weary , and when I grow weary I grow gently sarcastic . The paper strain gage , hitherto nameless , deserved one before it got any older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all four contestants , then perhaps we could shorten the discussion and bring lasting peace . However , for such a small gage the name should be equally small with a mysterious connotation to capture public interest . In advertisements I had noted the use of letters followed by a meaningless number to heighten the mystery . ( TV commercials use this technique today . ) How would it be to use the first letters of all four names ? I mentally tested them but to no good . However , S and R for Simmons and Ruge thus in the order in which they were dominating the discussion , sounded all right followed by the numeral 4 representing the four people who had held the stage all day . SR-4 , it would represent a sort of a good joke anyhow . In a lull in the proceedings I suggested it in a spirit of fun , for a diversion . Hathaway , who was tired but still sharp , took it up and registered it as a trademark . Thus it ended : Hathaway carried on zealously , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ruge . Royalty payments were agreed upon . I remember Simmons was to get a few pennies per gage , and Ruge a percentage on all his developments , after he and deForest formed Ruge-deForest , Inc. , rented an old store on Massachusetts Avenue across the street from MIT and started a series of strain gage and transducer developments . These brought exceptional progress and public acclaim to this modest business that made strain gages a major breakthrough for science and industry in all fields including medicine and dentistry . These contributions to technology from 1941 to date will be traced in a later chapter . The story of Simmons from this point , was not so smooth . Caltech claimed they sponsored the development and asked a 60 ? 40 split on royalties . Mild Ed Simmons , showing tiger-like qualities , hired two very young lawyers just out of college on a share basis and sued Caltech for rights to all royalties . It looked like an uneven contest , but it went all the way up to the California Supreme Court , which was pretty powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to bother to take out license or patent because it was n't worth the trouble .  | Ile won the final decree ? a surprise to many ? on the basis that when he made the invention he was only a graduate student and not on the Caltech payroll ; hence Caltech had no rights . The Los Angeles Times ran a picture of Simmons kissing the decree that entitled him to collect the $125,000 back royalties impounded by Baldwin awaiting court decision . Our California office clipped the picture and sent it to me , and I sent it on to Ruge . He returned it with a note saying he would kiss more than that for $125,000 . After this , when I was looking for Ed Simmons I would find him dressed like a tennis player in his law library that he had accumulated for study during the trial . While Ruge-deForest pushed ahead with the strain gage and transducer business , Ed Simmons read law , set up a " Simmons Research Foundation , " went into the oil prospecting business with a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin-diving and cave exploring in a quiet , persistent way , became an expert 3-D photographer with Viewmaster equipment . I bought a Viewmaster myself just to look at Ed 's pictures , some of which were excellent color views of Ed emerging from caves . He involved himself successfully in setting up a wire music service for restaurants ; he ( lid everything but follow up on the strain gage business . I was authorized to offer Simmons a job as our Director of Research at the suggestion of Ed Hathaway , but he declined in a terse but lengthy explanation ( for him ) as follows , " I do n't want to leave Pasadena . " That settled things for the moment . I went back again to talk with him in his law library in Pasadena , giving my offer a new angle ? be our Director of Research and work in Pasadena . He used fewer words to reject this one , " I am a one-shot inventor . " My interpretation of that one was he liked his role as business potentate better than thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size for their great value . The SR-4 Bonded Wire Resistance Strain Gage , Ruge version , which became the established form , was at the start made with 5 inches of one mil ( 0.001 inch ) copper-nickel wire laid in a grid and cemented to its carrier paper with duPont Duco Cement . The paper was a little heavier than cigarette paper . The first gages carried the plastic end blocks and brass bar mentioned before , but these were soon dispensed with to simplify and cut the cost of the gage . Lead-wire pigtails at least ten times as great in diameter , to which the grid filament wires were soldered , served to connect the gage to the external circuit . There was a wide catalogue of types and configurations and gage lengths available in envelopes of ten gages more or less which could be shipped by first class mail , usually from stock on hand . This is not a catalogue or a descriptive technical paper on SR-4 strain gages , so if more information is wanted the manufacturer can supply it in quantity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. R. Lissner ( McGraw-Hill Book Co. , New York ) can tell both beginners and experienced people all  | they want to know about bonded strain gages and how to use them . Perry and Lissner illustrate the whole story well , and the extensive bibliography they provide will permit people to go as far as they want to . In the few years since 1940 the literature has expanded beyond all belief . Perry and Lissner have prepared a second edition ( revised ) , which appeared in 1962 . I think it time to stop and compare the strain gage of 1941 with the specifications for an ideal strain measuring means as set forth in Chapter VIII . This comparison will be very hasty and informal because again I want to remind you that this is a history , not a textbook or engineering discourse : ( a ) Zero gage length ? not attained but almost ( 1/32 inch ) . ( b ) Zero thickness ? missed by 0.003-inch. ( c ) Electrical , remote reading , rapid switching ? it meets these perfectly . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other protective coatings serve this purpose . ( e ) Effect on weight , balance or aerodynamic drag in aircraft components ? negligible . ( f ) Effects of temperature ? not self-compensating for temperature , but a dummy gage in the circuit prevents mixing the effects of temperature and strain together in the resultant reading . ( g ) Usable temperature range ? in the Bakelite type up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit , and down to cryogenic in the Duco type , with special attention to installing technique . ( h ) Gage factor unchanging with temperature ? not achieved but metallurgical possibilities to approach it were under study . ( i ) High output signal ? not with this gage , amplifiers needed . ( j ) Ease of installation ? the best yet , once the technique is acquired . ( k ) Re-usable ? forms were developed by Simmons that could be removed and re-installed , but these were not commercially practical items . ( I ) Transverse sensitivity ? about 2%. ( m ) Zero creep ? not zero , but creep varies with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero shift ? not bad , not good , too many factors involved that detract . ( o ) Infinite fatigue life at high strain level ? this must be defined carefully as to strain level ; fatigue life was greatly extended by dual lead gages where the size transition from grid filament to lead wire was mitigated by an intermediate size wire . ( p ) High elongation ? this has been obtained up to 20 per cent by special gages and special cements. ( q ) Infinite frequency response ? satisfactory up to as high frequency as deForest was able to generate in his laboratory . ( r ) Accuracy ? gages have been used on calibrating apparatus of many kinds as secondary standards , and in testing machines of high precision .  | ( s ) Sensitivity ? a function of read-out instrumentation ; no limit could be determined . ( t ) Heat transfer to surrounding media ? not as good as hoped for because of insulating effect of paper carrier and cement . Thus low voltages ( 4 and 6 volts ) were generally impressed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not important . A gage factor of 2 ( constantan ) was very stable , a gage factor of 3.5 ( Isoclastic wire ) was not so stable having an appreciable temperature coefficient of resistance , so this wire was specified for dynamic use . The higher the gage factor the less the amplification required in the external circuit , hence on two occasions metallurgical research was initiated to find a binary or ternary alloy of higher gage factor and at the same time a satisfactory temperature coefficient of resistance , but this eluded all seekers for several years . In subsequent years new developments kept bringing us closer to the ideal , as you will see . As each hurdle is surmounted in this period from 1941 to date , the achievement of further steps toward the ideal will be specifically noted . This overcoming of technical obstacles is like the hazards on a golf course ; it would be a dull game without them . My admiration for Ed Simmons ' type of original thinking led me to offer his name to the Committee on Science and the Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their medals , a coveted honor among scientists . This was in 1942 . By late 1943 the deliberations of the committee had reached agreement that Simmons had qualifications to receive the Edward Longstreth Medal on Medal Day , April 19 , 1944 . I must set the stage for this by explaining Medal Day . It is about the most formal occasion that takes place in Philadelphia in the entire year . The world 's leading engineers and scientists assemble at a full dress dinner in the Great Hall of the Institute . About 15 medals are awarded each year , some like the Franklin Medal approaching the prestige of the Nobel Prize , but not quite . Much study is given by qualified sub-committees to the importance of the achievements of the candidates for medals in relation to their contributions to the arts and sciences of the world , to the good of mankind , and to the advancement of science . My job was to convince this learned committee , 70 in all , representing all branches of technology and science , that Simmons invention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid in the preparation of a report containing the facts gleaned from authorities including Simmons . Simmons , as I have remarked before , is a man of few words . All I had to work with after a long talk with him was , " Anybody could have done it . " All the talking was done by me , " How did you come to conceiving of this approach to a gage ? Was it a mathematical triumph , a theoretical victory , an experimental conquest , or intuition ? " His reply to all this was some-  | thing that when pieced together could have fitted into this pattern : lie did n't know it could n't be done so he just did it , without even trying . That last hit a spot I have been talking about for some time , namely , that to try hard to do something is the worst way to go about it . I have been taught not to try ; it gets you all tightened up ; it confuses the exercise of intellect , fogs the mental processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for accurate physical and intellectual effort , and knocks out instinctive action , which is usually the correct course . When tennis players , golfers , musicians ? anybody ? interferes with his skill by substituting painstaking thought and tries consciously to guide his movements , he muddles them up . I would trust in the Good Lord to help me arrive where I was going , and carry me along between times . Although I hesitated at first to face the committee with what report I had from Simmons , I decided to have a go at it , anyway . Instead of being snubbed or rejected , I noticed an expression of pleasure on many faces . I found that they liked " attic inventors . " History revealed them as the most truly original of all , and Simmons proved to be the first real " attic inventor " type honored by the Institute since Benjamin Franklin , the revered founder and patron saint of this very Institute . Medal Day begins with a formal luncheon at noon followed by meetings with the Medalists , press conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simmons did not show up , so I explained that he was embarrassed , knowing that he was n't at all , he just did not care . Simmons was still absent when we dressed for dinner , Medalists in white tie and tails , others in black tie . When the Medalists filed into their designated places at the head table , I had not the nerve to look to see if my boy was at his place at the table . When I did get up nerve to look my heart jumped with joy . There he was sitting between the great chemist , Dr. Leo Baekeland , inventor of Bakelite , tall , mustached and impressive , and on the other side Dr. Harlow Shapley , famous astronomer , director of the Harvard observatory , both in white tie and tails . Ed Simmons was looking very small , very young and very bored and he was in his familiar tennis clothes , or a slightly enhanced version of them . As each Medalist would receive his medal and scroll from the President of the Franklin Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Ed Simmons , who said nothing at all and looked tired . I think , but I am not sure , that he got the biggest hand of all from the 450 or more prominent people attending the dinner . Those of the Institute and committee members present seemed to feel that I had done the Institute a favor by letting them see in person an inventor that looked like a traditional , historic type , a Diogenes . After this , let me hear no one criticize the dress or nonconformities , or little singularities of E. E. Simmons , Jr. , for I am one of his fans .  | Next day Ed Simmons visited the Baldwin plant . I was editor of our SR-4 News Letter ( later called Testing Topics ) . In the May , 1944 , issue I ran a page on the Simmons medal with a photograph of Simmons displaying his medal to officers of Baldwin . He was wearing tennis clothes in the picture . An extract from the Sponsor 's speech is reproduced in the publication ; here are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a valuable contribution to engineering and research . . . " Stress analysis is based on assumptions . Our Medalist supplies a missing , link for correcting them by accurate measurement . His device , small as a postage stamp but large in usefulness . . . " It has proven essential in engineering design of aircraft and other powerful instruments of war , and . will be as valuable in peace . " ' We will now leave the deForest story and look elsewhere for our history , but we are not through with the bonded wire gage ; the best is yet to come , in the marketing adventures and the educational campaigns , also the dramatic entrance of experimental stress analysis upon world-wide usage which , in the late 1920 's , I practically had to invent to help sell strain gages.  | This could more aptly be called " The Bootstrap Story , " because it is a fine example of a man lifting himself and his business by his bootstraps . We have covered the early years , Peters at the National Bureau of Standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Telemeter , its commercial success and then its retreat before newer ideas , Peters ' move to the little room on H Street , Washington , the advent of Larry Hyde and the outgrowing of the H Street office . This has been a tale of peace and tranquility , earnestness , integrity mixed with good technology , of a yielding before the onslaughts of business experiences , not fighting or contesting with anybody or anything , no show-off nor overselling , very little talk but then only to utter words of wisdom with some dry humor . A familiar scene is reproduced below . A few engineers from the Bureau of Standards are visiting Peters ' shop to see if he would design and build a special instrument for them . NBS Engineer , " Do you think it can be made to work , Mr. Peters ? " Peters , " Guess so . " Engineer , " Will you design and build it for us ? " Peters , " Guess so . " Engineer , " Will it cost much ? " Peters , " Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you send us a price and we will send you an order . " End of conference . The prospective customer felt instinctively that he could trust O. S. Peters . Observing this , I say people seem a more valuable study than things . All technical writers start with the same intent , to trace the development of the physical sciences , the earth sciences , or any of the other sciences . Almost any study that is trying to make a showing these days calls itself a science . Other technical writers stick to their purpose , but I get so fascinated with the people involved that I start to study them instead of the sciences . People are the best education because they come in two parts , what they are and what they do . I believe in many 66  | things that I can not see . For instance , the better attributes of people are hidden like an iceberg , but you know they are there . What a person really is shows in his face , and as Thoreau says , the face is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters shows how an unpretentious small business man weathered the great depression . I have already told of his establishing a small shop in 1928 . In 1929 , before he could get set , the depression hit . Ile was without capital , paying his expenses from tiny earnings , meager savings , and rescue pittances from Southwark and Emery-Tatnall Company . As an example , Peters could not make his carbon piles without a pillmaking machine for pressing out the carbon ring disks , so Southwark picked up a second-hand pill machine from a Philadelphia medical supply house and shipped it to him on consignment . With this machine and improvised tools , Peters could turn out more work with less men than anyone I ever knew . His deliveries and prices and quality were very good . In rating the efficiencies of business organizations and corporations , you can rate Peters at 100 per cent , with other organizations descending from that level in proportion to size , management integrity , and employee fighting spirit . In January , 1931 , Lawrence Hyde started as mechanical engineer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid himself , in an interesting way , percentage of gross sales . But in the depths of the depression when money was very tight , these percentage earnings were not paid in cash but in paper , I.O.U . ' s , since rent and raw material came first . As an example , in one famous month in 1932 , Hyde earned 72 cents , which was his share of the ten dollars total sales that month , so Hyde 's wife Olga took up teaching and brought in the only cash seen around the place . When I asked Peters how he was standing up under adversity , he made one of the longest speeches of his career , saying , " God never gives a man a burden greater than he can bear , but this rule do n't go for people that put burdens on their fellow men . " I let the conversation stop there , because I knew whom Peters meant , having just looked at his account books . But never despair ; though periodic despair is normal . There is always help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard it said that the difference between success and failure is this , the successful man can hang on five minutes longer . The " help around the corner " this time proved to be the Goodyear Zeppelin stress-strain recorder , also a second item that closely followed , the Inductor Telemeter . My testing machines were being accepted commercially in unexpected quantity and seemed to be of satisfactory quality , which was powerfully  | encouraging for these depression days . But they lacked one thing , a stressstrain recorder , for we had preached that load without deformation measurement was " like ham without eggs . " I had devised a load-time recorder using a Peters carbon pile pressure gage in the hydraulic capsule line recording on a Leeds &; Northrup Micromax Recorder , and although this looked intriguingly scientific compared with old test equipment , I still could not sell the idea of " load-time " as a substitute for " load-strain . " This was so even though I could show that if I applied load to the specimen at a fairly constant rate for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and time with strain in the specimen ( not allowing for grip slippage ) , which was later done successfully by the Instron machine . I wrote a paper for ASTM on this subject that was rather convincing , but apparently the only one I convinced was myself , because the paper was rejected . I then put pressure on Leeds &; Northrup to build me an X-Y double Micromax recorder that would move the chart for strain instead of time , but the price was out of sight . The only one made was sold to the City College of New York and worked well . At the next annual meeting of ASTM at Atlantic City , I adopted a new stimulating technique for searching out ideas . I told everybody with whom I came in contact about my urgent need and how I would reward a winning idea . I practically wept as I described my desperate craving for a stress-strain recorder . I have used this method of idea-exploring several times with success . Its effectiveness was due not alone to its appeal to the puzzle-solving urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused in my friends , which was enough to start them all thinking and communicating suggestions to me by word of mouth , by letter , telephone , wire , and even by cable . Invariably , one out of a mass of varied suggestions would solve my problem perfectly . This time , the person who came to my rescue was my universally informed old friend Dr. L. B. Tuckerman of the National Bureau of Standards who stood with me at the ASTM registration desk . He noted my sad and quizzical look and wanted to know what was bothering me . This was the opening I needed , so I told him I simply wanted a stressstrain recorder . He agreed that it was a legitimate need and suggested I see Dr. Wolfgang Klemperer at the Goodyear Zeppelin Corp . in Akron , which I did as fast as I could get there . He . had exactly what I needed , so we arranged a license agreement on the spot . He was using a " break-and-make " electric contact system operated by a tiny extensometer secured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bell-crank that caused a contact to break as the specimen stretched . The resulting open circuit engaged a bevel gear clutch in the recorder case that started the chart drum turning , which rotated a  | pulley on the extensometer by means of a connecting string kept taut by hanging weight . Rotation of the pulley turned a micrometer screw that followed up and contacted the retreating bell-crank , which again closed the circuit and disengaged the clutch in the recorder . This provided an accurate step-by-step strain record that magnified strain either 250 or 500 times . I admire the ingenious brain that figured this one out ; it is in a class with deForest . I took this recorder idea back to Peters in Washington , with a sample , and he promptly designed and built a good looking X-Y compact unit that also embraced the break-and-make principle in the stylus movement to achieve the load coordinate of the X-Y graph . This load value was picked off the Emery capsule line by a Heise Bourdon tube , the same as in the testing machine load indicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonaveraging , were included in the package . The autographic recorder was first shown to the public at the National Metals Exposition on Commonwealth Pier in Boston in September , 1931 , and stirred metallurgists and competitors alike . Mr. Templin , Chief Engineer of Tests of the Aluminum Research Laboratories , was one who saw this recorder . This was the beginning of a valuable friendship , which started with his revealing his patents and prior art on this same method of strain recording , except using Selsyn motors instead of string , to which claim Goodyear Zeppelin yielded and transferred our license to Mr. Templin . He then made available to us further advances in strain recording mechanisms , as well as many other designs on grips and testing tools that advanced the art of testing immeasurably . This provided Peters with many more products to manufacture that were related to the field of our mutual interests . When we had thus settled down to work with Peters as marketer for his line of testing accessories , he confided that his fortunes had changed their course . From dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging to impell him to draw upon the last of his carefully accumulated earnings . Income taxes had not preempted earnings of small business in those days . He felt he could finance the building of a small factory at 1236 Mt . Olivet Rd. , N.E. in Washington , a quiet spot next to Mt . Olivet Cemetery . This was completed in 1937 , which you will note was a good period in history in which to build because the effects of the great depression were still around , and builders were very glad to provide high quality work at very low prices . I built my own home in the early part of this period and still reside in this excellent example of how well people can work when they are motivated by need . But tranquility and a clear track were not long assured . They never are .  | We were notified by a competitor that they were licensees under the patent of Professor J. Hammond Smith of the University of Pittsburgh , which covered broadly the use of electric contacts in recorders . This broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contest , we bought the Smith patent so as to remove the last obstacle to participation in the enlarging recorder market . We had not long to enjoy the expensively acquired peace until we were competing with ourselves . W. D. Macgeorge , who ran our development laboratory at Southwark , devised a stress-strain recorder using the Differential Transformer , an invention he had brought with him when he joined us . This used no electric contacts , drew a smooth curve instead of steps , and increased the speed of response , but it also presented a new series of obstacles regarding prior art that we had to set about clearing up one way or another . Peters ' enlarged plant and staff permitted him to take on more products such as a hysteresis-tree a-c instrument for which we had obtained a license from B. F. Langer of Westinghouse . Peters called it the Inductor Telemeter because it was physically the same size and did the same kind of work as the old carbon pile d-c telemeter , but did it better . The two carbon piles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laminated cores with an armature in between the coils . The air gap between armature and coils was 0.01 inch . The frame carrying the coils terminated in one gage point ; the armature was attached to the other gage point . Movement of the armature between the coils changed the magnetic reluctance of the flux paths and therefore the current in the coils . These coils were connected as two arms in a Wheatstone bridge . The bridge was powered with 60-cycle current except when frequencies greater than 12 cps were to be measured ; then the power supply was a 720 cps motor-generator set . Calibrated milliammeters were used as strain indicators. and oscillographs with built-in rectifiers as recorders . The high output required no electronic equipment , such as amplifiers . Inductor Telemeters were used most effectively in rolling mill load blocks . Continuous mills with multiple roll stands were coming into use in large numbers in 1934 . For these installations , roll pressures were a vital factor to prevent roll spalling , broken roll necks and bearing failures , but most of all to distribute loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper . The load blocks were installed as permanent equipment fitting between bearing chuck and screw-down at each end of the roll . The compression forces caused the solid round block to take a barrel shape . The swelling around the middle circumference caused the split ring that girdled the block at mid-section to spread open at the split , providing relative motion between the two coils and the armature of one Inductor Telemeter . Load was indicated on wattmeters  | and recorded on h:sterline-Angus instruments on the mill operator 's panel . The load blocks were pre-calibrated before installation in the 10,000,000 pound testing machine at the National Bureau of Standards . Business in load blocks flourished for a time , but before long the Pratt &; Whitney Company , using General Electric reluctance gages on 50 or 100 inch gage lengths , measured rolling load in terms of deformation of the mill housing . It was so much cheaper , though more troublesome , than our blocks that we soon were losing business , and in typical Peters fashion decided to withdraw and let Pratt &; Whitney have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the calibration , which required that a hydraulic jack be set up in the mill so as to deform the mill housing while taking readings on the long gage length extensometer , thus transforming the mill itself into a calibrated load cell . In quick succession I brought in other products for Peters to build under license because his increased capacity needed filling . These included the well-known R. R. Moore Rotating Beam Fatigue Testing Machine , the Bell Telephone Laboratories Impact Tester for plastics , and other things that would eventually round out Baldwin-Southwark 's testing equipment line . Peters was now operating under an agreement that said that Peters was Baldwin 's sole supplier and Baldwin was Peters ' sole customer . He had worked up from the bad depression days like Phoenix arising from the ashes , to a prosperous business of respectable size . This business was still like a big family where old-time instrument makers ( rare in Washington ) and benevolent management were in harmony . Hyde was chief engineer and Peters was the patron saint who remained unchanged while everything about him changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice or appeared disturbed . He simply said he trusted in the Good Lord and did what was necessary . He succeeded well , keeping both himself and his business healthily alive until August , 1942 , when there came a parting of the ways . 0 . S. Peters quietly died . Hyde joined Peters ' wife and son in a partnership until the company was incorporated in 1946 with Hyde as President and Graham Peters as Vice President and purchasing agent . Peters had always financed himself from his own small resources . Upon his unexpected death Mr. Harman and I straightened out a few things with the Riggs National Bank and internally in the Baldwin relationship , such things as cash advances against inventories for stock orders in process , a home mortgage and so on . Fortunately the stress-strain recorder using the differential transformer system turned out to be a great success , so much so that Hyde used differential transformers in preference to all other strain measuring systems for many purposes and also sold them to industry through Baldwin-Southwark.  | Bill Walsh , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyde to take over his scratch gage manufacture and sent down all his tools and fixtures . All this and more so established the Peters Co. as a pre-eminent instrument builder that Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp. , which was Baldwin 's corporate name after some mergers , in June , 1954 , acquired the company by exchange of stock . They put it together with Sonntag Scientific Corp. , Ruge-deForest Co. , and the Southwark Testing Machine Department to form its presently existing Electronics &; Instrumentation Division . This was being set up in a new plant leased from Cabot , Cabot &; Forbes on Route 128 at Waltham , Mass. , which as we said at the time , was a location on the right side of the tracks for an instrument business . I think this story has a definite moral . Here was a business grown up in the sterile soil of the worst depression in our history , without artificial stimulation , like a rags " to riches story , that succeeded more by the under-stimulation of O. S. Peters than by any frantic " go-getter " activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the uncomplaining " servant of all , " so that if prosperity came to him it had to be self-propelled . He was never completely knocked down because a man lying on the ground has not too far to fall . He was too busy to feel the heartaches of the bad depression that devastated so many others , because he was confident that every hurricane eventually passes on . The same spirit existed in Lawrence Hyde , in Peters own family , and in the small company of faithful career workmen . I have told you how , when there was no money coming in , everyone took " promise to pay " paper for salary and kept on working so hard that they had no time to meditate upon their worldly woes . Peters kept careful account of what he owed his employees and his family . These debit sums mounted up , so that when the corporation was formed , these back salaries and wages were turned into preferred stock . When Peters ' company was purchased , this stock was turned into Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton stock worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told about the early days of the Emery-Tatnall Company and its relationship with Southwark . It was successful from the start . The formal Southwark-Emery-Tatnall agreement drawn by Mr. Hathaway was so approved by all and the human relations so good that I can not remember once in thirty years of our business together that the agreement ever had to be brought out of the files to settle a disagreement or a misunderstanding or a breach . On our side we were not argumentative or suspicious or greedy , and Southwark , later Baldwin-Southwark , still later Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton , behaved in the same . considerate and generous way . If co-existence were always like this life would be sweet indeed . Further , as I have said before , the agreement provided a kind of " profitable " perpetual motion , for this reason : Emery-Tatnall Company would offer Baldwin a product whose prototype had been built , tested and " debugged , " on the basis that , if used , Emery-Tatnall Company would receive 3-1/2 per cent royalty on sales . The instrumentation and parts that Southwark could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accuracy guaranteed ; the finished machine would be calibrated by Emery , who took full responsibility , and often Emery-Tatnall Company would share the warranty . As a member of Baldwin 's sales department and so-called Manager of Testing Research , I would take the lead in selling the product and making sure the customer was satisfied . We never ran away from trouble . In this latter case I was also acting as an officer of the Emery-Tatnall Company . Serving in two capacities never embarrassed me with Baldwin or with the customer , or with myself . The royalties were accumulated in an Emery-Tatnall Company development fund that financed new and better developments . These , when proved out , were offered as products to the Baldwin Testing Equipment Department , upon sales of which the royalty was again paid to Emery-Tatnall Company , which in turn paid for the development of still more products , and so on ad infinitum . Emery-Tatnall Company also paid their officers small salaries in proportion to income , and since practically everybody in  | Emery-Tatnall Company was an officer of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no lasting dissatisfaction with anything , and no let-up in new development work or in the eagerness with which all approached their tasks . I recommend this system to others ; everybody gains and nobody loses until one or the other gets tired of perfection , or dies . A. H. Emery and A. C. Tate , throughgoing engineers and very conservative gentlemen , maintained a partnership apart from Emery-Tatnall Company but so close as to tie almost indistinguishable from it by the general public , though , of course , the Internal Revenue Service could distinguish the dual nature . The partnership 's offices and plant were in a storefront building embellished with all kinds of annexes , in Stamford , Connecticut . Emery and Tate were quiet people but the place was full of activity . There were no conferences , just work . They lived in the business and the business lived in them . They belonged to the Woodway Country Club , but it was a noteworthy event when any of them took time out for lunch in the club dining room . The staff customarily lunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time , so they switched to the kitchen of a friendly delicatessen shop where they made their own sandwiches by picking the ingredients off the shelf . Visitors also ate with them here unless they were so tremendously important as to call for a meal at the country club . This " living in the business " is the wonderful phenomenon of the typical miniature American enterprise operated by intelligent men who use their own money to build it . In such a place , all who work there are spurred to concentrated thought and effort because each expects to see the full fruit of his work rise before his eyes and so he loves it , though , I hope , not to the exclusion of his family and his church . I aim to include only sufficient remarks , in passing , to establish the character , structure , and policies in each business that I worked with so that I can develop a " Catalogue of Careers " that could permit a young reader to choose the kind of life and work he would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I find that in most things " easy does it . " Our testing machine had a distinguishing virtue , a " separate hydraulic weighing system . " I think it might be useful for me to tell how this idea was introduced to the market . I concentrated my approach upon about thirty organizations staffed with authoritative testing engineers , those who wrote papers for technical societies reporting on test methods , discoveries and technical advances . Usually , somewhere in the papers or reports they would mention the apparatus used , omitting trade names but describing the equipment . If the equipment pleased them they would gladly endorse it to those who asked , and I would often be the one who stimulated the asking . Sometimes the customer enthusiasm was spontaneous .  | The next step was to create the desire in some government department to um . our more versatile type of machine and then to aid in the preparation of hid specifications that outlined the essential performance without saying how it was to he achieved , or without naming names . Competitors would 1w hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take many exceptions in their bids , which revealed a lack of sense of humor . They indicated they would give up on the bid this time because they were down temporarily but not out . This point they would prove by undertaking n crash development program . This had the beneficial effect of increasing the vigor of the whole industry and yet allowed the company first in the field with an innovation to enjoy a period of a few years alone . Thus it gained a legitimate monoply , always aware that competition was coming on . This meant that it also must step ahead with new developments or fall hack into the competitive scramble . This " self-accelerated motivation " was invigorating and confidence building , so much so that when we thought competition was not catching on fast enough we would show competitors anything they wanted to see , relying on our " perpetual motion development " system to keep ahead . When the combination of Southwark and Emery-Tatnall Company started out in the period of 1926 to 1929 , it was grandly ignored , or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of confining our sales promotion to a selected few among testing machine users perpetuated our obscurity . This changed when Navy , Bureau of Standards and State Highway Department specifications began to follow each other into bidders ' hands . There was , as one might say , a " surprised awakening . " The first government order from the Bureau of Standards was exploratory , to try out something that looked pretty interesting . Their specification , which became widely used , stated a preference for ( a ) self-indication of load ; ( b ) hydraulic loading system controllable as to constant head motion and constant load rate ; ( c ) a " low inertia , separate hydraulic weighing system ; " and ( d ) calibration to lull capacity in all ranges by " National Bureau of Standards certified " proving rings . This was enough to upset other existing equipment including the Swiss Amster for the following reasons : Mechanical machines then were not selfindicating . When domestic manufacturers later cleverly rigged a pendulum at the end of the last lever in place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low inertia . The Swiss Amster was hydraulic and self-indicating , but it indicated load from a lapped ram without separate hydraulic weighing system . Finally , most manufacturers had not thought of equipping themselves to calibrate to full capacity with proving rings . One did not have to be a particularly good salesman to point these things out . This pointing was done , however , with great humility but with  | a detectable undercurrent of excited enthusiasm . We knew our worth because we had tested tirelessly in our plant . One competitor switched his designs as quickly as he could to meet the specifications that continued coming out , and he did it so well that we had to have a little law suit about it , a rather decent kind of an affair . I enjoyed the experience of watching Mr. Hathaway and his trial lawyer Mr. Edwards set forth a case that was conceived deftly enough to win . So we licensed our opponent , and all was peace again . The business grew , but Emery and Tate , like Peters , remained the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about them I never ceased to admire was their earnestness in pursuing design improvement and cost reduction without being pushed by the sales department to do so . The sales department is , in truth , the eyes and the ears of a business , although seldom appreciated as such . They know what the customers want , what the competitors have , what the market prices are and what they should be , what needs to be done to get more business and to keep customers friendly . All these things are known through outside contacts and reported back , but the folks at the plant , well-insulated from front-line combat , often view these reports as disturbances to routine or as alibis for lost business . The better the sales department the more disturbing they are . The more rigid the system in the home plant , the more safeguards that are set up to keep disturbing information from filtering in . Malcolm Tate , A. C. Tate 's son , came from the Detroit Edison Company to join the engineering staff when the pressure of business grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Stamford . He started at once to perfect a major development that created wide interest , an upsurge in business , and a minor revolution . This was the Tate-Emery Null Method multi-range Pressure Indicator , used as a load indicator on SouthwarkEmery Testing Machines . It utilized a principle that came from France a long time ago and was used in Sheffield pneumatic gages , in inspection devices . It is c ' , fled the Jet-Orifice system . A controlled amount of compressed air is admitted through an orifice and escapes through a jet . The amount of air escape is metered by a floating baffle over the jet that , by the amount of opening between jet and baffle , can maintain any pneumatic pressure constant in the system . Whatever value you want to measure works mechanically on the baffle to position it and at the same time reads the baffle position in the terms of the quantity to be measured . Here is how Mac Tate used it : He picked up the oil pressure in the hydraulic capsule line by a Heise bourdon tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried by the tip of the tube . ( If you are interested , go look at  | the hack of the load indicator dial on a Southwark-Tate-Emery testing machine . There is always one not far away . ) As the tube lifted the baffle , more air escaped from the jet and the system pressure dropped . This instantly actuated a servomotor that pulled down the tube tip and restored pressure equilibrium in the pneumatic system . The servomotor was the simplest , most foolproof , fast response device you ever saw . It was a large sylphon bellows inflated by the air pressure in the system . This force was balanced by two uncalibrated springs , which were actually the motor . When pressure dropped in the system the unbalance of forces caused the springs to pull down on the bourdon tube tip , through a ( ; hatillon Iso-Elastic Spring set . Iso-Elastic Springs were another deForest metallurgical miracle that made possible a spring system of such outstanding characteristics as to be used as the heart of the well-known Chatillon precision scales . I recommend them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges . In Mac Tate s design , the spring-set gave the pull rod the proper amplified movement so that its travel turned the dial indicator hand and maximum hand , moved the pen rod for the stress-strain recorder and any load maintainer , load rate control or other kinematic motions that were mechanically attached to it . You know that in a null balance system , which measures the force necessary to restore zero balance instead of measuring deviation from zero , a servomotor , which provides the restoring force , is always outside of the measuring system . Thus it can overcome all frictions and other unwanted mechanical forces , providing the most accurate of force balance unimpeded by ambient conditions . The best illustration is the equalarm chemical balance , you put an unknown weight on one pan and a known weight on the other to balance to zero or null . The null system can insure accuracy , and the servomotor power can insure sensitivity , since it can provide enough restoring force to move large hands over large dials , in this case a 66-inch scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by providing four or more parallel scale ranges without any more trouble than adding a jet and Iso-Elastic spring-set for each range , hooked in parallel to the pull rod of the servomotor , and providing a rotating mask on the dial face to reveal the proper numbers for each range . Our competitors used to cry out that the indicating system was complicated . " Just look at the back of the dial , " they would declaim as though to sound the alarm , but when people would look , and we deliberately put on transparent covers so they could see , all that was visible was a neat array of little pipes innocently carrying oil from the capsule or air from the orifice . There was a no more trouble-free , long-lived , self-cleaning work-horse that could be found . Temperature , vibration , shock . moisture ; none of these disturbed the system or could cause an error to enter in . Ot course , accuracy  | and sensitivity are quite different , as Professor II . F. Moore used to say . There can be accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indicator was blessed with both . Many uses besides testing machines could be found for such an instrument , and so it proved . One was in the wind tunnel . The NACA Structures Research Laboratory at Langley Field , Virginia , ordered from us a six-component balance system , which we successfully built . When those who were designing the California Cooperative Wind Tunnel for Caltech heard about this , they came to see it and ordered one for their own wind tunnel . The Armv Ballistic Research Laboratory at Aberdeen , Maryland , heard of this Caltech installation and ordered a similar balance system for their wind tunnel for studying the aerodynamics of artillery shells and bombs . They then ordered a three-component system in addition , which was much simpler and cheaper . These were followed by wind tunnel balance systems for CurtissWright at Buffalo , Convair at San Diego , and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at Dayton . These hydraulic balance systems were the forerunners of the strain gage internal balances , some as small as fountain pens , now universally used , especially for supersonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed directly into computers and other data reduction systems of marvelous complexity , but also of marvelous speed of performance . Data on a tunnel run are available at once instead of waiting two weeks for the computations . These wind tunnel balance contracts required the development of the self-contained hydraulic capsule load cell and the " leaking load cell . " Six-component testing machines and wind tunnel balances measure three forces and three moments , or in wind tunnel terms : lift , drag and side force , and moments of yaw , pitch and roll . These are the only six ways that a free body in space can be acted upon . Proceedings Volume XIII No. 1 ( 1955. ) of the Society for Experimental Stress Analysis contains a paper entitled " The NACA Combined Load Testing Machine , " by R. W. Peters of Langley Aeronautical Laboratory , which gives the most complete description of this monumental equipment that I have ever read . I think this is required reading for those in the fields of Engineering Mechanics or of Mechanics of Materials . An adequate description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the machine can be inferred from the following capacities in the six components : Tension , 120,000 pounds ; compression , 250,000 pounds ; horizontal shear , 25,000 pounds ; vertical shear , 50,000 pounds ; torsion , 2,500,000 inch-pounds ; bending moment about horizontal axis , 3,000,000 inch-pounds ; bending moment about vertical axis , 600,000 inch-pounds . This machine has explored totally new areas in structural strength as reported in the paper such as combined torsion and com-  | pression in large tubes , compression , torsion and side slip in bomber landing gear tires , and so forth . The self-contained Emery hydraulic capsule load cell was called the " brain center of the weighing system " in the NACA paper . It differs from the conventional testing machine capsule chiefly in that all side-load stabilizing stayplates and pre-load springs are built into the unit so that it is essentially portable and can be placed in rocket and jet thrust stands , platform scales , crane scales , power dynamometers , in industrial tank weighing , truck weighing on highways , and so on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , the Tate-Emery pressure indicator used with the hydraulic load cell was designed for reading static or slowly changing pressures , whereas the strain gage load cell was capable of reading rapidly changing random loads and its electric output would be compatible with most recorders and other data-reduction units . Recently , by placing a strain gage type pressure transducer in the hydraulic capsule , the hydraulic load cell can pick up dynamic random loads because it is fundamentally a unit of high natural frequency that can record , without lag , 200 cycles per second or more . A hydraulic load cell can support full load , without re-zeroing , for months . It can be checked for calibration or for zero while under load . Its temperature stability , its lateral stability against off-center loads , and its zero stability are all exceptionally high . It can be built in capacities of 10,000,000 pounds . Its indestructibility , ruggedness and long life are unequaled . The " leaking capsule " is the reverse of the conventional closed system capsule , with some special features , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument panel . It was never commercialized because the wind tunnel business with hydraulic balance system after World War II went into a decline , so it will only be mentioned in passing . The same applies to another of Mac Tate 's product designs , the low capacity screw drive testing machine with wide range stepless electronic speed control and Emery capsule weighing system , that was built for testing rubber , plastics and light materials . This design pointed the way for many other such machines that followed . These others with strain-gage weighing systems pretty much took over as time went on because of their additional refinements to meet the increasingly demanding requirements in the testing of nonmetallic materials . Like all successful companies , Emery had to expand . It surprises me that this urge hits everybody and every organization , because problems and responsibilities and headaches increase faster than size . Those concerned so deeply with quality and conservatism as were Emery and Tate would be the last to be expected to have the growing urge , because of their philosophy  | that if one must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than quantity . The best of people seem attracted by world acclaim that is tendered to successful size growth , so they venture into it at the expense of peace of mind . Emery expansion in 1951 was into a picturesque Yankee colonial brick plant in that elegant New York suburb of New Canaan , Connecticut , whose main street looks like a movie set representing an old New England village . The town is important enough to have the New Haven Railroad run commuter trains right to its door . I like the town , it makes me feel rested and stylish . The Emery plant is one of only two industries in town ; this illustrates how genteel is the Emery business . Mr. Emery died before the move to New Canaan , and his son Hamilton Emery came up from Virginia to fill his place . Ham was a good business man , and the expansion of the business was to his liking . When Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton was buying up its satellites , O. S. Peters , Sonntag Scientific , Ruge-deForest , to form the Electronics &; Instrumentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is today . There is something about these rugged old New Englanders that makes them want to work out their own salvations . They usually do so , although at this writing this trek to salvation is still in process with Ham Emery as the leader , and quality still rules .  | Am I engaged in a field of endeavor that favors the growth of singular and precious personalities ? This chapter deals with another of the uncommon people who have been so common to this history . This person is very Individual and quite different from any and all . Bill Bean had a bringing up in the old Southwest , which prompted me , In years past , when introducing him at lectures and " work shops , " to refer to him as " ex-cowpuncher , ex-wildcatter , ex-college professor and extrovert . " This cuts across many fields and about sums up his manner and appearance . A college professor and a wildcatter from the oil fields , or as he says " awl fields , " is covering a span connecting opposite ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Engineering , but he has the qualities of a circuit riding judge or an intinerant preacher of old-time religion . He looks like , talks like , and acts like a southwestern ranch boss , open handed , generous , tough , outspoken and kind , and to add to the variety of attributes , the most " intuitive " man I know , and this does not exclude deForest . A. V. , I think , realized he was blessed with rare intuition , but Bill Bean got mad as hops when I told him that he worked by intuition , that his novel ideas and his striking manner of expressing his thoughts , came to him from outside of this world without his even trying . Einstein admitted to intuition for his larger penetrations and insights , but Bill Bean complained that the way I said he was intuitive made it sound like he never did any work . Bill insisted that he worked hard for what he got , so I was forced to define intuition in another way : " knowledge obtained without recourse to inference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " so says Webster . Bill Bean still took offense , so I long wondered what was derogatory about my appraisal . I am glad to report , however , that Bill Bean has changed his mind since reading somewhere a practical account of the value of intuition . This made him understand what I had been saying ( my use of the English language was at fault ) , so he stopped being offended and even apologized . I met him in a way that indicates that fate meant it to be . Fate has 81  | had a hand in our relationship ever since . Baldwin-Southwark had an exhibit at the ASTM annual meeting in the Buffalo Statler in June , 19I ( i Our booth was located just opposite the door to one of the big meeting rooms . At the close of a session in this room , the door opened and the usually self-restrained , dignified , thoughtful members came pouring out laughing and in high spirits . My curiosity aroused , I accosted some of them for an explanation of this unseemly behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just heard the most unusual talk about failure of automotive and aeronautical components in service by a picturesque westerner leaning against the proscenium arch support , talking like Will Rogers with appropriate drawl and gestures . It was a mixture of the most practical facts with the driest of humor , and with new and valuable ideas on design to increase service life , all thrown in . I made up my mind to meet that man right then because he was preaching what I had been trying to say , but he was doing it much better , fortified by practical examples . We were surely thinking alike , if the reports were correct , so I grabbed a meeting program and saw listed a paper entitled : " Endurance ? Criterion of Design " by William T. Bean , Jr. , Research Engineer , Continental Aviation &; Engineering Corp. , Detroit ( S.T.P. 72 , 1946 ) . To meet the man who could stir up ASTM members en masse , who could dispense pungent engineering facts and make them stick without being deadly serious was my sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the hotel to the coffee shop . He yielded readily when cornered , so I got down to business . " You certainly impressed ASTM by your talk on my favorite subject . I want to hear you be technical and funny at the same time . We need some of this in our business , because some people wo n't take me seriously . " This approach had the effect of silencing Bean . He complained that when I ordered him to be funny , he could not think of a thing to say . But when he did think of something , the way he used his words heightened by his drawl tickled me . He impressed me as my natural partner in this pursuit of the waking giant of Engineering Mechanics , and I cast about for a way to forge an informal bond of cooperation . My next view of Bill Bean was in his laboratory at Continental Aviation on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit . This completely sold me on what I had been selling engineers and lent powerful impetus to my preaching and teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical example of its potential . He had redesigned completely a stock engine by experimental techniques and had a step-by-step exhibit , on a long table , of the " before " and " after " of all the stressed parts . Startling changes had been made that invariably improved not only their strength and weight but also their appearance . Parts were clean and  | smooth and efficient looking . The viewing increased my excitement and determination to work harder than ever to promote this technique so as to automatically develop a broader market for bonded wire strain gages , Stresscoat , scratch gages and Huggenberger Tensometers . My efforts thus far had struck home almost exclusively in only the aeronautical industry on the west coast , and the Navy on the east coast . Now I saw how we could reach all industry with a specific campaign of design improvement , especially in the neighboring automotive and farm machinery plants . There were three things that made Bean 's method so powerful . First , he attacked machine design 's traditional weaknesses , proved them wrong and showed how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ribs , inadequate fillets and irresponsible changes in section , oil holes in areas of high stress and built-in notches , so many of these things were accepted with a shrug of the shoulder as inevitable , that they had to be pointed out , as errors for correction . Second , when he had redesigned a part and proved its value in a fatigue test or with strain measuring equipment ( in the case of Stresscoat , one cycle was sufficient ) he found that when he reduced weight by his engineering analysis he had greatly increased life . He was sensible enough not to throw the original part away , but would display it as an example of evolution . If further changes were made he would line up all trial parts . This side-by-side exhibit told a heartening story , with a cleaned-up structure as the exciting climax . The reborn engine , weighing only 777 pounds after being trimmed down from about 2000 pounds ( a phenomenon that made two pages in Life magazine ) outlived and outperformed its heavy progenitor by a substantial factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bushel basket technique " took a back seat . " Bushel basket technique " was Bill 's description of a fatigue and life test by engine operation in a test cell where an incipient failure initiates and spreads so rapidly that no one can find where the trouble started , so the parts are gathered up in a bushel basket to throw on the scrap heap without yielding any clues for the designer . The operating engine itself should theoretically be the ideal fatigue testing machine for engines except for one thing ; it does not reveal the all-important starting point of breakdown . This was what was meant by the oft-repeated slogan , " Making structures stronger by making them lighter . " Third , Bean would casually describe the results of his experimental analysis in such piquant terms that it would stir the imagination of the hearer and fix ideas in his memory , stimulating a lingering desire to try these things himself on his own problems . This is the mark of a good teacher . Bill Bean has been widely quoted . Many have borrowed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Picturesque similes have entered the language such as " shape determines the stress distribution , " and " stress flows through a structure like fluids through channels , " and " stress concentrations are areas of turbulence in these fluids . " In Baldwin 's publication " Testing Topics , " we reserved a spot in most issues for a cartoon of a cracker-barrel philosopher and a few lines of rough script under a heading " Bill Bean Says . " Here are a few samples of Bill 's rustic sayings : " A bad design is like a rotten egg ? its quality is apparent after it is broken . " " Management is tops when it runs interference instead of causing it . " " When strength is based on weight alone , weigh the part and question the strength . " Other pert sayings were of the type " A good design is based on fundamental concept of strength ? not on history , " and " The hound dog wants to know where the rabbit is , not where it ai n't . " Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His ASTM paper previously referred to was the only one I can recall , except for a recent editorial appearing in " Experimental Mechanics , " the journal of SESA . He wrote little for Testing Topics after his one article that was really a pictorial sequence of a case history entitled " Good Casting Design on Purpose , " which showed the steps necessary to put a comt .. essor crankshaft casting in a good competitive position with a forging . Bill Bean wanted to help all who wanted to try their hands at experimental stress analysis . He lectured and demonstrated . He made up in his home little kits containing all the items necessary to install strain gages ? wire , adhesives , surface cleaners , waterproofing coatings , even cotton swabs , dental picks and tweezers . Packed in a small box was everything that a strain gage user could possibly need in addition to the actual strain gages themselves . Bill 's generous passion to help everybody help themselves , made him feel that he had to become an independent dispenser of aid to engineers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken on the character of an avalanche ; everybody was rushing into it , afraid they would be left behind in this dawning age of technology , but the lack of printed helpful information was appalling . Our mail was mountain high with questions and requests for information . The situation had certainly changed . Instead of my going around trying to arouse interest in strain gages , the situation reached a point of no return when the strain gage was so popular that all engineers thought they would have to learn about it quickly or fall behind . In these early days , the only published information sources I knew of were the SR-4 News Letters that I had written for our own people at Baldwin but was prevailed upon to issue in broadcast  | fashion , followed by Testing Topics , and after 1943 , proceedings of the Society for Experimental Stress Analysis . Perry and Lissner 's " Strain Gage Primer " came in 1955 , and there was a strain gage book from England that showed up about this time too . Bill Bean was sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1947 when he stated that he was going to cease to be an " employee " and become an independent adviser on strain gage techniques . This did not surprise me much until I heard how he was going to do it . He was going to work for nothing as consultant and adviser , and from this time on , when invited to speak on this subject of experiment analysis , anywhere , he would go at his own expense . I knew this surprising person had had a rich history up to this time , but that is where his riches stopped because he only had what money he saved from his modest salary at Continental . " What about your wife and three children ? " I asked in dismay . The Good Lord will provide , " said Bill calmly . I had heard this said before in other times , but had never seen it actually put to the test in the way Bill was going to do . Rather than continue recording the conversation that lasted for hours , wherein all kinds of useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan for his future remained unchanged and it was evident that I was hearing these plans even before his wife and family . If anyone were to undertake this kind of thing , Bill looked to me like the one who could get away with it , he gave forth every evidence of being totally self-reliant and fearless , and he was certainly qualified to be an adviser and consultant . Doing this for nothing was where he broke away from conformity and was offering a new challenge to science and industry . According to my snap judgement , the challenge would be " I dare you to let me go broke and die on your doorstep . " Or was it a true reliance on the applicability to modern life of the Biblical statement in the Gospel of Matthew , " consider the lilies of the field . . . they toil not , neither do they spin ; . . . even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these , " or was Bill over-daring , maybe even foolhardy ? Time told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew more about the basic rules of the universe than most of its wise men . Bill prospered in his policy of giving things away in a manner that I had never seen before . I could write most of this book about this , but I keep feeling that I must hurry , so I can only outline the subsequent years . Bill went back to Detroit and did give away his services , which were much in demand . Ford , General Motors , Chrysler and the others were diving into experimental stress analysis and were testing components and structures with all their might and main . Bill not only served without formal charges , but traveled at his own expense for lectures and work-  | shops . Most astonishing of all he gave away strain gages , materials , and equipment . His clients would ask , after a job well done , " How much will you bill us ? " Graciously , Bill would answer , " Nothing . No charge . " The trend of further conversation was as follows , " Bill , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your expenses ? " Bill would admit he did not know . " Will you go broke ? " " Possibly , " Bill would answer , " I trust in the Good Lord 's promise that bread cast upon the water will return manyfold . " Apparently the customers did not usually have as much faith in this happy ending as had Bill . It was generally agreed in automotive and farm machinery circles around Detroit that if Bill " went down the drain " it would be a tragedy for technology , so they began to ask him , " Will you accept donations or gifts , like colleges or nonprofit institutions ? " Bill would assent to a donation if it came as a kindly act from the heart and did not represent anything like the repayment of an obligation , because his motive in service to the client was a gift of aid freely given , not intended to put the client in debt to him . The idea of giving without thought of repayment was well pointed out in the Bible . Bill was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can imagine the effect this had on world-weary people , like me , for instance . Here was Bean doing much the same as O. S. Peters and with the same result ; he could not give himself away fast enough to go broke . Donations and gifts came in greater volume than consulting fees would have brought in . Noting Bean 's generosity , I requested Bill 's consulting assistance for our ' train gage business at Baldwin . He made this available to us whether we paid for it or not . Because I had no appropriation to cover his services , he was usually not paid . But I would struggle from time to time to get him expense money or a donation , though it never seemed to make any difference one way or the other to Bill . What freedom from anxiety Bill was privileged to enjoy ! The Locomotive Department did later formally retain him on Diesel engine piston and connecting rod design on a hard money basis , but when I asked him to work with me on an SR-4 Educational Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying his own expenses to the conference locations , at first . Later , Baldwin paid his expenses , but no fee , and still later , noting his tremendous contribution to the meetings , they paid both fees and expenses . There will be more about these SR-4 conferences in the Baldwin Story . Bill 's business card was as artless as he was . Printed , not engraved , it said simply : " BILL BEAN ( Himself ) Here to Help ? Hard to Get " and  | in small print in the corner , " Detroit , Tulsa , Mexico City . " When asked to explain these offices , he said , " 1 live and work in Detroit , I go to Tulsa to help my friends in the awl ( oil ) business , and when people ca n't reach toe in Detroit or Tulsa , my wife says I 'm in Mexico City . " Bill continually used the expression " By and large , " I got tired of hearing this and asked him what he meant by it in all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . In the next ten years Bill 's absolute devotion to his chosen field and his tireless energy brought spreading renown , mainly for three reasons : first , his " learn by doing " method of teaching , with his peculiarly sharp barbs and humor and his ingenious analogies and examples ; second , his own tests and studies made him a central authority on materials and methods ; and finally , the picturesque figure of Bill Bean himself represents the early American advocate of design improvement . He was the great teacher on horseback roving the nation like a cowboy evangelist , an itinerant preacher and a miracle worker . They used to say about Bill in his demonstration of laying down high temperature strain gages ( which was a good trick ) , " Bill Bean makes it look easy , you know , because he has six hands , " When new advances in strain gages and equipment would appear at Baldwin it would be Bill Bean who would suggest and demonstrate the very practical techniques that would make them work best . The demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on summer " short courses . " The most prominent were those at MIT , prepared and run by Dr. W. M. Murray , who earned a rank with Bill Bean and Peter Stein as foremost educators in this business where education was the cornerstone . The MIT course at Cambridge was so beneficial and became so popular that Bill Murray was asked to put on the same course at UCLA in Los Angeles , although many from industry were not averse to crossing the country to attend such lectures and laboratories . Although both courses were planned so as to assuage the thirst for knowledge in a learned and dignified manner , Bill Bean , as one of the headliners of the teaching staff , put on his characteristically spectacular and genial shows in a manner that thrust the lessons home for keeps . One example of a Bill Bean educational show was the Bow and Arrow demonstration . Bill would enter the arena with fully instrumented archery equipment and some apples which he would pass out to those on the front row , with the command that they place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow , they would duck behind the seats . The bow would carry bonded gages to measure bending moment ; the how string would be fitted with a strain gage tension dynamometer and a strain gage accelerometer . The three circuits would be connected into three channels of a six-channel pen-and-ink oscillograph . The arrow  | shaft would have two bonded gages connected to measure axial loads , mounted just back of the arrowhead , two to measure bending at midpoint of the shaft , and two at 45 degrees to measure torsion near the tail of the shaft , all connected by light trailing wires to the remaining three channels of the oscillograph . When the arrow was shot at the target , the gages measured the weaving and twisting as the arrow flew , the axial impact on striking the target , and all gages registered the arrow 's hitting the ground , after it fell from the target . In the years 1951 and 1952 Bill Bean , Greer Ellis , Bruce Sutton and I took the Baldwin SR-4 Strain Gage Conference on a tour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government departments of Ottawa were our hosts . Many thousands of engineers , executives and technicians were brought up to date on techniques and information at these thirty large meetings . When more applications for attendance were received than could be accommodated at one meeting , a second one was held on the following day . A typical conference day beginning at 9:15 am and ending at 5 pm was scheduled something like this : 1 . Welcome by the University ; 2. 20-minute sound film on " The SR-4 Strain Gage at Work " ; 3 . Demonstration-lecture on strain gages by Bill Bean for an hour and a half ; 4 . Demonstration-lecture on Stresscoat by Greer Ellis ; 5 . " The Past , Present and Future of the SR-4 " by myself , demonstrating by schematic drawings and models , ingenious applications of the bonded wire strain gage in industry , education , and research ; 6 . " Strain Gage Transducers as Used Industrially " by Bruce Sutton ; 7 . As a climax , instrumentation , case histories , interpretation of data , and practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the most effective way by which we could serve the wide field of interest . In 1956 , Bill Bean joined with me in some strong moves to advance strain gage development and application . These will be told in " The Budd Story " that will follow . By 1961 , Bill , who had not lost his western ways or accent , identified himself as " Unemployed , unincorporated , and uninhibited . " His passion to live up to the spirit of his slogan " Here to Help " impelled him to form the " Friends of Engineering Progress , " a group of 12 men , long identified with the art of experimental stress analysis , whose aims , in part are quoted here : " To help in the area of engineering progress in the same way that the old-fashioned family physician unselfishly answered calls in his horse and buggy from all who needed him anywhere , without first asking if the patient could pay . His mission was to heal , not make money . Those whom he served rewarded him in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A study of human relations in history and religion of all ages teaches that good works , persistently adhered to , can not fail to survive and leave their marks . Instances in other times , as well as in recent days , sustain the belief that this group can reverse the formula for - business survival in more ways than one and still succeed in a ' Service before Profit ' motive . " The ' Friends of Engineering Progress ' will cooperate without formal organization , without over-administration. and without red tape . Each individual remains principally in his own private vocation . . but will always be on call . . the idea of here to help ' is thus put practically to work without being lost in paperwork . The question of fees , money and credit is taken care of by the human relations that ideally exist between friends and gentlemen ... This is the keen desire , that friendship , service and trust shall live in a world side by side with giants of industry and their big organizations , massed capital and extensive personnel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being run over , starved or opposed . " The bird 's eye view of equipment and methods gained from long experience enables the counselors to advise on choice of materials and instrumentation without bias . Regardless of company affiliation , when they serve as counselors , they divorce themselves from any personal or special interest . " But opposition always arises even in cases of the purest impulses . The " Friends " were misunderstood by some and called a " gimmick " by others . Did you ever try to give something valuable away ? It is natural that you should be viewed with suspicion ; it even happened to the Prophets . Some thought F.E.P. was an exclusive club monopolizing information , others thought it a self-appointed authority to police the strain gage business for quality . Still others insisted that many plain people were also friends of engineering progress . The head of a consulting firm wrote in to say that any professionally oriented organization also believes in service before profit , and a few small business men advised us that , in their business at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seehorn of Boeing called it the Bean Benevolent Society . All such comment was received with serene understanding and mild amusement , and we took pains to show how we were patiently trying to fit into the world of experimental stress analysis without pain or stress concentration . We said , in fun , that we had helped bring this technical disturbance into the world and felt it our duty to help people live with it . Six of our group were full-time professors and five were consultants or industrialists who were trying to help a valuable art and technique to grow . There should have been a place for this personal donation . Bill Bean in his concurrent merchandising business put into practice the  | Christian principles as he recognized them in the four Gospels . To do this required some tremendous readjustments in conventional business methods . He had sales representatives in eight locations , and he maintained with them on consignment , strain gages , supplies , and instruments for instant delivery . Each office or home had a Teletype for " Instant letters , " as Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some full time , but all were well qualified to serve . Each was an unsupervised little business island on its own . Each ran its own business in its own way and was completely trusted to handle its affairs for the good of all with a most startling absence of red tape , or of reporting or explaining . These were " Free People " as Bill Bean called them . Virtue was rewarded , errors were self-punishing and quickly forgiven , and any excess gains were put to use for the benefit of all , or to support general R and D work . This was another form of the perpetual motion system for advancing both science and art . Bill 's only worry was the size of his income tax . It surprises me that such happy ways of doing business are not found more frequently in the world of men . Bill Bean once gave me this to read from the Gospel of John : " The good shepherd will give his life for the sake of the sheep . But the hired man , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will see the wolf coming , desert the sheep and run away . . . The hired man runs away because he is only a hired man and has no interest in the sheep . " There is a point that Bill is making here ; he seems to be referring indirectly to his " Free People " who are not hired men . I used to call the strange fervor that infected people who are exposed to strain gages , the SR-4 Disease . It affected people in two ways , first , people began to hoard information and feed it out sanctimoniously in small doses , enough to stir men 's minds but not enough to satisfy their curiosity completely . The second was to disgorge information in such large quantities as to drown the individual and to keep feeding it out until the listener was almost dead from saturation . I once saw Bill Bean lecture Denis Drew and Headley-Bullock of Rolls Royce up to the time they had to hurry away to catch a train for New York . Their departure did not stop Bill Bean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking right at them . I saw them off and returned to find Bill carrying on to an audience that consisted solely of my ten-year-old daughter , who had no idea what he was saying but was fascinated by the way he said it . If you were mixed up , Bill Bean would straighten you out . To do this he invented illuminating analogies , visual aids , dramatic educational shows , figures of speech ( impressively symbolic and metaphorical ) , and practical examples , all of which people long remembered , quoted and copied  | without embarrassment . He was a phrase-maker and theatrical performer who tended to make any strain gage seminar or short course seem undernourished without him . His spirited way of teaching diffused throughout the field of experimental mechanics , and although some people cussed him , they came back time and again to learn what was new . When he entered a lecture room he would dump his box-load of bottles , soldering irons and surgeon 's operating gear on the lecture table in a way that made people jump . The hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual gage installations and proof tests himself , using all tricks of the trade while carrying on a running commentary that fixed solidly the attention of every spectator , interrupted with healthy peals of laughter at some spontaneous or artless remark . He was really a sleight-of-hand artist because he made the techniques look so deceptively easy . When he came to the end of his scheduled time , it turned out not to be the end at all , because in answering questions , he initiated new lectures to those who stood around a blackboard all through lunch hour and until forced to yield to the next after-lunch speaker . There were times when Bill was so positive that no argument was possible . Sometimes he was so emphatic as to be frightening , but in any discourse , it would not be long before some humorous remark that seemed to originate somewhere in Oklahoma broke through . Like all people who stand out in a crowd , he had his detractors . His bluntness and sharp barbs were bound to injure delicate feelings . His lack of diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contempt for people that beat around the bush in so-called diplomatic manner as though afraid to meet situations head-on . The art of concealing his real feelings was unknown to him , for anyone who wears the cowboy costume as he does at all times could never be accused of concealing feelings . And all the time he dispensed old time religion , which the world also needed . Bean 's pioneer wife , Joni , is Bill 's much needed guidance system , especially when he is flying close to the ground where situations are hazardous . Bill 's propulsion system is so powerful that strong wifely guidance must persist to maintain the flight path of service . This will for service is strong , a light illuminating dark places . Light is real and darkness is only the absence of light . Bill 's philosophy says , " The jewels of a business are its people , let 's make them strong . " This fact becomes significant in cases where we watch big companies absorb dynamic little businesses . If the principal people of the little businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels that the big company thought they bought are lost and the history of the action may not be inspiring reading . We shall meet Bill again in the Baldwin and the Budd Stories .  | Professor Arthur C. Ruge started as part-time instructor and Research Associate in Engineering Seismology , Department of Civil Engineering at MIT in 1932 . ( I was always , by accident , encountering seismologists , such as McCollum , Peters and Hyde , and now Ruge ) . Ruge , quite naturally , was studying earthquake-proof construction . His study required an electronically controlled shake table and a means of measuring static and dynamic strains in the small scale models used on the shake table , in which stresses were low and the model skin extremely thin . He readily developed and built the shake table , but suitable strain gages eluded him for a long time . Of every kind of strain gage he knew , none were compatible with the small thin walls of the model of an elevated water tank that represented his patented earthquake-proof construction . He was especially pressed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Meier , decided to do a doctor 's dissertation on Ruge 's elevated water tank , and Ruge had agreed to provide instrumentation . The laboratory was littered with unsatisfactory strain gages , too big , too heavy , too hard to attach , and too difficult for use in every category . On a Sunday morning he was struck with an idea ; instead of going to church he went to his laboratory , the one in the MIT basement lighted by a single 2 by 3 foot window and a few bare incandescent lamps . He wanted to see if a fine resistance wire cemented to the skin of the model structure would give any indications on his galvanometer under simulated gravity and earthquake loads . Being Sunday , the only resistance wire he could find was embedded in glass insulation in a commercial resistor . He broke the glass with a hammer , unwound the resistor and attached the wire to the model with some Duco household cement that was handy in his old rolltop desk . Splinters of glass were still stuck to the wire as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such good galvanometer indications when he shook the model that he went on to make rosettes and an accelerometer in the same way . To evaluate his work he later cemented his wire to a carrier paper that had been stiffened by cementing the paper to two Plexiglas end 92  | pieces with brass spacer bar serving as handling frame and lead wire holder . The rosettes carried a plastic ring stiffener . The gages , now portable , were carried upstairs to deForest 's precision bridge , where they showed straight-line calibration and a surprising reproducibility of readings on the bridge . There was childlike enthusiasm in both deForest 's laboratory and Ruge 's . The bonded wire idea was duly submitted to MIT 's patent committee in accordance with custom . They declined it with thanks in view of its lack of commercial possibilities . This was a typical reaction at this stage . It was at this point that I walked into deForest 's office and was introduced to Ruge and his basement hideout , and the decision was made to take the idea to Baldwin . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engineering and manufacture of strain gages and strain gage devices for sale . This was their part of a proposed orderly business arrangement . The rest of the business details , the marketing , publicity , legal affairs and foreign sales was to be Baldwin 's contribution through a very orderly business agreement eventually arranged between Ruge-deForest and BaldwinSouthwark . Before such agreement could be consummated , it was necessary that there be a legal entity with whom Baldwin could agree , so in 1939 Ruge and deForest got together in that informal partnership . Ruge ran the business and deForest , until his death , was the " silent partner , " whose name and connections , and his advice and 50-50 share of expenses were his contribution . Profits , if any , were also shared equally , but Ruge figures that his combined income from the business and his MIT salary during the first two years of the partnership averaged 50 cents an hour for the time he put in . At least they knew what they were doing and saw to it that they owned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory became also his shop , and deForest 's laboratory became the calibration and evaluation room . 1941 saw the first solid sizeable order from Baldwin for stock gages , 50,000 in one order for all types . These were to last a year , but actually lasted two months . Ruge operated the business as sole proprietor after deForest 's death ; incorporation followed in 1949 under the name of Ruge-deForest , Inc. with Ruge as President , General Manager , and Chairman of the Board . When , in 1955 , Ruge-deForest sold out to Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton , they then employed more than 200 people . Close upon the birth of the partnership in 1939 it was necessary to have a respectable place of business . The old abandoned MIT Coop store directly across Massachusetts Avenue from the door that led to the collegiate offices  | of both Ruge and deForest , was found to be available for a reasonable rent since it was very old , in appearance at least . In spite of added business worries , both Ruge and deForest retained their status as members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1947 . When the business moved from the dimly lighted basement to the cheerless store-front across the street whose only access to daylight were the big front windows , Ruge took with him Frank Hines and Ed Jones , who gladly followed their enthusiastic leader . The Prof , they called him , which suggested respect combined with informality . The janitor was the only man called " Mister . " " Prof Ruge " was used so much as a calling name that his first name was lost in antiquity and his middle name , Claude , was never used because it is not the kind of name that people volunteer to reveal . Can you imagine anyone addressing the Prof as Dr. A. Claude Ruge ? Since he had been so long buried in the basement , Prof Ruge was particularly attracted by the daylight from the front windows . He placed his desk near the window , which also placed it near the front door so that an entering visitor had to be alert to avoid bumping into him physically . Private offices were unthinkable here ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disorderly manner in such a way as to trap the visitor when he stepped through the door . It was referred to as " on-the-job " location . It gave the impression that on the first day of occupancy everybody moved in and started to work where they found themselves as though they were staying only for the day , but they stayed for years without stopping to straighten up and re-arrange the furniture for more comfort . Nobody seemed to care as long as they got their work done . This was my impression of the Ruge-deForest beehive , though bees would have worn themselves out there . Not so with the personnel who appeared spontaneously and never looked up from their work . It has been said that the output of a lab is inversely proportional to its orderliness . The act of crossing Massachusetts Avenue from the MIT steps to Ruge 's front door was in itself a physical fitness program . I would rather try to cross the Philadelphia Schuylkill Expressway in rush hour than navigate Massachusetts Avenue at any time . On my periodic visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy Massachusetts Avenue bridge , munching store-bought apple and crackers for breakfast , I invariably introduced transient disturbance in this plant , which became superimposed on the ambient disturbance . I was always loudly crying out for more speed in providing me something to show the impatient public who had been hearing about the " postage stamp strain gage " and wanted to see it in action . I felt that my job was to keep people stirred up and not to promote peace . If industry is not agitated by salesmen , it tends to lapse back into a comfortable coma because engineer-  | ing and production men become insulated from the grasping , cheating world . I wanted my weapons , they were papers , leaflets , verbal assaults , meetings , demonstrations , conferences , and sophisticated new ideas . I cried for ' maximum effort and frenzied activity without ceasing , and I did not want to think of my dear friends in this beehive taking time out to make themselves comfortable , because comfort also lulls to sleep . I was tugging at the leash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in all this , I got increasingly strong support from Prof together with a continuing flow of unique ideas and good engineering advice , for which I thanked Heaven . In the subsequent Baldwin Story I will dwell upon the gigantic proportions that marketing activity attained in the years after 1942 . The methods were somewhat unique during the period of introduction of the RugedeForest commercial versions of the strain gages . They , by this time , had shed their plastic end pieces and brass bars , and the rosettes ( for three-directional measurements to obtain magnitude and direction of principal strains ) became delta or fan arrangements of three standard gages , without plastic rings . The aeronautical industry did not need an introduction to these things , they were going ahead full speed , being thoroughly involved with them in every possible way before we could turn around . The earliest form of strain gage indicator was perhaps the most precise form that appeared at any time , stemming from Professor Ruge 's first galvanometer indicator that had revealed strain sensitivity on that Sunday morning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great accuracy , sensitivity and simplicity , was too slow for the " hurry-up " multimeasurement people who were willing to sacrifice some precision for speed , because , as irreverently stated in those days , they were " slapping on the gages " by the hundreds for structural tests . The words " slapping on " or " gluing down " were used so often that I felt they were slapping the dignity right out of strain gaging . I cried out against it , but my rejection of these expressions seemed only to amuse people . I insisted on the current Ruge wording " cementing " since the adhesives were labeled cements not glues . LePage 's Glue of my youth was not on our list of adhesives , I do n't know why . It takes a long time to establish an appropriate strain gage language , and many times I was forced to feign personal injury when people would use improper words that manifested lack of respect for strain gages and transducers . The early strain indicator became known as the " Ruge Box . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was this instrument . Its balance indicator was a Rubicon galvanometer whose light spot showed , on a graduated glass scale , precise bridge unbalance . A built-in decade panel provided rough balance and a micrometer screw bending a beam carrying two bonded strain gages back-to-back was a most praise-  | worthy method for obtaining fine balance . This instrument , which proposed to utilize the potentially superb accuracy and sensitivity of the paper gage , was of necessity slow in operation . Strain readings from the decade and the micrometer bending beam had to be processed with both a bridge factor and a gage factor computation . Each strain reading was a chore . An electronic strain indicator , which grew out of a breadboard model presented by Foxboro 's unique idea man , Mickey Allen , speeded up strain gage readings greatly with but small loss in precision , which , we found , could be spared . This instrument involved a 1000 cycle oscillator , threestage amplifier , phase discriminator , null balance indicator , point-by-point coarse balance , and the main slidewire , which indicated strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own batteries in the base of the instrument . The first step , following the completion of a prototype of any instrument , strain gage configuration , transducer or special circuit was to refer it to Edward A. Hathaway , Baldwin 's patent attorney who had started very early building an impenetrable legal fence around all this valuable property flowing out of Ruge-deForest , Inc . There were many ideas , devices , applications and circuits of the most original kinds submitted for patent applications to Baldwin . Ruge himself initiated over 50 U.S. patents . I was totally charmed by those that were never commercialized as well as by those that became products . The product list was growing as fast as imagination could work . These patent applications that were never commercialized , being obscure but none the less triumphs of original thinking , so intrigued me that I made up enlargements of the patent drawings and took them on a tour of the country as part of the SR-4 Conferences in what was called " A Parade of Ideas , " as mentioned earlier . During all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own applications of the strain gage , equally original and ingenious , as will appear in " The Baldwin Story . " It seemed to me that something about the bonded strain gage called up a burst of ingenuity in all those that it touched . I even caught Fritz Schranz , now a Baldwin Divisional Vice President , winding a strain gage on the desk in his office for no reason at all except to prove that he was as up-to-date as anyone . These tremendous parallel development efforts by Baldwin , with patent protection , and the airframe builders working on their own , these two engaged in an exciting technological race . This resulted in faster development of more useful instrumentation , ideas and engineering " steam " than was ever known . I was designated by Baldwin to circulate all over , to report what was going on and to keep telling people that Baldwin was really the legitimate father of all this . Instead of acting bothered by having me around like a Prophet Jeremiah denouncing sinfulness and retribution , all treated me as  | an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught me , a willing pupil , aeronautical engineering as they practiced it and gave me all the top talking points for our strain gages . My reports back home were in themselves treatises on aeronautical engineering and applications of strain gages that stirred our own people to more intense efforts . This was all taking place during World War II , so Baldwin 's patent coverage had to stand aside while the war was on . Politically , the war did end in 1945 after hostilities ceased , but the war period legally kept on going until all peace treaties were signed and sealed . The exceptionally big jump forward in design improvement in aeronautical structures by the mass use of bonded strain gages and their associated transducers so absorbed the enthusiasms of everyone to whom I spoke , and produced so much unrestrained optimism in the airframe plants , that all men , high and low , acted as if they were living only for the triumphant day ( the triumph of engineering over nature ) , and they had no time for anyone crying over patents and licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It spoiled the fine elation that accompanied this heady progress . Thus is described the feelings of all but one , a friend of mine of long standing , Dr. V. N. Krivobok , Lockheed 's Director of Research who was also a man of direct action . He threatened to line up with all the airframe builders and their satellites in an imposing joint opposition to me or Baldwin or whoever put patent obstacles in the path of the achievement made possible by strain gages , " the greatest weapon in the arsenal of American air supremacy . " This involuntary award of merit was stated with gentle heart and inscrutable smile that really left me speechless , which is unusual . What was a docile one like me to say when facing such a rebuff from a dear old friend ? I was just a little fellow , ready to retreat before any blow that came at me , but this was no indication of what Baldwin would do about it ? they were n't so timid . When I reported my unhappy position to them , sadly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misery man always running into trouble , maybe because I moved around so fast that I could find all the trouble there was . However , it was still my firm opinion that we must not permit the growth of a hostile attitude in those who might one day become our very best strain gage customers . I kept saying to my company , " A soft answer turneth away wrath . " I found out later that a soft answer had always been contemplated because legal opinion confirmed that we could not talk patents and licenses until a state of peace was authorized by Washington . No great contest arose between airframe builders " in serried ranks assembled " and Baldwin standing alone like little David . When official peace finally settled upon the world , we made amicable agreements with all those who had been making  | their own strain gages , and aside from a little quiet grumbling , individual arrangements suited them all , granting some privileges while requiring some abstention . The situation called for stepped up efforts on our part to fill the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on research and development , seeking answers to chemical and physical questions such as fatigue , creep and high temperature effects in gages , on which subjects and many others , questions bombarded us . There was need to develop variations in gages and transducers as these were being urgently requested . Next , we set up a good-sized windowless , air-conditioned strain gage plant on the Baldwin property at Eddystone , Pa. , with the best possible provision for quality control . There were rows upon rows of well lighted desks where girls with good eyes and nimble fingers armed with ingenious miniature jigs and tools were winding strain gages on a production basis , all this under the direction of Professor Ruge and Frank Hines ; that is , all but an intricate machine we devised at Baldwin , with a motor-driven pair of scissors for making A-11 gages in huge quantities , many of which fed our scrap pile rapidly . Finally we proceeded to educate everybody who wanted to listen to us , which was about everybody , including the knowledgeable aircraft industry itself . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds drifted away and we went on working ourselves to death to attain maturity in strain gage processing and marketing , all of which will be enlarged upon in The Baldwin Story that follows . In the SR-4 News Letter of May , 1944 , we made our first serious attempt to dispense useful engineering information on the bonded wire strain gage , but the fact remains that we were just learning many important details ourselves . Since the founding of Ruge-deForest , Professor Ruge was naturally the main source of knowledge . He and Hines and Jones were committed to establishing the engineering background for the industry , together with facts and figures from the airplane companies . We gladly gathered in and fitted into our Book of Knowledge everything that came our way , being very meticulous about acknowledging sources . Ruge-deForest was assigned the task of making all unusual gages , transducers , and strain gage devices and anything else that was designated " special , " for which there was no lack of demand , while Baldwin concentrated on the stock types of gages of which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expanded to 86 types falling into the following classifications : 1 . Constantan wire gages ; 2 . Iso-Elastic wire gages with high gage factor ( for dynamic use only because of high temperature coefficient of resistance ) ; 3 . Rosette gages ( three in a cluster ) ; 4 . Bakelite gages ; 5 . Specials , such as temperature gages , dual lead and spiral gages , noninductive gages , and very high resistance gages.  | To carry on with education and advancing information to the public , in May , 1944 , we scheduled a series of engineering conferences in Los Angeles , Chicago and Cleveland . These turned out to be fairly large gatherings held in large meeting rooms . More modest conferences were held in hotel rooms in Wichita , Detroit and Washington . These conferences brought out what information we had to date about SR-4 strain gages and application techniques , and added the subjects of fatigue , vibration and damping testing of materials and structures , and finally structural static testing . We called for an exchange of ideas with the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no monopoly on brains in this business and many in the field knew the testing business well enough to teach us . The forum idea was good and was carried on . In getting material for our SR-4 News Letter Volume I , No. 1 issued May , 1944 , I naturally sought as my main source Professor Ruge . I sat before him like a newspaper reporter , taking notes on answers to questions that had been put to me by others , and interviewing him relative to his ideas about the business future . In Volume I , No. 1 we deemed Objective No. 1 to be a frank discussion of calibration and quality control of wire gages , and I am abstracting very briefly from Professor Ruge 's notes : " One sample out of every 50 for some types and one out of every 20 for others , is subjected to routine test . From time to time an entire packed box from the shipping room is checked for gage factor and resistance , while every gage manufactured is checked ' for resistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing that interested me about this was that it involved my old friend , the Tuckerman Optical Strain Gage , in the strain survey of the calibrating bar upon which test gages were cemented . Professor Ruge went on to discuss the training of girl operators and the manner in which they were selected for the work , and further , how records were kept of the performance and quality of each operator 's samples . In discussing the girl operators , he emphasized the qualities that were most desired in them . Many of these qualities would have qualified them for being good wives , such as honesty , intelligence , and manual dexterity . Professor Ruge concluded , " So painstaking has our control become that we would regard as inexcusable the finding of one bad gage out of several thousand . For example , we have never had a report of an A-1 gage which was inoperative or which was inaccurate due to manufacturing defects ; and over 100,000 of this type alone were put in service in the field in 1943 . " Girls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental fatigue , but in my opinion , an ordinary man would go crazy or go blind at such work in less than a week . The next issue of the SR-4 News Letter was dated October , 1944 . As Edi-  | tor of this informal publication I initiated my series of compositions under the title of " Simple Facts about the Bonded Wire Resistance Strain Gage " that was published serially in four subsequent News Letters . As I have said before , this was done in self-defense because questions from the field came upon me in such volume that I was ready to give up , and so were Professor Ruge , Chester Gibbons and A. V. deForest , from all of whom I was frantically seeking answers . I found , in those days , we first had to teach many people the simple facts about electronics before we could completely settle the matter of simple facts about strain gages because the two subjects were wrapped right together in the same package , but before I could teach anybody , I had to learn about all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an Electrical Engineer , nor a physicist , and have no PhD . I will abstract my introduction to these writings as follows : The learned technical writer writing for his learned compatriots skips the Fundamentals of his subject , but most people who would like to hear basic facts are afraid to ask questions , fearing to be considered ignorant . But I , the Editor , knew myself to be ignorant , so I did not hesitate to ask the simplest questions . Having no desire to show off , I will convey what I have learned in a language which anybody can understand . The sources of my information on early strain gage electronics and instrumentation prior to 1944 were discussions with Professor Ruge , A. V. deForest , Chester H. Gibbons , the profound student whose death in 1948 was a handicap to my learning , and W. D. Macgeorge , whose extraordinary inventiveness will be chronicled in the Baldwin Story . My principal tutor , however , was the Westinghouse short course for business people entitled " Electronics at Work . " The syllabus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide for everything that I wanted to tell to readers of the SR-4 News Letter . This was accomplished with the help of the circuits and schematic diagrams made for me by Macgeorge . With these acknowledgments , I can now proceed with the nonmathematical abstract of the News Letters , boiling down eight News Letter pages into about one page . " When a wire is stretched 0.1 per cent elastically , its increase in length and decrease in area produce a change in resistance of 0.17 per cent . To put this in terms of strain , it is convenient to speak of a gage factor ' as the ratio of change in resistance to change in strain . The usual figure for this ratio for copper-nickel wires is in the neighborhood of 2.0 , meaning that resistance changes twice as fast as strain , a 2-to-I lever . A higher ratio would be desirable if it could he achieved without losing other valuable qualities such as the low temperature coefficient of resistance ( ' I ' . C. for . short ) which is characteristic of copper-nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it differs from the theoretical . The wires being investigated for use in gages were Nichrome with gage factor of 2.0 ; Manganin , discarded because of a low gage factor of 0.47 ; Advance , Copel or Constantan , gage factor 2.0 ; Iso-Elastic ( Nickel-ChromeMoly. ) gage factor 3.5 but high T. C. ; and pure nickel , gage factor minus 12.1 , used for temperature measurement . " A 1-mil wire ( 0.001 inch in diameter ) has a surface area 4000 times its cross-section in every inch of length , which gives the cement such bonding strength that it has full control of the wire in tension and compression . That this claim , the application of the idea that the cement was stronger than the wire , is the strength of the Simmons patent ( No. 2,292,549 , Aug. 11 , 1942 ) was later demonstrated in the courts . " A gage resistance of 120 ohms was selected first , because it would pass 25 milliamperes in a bridge circuit at 6 volts . Second , this resistance is large compared to the 6.385 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gage copper lead wires , and third , 120 ohms is great enough to avoid being too badly affected by switching resistance using silver-tipped switches , yet 120 ohms is small enough so that only a 5-inch length of 1-mil copper-nickel wire need be used to attain this resistance value . " When wound in a grid pattern , the end loops introduce 4 per cent error due to transverse strain but this is largely accounted for in the calibration . The function of the felt pad over the wire grid is to protect it from local temperature gradients and physical damage . " In gage manufacture , gage factor tolerance is plus or minus 1 per cent . Resistance tolerance is plus or minus 0.25 per cent of nominal . Leakage resistance to ground must be at least 50 megohms , preferably 200 . " The gage calibration bar is a beam loaded at its third points . The center third of the bar is in a state of constant bending moment so gages for calibration are mounted along its entire length . Loading is by dead weights , strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type gages are cellulose bonded , B ' type are phenol resin bonded and baked in place for such permanent installations as transducers . They can also be used up to 300 F for long exposure or 500 F for short duration hot tests . " C ' type Iso-Elastic gages are for dynamic tests only , because , although they provide six times the voltage output of constantan gages , their T. C. varies from 25 to 50 times that of constantan , which is intolerable for static testing . " ' R ' type gages are rosetted single gages of three or more in delta , Tdelta or fan pattern on a single paper carrier . They are used to determine the directions and magnitudes of maximum and minimum principal strains . " When a gage is cemented to a stressed part it measures both strain due  | to stress and strain due to temperature change in the part , it can not tell the difference . If a dummy gage be connected into the bridge circuit so as to buck the live gage and it be cemented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same temperature change as the live gage , then strain due to temperature change automatically cancels and the live gage measures strain due to stress alone . " The brief digest of material we have been going through , abstracted from the SR-4 News Letters , is not intended as educational material but is presented as an historical exhibit to indicate the state of the art and the state of knowledge and public information prior to 1944 . Also there is the halfformed thought that this glimpse of strain gage capabilities may stir the minds of those unfamiliar with the subject and stimulate them to looking further . All the real useful and formal textbook material , as has been stated before , is found in Perry &; Lissner 's " Strain Gage Primer " ( McGraw-Hill ) or George Hamor Lee 's " Introductionrto Experimental Stress Analysis " ( John Wiley &; Sons ) . To proceed with a review of the abstract : Vol . I No . III contributed much toward making the Wheatstone bridge understandable to beginners , which most of us were before 1944 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which strain gages were valves , the power supply a pump , and the unbalance indicator a manometer measuring pressure difference between the two branching pipe lines , then comparing the whole show to a voltage divider . This , then , was the time to show Professor Ruge 's T-circuit arrangement of gages , and the other basic circuits for separating forces from moments , also for use as a component dividing device ( because a gage is not capable of measuring any strain except along its axis ) and as a measuring device for torque and thrust . The basic d-c bridge reads on a galvanometer-type strain indicator ( the Ruge box , which can read strains to 0.000001 inch ) . In contrast , the a-c bridge was the Foxboro SR-4 Strain Indicator with its 1000 cycle power supply , a good commercial unit . As yet , d-c amplifiers were not considered respectable members of the precision instrument colony and were thus deemed unsuited even to think about . We now faced the growing complexities of electronics in strain gage circuits . First came the vacuum-tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in making schematic drawings for me , waxed so enthusiastic that he pictured electrons actually flowing up the tube . Then we had to learn the meanings of such words as gain , pentode , screen grid , suppressor grid , and tube characteristic curve , the latter apparently related grid bias , anode current and the cut-off point each to the other . We found out that when one amplifier tube was not enough to build up the weak strain gage bridge signal sufficiently to drive a recorder pen or the motor of a self-  | balancing bridge , we had to study transformer coupling or resistance coupling between stages so we could tie enough tubes together to do our work . When we powered a-c strain gage bridges from 60 cycle input , which was adequate for many uses , we found we had inductance and capacity problems in the bridge network , so we had to introduce a phase balance to supplement the resistance balance we already had . We were pleased when Macgeorge said we could simplify our vocabulary if we lumped together inductance , capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an a-c bridge what resistance alone was to the d-c bridge . The d-c circuit was such a comfortable , well disciplined servant except for its thermal emf 's but it was definitely limited in its usefulness for strain gages . With 60 cycles powering the bridge we found we were limited to recording strain oscillations of not more than 6 cycles per second or at a stretch , 10 . Macgeorge said we needed an oscillator , which was a simple matter because it was simply an amplifier in which part of the output feeds back into the grid through a resonant circuit . ( Everything was easy for Macgeorge . ) The resonant circuit was easy because it was merely the electrical equivalent of a mechanical mass and spring system , where the inductance behaves like a mass and the capacitance like a spring , and , like the mechanical system , a small force input can maintain heavy oscillating forces when the L-C or mass-stiffness ratio is properly adjusted or tuned . Thus , the amplifier tube with feed-back to grid can become a self-sustaining alternating current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the strain gage bridge . Then we found impedance varied with frequency so there was an adjustment for that . In SR-4 work we then applied a more suitable resistance-capacitor oscillator to replace the original inductance-capacitor tube because it was easier to tune . Having achieved an oscillator we next encountered the ingenious modulated carrier wave , adding more appendages to what started out as a simple cl-c bridge and galvanometer . In radio , weak audio-frequency currents modulate strong radio-frequency currents known as carrier waves . If we powered the strain gage bridge directly with an oscillator and amplified the output into an oscillograph , we would get an envelope in which the pattern above the center line duplicates that below , while the peaks of the carrier waves outline the envelope . Then we had to demodulate and rectify the amplified output , so we piled on more electronic equipment , first a vacuum tube half-wave rectifier ( an ordinary diode ) , which we later replaced with a copper oxide rectifier because it meant one less vacuum tube . This rectifier eliminated handily the negative loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line-up ( a resistunce and inductance in series , in parallel with a capacitor ) knocked out the high frequency currier waves and let the low frequency signal slip through .  | Thus the original signal in enlarged form appeared on the recorder . Both steady state and dynamic strains were recorded with equal fidelity even though they had gone through a lot of processing from the strain gage bridge to the recorder . This is the Devil 's workshop . The Foxboro SR-4 Strain Indicator , mentioned so often , is a good example of a circuit embracing all these elements . Resistance changes in strain gages can be measured to an accuracy of 0.0006 ohm , in spite of all the components it takes to do it . The self-balancing bridge , diagrammed in the December 1944 SR-4 News Letter , was becoming increasingly important for strain recording . In this instrument , bridge unbalance drives a two-phase reversing motor through power amplifiers . The motor runs to re-balance by turning a slidewire , which at the same time moves the recorder pen . The two-phase motor is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is connected to the oscillator , the other to the external bridge , so the phases are bucking each other . The direction of input signal causes one or the other of the phases in the motor to lead , thus setting the direction of rotation . In 1942 Foxboro built for Ruge the first 48 channel recorder , actually 49 channels of which one was the dummy and the other 48 were parallel live gage circuits . Automatic Telephone stepping switches could make a record on a circular chart from 48 points on a structure at the rate of one to two seconds per gage depending on the amount of unbalance . The January and February 1945 issues of the SR-4 News Letter describe with schematic drawings other instrumentation such as the Brush two channel pen-and-ink oscillograph ( frequency range 1 to 120 cps ) . Amplified bridge unbalance in this case was impressed on a piezo-electric crystal causing it to deform and to move a very light recording pen . This system can not record steady stress because the crystal will only respond to changes in voltage . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving mirror oscillograph of that day was usually a 12-channel unit with either bi-filar or D'Arsonval galvanometers , furnished for frequencies of 120 and 2000 cps . William Miller and Consolidated Engineering instruments were the ones usually seen . The rule that the lower the frequency the longer the bridge length and the greater the sensitivity led Dr. Howland of Lockheed to feed strain gage bridge unbalance directly into the vibrator elements , eliminating the need to carry airborne the big amplifier boxes . Before leaving the early SR-4 News Letters I am impelled to abstract my 1944 write-up on the prevailing idea of experimental stress analysis in those days . This was gained from spending much time watching the airframe builders work out their problems of design improvement and asking many questions about what were they ( l ) ing. lien. is the order of a project : I. Lake prelin ( inary design from computations haled 011 overlapping as-  | sumptions wherever indeterminates are encountered . Assumptions are usually educated guesses based on past experience . Extra weight arising out of the use of conventional factors of safety is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to under-design . Aeronautical engineers know they can go easy on factors of safety ( 1.66 is going easy ) because they are eventually going to correct the assumptions by experimental stress analysis . The current idea of making a structure stronger by making it lighter is not helped by " beefing up " failed parts ; better to re-shape them . 2 . The next move is to build the first full-scale model in accordance with the analytical design , place strain gages and rosettes at locations where stress information is needed , then make the static test of the structure . Analyze the stress patterns at these locations as load rises . On parts subject to bending and buckling use gages and rosettes back to back where possible . For cast and forged parts , let Stresscoat show where to put gages , by its crack pattern . 3 . Load the structure as a whole in increments of 10 per cent of design load up to 100 per cent . Return to " no load " from the higher increments to look for permanent set . Plot back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress distribution . Make structural adjustments and corrections so that the original corrected structure can be " proof loaded " ( 66-2/3 per cent of design load ) . Reinforce overstressed parts and then carry the test up to 100 per cent design load , hoping it will fail at that point . 4 . Using test data , correct all assumptions and assign true values to empirical formulae . 5 . Dynamically test the corrected structure . This may be called simulated service testing . Examine the effects of occasional dynamic overloads. 6 . Flight test the final design built into a new structure . From this test determine actual flight loads and landing stresses . In cases of radically new configurations , run wind tunnel tests on a model of the final design . 7 . Gages , when properly installed , do not alter the weight , balance or natural frequency of the part to which they are attached , and , with special techniques , would have little or no effect on aerodynamic characteristics . One of the strain gage 's greatest services is to show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns in the structural plastic range , while the . t riicture is being loaded to failure . We continued to note that in answer to the universal question , " What causes the difference between good and bad performance of SR-4 gages ? " our experts from Professor Ruge and Chester Gibbons down to the Baldwintiouthwark sales department had one stereotyped answer , " Technique . " I because impatient with hearing this word " technique " used to parry all questions , so I asked Gibbons , our expert iii the language , " What is tech-  | His answer was informative . " Know-how , " he said . I asked for elaboration and got the full statement , " Know-how , practice and experience , learn by doing . " That was it , we no longer needed to be evasive . When Ruge-deForest in 1942 first opened up in the converted store , which was actually the old Tech Co-op Store at 76 Massachusetts Avenue , it was not hard to predict that a bigger place would soon be needed and one that had more windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in daylight . Like a variation in Parkinson 's first Law it can be stated , " An organization will expand to over-fill the space it occupies . " So in the case of Ruge-deForest , they started " filled " and proceeded rapidly to be overfull . In 1947 they moved upstairs in the same building block into what had been a roller-skating rink and marathon dance hall , which is now burned down . This was 84 Massachusetts Avenue . With more room to expand , this area was soon filled to teeming capacity , so in 1952 they moved again , this time into a respectable factory type building that looked like a modern place of business , one story high and back from the street . This was the Moulton Street address within walking distance of Howard Johnson 's Restaurant in the Fresh Pond District , on the edge of Belmont , Boston 's pleasant suburb . It made no difference what anyone did , or where they moved to , business kept on increasing and the variety of product could have filled an abbreviated Sears-Roebuck catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some did not even have names . The torquemeter with its slip ring structure was one of the things that intrigued me . There were so many places to use a torquemeter , from a kitchen egg beater to a battleship . The first one I sold was to Charles Lipson at Chrysler in Detroit . It was a sort of cooperative venture between Ruge and Lipson . Dr. Lipson stated , with some heat , a year or two later that it still did not satisfy him and he had spent more of Chrysler 's money trying to make out of it what he wanted than the thing originally cost him , After all , I never did find out exactly what Charley Lipson considered satisfactory , but the incident did put pressure on torquemeters and wonders were performed on slip-rings and Kelvin Bridge circuits with " Ruge corners " and in torque instrumentation . We finally did get up to the battleship . I sold torquemeters to the Navy to put on the propeller shafts of the battleship Pennsylvania which , I think , was the flagship of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept asking when they were going to get their torquemeters and I kept asking HugedeForest . Finally I found out what was holding things tip . deForest was waiting for the battleship to steam up to Boston Navv Yard to have the equipment installed , and the ' Navy insisted that it he done at Washington 1a l:ad  | Both sides were strong ; neither would give in . We were in a wartime situation , so deForest agreed to trust the Navy to install the torquemeter components , which he sent to the Washington Navy Yard . It was agreed that the instrumentation would be up to them , because they wanted to use an oscillograph for service records . The Navy proved their competence by doing a good installation job on the propeller shafts . They located the oscillograph on the ship 's bridge . After sea tests , they wrote a fine report ( Report R-54 , David Taylor Model Basin , January , 1942 ) . The gages apparently did wonders . They revealed propulsion efficiencies , the distribution of load between propellers , torques during maneuvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propellers partly out of water and other things the Navy wanted to know about actual seamanship . This , I would say , was a Navy triumph , and proved they could be trusted to make complicated instrumentation provide very good data . I was even invited aboard the battleship Pennsylvania by Captain Saunders , at a later date , when she was anchored in New York . In 1945 deForest died at his country home in New Hampshire , a hideaway he had enjoyed as much as sailboats . His place in the world of technology was never completely filled . Professor Ruge carried on the expanding business with a competence that one would not have expected from one who was a learned professor of Civil Engineering . In fact , his efficient operation in Cambridge amazed us all , for quality and deliveries were excellent in spite of the rapid growth that was taking place . Not only did he turn out many new strain gage products , but also maintained a continuous flow of new ideas on strain gages , transducers , circuits and techniques . Ed Hathaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of all these new ideas . Some he patented , others he had me publish in Testing Topics to secure these ideas against being patented by others . Some of these were the " Swiss Cheese Load Cell , " so-called because it was full of gaged holes , certain configurations of tension dynamometers that were a combined ring and stressed bar , an ingenious SR-4 laboratory scale , and such others . Testing Topics was the successor Baldwin publication to the SR-4 News Letters . Our business had matured now and we needed a more formal publication to reflect it . I was still the Editor , specializing in writing comment on the current scene , columns which I called Editorials , and they represented only my personal thoughts as I moved around in the testing and instnunent field . Professor Ruge was honored by the Society for Experimental Stress Analvsis at their annual meeting in 1955 in Chicago . He delivered the William Murray Lecture on Transducers , when he showed his fellow engineers behind the scenes for the first time revealing the design of strain-gaged load veils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In  | 1951 he had addressed the National Bureau of Standards Semicentennial Symposium on Resistance Strain Gages , which was a prestige affair of international scope . In 1955 Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton bought Ruge-deForest , Inc . It turned out that it was easier to move the Baldwin Electronics Division to Cambridge than to move Ruge-deForest to Eddystone . Mohammed came to the mountain . Ruge remained in his Moulton Street plant while Baldwin opened offices on Massachusetts Avenue directly across the street from Cambridge City Hall and next door to the YMCA . This was to the liking of our exuberant Vice President , Col. John Robert Martin , who would spend his lunch hour at the YMCA exercising . This he did to assure himself that he would be in top shape to function as spirited leader of his Division . When dominated by such effervescence , the Division was observed to pick up so much speed in its forward drive that it literally swept up the Ruge-deForest organization as one would snatch the brass ring on a merrygo-round . Thus , Ruge and Baldwin rode together into the new plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing upon Route 128.  | Alfred Sonntag came from Germany in 1930 , from Losenhausenwerk , at the age of 27 and moved into the position in Riehle Bros . Testing Machine Co. that I had vacated at Mr. Riehle 's request , four years before . Riehle Bros. in 1935 became a division of American Machine &; Metals Co. ( now Ametek , Inc. ) and moved to East Moline , Illinois . Sonntag became chief engineer and sales manager . I have always envied the man that holds such dual role . When a sales manager and chief engineer are two separate persons with strong wills , the sales manager is forced to argue endlessly with the chief engineer to get what he wants . In Sonntag 's position , he needed only to talk to himself , and if he did not win his point , it was his own fault . Sonntag was not only an excellent and most experienced testing machine designer , but also a powerful sales personality , so he became a most formidable competitor . He was a strong man , one not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his apparent summary of facts had a ring of authority . When , rarely , he lost his poise , he employed a single dignified expletive which was expressive , quietly spoken profanity . " DarnDamn ! " he would say , and this harmless outburst seemed to relieve his feelings completely . In staff conferences , of which there are too many these days , there are two kinds of attenders who are there to answer technical questions . The first type answers slowly , exhibiting personal power from the depths of his great knowledge , and everybody nods in agreement , saying respecthilly , " Yes , Dr. X , of course , Dr. X. " The second type , armed with the same knowledge , answers just as promptly and presumably as accurately but speaks humbly with downcast eyes , while the questioners , in disbelief , snap , " Is that so , how do you know ? " Sonntag was the kind of fellow toward whom the people in conference unquestioningly nodded respectful agreement . Ills opinions , delivered in clipped terms , settled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require any subsequent enlargement or alteration  | One day in 1942 we received a letter at Baldwin-Southwark from Sonn- ' tag asking if he might affiliate with our organization . That was all he said , but it was a pleasant surprise of some magnitude that drew our prompt answer . We merely asked , just as simply , " What does it take to get you ? " as if that mattered . He agreed to come to Eddystone as chief engineer of our Testing Equipment Department . When at length he came and looked at our big drafting room in which were assembled in close proximity the engineering departments of three distinct groups , the Southwark presses , the I. P. Morris hydraulic turbines , and finally ourselves over in one corner , he shrugged and announced quietly that he did not like big engineering departments . He preferred creative solitude , which actually meant he had in mind a separate technical aristocracy in a locality apart from the crowd , but under our sponsorship . This sounded good if we could do it ; surely we would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want Sonntag moving against me in competitive fields again . He must stay on our side at all costs , so as to leave me a clear field in testing machine sales . The unceasing battle of wits in which I had been engaged with Sonntag for years was due for an intermission so that I could give more time to my other capacity , Manager of Testing Research , as it was called . Mr. William Harman , Vice President of the Baldwin-Southwark Division , agreed with me on the importance of holding Sonntag by any reasonable means . Our point of disagreement was that I wanted to hold him by all means , reasonable or not . Harman could see no way that Sonntag could be an absentee chief engineer occupying an ivory tower separated by some distance from the turmoil of the divisional engineering department . This was too much for Baldwin to digest . Nothing could persuade Sonntag to abandon his distaste for large aggregations of engineers and draftsmen . It was obviously up to me to act alone , as I had done before in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products or components to Baldwin-Southwark under contracts ; so why not try a fourth . My proposal to Baldwin management met with resounding opposition I did not fight back , just quietly let nature take its course . Sonntag temporarily occupied himself as a consultant for a firm called Gyro-Balance Corp . ( high speed balancing machines ) at Greenwich , Connecticut , while I was out looking for a location in a quiet area outside of Philadelphia to set up a business rnaking a testing product not vet defined . While looking for a location I also started looking for Homey , because Sonntag had none , Mr. Harman felt lie would he entharrassed hs participating , aril Mr dekrafft was in I:urupe ,  | I found money in unexpected places . I was telling my troubles to my associate , A. H. Emery , when he came to my rescue offering some financial support . Thus encouraged , I told Chester Gibbons at Southwark about Mr. Emery and Mr. Tate investing in my project and he agreed that if conservatives like Emery and Tate would take a chance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress others , so I added Bob Tabors , John Graf and Frank Buckingham , members of the Southwark sales department , to my list . Finally Bill Harman , Junior and my wife completed the informal syndicate to all of whom Sonntag issued $1000 bonds with common stock as a bonus . I do n't know why these investment certificates were called bonds but I am sure they were not stock certificates ; they were actually long term notes . The financial structure does seem odd to me right now , but Sonntag 's prestige gave the whole affair ample solidity . He leased the Greenwich plant of Gyro-Balance , because this plant was ideally located in an abandoned quarry that was the only permissible place for a manufacturing business in that exclusive residential suburb of New York City . There was much activity connected with the establishing of an embryo business in the quarry , but we still did not know for what . Finally Sonntag released small morsels of information . He was planning to build a structural fatigue testing machine based on the " resonant beam " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he needed a chief engineer . I said to him , " I thought you were chief engineer , " but he showed me that he could not set up a business and do the engineering at the same time . The announced name of the business was the Sonntag Scientific Corporation . I liked that . Luckily . I knew where to look for a chief engineer . Dr. Rudolph Bernhard from Germany had introduced a mechanical oscillator to us at Baldwin-Southwark , consisting of two eccentric masses rotating in opposite directions so as to induce forced vibration sinusoidal oscillating loads in any structure to which it was attached . He worked on the development of a commercial model with us , but since progress was slow he moved on to Pennsylvania State University as head of a dynamics department . His assistant was a Dr. Benjamin Lazan who had developed a simplified mechanical oscillator employing a single rotating mass . Sonntag hired I.azan as chief engineer and the resonant beam idea was soon replaced by u compact fatigue machine with a single rotating mass oscillator that looked small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his two assistants from Penn State , Alex Yorgiadis and AI Kutsay , both natives of Turkey . This rapidly enlarging but highly competent staff increased the confidence of our investors but at the same time strained our finances A disturbing situation arose iu which every so  | often , usually on a Saturday afternoon ? a time most likely to cause maximum alarm in our household ? we would get a telegram from Sonntag Scientific Corporation stating that more payroll money was needed by early the next week , for which a bond certificate would be mailed . It was evident that I needed a reliable source of emergency funds in large supply until we could achieve a marketable product . My other satellites , Peters and Emery had developed more slowly in attaining their small business maturity ; hence their money crises did not arise faster than they could be handled . As for Ruge-deForest , it seemed to grow like Topsy , a child of Nature , which induced no panics . Sonntag Scientific , on the other hand , was like Jack 's bean stalk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow it down . It could not wait for normal growth of products and markets ; it needed some work right now that had hard cash connected with it . Thus , my twin objectives , to find loth more money and emergency work , were in addition to my regular occupation at Baldwin-Southwark . The money trail started with Mr. Charles Acker , Baldwin 's treasurer , respected alike by bankers in New York and Philadelphia . He gave me an introduction to a New York banker who passed me on to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , one of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's government agencies which was set up to help American Industry with its money problems . Apparently many others had money problems besides me . When I visited the RFC in New York I walked through endless corridors in barn-like floors of offices , tried many wrong doors , and inside these doors , faced walls of filing cabinets and chilly-eyed financial looking people who offered me little sympathy and no money , but who let me fill out forms . Apparently RFC was the wrong place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough . I was talking money in terms of thousands whereas to attract attention I would have to speak in millions . But I realized that I did not look like the kind of person who could casually drop the word " millions " in public places . I have mentioned before that to get the ear of big executives you have to look like one . Sonntag himself could have carried off this masquerade much better than I , but he had his hands full elsewhere . The trail led on to a very human bank executive in Wall Street , Mr. I . D. Forster , high officer of the Bank of the Manhattan &; Trust Comparuv He took a personal interest in my problem and visited Sonntag at Green wich . Though his bank did not participate , nevertheless his own personal concern gave me heart and hope , both of which I was fast losing amid the giants of Wall Street , Mr. Forster and I have enjoyed a firni friend ship ever since . We had much in common because he was interested iii his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a prisate fish  | hatchery which was an enlarged version of the pond on my farm , stocked by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service . I reasoned that like the RFC , Wall Street bankers were allergic to little problems like mine . It seemed that businesses are considered potentially successful if they are big , even though nearly bankrupt . It reminds me of that cynical statement of a business hero , " The more money you owe , the bigger you are . " Small town bankers might be nearer my size , so Sonntag and I visited Mr. Bigelow of the First National Bank of Greenwich . He not only lowered his sights enough to look at us , but also he seemed to understand us , especially since we represented local industry , however unpopular it was in elite suburban Greenwich . We were tentatively acceptable because of our location in a quarry where no one could see us or hear us or know that we were even there . After all , we would be taxpayers , and invisible taxpayers are an asset to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive while we gained other financial allies . This left me only one more place to go , back to Mr. Acker at Baldwin , like going home to mother . My proposal to Baldwin was to drop their opposition to this new satellite now that it had already taken form . We definitely had a unique product , a structural dynamics testing machine for which I could show a strong need , especially in aeronautics . We had a good place to build this product which would complete Baldwin 's line of profitable testing machines . We had an exceptionally strong engineering staff and we had our own initial financial backing which , though insufficient , revealed the faith of people who knew values . In return for some financial support , we would offer an attractive contract giving Baldwin exclusive marketing rights and a substantial voice in the business . Mr. Acker was a prudent man ; he recognized the success of the other three satellites and their value to Baldwin 's consolidated balance sheet and agreed to take 34 per cent of the stock of Sonntag Scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small added premiums , gave Sonntag controlling interest because of his contributions , which included working for nothing all this time , and finally relieved the financial tension . This purchase was subject , of course , to an inspection of the properties and the staff and facilities by Mr. Acker , Mr. Hathaway , and u Baldwin manufacturing executive . The plant was spruced up , the work in process set out conspicuously and the staff put on exhibit . The visit was a success and the contract concluded in 1947 , but I am now ahead of my story which was how we got ork to live on while waiting for all this to happen . In my wandering in search of business I always found myself eventually itt the vicinity of Washington , which then as now , was the source of  | many cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts that saved many a business life . In these wanderings and searchings , I met an impressive inventor by the name of Myers who had a startling idea for aeronautical propulsion . This was a kind of jet , that came before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shortly thereafter we heard of the V-1 and the V-2 German weapons that frightened the life out of everybody , we heard of German airplanes that were flying mysteriously without propellers and sailing by our fastest allied fighters , then we later heard of the Whittle turbo-jet in England . I was Air Commodore Whittle 's host when he first visited Philadelphia to argue for the centrifugal compressor versus Westinghouse 's axial flow compressor . Myers , as far as I know , was ahead of them all . There was only one trouble with the Myers engine : we could not make it cycle more than a few times . The Myers engine was a top military secret , being handled directly out of President Franklin Roosevelt 's office in the White House to which I had private telephone access , conversing with Mr. David Niles , F.D.R 's right hand man on these matters . I took this development contract for Sonntag in 1943 , and this is where the idea of working in a quarry reached the pinnacle of good sense . The development work came to involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially elite and all that , suffering from window-rattling explosions taking place daily , even though surrounded by quarry walls ? In spite of the fact that we might win the war with this pioneer jet engine , Greenwich was not going to let its home life be bombarded by something that exploded every time it ran . Nobody that I heard of was killed or wounded in the trial runs because these runs did not last long enough . Here is why : The engine , in its normal attitude , was a horizontal tubular affair whose slide moved to suck into the combustion chamber two chemical fuels that would ignite and explode out the tail pipe , the reaction moving the slide to take in another fuel charge . For the tests , the engine was mounted vertically in a guide frame and the explosions thrust the engine upward , lifting dead weights that were on its nose . The object of the test was to measure the thrust with different chemical fuel combinations . Thus big noise was normal operation . One of these test fuels was Mercaptan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stresscoat . The Sonntag organization could not stand the smell , so when two of the employees were going on a fishing trip they poured three gallons of the unused fluid into the water of Greenwich harbor . The harbor began to smell so fiercely that many Greenwich citizens called the police , who made a thorough investigation . They announced through the local newspaper that German submarine had entered the harbor and released mustard gas .  | Perhaps the ram-jet or flying stove pipe was an evolution of the Myers engine , because the experimental models in Greenwich were not practical judging by the way they worked out on the Sonntag artillery range . Combined pressure of the Greenwich citizens and the German and Whittle jet engine developments ended our contract in less than a year , though we were officially complimented on our results . The development product never flew in this country , as fas as I know , but the German V-1 missile appearing over England sounded like a muffled version of our intermittent explosions in the Greenwich quarry . I will bet that the V-1 did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonntag experiments scared the Greenwich residents . One thing the Myers engine did for us , it shifted our main concern from financial to political . We had to become good politicians to be allowed to stay in the Greenwich quarry to finish another contract I had gotten for Sonntag from The Budd Company . This was for 100 tension testing machines for quality control testing of Budd Shotwelds in the various shops , in accordance with Budd 's welding standards . The frames of these weld testers were made from 14-inch diameter seamless steel tubes that enclosed the miniature pumping unit and the hydraulic power cylinder , surmounted at the top by an 8-inch load idicating dial . Access to the grips and the tensile specimen was provided by a window cut in the tithe wall . The machine looked like a gasoline pump at the corner filling station . This job kept the Sonntag organization busy and well fed until their Universal Fatigue Machine and Lazan Mechanical Oscillator were ready for the market , which was about 1944 . This was when we first heard the expression , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " showing the fast pace of change . There is no space nor time to detail here the innovations and novel testing products turned out by Sonntag 's capable engineering staff and his shop run like a disciplined team . His Universal Fatigue Machines took many forms , most of them designed for " constant load " life testing of parts , components and small structures . These machines grew bigger and bigger until they were testing large structures dynamically , and when the structure got too big for the biggest machine , the testing machine was carried to the structure in the form of the Lazan portable oscillator . A well known example of a large structure tested by a mechanical oscillator was the Losenhausen heavy duty oscillator used by the David Taylor Model Basin at the Washington Navy Yard to shake a floating battle cruiser . The purpose was to test the sensitivity of the fire control apparatus to vibration , but the test provided some unexpected data . At certain critical frequencies motion sickness attacked most of the crew ; this was of more concern to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The weekly payroll crisis had diminished as the company grew busier and healthier , that is , for all except Sonntag himself and his wife Teeny , who were still drawing no salaries . They lived in tranquility without income , but I am unable to describe the situation because I do not understand how they did it . The Sonntags kept up appearances with powerful dignity , held impressive meetings with the Board of Directors and managed to keep them all satisfied with progress . He ran his business along two lines . He built standard fatigue machines on stock orders , and with equal enthusiasm he took on many hard jobs of special testing machine design , coming up with practical solutions clothed in entirely original concepts . He introduced new and much-desired principles in his designs such as constant load fatigue testing as opposed to the conventional constant deflection method , which so frequently failed to duplicate service conditions in the field and would give too optimistic fatigue life values . He even scientifically studied and achieved constant energy testing , with a big assist from Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in simulating some service conditions on rubber engine mounts . Ile had the personal experience and the engineering support to make all this service to industry possible without pain or complaint . Alfred Sonntag claimed to have designed more testing machines of more kinds than any man living or dead , and who can dispute it ? Certainly not I , after studying his background in Germany . He ran his plant like a benevolent Prussian martinet . Everything was in order , everybody worked hard and with good common sense because Sonntag made a point of letting them all know what they were doing and why , and what the end product was to be . He had a conscientious business manager , John Toms , who liked to work himself to death and still maintain a gentle smile . He could produce charts , figures , statistics and facts sufficient to satisfy Baldwin interrogators at a moment 's notice . He kept running curves of costs and production . In fact , he marshalled so many facts that the directors became weary from overexposure and hastened to the cocktails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical time , followed by steaks at Manero 's restaurant , where all questions faded away like the Cheshire cat 's smile . Sonntag 's main product , which gained wide acceptance because there was nothing else like it on the market , was his universal fatigue machine , where the word universal is not used lightly . This has been widely described in the technical literature , in news releases and especially in Baldwin 's Testing Topics , particularly Volume 4 , No. 1 , February 1949 . The universal fatigue tester came in many capacities up to 20,000-pound static load , plus and minus 20,000-pound dynamic ( alternating ) load . The most popular size was the 1000-pound static , 1000-pound plus and  | minus dynamic called the Model SF-1-U . Used with bonded strain gages on the parts being tested , a complete story of the life behavior of parts and components could be quickly achieved and changes could be promptly made for re-test of corrected members . There were two obvious ways of correcting weaknesses revealed by the life tests ; one was to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other to change the material , or a little of both . Like all testing equipment , the machine would be only as useful as the intelligence of the man who used it . Sonntag was the " Yes-Man " of testing , " Yes , I can do it if you have the money to pay for it . " Harassed industry , with vexing problems to solve , thanked heaven for him . This is the reason payroll crises diminished . The big AEC shake table was a good example . A development contract with the Atomic Energy Commission called for a shake table developing such high forces and accelerations at such high frequencies that Sonntag predicted the machine would destroy itself on the test run . After all , a fatigue machine should not fatigue itself . Sonntag then proved mathematically that self-destruction was inevitable . Incidentally , this mathematical thesis solved the very problem that the shake table was supposed to solve . The AEC promptly scaled down the specifications to a performance that was feasible though never before attained . Several supershake tables to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the main problems were bearings and lubrication , which led Sonntag into the bearing test business as a sideline , which in turn led to Molykote , the high pressure molybdenum disulphide lubricant . The purpose of the shake tables was to see if an atomic bomb mounted in its bomb rack could arrive intact at its destination . Another supplier of a shake table to the AEC tried to meet the specifications without troubling to make a preliminary mathematical analysis . The table was mounted in a concrete pit . It destroyed itself while under acceptance test , so concrete was poured over it and buried it deeply . Two advantages were gained from this total disappearance : first , it provided a vibration-free base to the solid rock upon which to mount delicate instruments , and second , it also removed a white elephant from the inventory lists . Nothing could be more straightforward than the principle upon which the universal fatigue machine was based . Nothing could be less likely to give false information , except through misalignments : A single rotating weight driven by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage with a single degree of freedom , up and down . The cage is supported by two flexplates attached to the stationary frame . These eliminate unwanted lateral components of force . A preload spring , serving a dual purpose , has one end fixed to the lower end  | of the cage and the other to a screw that adjusts and measures the static preload . The preload determines whether the alternating load will run completely reversed , or all tension , all compression , or become an alternating load superimposed on a static deadload , or any other combination . The second purpose of this spring is to be an inertial force compensator , as it exactly opposes inertial forces of the rotating weight . The machine was a panelled cube . The panelling was a Lindsey structure , a kind of " Erector Set " idea , consisting of standard components that could be put together in different ways that looked clean , efficient and sturdy no matter what shape they displayed . The top was a spacious slotted work table to which could be ancnored an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could be oscillated in the mode of direct stress , bending , torsion , combined bending and torsion , or other combinations , by the up-and-down force applied by the vibrating cage . This machine , in its cubical beauty , gave the impression of an ultra-modern piece of heavy duty space-age furniture . Its special appeal , however , was a scheme of operation that was so quiet and effortless that it could be running in your living room without anyone suspecting that an important life test of a structure was in progress . All the while this test was simulating service by constant force or constant energy input ( this latter means constant area within the load-deflection loop ) , and the nice point was that so many things could be done so easily with only three adjustments : force , frequency and static pre-load . Constant force input allows amplitude to go where it will , so there need be no adjustment for it . For larger force build-up a 3600 rpm motor was used because force varies as the square of the frequency and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For testing high damping materials such as plastics , which heat up under alternating loads , it was often desired to rotate the mass at fractions of the synchronous speed though at a sacrifice of magnitude of applied force . Fortunately plastics do not need forces as large as metallic materials . In rigging the machine for environmental tests such as hot and cold , our customers devised some highly original fixtures for their individual machine parts undergoing life test inside temperature-controlled chambers . Speaking of ingenious fixture design , I am thinking particularly of Dr. J. S. Laird of Ford Motor Company , who mounted for life testing such automotive parts as front spindles , steering arm spindles , tractor spindles , thrust bearings , and also universal joint flanges and universal joint knuckles in reversed torsion . Most interesting of all was Ralph Schmuckal 's constant energy fatigue tests of rubber engine mounts , where deflection was measured and integrated with force in rubber in shear . 9  | Others designed unique gear tooth fatigue test fixtures , and MasseyIlarris took the prize with a vibration test mounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small capacity Sonntag machine that was not any bigger than the test tank itself . Aeronautical engineers exhibited equal cleverness in fashioning structural component mountings . Thus we felt impelled to invite our customers to periodic working conferences in our quarry plant at Greenwich to show off some of these praiseworthy fixture ideas , which seemed to tap the secret of the maximum utilization of fatigue equipment . Alfred Sonntag could be counted upon to put on an eye-opening show . Competitive equipment embracing the principles of these machines was bound to hit the market , with , naturally , some additional refinements and talking points , such as the two oscillating heads on the new Ivy Fatigue Machine . The climax was reached , however , when Northrop Aircraft and Wiley Laboratories , in the Los Angeles area , revealed an astounding random-load-programmed fatigue machine where extraordinary high force capacity and high frequency were brought together ; the result was a fierce monster that needed a separate building and a massive foundation of unprecedented proportions , and a lot of nerve to operate . Instead of forces developed by unbalanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-acting cylinders so that all kinds of forces , frequencies and combined loads could be produced on large structures . It was called " The Earthquake " because it shook the earth . Sonntag preferred to specialize in dynamic testing , which influenced Lazan to continue with improvements in his mechanical oscillator . When a structure to be fatigue tested was too big for a universal fatigue machine , then the alternative was to hand-carry the Lazan oscillator to the structure in the field and mount it thereon . Welded ships , highway bridges in place , fully assembled aircraft structures , railroad cars and automobiles were oscillated to study reliability , natural frequency ( in connection with vibration problems ) , and to predict service life or find weak points that would shorten it . All this was accompanied by a liberal application of accelerometers , strain gages and force transducers . This technique was also used to measure " jerk , " which is the rate of change of acceleration . One especially interesting use of Lazan oscillators was installation in the wings of aircraft in flight to evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical oscillator was mentioned in passing in connection with the work of Dr. Rudolph Bernard at Baldwin . It consisted of two eccentrics rotating in opposite directions . During a cycle of revolution when both eccentrics pointed vertically down , the unbalanced force was double the force of a single eccentric in that direction . When both eccentrics  | were vertically up , the upward force was also doubled . When the eccentrics were horizontal they cancelled each other . If you will aualy n this motion you will see that it comes out purely sinusoidal , or a true sine wave . If , on the other hand , one eccentric pointed up , and one down , when rotated , a torsional force was generated . The forces generated were proportional to the radius of eccentricity , and of course , the square of the speed of rotation . One of Lazan 's best developments was in devising a means of adjusting the eccentricity of the masses while the oscillator was running . Among other things , this made programming possible . In brief , it was accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so these two weights could be adjusted with respect to each other to steplessly vary the unbalanced mass . Signals from strain gages attached to the vibrated structure feeding back into servo-controls of the masses was a possibility then investigated . A futher development by Bernhard , later at Rutgers University , involved a three-rotating mass oscillator , which when tamping fills on highways , for instance , would walk itself along because of the unbalance set up by the third mass , while it tamped . The Lazan oscillator did not compete with the electronic oscillator , such as the M. B. Electronics Co. equipment . This latter was essentially a giant loud speaker , which is really an a-c voice coil moving in the d-c field of a large electromagnet . Each type of oscillator , the mechanical and electronic , has its place in test work . For example , apparatus for generating large forces is simpler with the mechanical oscillator but limited in application by its force-frequency relationship previously noted . The electronic oscillator delivers the same equivalent force at any attainable frequency from lowest to highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . Dr. Lazan , whom we dragged out of Penn State University in 1942 , was always a teacher at heart and never ceased to yearn for the college classroom and laboratory . When he had Sonntag 's engineering department going and had completed the development of the product line , including a line of low-priced static testing machines for Baldwin , he took himself off to Syracuse University . This was the year 1945 . A few years later he had an offer as department chairman at University of Minnesota , and since he was a cold weather man and ski enthusiast , he settled down there and soon became an authority of high standing in the world of damping , shock and vibration . Yorgiadis took over Lazan 's place at Sonntag 's in his competent and humble way and served all functions from chief engineer to glorified service man . Sandia Base in New Mexico enticed him away in 1953 to the magic desert area , which I think must lose its magic with time , because  | in a few years he was back in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kutsay then took over for a while as chief engineer , then he too went out with the Ivy Company to make that interesting variation of the universal fatigue machine with its two oscillating heads and other related refinements . Ivy is now part of the Wiedemann Machine Division . It is hard to keep up with all the changes that take place in this business . Baldwin bought the remaining stock of Sonntag Scientific Corporation in 1947 and took the company up to Waltham when the big move to Massachusetts was made in 1954 . The rest of the story I will give you in Sonntag 's own words : " I got along with Colonel Martin very well . I liked the man . He brought in an inexperienced consultant out of the clear sky . I opposed his designs at a general meeting in Waltham , first calmly , then with vigor , then with such violence that I knew at the time he would never call on me again . " This is about as vivid a picture of the cleavage of great minds as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Alpha Corp . and made a great success of it , showing that his merchandising talents even exceeded his engineering talents . Now he is a legend in the industry .  | One day in July 1930 , a most uncommon young man came to the Southwark office in Philadelphia and introduced himself to my boss , Fritz Schranz , as Dr. Ing . Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf of Braunschweig , Germany . He said he was looking fd1 Mr. Tatnall with a letter of introduction from Dr. Wazau of Tempelhof , Berlin . Schranz replied with characteristic bluntness , " We are all looking for Tatnall . He spends much time on the road but sends in no itineraries . Will I do ? " " No , " said von Heydekampf , which set off a big laugh . Laughing came easily to both of them . Schranz promised , " He 'll come home when he runs out of expense money . Sit down and wait . " He did , patiently seating himself at my desk . Next day we met , and Dr. von Heydekampf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O. Foppl , famous materials scientist and head of the Wailer Institute of Braunschweig . I had always pictured this institute as a combination Alcoa Research Laboratories ( who were then contending that they researched aluminum while steel companies talked tonnage ) and Battelle Memorial Institute . Dr. von Heydekampf , immediately nicknamed Doc by the brusque Mr. Schranz , told this story , " I decided to visit the U.S.A. to see what was being done in metallurgical research . I first studied the spoken ' American language by sitting in the talking movies . Next , I visited ASME head office for advice . They suggested I visit Bell Telephone Laboratories and then U. S. Steel Research Laboratories . Due to the worldwide depression I obtained good advice but no employment at each stop . My next try was Esso Labs in Bayway where there was no job tor me , but I was asked to help them translate a new book just in from Germany on Fatigue Testing . When seeing this book I had to grin . It was one written by Prof. Foppl together with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Esso people were impressed and recommended me to Mr. Rohmer at Babcock &; Wilcox Corp . at Bayonne , where I found my first U.S. job at 60 dollars a week , obtained by luck and youthful impertinence .  | " While at 13 &; V doing tensile tests at elevated ternperatures , I wrote an article on ' Damping Capacity , ' which was promptly printed in Iron Age . My boss , Mr. Rohmer , was not pleased by my innocently adding the title of Research Engineer , Babcock &; Wilcox Corp . to my name as author without his permission , but later forgave and promoted me when my article drew quite a bit of attention . My better job also paid 60 dollars a week , of which more than half went to my savings account . In three months I came to Baldwin-Southwark because I wanted to get along faster in materials testing with a broader base of study . " This smart young scientist with the wisdom of long experience was only 25 years old . In three months of listening and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He accepted an offer of 75 dollars a week to work as my assistant without promise of future raises or fringe benefits . Doc brought to us a charming personality , an air of competence , warmth and good humor , and a repertory of new ideas from European science that gave promise of a leap forward in materials testing . These great expectations did not fully mature because von Heydekampf returned to Germany after three years ' sojourn with me . In his contacts with General Motors during those years he had made such an impression that they hired him for a high office in their German Opel plant that led to a Vice President 's job , assisting C. R. Osborn , later head of GM 's Electromotive Division at LaGrange , Illinois . At the time that the " Century of Progress Exposition " was opening on the lake front , across from the Stevens Hotel ( now Conrad Hilton ) in Chicago we had a booth in an ASTM Testing Exhibit in the Exhibit Hall of the Stevens . Though in direct competition with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically minded people were on hand because everything we were showing was new to most materials men . Our exhibits included the Wazau double pendulum universal testing machine , the Mathar apparatus for measuring residual stresses by strain relief from drilling a hole ( first showing for such method ) , Lehmann &; Michels recording torsiographs and vibrographs ( miniature self-contained units with stylus scratching on coated tape moved by clockwork ) , the Foppl-Pertz Damping Tester ( a torsion pendulum and stylus on coated tape ) , an accelerated creep test method , and others of similar character , all imported from Europe . The damping tester claimed the major interest because research laboratories discovered that it could evaluate properties that they wanted to know more about . For instance , Jones &; Laughlin found that it measured rnachinability , International Nickel found it an evaluator of age hardening , Prof. H. F. Moore of the University of Illinois wrote that damp-  | ing tests measured the degree of crackless plasticity ' ' possessed by u metal ( Iron Age , Sept. 10 , 1931 ) which revealed this property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the ability to resist fairly large numbers of loads that caused very slight plastic action without starting a crack . J. O. Almen of General Motors Research , wrote and spoke much about damping and cold-working metal surfaces to obtain beneficial residual compressive stresses to increase fatigue life in bending and torsion . The Foppl-Pertz machine recorded the rate of damping out of vibrations of a torsion pendulum that was provided by the specimen under test shown by the length of the decaying wave . High damping materials such as east iron turn vibration into heat by their hysteresis loops , so they do well as machine tool housings , whereas low damping materials amplify vibrations , because rate of vibration decay is so slow . Dr. von Heydekampf 's reputation spread rapidly , against his will , because he sought no fame or distinction whatever . I remember that when he and I would walk through the Stevens Hotel lobby to our booth , engineers and metallurgists would converge upon him asking questions , never noticing me though I was inches taller . He was sought out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist of great depth , tempered by a bright and pleasing personality , and a happy sense of humor . A universal testing machine that he designed was adopted at once by Southwark , as a product they could build . Studying all existing forms of testing machines , Doc decided that the Swiss Amsler type was the best place to start since it represented advanced European thinking . He would remove the weaknesses in the packless power cylinder and the inertia of the pendulum weighing system . He made four major improvements on conventional design . First , he rotated the power cylinder at the top of the machine instead of the piston to reduce friction , thus gaining consistent accuracy in the low-load ranges . Next , he devised a means of changing the area of the measuring piston by reversing its rotation , further increasing low-range precision . To eliminate temperature effect , pendulum inertia , and to improve speed of response , he replaced the conventional bell crank and pendulum with Iso-Elastic Spring Units ( described in connection with the Tate-Emery Load Indicator ) arranged so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force measuring line to provide five load ranges , high to low , and at the same time , providing an efficient recorder drive . A fourth innovation was the over-size load-indicating dial with a rotating mask that revealed one at a time on one graduated dial face the load values for the five ranges . This was an idea soon adopted by almost all domestic testing  | machine - manufacturers . Known as the Southwark-Heydekampf Universal Machine , this equipment was soon in use by many leading laboratories . This machine attracted the attention of Henry Sang of the Naval Air Experimental Station , who installed one in his plastics research laboratory at the Naval Aircraft Factory . This was the time when many enthusiasts were promoting plastics as a structural material to end all other materials of construction . There were frequent references to plastics , the " New Metallurgy , " with arguments so potent that real metallurgists were becoming alarmed . The Navy wanted to evaluate the true mechanical properties for themselves so as to establish their purchase requirements . Bag moulding and other new techniques led venturesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and airplane fuselages to office furniture , exclaiming with delight at the high impact- values , high damping capacity and " strengthweight ratio " of such structures . Henry Sang insisted that the Heydekampf testing machine was an instrument and specified it as such . He called it a device of " unparalleled accuracy " and wrote an amusing little by-word on such a big instrument set in a leather case with purple velvet lining and tied with a baby-blue ribbon . Anyone knowing Henry Sang as a sturdy critic of instrumentation , with an artist 's mind , and a researcher scientifically meticulous , would realize that instrumentation was growing up and maturing into an art as well as a science , thus gaining wide respect . Von Heydekampf and I and a third engineer , Herman Ruch , a good , experienced but sometimes stubborn designer , comprised almost the whole team representing the Testing Equipment Department at the time that Southwark joined Baldwin and moved to Eddystone . Hard-headed practical thinker Herman Ruch put Doe 's sketches into detail working drawings that the shop would accept , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , with the benevolent approval of both Mr. Harman and Mr. Schranz , was totally integrated and functioned like a smartly trained football squad . For instance , when I would go out on a two weeks ' sales trip , Doc would handle the correspondence , office work and engineering supervision , while Ruch would carry on as the engineering department and keep an eye on the shops . When I would return , weary from my travels , I would take over the office desk and its duties and Doc would take to the road , as both salesman and ambassador of scientific prestige . He was just as good in this role as he was playing his part as engineer-scientist . He had a captivating way of using words with a delightfully innocent foreign twist that fascinated his listeners . His intuitive understanding of people and their problems and his sincere searching  | for solutions was what made his ambassadorship so superb , yet there was no hint that he was seeking to build goodwill from a business angle ; he was only trying honestly to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would always promise , " I will send Dr. Heydekampf . " That satisfied everybody . The low overhead resulting from this dedicated three-man team idea , even with Southwark 's general overhead superimposed , was still low enough to favorably impress a management harassed by the grinding business depression . This had so decimated organizations that I was , for a time , my own stenographer . The time came in 1931 for Doc to return to Germany to marry . While there , he took a quick look around to see if Europe had anything new to offer , although we were still assimilating his original batch of ideas . When he returned to our Baldwin-Southwark team , he and his wife Elisabeth lived in a very modest apartment in Chester , Pa. , within walking distance from the plant . Dr. von Heydekampf 's free consulting services and educational work did not build up traveling expenses nearly as fast as it built good will , so there was no attempt to curtail it even in the deep depression of the early 1930 's , especially since the Testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , Doc and I were both proud of the fact that we were low-expense account people , and our educational work made expensive advertising unnecessary , except for convention exhibits . Sad parting came at the close of 1933 when Doc went to Germany to take up his executive job with Opel , where he was going to be paid what he was worth . Thereafter , on all of his trips to Detroit for official General Motors conferences , he stopped by to see how things were going , though he was drawing away from materials testing rapidly . He was trapped in Germany by the start of World War II ; when Opel was isolated from General Motors , he became President of the Henschel Locomotive Works of Kassel . After the war 's end when we could reach him again , he was President of a German automotive company , NSU Werke in Neckarsulm , maker of the Printz car and developer of the NSU-Wankel engine , a revolutionary fourcycle internal combustion engine operating without pistons , connecting rods , crankshafts , or valves , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. licensee is Curtiss-Wright . When Dr. von Heydekampf left the scene , the spark of our brief scientific interlude slowly died out ; the ideas he fathered were crowded out by the pressures of the " here-and-now , " and we have only the fine letters from him to remind us of that transient golden day .  | My involvement in exotic instrumentation came to an end when Dr. von Heydekampf went back to Germany . I quickly discovered that I was not a scientist but just a materials testing engineer . My recent show of brilliance evidently had been not my own but a reflection from Heydekampf ; without his presence to rescue me from difficult technical situations , I was in trouble . This change in direction had its favorable factors . My regular strain gage and testing machine business , when removed from the shadow of the esoteric materials sciences , was actually more profitable than the latter , and furthermore I was pleased to note that I carried over from the Heydekampf era a small amount of residual prestige , enough to get me along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the strain gage and testing equipment business was proving out what we had dared to anticipate , that such businesses were depression-proof . Most of our industrial customers had fallen into a mood of self-pity , but a few courageous ones sought to utilize this period of low costs to further their work on new products , on the theory that some day the depression might come to an end . Universities and governments were far less given to panic , so I divided my time between these two . Somehow , the universities ' long dreams of equipping laboratories seemed to mature in timely fashion when prices were low . This yielded to several of them record bargains in large testing equipment , such as the University of California 's monumental 4,000,000 pound Universal Testing Machine with 10 feet clear between vertical columns , which called for a whole new building on the campus . One might say that , in such instances , Baldwin-Southwark almost always became involuntarily one of the main contributors to the university 's testing machine fund ; I can scarcely recall a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monsters . We wistfully comforted ourselves with the thought that part of our pay was taken in beneficial , dignified advertising . Students would undoubtedly be imbued with the romance of our name and , as they were the next generation of engineers , we wanted them to know us kindly . 127  | In circulating among universities , I used to rebuke myself for allowing Baldwin-Southwark to pay my salary and expenses while enjoying such a pleasant life . The engineering staffs of universities were a multitude of hospitable hosts providing unforgettable visitations , studies and social events that extended even to their homes and families . This continuing series of pleasant relationships combined delightfully informal friendships with the sharing of information , ideas and philosophies . While I was telling them all I knew of testing and instrumentation , they were greatly broadening my field of knowledge , even into agricultural engineering . With such warm intellectual sociability , it was easy to remain young at heart . When not enjoying the hospitality of the universities , I moved about in the Washington , D. C. , technical underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good time to advance their testing and development work . Among the government people , friendship and informality also persisted . Those whose duties assigned them to research , testing , and specification writing welcomed me because I could bring late information gleaned from my travels and contacts in many places . I was so eternally busy and optimistic about the good outlook for business in my line , which was also theirs , that it breathed a hope for a better future for them all . I sought to serve as a traveling news bureau , carrying word of the engineering advancements in laboratories around the country , which was actually the early unfolding of the scientific era to come . In visits to universities my attitude was that of a relaxed observer of the engineering enlightenment , managing always to be on hand when I could be of help , but in visits to Washington it was somewhat different . Here I was like a dog looking for a rabbit ; they used to call it " nosing around . " What I was really looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just beginning to take form . In my curiosity I did not miss any quiet areas or dark corners , because these were often the hiding places of the best treasures , the biggest plans , and the incubators of the biggest specs . Sometimes , in a fit of exuberant goodwill , our Washington representative and myself would go up and down the corridors of the Navy Building opening every door in succession to see who was behind it and what might result . This brought many adventures in friendship , where the occupants of offices either did not mind the intrusion , enjoying our make-believe embarrassed confusion , or were glad of the interruption . Sometimes we discovered longlost friends and more often we made new ones , this being easier the higher the rank of those we encountered . There was always the chance that each could learn something from the other , remembering , however , that a good listener is remembered more fondly than a talker . I had noted the same reaction in the universities . When looking for cer-  | tain professors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were teaching , and often ended up lecturing the class , by invitation , on materials testing . My father had always taught me that it was safe to go anywhere as long as you acted as though you belonged there ? nobody would mind as long as you left the scene quickly and easily . Another instance of blundering into impossible places and emerging unscathed was at Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford , Connecticut . A company guide was showing me around when we came to Mr. Igor Sikorsky 's private office . I had been studying Russian at Berlitz School , because at one time before the international cleavage , Baldwin was planning to send me to Russia to promote testing machines . I liked to practice my Russian on every opportunity and I felt an irresistible impulse to talk Russian to Mr. Sikorsky , so I just opened his door and walked in , contributing to the fright of my guide . I found myself in a top level staff meeting and tried to act unflustered . So I stepped up to Mr. Sikorsky , at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying to meet him and wondered if he would mind my addressing him in Russian . He laughed cheerfully and introduced me to all present . My Russian must have been satisfactory because he soon dismissed the staff meeting and offered to show me around . He said he did not mind the interruption because the meeting was getting sticky and he thought I seemed so " innocent of harm . " In Washington , the object was to keep moving through the working areas of all departments , sticking close to the " grass roots , " knowing that if one place was not feeling a need for new equipment , I would at least be told of some other department that was . Thus , one thing always led to another , and following clues like a detective never failed to turn up a prize of some kind . I had been early taught that , when selling to industry , be sure to start at the top where , in a relaxed environment , a pleasant , unsuspicious and nontechnical welcome could usually be had . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all doors opened when you could say , " The President told me to see you before I left . " In Washington , preferred practice was quite different . There , one started with the laboratory staff and worked up through the supervisors to the man charged with the vexing duty of writing specifications , moving meticulously through " channels " in a manner unhurried and noncompetitive . When visits were timed properly , and timing was important , need for equipment would be freely revealed . The laboratories welcomed information as to actual performance of equipment currently available on the market and wanted to know how its maximum capabilities could be specified in writing without establishing a " proprietary specification , " yet not straying too far from the preferred equipment . The hardened specification writer , whose  | thankless job was always difficult any way you looked at it , sought to make his composition a beautiful as well as factual piece of literature , dignified , uncontroversial yet slyly pointing at what the laboratory said they wanted . We enjoyed our grave and serious human relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing job to do . They were masters of precise wording , demanding answers to the questions , " How much , how rigid , how accurate , how fast ? " We tentatively counted these people our friends . We put them on our informal calling list and humbly presented ourselves from time to time , even when we had nothing more to talk about than the state of weather , of business or of health . When we had business matters to talk about , we confined ourselves to unprejudiced information on " attainable performance " without saying where it was attainable . We suggested that , so long as the originating laboratory had insisted that such performance was what they needed , bidding could be made competitive by adding that last-resort escape clause " or equal " so that the specification could be reckoned as suitable for competitive bids . This left only the riddle as to what was " equal " when the bids were in . It was always fondly hoped that those people unable to compete even on the " or equal " basis would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bidders who might be shy on certain items of performance could still contend with the " or equal " clause by extensive " explanations " or they could take blunt " exceptions , " indicating their extreme displeasure if it might be found that these exceptions were not considered right and valid . The nice thing about performance specifications was that they could be so easily checked for compliance by " acceptance tests . " Some acceptance tests became highly involved , so a description of the exact manner of carrying them out was often carefully described . I refer especially to such items as accuracy of load indication and recording ; deformations of the machine frame under off-center loads of maximum severity ; measuring sensitivity ; hysteresis ; speed of response of the indicating system ; and other equally sensitive details . When government procurement activities increased as time went on , the wide-ranging vigilance and the rapid movements needed to maintain all points of contact were more than one man could handle , no matter how hard he worked . The next move was to write an agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help cover our contacts in Washington . This was before representation to the government became such a firmly established science . Our new representatives were old-timers in government service and knew all the channels from " grass roots " to top side . " their job was only to inform me when and where testing equipment and strain gages were being  | first thought about . Our Washington representatives did not need fine technical talking points , facts , or figures ; that was my job when notified . I certainly enjoyed working with these three " pros . " They were comfortable , easy-going pathfinders , apparently tireless and equipped with some sort of directional equipment . Mr. Nichols , the chief scout for our line , was the author in his quiet way of a statement that at times seemed very applicable , " I would quit this business tomorrow except that I want to stick around just to see what is going to happen . " As joint composer with Nichols , I established a specification for the ideal vendor : 1 . Try to be everywhere at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for not remembering yours . 3 . Always try to bring with you good news , new technical information and imaginative ideas . Get news , not gossip , from one place and take it to another . 4 . Let your customers educate you by the work they are doing . This will keep you on the forefront of knowledge . ( This is how I was educated in experimental stress analysis in aeronautics . I listened to everyone who would talk to me and stimulated their talking by enthusiastic response . From this was assembled facts from many sources to point out what had to be done to make strain gages of greatest value in aeronautics . I never originated anything ? just stored the facts that were presented gratuitously. ) 5 . At conventions of technical societies , the values that count most are not on the program . You can read the technical papers to better advantage later , so do n't spend too much time sitting in meeting rooms . Take every opportunity to exchange thoughts and feelings , ideas , opinions and experiences with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical sessions with low resistance . 6 . Do n't try to be " Diamond Jim Brady " by seeking to overwhelm prospective customers with lavish entertainment and personal charm . Substitute , instead , integrity and useful knowledge and be self-effacing . When there is a question of whether to listen or talk , listen , because you can never learn anything while talking . Too much proffered entertainment begins to look like the purchase price for favor . This is not so popular with the high type of people encountered in the engineering and scientific world . 7 . Be not a salesman type , but be a student or a teacher as the occasion demands . Above all , be humble , not a show-off , because what you are will eventually show in your face for anybody to read and decide whether or not to trust you . Thoreau wrote that your thoughts are continuously sculpturing your face . 8 . Love your competitors , but beat them by quality , price , and delivery .  | Do n't try to beat them with ugly words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the customer says he will buy , do n't hang around ? get out quickly , the customer has work to do , he has made his decision . During these desperate depression days , the centers of activity in engineering progress and testing seemed to reside in the Experimental Model Basin of the Bureau of Ships at the Washington Navy Yard ( later established in its new plant at Carderock , it was named The David Taylor Model Basin ) , and also in The Naval Aircraft Factory at the Philadelphia Navy Yard . Others were The Navy Bureau of Aeronautics offices in Washington , the Army Air Corps establishment at Wright Field , and The National Bureau of Standards . It may be appropriate to recall a few early adventures in experimental stress analysis and testing in a few of these . Lieutenant Lloyd Harrison ( later Admiral Harrison ) was projecting fullscale testing of airplane structures at Naval Aircraft Factory . He mounted the airframe upside down in a structural steel loading frame ; tension pads had not yet appeared in laboratories . He utilized hydraulic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve ( the general idea is still employed in static tests today ) . Sometimes cables and winches , or shot bags , were used for dead weights . Applied loads were sensed with reluctance gages or " inductor telemeters . " These were mounted in loop dynamometers and on tension bars ; this was in the days before we had bonded strain gage transducers . Other ingenious dynamometers were developed by Henry Sang of the Naval Aircraft Factory , a gifted inventor and also a gifted music lover , though which side of him predominated we never found out . The Sang load pick-ups were " C " loop dynamometers reading on dial gages and adjustable in many ways to add charming versatility . These earliest full-scale structural static tests used anything and everything attainable to read strain . Taking strain readings was much more demanding upon the data taker than the later panel board system , which electrically collected readings from remote bonded gages and carried them to some comfortable location . With Huggenbergers , Whittemores , dial gages , scratch gages , electric carbon pile telemeters and induction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operator 's agility and endurance . Such aeronautical structures tests , both static and dynamic , were carried on so extensively , and my association with them was so close and continuous , that Lieut . Harrison was justified in saying unsmilingly , " I kept your business and you alive through the whole depression . " This also made it easy for me to forgive him , when one Sunday , visiting my home , he surveyed my beautiful tree plantation , which I have mentioned before , and made the laconic comment , Out in Oregon where l come from , we cut things like these down with mowing machines . "  | Drop tests of airplanes were next in order , calling for electric pressure gages for the Oleo gear , together with accelerometers and deflection transducers mostly made with the inductor telemeters and slide wires . The airplane , falling from prescribed heights , was dropped mainly as a test of the landing gear . With travel of the pistons in the hydraulic gear and the fluid pressures , accelerations and forces recorded simultaneously by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic tests with an organized instrumentation program . There was an insistence upon 5 per cent or better accuracy checked by calibration after calibration in test after test to be sure that the data were good . Landing gear manufacturers were the most interested spectators , because here was their chance to set standards for equipment that was a very sensitive part of every airplane . Lieutenant Harrison was a working type of director . When big tests were on , he was standing right beside the test structure . I was standing right beside the Lieutenant . Thus when there was any equipment failure , he did not have to talk very loud to have his complaints heard . He knew that when I knew that he was keeping me and my business alive in the depression , he was going to get the liveliest action in keeping the equipment working , from strain gages and recorders to the hydraulic load maintainers . They were all my responsibility as at that time there was no competitive instrumentation . I was under test as much as the airplane . Lieutenant Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words , but when words were needed they were strong ones and picturesque . I often thought his silence was more frightening than his words , but there grew up an unspoken undercurrent of comradeship between us . I knew that he knew how far he could go before I perished from overexertion in obeying his commands or died of fright . I was sorry to see him move on to other fields , as do all Naval officers as soon as they have become well set in a job . His successor , Commander R. D. MacCart , was in his special way just as enjoyable . As Chief Engineer , he approached the airplane stress problem as if he enjoyed it , though he spent less time on the test floor than had Lieutenant Harrison . Instead , he pushed the expansion of facilities that led to environmental testing , the sub-zero room , the embryonic hot-test equipment , and the programmed random loading of structures . The advent of the tension pad allowed the airplane to be loaded right-side up , which was easier for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into sharp focus , such as Principal Engineer John Kean ( he became Technical Director of the Aircraft Structures Laboratory ) , Aeronautical Engineer henry Sang ( a man of many talents ) , and Robert Heinlein ( he became a science fiction writer and his stories appeared iii The Saturdays Evening Post ) . It was no wonder that a man exposed to this kind of work would take  | to science fiction writing when they were hearing of such things as the guided missile with the television camera in its nose so that it could be directed to the target by a man at home base watching a television screen . Then again there was the programming of random loading actuated by running steel balls of different sizes down a chute . I was tempted to take up science fiction writing myself instead of merely composing dull testing equipment sales bulletins . Imagination of the purest kind was beginning to show in aeronautical technology , and it , one day , took on a new name as it became more unbelievable , " Astronautics . " This meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonplace flights of fancy do n't stop at the stars ; there is no limit and no more excitement because we are gradually losing our sense of childish wonder . In 1943 , the Naval Aircraft Factory became part of the Naval Air Materiel Center . As time went on , an officer I admired very much became commanding officer . He was Admiral Rico Botta , who continued to stimulate my imagination with such ideas as expressed in a talk he gave to the SESA at Drexel Institute . He pictured future wars in the air as so destructive of its own weapons that nations could not afford such contests unless they built aircraft in the manner of automotive-type conveyor-belt mass production with die-cast engines , forged wings , super-simplification of cockpit instrumentation and other exhilarating short cuts and money savers , many of which ideas were later given hard thought by the industry . The expensive ways of making aircraft of that time would make it impossible to attain the ideal of " throw-away type " flying machines like our " throw-away " bonded strain gages that so fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aircraft because Project Fox was then well under way , perfecting radio-controlled " drones " for unmanned flight . Project Fox had memories for me ; it represented my head-on collision with NAMC and its commanding officer , which changed the course of strain gage instrumentation . Around the structures laboratory there were whispers of radio transmission of strain gage signals as a part of Project Fox . First there was talk ; then I saw a working model that looked unimpressive . C. W. Pierson , in charge of this work , called it " Telemetering " ( not to be confused with the carbon pile Electric Telemeter of earlier days ) . Pierson introduced me to W. D. Macgeorge , who seemed to have a conveyor belt mind for producing original ideas in both mechanics and electronics . In my enthusiasm , I committed the supreme error of hiring Macgeorge away from Project Fox to set up a strain gage instrumentation development laboratory for which I had obtained the approval of Baldwin 's President , Mr. Ralph Kelly . ' this brought the official wrath of NAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macgeorge was " the best there was " in electronics . Quiet , re-  | tiring Macgeorge had never run afoul of an angry commanding officer before , so he wilted , but I was more familiar with this sort of thing and did not wilt . Apparently Macgeorge was more important to Project Fox than either he or I had thought . In my desire to avoid the embarrassing details of this incident , I will only say that in spite of the fact that NAMC was my very best customer , and I would do almost anything for a good customer , nevertheless I hung on to Macgeorge . I do not know how I had the nerve to do it . I would do anything else the commanding officer wanted except join the Navy , which would have been no place for me with that stern and handsome officer feeling as he did . Macgeorge and I , in the same doghouse , realizing we had both done something very wrong , hastened to make amends that might repair the situation . This , we found , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the Telemetering project ourselves on a crash basis , guaranteeing to deliver it to the Navy , completely debugged , in time for the important drone tests at Cherry Point . To start this race with time we had first to build a temporary laboratory for Macgeorge . This we did in the form of a cinder-block appendage to the Baldwin materials testing laboratory , but we were in such a hurry that we neglected to include an entrance door . We found the only way we could get into our lab was through the Men 's Room of the Baldwin testing laboratory . This turned out to be better than we thought ; this new kind of concealed passage spared us from many curious but unwanted visitors . Macgeorge and three assistants worked so fast and efficiently that he did deliver two complex-wave modulators and two six-channel demodulator sets to feed commercial oscillographs at the Cherry Point tests . They did work well , even better , I am told , than units of other functions such as the Radar and the Control sets . The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct the pulling off of wings on fighter planes in power dives . The lives of many pilots were saved by the resulting structural improvements . The radar unit was to keep the diving plane and its attitude " in sight " and the control unit was to maneuver it , while our units were to read strains , accelerations , flexure and torsion during the dives . This is where , in the first tests , strain gage data came through well when radar and control units lost sight of the plane . These malfunctions , however , were quickly corrected . While Macgeorge was pushing his crash program on telemetering units , he found time , incidentally , to develop a 50-circuit single tube amplifier commutating unit for NAMC , which commutated 50 strain gages 20 times per second into an oscilloscope using a " stair-step sweep " so that dynamic signals from 50 strain gages appeared simultaneously side by side on the one oscilloscope screen . Ile also found time to build a two gun oscilloscope out of cannibalized parts and to work further on his differential trans- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into so many measurement applications . The latter was simply three small coils wound on a hollow ceramic spool . The primary coil , operating from 6 volts 60 cycles , was the middle coil ; the two flanking coils were bucking secondaries . Inside the spool was a movable core . Output in either direction was proportional to core movement . Thus it served ideally as an extensometer or deformation indicator having about 50 times the output of a bonded strain gage but , of course , lacking the speed of response of the strain gage . As far as we knew , back in 1943 and 1944 , these were all " firsts " in the field of " working " instrumentation . With this temporary laboratory going so well at such a fast tempo , the word got around in the company , so Baldwin sought to expand our operations and facilities . The original four-man team , which we called " ideas into action , " practically without organization or regulation or high-level supervision , attained achievements way out of proportion to its size and cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unregulated smallness : Macgeorge would come to work almost daily with a practical idea , such as introducing the differential transformer into the extensometers and stressstrain recorders Peters was building for testing machines , replacing , to great advantage , the " break-and-make " contact system of the Templin recorder . This provided a smooth curve , with faster response , in place of the old step curve . Or he would bring in surprising ideas on transducers with pick-ups not only made with bonded wire gages , but with piezo-electric , inductance , capacitance , deposited metal , mechanical , but most ingenious of all , applications of differential transformers as pick-ups . He developed testing machine control systems , gripping systems , recording systems and just " devices " that were so attractive that Mr. Kelly , Baldwin 's President , became so interested that he set up a special shop to produce some of these commercially . The patent department worked overtime . When Macgeorge would come in with an idea ( we wondered when he had time to rest ) , he would turn it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day or two would put working drawings into the hands of instrument maker-machinist Walter Fitch who , without slacking in tempo , would quickly turn out a prototype or working model . The team worked smoothly , quietly and fast with nobody supervising or interfering , everyone seeming to be enjoying themselves as though they were working on personal hobbies . At the end of this informal production line , I was picking up the prototypes and running with them to the shop , the patent department , the sales department or the management , whichever seemed forms , requisitions , ansv%ering questions or even telephones , so we  | got them a business manager , Scott Thompson , who kept them free from annoyance so they could work in peace . Mr. Kelly was so pleased with his spontaneously sprouting instrument business that he envisioned it as a new product diversification , a need for which had been in his mind since the steam locomotive business began slacking off . He volunteered to expand the laboratory and its staff and prepared for it a new location in a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our new research and development men included Herman Schaevitz brought in from the Philadelphia Navy Yard and who later founded Schaevitz Engineering near Camden , N. J. , Ed Capuzzi who later set up Polyphase Instrument Co. of Bridgeport , Pa. , Ben Bertolet who went on to bigger things in Milton Roy Pump Co. , Doc Moore who came from Ohio but , after leaving us , moved up into Leeds &; Northrup research , and others no less competent . It was here noted that the bigger the laboratory and staff grew the slower the pace of creative output , but this is nature 's way . The reason for the universal departure of all good men from the laboratory simultaneously was that a change in company policy abolished it on short notice . It had been a good training school , and all who graduated were quite successful elsewhere . For instance , take Herman Schaevitz ; he was captivated by the differential transformer and went out to make it the basic product of a business that grew like weeds . He gave it the special name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the first of these instrument business men that started small but in no time was big and expanding . He still is bigger and more expanding . Many engineers and scientists with good ideas and good engineering have prospered in business for themselves , but many others have not . They have sold out or gone broke because they did not realize the over-riding importance of ample working capital and a strong sales capability . Scientists turned business managers found out that a well-engineered good idea was not enough in this so highly competitive technical world unless they assigned high priority to the tiresome subdivisions of business management . Looking back over this garden of budding measuring devices , well fertilized with the enthusiasm of a young and pioneering technology , I sought the viewpoints of others who had been mixed up in the activity in the same way that I had , in order to reinforce my impressions of it all . I asked John Kean , a leader in these activities and recently retired Director of the Aircraft Structures Laboratory of the Naval Air Experimental Station ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some notes on the panorama as he saw it . 11ere is an abstract of what I received from him : 1932-1935 . The age of extensutneters , of little use in aircraft research . 1935-1936 . The dawn of the age of the strain gage ( brit it was a cloud ) .  | morning ) . For dynamic work , the deForest scratch gage ; for high accuracy static test , the Tuckerman Optical . ( Kean overlooked the Huggenberger. ) 1936-1939 . Research in aeronautical structures began to develop other channels , such as corrosion. 1940-1945 . Flight and dynamic testing supplemented static testing . Hinge fittings , landing gears and interplane struts were gaged . Bonded resistance strain gages were not completely trusted , so deForest scratch gages were used where possible , as a check , to read maximum strain . Resistance gages gradually proved trustworthy and became the heart of research in structures under subsonic conditions . The effort staggered along but kept going forward . 1946-1948 . Magnesium and titanium had been used in structural components that were mechanically connected to aluminum and steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is evidenced by the many aircraft failures that went completely unexplained or quite inadequately excused . Acquistion of data relating to the time rate of incidence of load , its magnitude and frequency , required the analyzing of thousands , perhaps millions of records to answer the questions : How much , how fast , how often ? Trends for particular aircraft were sought from the records , and from these trends general conclusions were drawn that were virtually laws . A million strain gages were needed , and it was hoped that they would be so stable that they would become the standards of measurement that they were intended to be . 1948-1955 . The matter of heat entered the problem of measurement . Heat energy is just as deleterious to the strain gage as it is to the structure upon which it is installed , so the need calls for a gage unaffected by heat . Faltering steps in this direction have been taken , but because of the myopic view taken by researchers , little has been accomplished . ( Kean should have blamed most of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this time . ) It must have been 15 years since the writer ( John Kean ) had first set down the modest requirements for a high temperature strain gage. 1955-1963 . I have no way of knowing how space vehicles are instrumented for strain , but I am certain it is not reasonably satisfactory . A completely new approach would be more productive than depending upon room-temperature strain gage experience . Thus ends John Kean 's notes on history , from which it is evident that he was not pleased with progress in his time , nor was I. Back in about 1951 John was beginning to have high temperature testing problems and was setting forth to contract for the enormous , costly installation necessary to program structural heating with ( : I ? ; Quartz Lamps , folloing pioneer work done at Vti'right I i ( ( Id . When he felt he had the heat generation in hand , he  | turned to high temperature measurement problems and reactivated his " griping " to me about strain gages . I told him to write it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to see if I could raise research money . We had been flirting feebly with the idea at Baldwin , but it was evident that real bundles of money were going to be needed , more than the amount of prospective business warranted . Extensive metallurgical research , ceramics research , fine welding research and explorations of other methods than bonding would be required . Private industry could not afford this kind of money because there was not enough business in sight to pay for the start of such program . Kean did write a letter , a short and pungent one , that became a fuse to launch a lot of powerful action . I took Kean 's letter in my hand and sought money outside of government but without arousing interest much less desire . Bureau of Aeronautics at Washington was also unmoved but suggested the Office of Naval Research . I took Kean 's letter and visited ONR in the Navy Building and , by following clues in accustomed manner , found at last the man who could make a decision , subject to high approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my good fortune to have known him when he had been in charge of things , a few years before , at Naval Air Experimental Station , NAMC , Philadelphia . When R. L. Kinney , our Washington man , and myself entered his office he was just leaving for lunch . He suggested I come another day . We felt so forlorn that we said we thought we would just sit down and wait until he came back . He said he might not be back until late . We said we would wait anyhow , all day and all night if necessary , because our mission was killing us , so we picked out two old chairs in the outer office and sat miserably down . This must have touched the Captain 's heart ; when he found out we were not even going out to lunch , he ordered his Chief Yeoman , who was a nice girl in an attractive Naval uniform , to heat some soup on the coffee burner and feed us . When he saw us hungrily go at the soup he decided he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We told our story , showed him Kean 's letter , and asked for a small research contract . Captain Burr , an experienced Naval flyer , though when head of NAES he did land his plane in a swamp south of the Philadelphia Navy Yard but so skillfully that he walked away from it , agreed with the need for high temperature research and said he would try for a small allotment . He told me my work was done , he would do the selling up top from now on . He got us a $10,000 contract and put the project in the hands of Mr. Alfred Lundquist of ONR Technical Office to administer . When John Kean heard of this , he took the matter up with his BuAer Washington office and they then added an equal amount to the project , for I had found out that just to publish the report of the research in accordance with the requiren ? nts of ONR would cost almost $10,000 . BuAer 's ten  | thousand gave us some working capital , but I soon found it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oak Ridge National Laboratory , I found out that the Atomic Energy Commission was also interested in high temperature strain gages . I asked W. D. Manly to get me some research money to throw into the pot . He asked , " How much have you got now ? " When I told him he said he would try for $10,000 also . I asked him if he would throw in with ONR and BuAer because there was not enough money for two separate researches and two reports . He said he never heard of such a thing as interagency research but he would try . He soon reported that the idea was not acceptable to AEC , and I had not even asked ONR yet . I told Manly I would ask his Washington office if he would tell me whom to see , and also write me of his need for high temperature measurement . When thus armed , our attorney from Baldwin , Ed Hathaway , and I in one day visited AEC headquarters , ONR and BuAer . We were able to overcome the shock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we had only one effective argument , namely , all three allotments were just about enough to start something in high temperature gages and write one report for all . It was granted by all that the investigation was very necessary , and if we could get it started perhaps the various agencies could carry on to a conclusion under their own power . The reports could serve as a launching platform for formal research , gathering together all thinking that had been done thus far . The objectives of all three sponsors were different : ONR wanted a report but not working gages ; AEC wanted working gages and the report was incidental ; BuAer wanted both . Since ONR dealt mostly with universities , we were to assume the role of a university and follow their customs . Among other things , this required a monthly progress report . Since I was carrying out my regular work for Baldwin and conducting this research in my spare time , I did not get around to writing regular monthly reports . In fact I wrote only one . Noting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . I explained my situation by asking him , " Which do you want , research or progress reports ? I ca n't do both in my crowded circumstances . " This brought him up to Baldwin for a meeting . When he saw what I had done to date with so little money spent , he agreed , " Washington is sinking into the Potomac under the weight of progress reports . I guess we can do without yours . " Let me say one more thing about research contracts . Visits to Wright Air Development Center at Wright-Patterson AFB , Ohio , disclosed that they had heard about my AI ' : ( ' contract . WAD ( : wanted high temperature strain gages as much as anvbodv , maybe more so . I prompt I% asked them for a research contract like the others , to throw into the pot because I %%as running  | out of working money . At first this idea looked attractive , but after finding the Navy so much involved , they insisted on a separate research project and sat down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making things more formal than in the current subsistence contracts . " Is Navy your enemy ? " I asked . Our eventual bid was based on a realistic cost of doing what they called for . It seemed that whenever I bid on anything to the government , they always told me that my project did not rate major outlays of money , so I began to wonder what kind of investigation was considered " top drawer . " Anyhow , WADC turned me down but settled for a lesser and more informal investigation at a cost slightly higher than each of the others that we were working on . Altogether , my four allotments totalled less . than $50,000 . This was not much as research contracts go , since my assignment was to comb the world for ideas and then make a museum full of sample gages with test reports attached , all compiled in two formal reports , one for combined AEC , ONR and BuAer and one for WADC alone . Baldwin handled the business and accounting end for me , but as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . My plan differed from most sponsored research projects . I knew most of the people around the world who were either thinking about high temperature gages , wanted to think about them , or who were already dabbling in ideas , so I went after them all either by personal calls or letters or cables . I offered them modest subcontracts , dividing up all my available funds less a sinking fund for publishing the two reports . I accumulated about 36 very diversified and competent subcontractors , but the man from whom I expected the most and who later followed up with the greatest energy , Bill Bean , said he was too busy . He agreed to work when he felt inspiration at a later date but not as a subcontractor . He said he did things best that he liked to do , when he liked to do them , and being paid for doing research was not as effective in getting results as in letting him work when the spirit moved him and without rules and regulations . In this he sounded like Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to schedule , and Greer Ellis was another , but when they did something that the spirit moved them to do , it was a true innovation and a major one at that . It would take a better specialist in human nature than I am to regiment genius , so I did not press Bill Bean . There were certain of the subcontractors who , in the interest of science , contributed their reports without asking any financial return . Armour Research Foundation was one , and their generosity was later rewarded by award of a contract from Naval Air Experimental Station sponsored by John Kean for the development of high temperature strain gage alloys . This research produced two metallic materials of superior high temperature performance in wires and foils.  | None of the subcontractors saw very much actual money because the fees paid for reports and work varied from $100 to a rare few at $2000 . I think that all my subcontractors gave me bargains in accepting low reimbursement for intensive effort . When I submitted my final report to the Office of Naval Research , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stated that this was the most research for the money they had ever seen , and they invited me to lunch as their guest in the Navy Building Dining Room . The ONR-AEC report was listed for public sale by the Dept. of Commerce , Office of Technical Services , Washington 25 , as AECU 3003 , entitled " Summary Report on High Temperature Strain Gage Research . " The date of publication was January , 1955 . The ONR-AEC report had cost me more to print than I had budgeted and I was running out of money , so I appealed to Mr. Lundquist at ONR for a little help . When he saw how big the report was , he agreed that I needed it and did help me secure enough residual funds to pay the printers ' bill , which in itself was deemed very reasonable . This maintained the informality with which my research relationship with the Government had persisted . After 1956 , visits were made with Bill Bean to many high temperature strain gage users , notably NACA at Langley Field and McDonnell Aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bean had evolved . Although he had not contributed to the research reports , he had become a leading developer of practical methods , techniques and equipment for high temperature strain gage application , that is , so far as I could see , so we offered his aid to interested customers , often gratis . Among the earliest high temperature cements closely following Sauercisen , was the Quigley Green Paint . Prof. Ruge tells the story that when he was looking around for high temperature cements he heard of this Quigley Paint and bought some as a routine exploration . It worked well so Ruge went back for more . This second lot may have been all right as a green paint , but it was not a refractory cement , so Ruge wanted to know why . It turned out that the first lot was a bad batch of paint that escaped rejection ; the second lot , a poor cement , was rated a good batch of paint . Ruge asked for some more bad batches , but nobody at Quigley could remember how they had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . assigned a priority to a study of bad batches and finally came up with a good high temperature cement that you could have in either green or blue .  | Going back to the early 1940 's before entering the wonder-working world of high and low temperatures , I then thought aeronautics had attained its peak when strain gages recorded flight tests of aircraft . The first big " total measurement " job of this kind that I had encountered was on the landing tests of the Douglas B-19 . At Lockheed I was there when they fired the cannon in the twin-tailed P-38 in flight and did another total measurement study , reading miles of oscillograph records to prove that it was possible to do what they had already done . That was when strain gage load , pressure and acceleration transducers made their complete and magnificent debut in flight . While this was going on in California , the Naval Aircraft Factory at Philadelphia was doing their share to keep the East versus West race going . In 1943 Dave Weiss and Christian Weeber were junior physicists at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testing Equipment Section . He was assigned to carry out a " total measurement " test on the Chance Vought gull-wing F4U fighter plane for use on aircraft carriers . To see if it could be safely catapulted , they cemented bonded strain gages all over the airplane , on the towing bridle , on the arresting hook and on the catapult structure itself , together with many accelerometers . This test delighted the Navy with its first reliable quantitative data on loads applied by the catapulting mechanism and was received with much interest by the Bureau of Aeronautics Structures Office in the Navy Building in Washington . This led to many visits to Commander Conlon and his engineering staff . which was then a great concentration of aeronautical theory , practice , inquisitiveness and search , with a paramount interest in strain gage applications . Since this office was virtually my second home in Washington , I had such a homing instinct that when marooned in some distant places like Dayton , Dallas or Wichita and needing an air travel priority to get back East , I would wire Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any reason , he needed me ; if so please dispatch a priorit Sometimes he did , for we always had things to talk  | about in structures . His was an enthusiastic group that never failed to display lively interest in any new thoughts I could drag in . There were other people in Washington also interested in structures . The Bureau of Ships viewed structures testing from a different engineering angle . In 1931 , the Experimental Model Basin at the Washingtion Navy Yard was one of the hardy pioneers in experimental stress analysis , rivaling the Army Air Corps and the Bureau of Aeronautics . In 1933 , Model Basin purchased a 600,000-pound Southwark-Emery testing machine for testing structures , components and assemblies of certain critical configurations . For this , the machine required six feet clear space between upright columns . Commander Harold E. Saunders , who had been number one man of his class at the Naval Academy , lovingly fathered this very diligent testing center . One would have thought that the Model Basin was racing the aeronautical laboratories for first prize in full-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to fast build up of information , methods and equipment . Commander Saunders wrote the most all-embracing specification of all time , covering 48 typewritten pages of performance and acceptance test procedure . He was looking far beyond anything available and so he advanced testing machine concepts by giant steps . He was determined to obtain equipment that would not share a margin of error with the test structure . To insure getting exactly what he needed he called a conference of prospective bidders and read them his rules , namely , that his specifications represented his exact minimum needs , nothing less would be tolerated , so bidders were permitted no exceptions . Any item falling short would call for rejection of the whole because the performance of the machine was the sum of the performance of its components . A rejected machine would be ordered removed at the expense of the bidder . My company , Baldwin-Southwark , was the only one daring to meet this challenge . In spite of the fact that business conditions were in the depths of depression and bidders were starving , nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical , he was able to get the approval of the Chief of the Bureau of Ships , the Judge Advocate General of the Navy , and the Secretary of the Navy to place a proprietary order with Baldwin at cost , including installation , plus fixed fee not exceeding 5 per cent with all cost sheets and overhead schedules to be submitted to the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts . This machine was built by foremen at Baldwin , because it was the on big piece of equipment going through the shops , With its I inery Weighing System it passed all tests hotly before arid alter installation in the Washington Navy lard , including the structural tigtdits test , It seas  | immediately put to work on full-scale structural studies from submarine rings to welded wide plate . It was used in seeking the cure for brittle fractures in welded ships , in cooperation with the Ships Structures Committee , which many will remember . Supplemented by DeGarmo 's work with strain gages on welded plate at the University of California , and tests by Paul Ffield of Bethlehem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were found and cured , to the everlasting advancement of all-welded structures . This testing machine was later moved to the new David Taylor Model Basin at Carderock , Md. , with height added to the columns . It was here that outstanding developments in strain gage waterproofing techniques were initiated so that ships could go to sea with strain gages on the outer hulls . I remember particularly the hogging and sagging tests on the destroyers Preston and Bruce . These destroyers were set up on blocks in drydock , strain gaged and loaded to destruction . One was loaded as a simple beam ( sagging ) and one was supported in the center ( hogging ) . The Model Basin became one of the largest and most proficient users of bonded strain gages . Their test results were put into immediate practical use . The David Taylor Model Basin kept expanding to include both wind and water tunnels , and an underground water chanber where the effect of depth bomb shock waves on submarine hull components was tested , picking up pressures on tiny sacks of carbon particles furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , over which ran a high speed towing carriage equipped with a Baldwin three-component weighing system ( drag , yaw and pitch ) . There were extensive mechanical and structural testing laboratories , and other mysterious rooms into which I never looked . During the war period the staff was probably the greatest aggregation of well known scientists and wise men ever gathered together outside of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . It was a veritable aristocracy of brains , because this was a testing man 's paradise . Commander ( now Captain ) Saunders ruled over this highly diversified study factory with quiet competence , pushing search and research ever forward and leaving orderly bundles of facts and discoveries in notebooks , like a hay baler leaves neat square bundles of hay on the tanner 's field . The Model Basin regulars like Doctors D. Windenberg , E. Wenk , E. E. Johnson and many others combined in a special way geniality with high intellectual exercise . I often felt that if I were to he connected with a laboratory under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would choose .
