Ghana 's President Kwame Nkrumah presents two faces when he deals with foreign investors . With one face he encourages them to come in and help Ghana grow ; with the other he winks at his trusted lieutenants , who talk darkly of nationalizing foreign enterprises . A favorite target has been the seven British-owned gold mines . From exports of $28 million in gold a year , the country gets a tenth of its income . <P> Last summer Nkrumah 's government passed a law granting a 14-a-day wage increase to gold miners . This wiped out the benefits of a subsidy the government was giving the shakier mines . The British owners threatened to close two of the mines , wiping out 2,000 jobs . Nkrumah countered last month by announcing a new bill , not yet passed , that called for a heavy fine and imprisonment on any mine operator who closed down without his permission . To mine owners , this looked like the first step toward nationalization and brought an immediate outcry . Major General Sir Edward L. Spears , chairman of Ashanti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines , and also chairman of Bibiani ( 1927 ) Ltd. , one of the marginal mines , warned Nkrumah that if he does not make it clear that he was not trying " to seize the mines without adequate compensation , no more outside capital will come into Ghana for mining or anything else . " <P> Last week Nkrumah changed his tack , decided that necessity is sometimes the mother of investment . To calm the fears of potential investors and save the miners ' jobs , he offered to buy the stock in five marginal mines for $14.7 million , almost twice its value on the London Stock Exchange , presumably to make certain that the offer would be accepted . Within 24 hours , the value of the stocks jumped over 100% . The relieved companies hailed the offer as a uniquely civilized way to nationalize industry , were certain that their 40,000 stockholders would grab the offer .
