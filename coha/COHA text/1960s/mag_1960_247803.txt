To non-Moslems , Arab leaders often seem more interested in bemoaning lost glories and nursing old grudges than in attacking the problems of the day . Last week Pakistan 's Moslem President Mohammed Ayub Khan arrived in Cairo and throwing away a diplomatically phrased set speech , delivered the sharpest criticisms of Moslems by a Moslem heard in many a year . <P> Ayub spoke plainly on his view of the long-festering problem of refugees along the Israeli border , where more than a million Palestinians-those who fled or were ejected by Israel , and the children born to them since-still inhabit squalid detention camps in Jordan , Syria and the Gaza Strip . The Arabs have let the U.N . look after them , arguing that to provide the refugees with permanent homes and jobs would seem to be acquiescing in the existence of Israel . Ayub remarked pointedly that after partition , his own Pakistan made room for 9,000,000 Moslem refugees from India , and did it without asking or expecting outside help in shouldering the cost . <P> Moslems should ask themselves , said Ayub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities are the most backward and most uneducated . " He answered his own question : Because the Islamic culture let slip its " earlier dynamism , " relapsed into " conformism , superficiality and superstition . " Said Ayub Khan : " The kingdoms and crowns which the Moslems have lost in the course of history are far less important than the kingdom of the free and searching mind , which they have lost through intellectual stagnation . " <P> Sharing the platform with him , Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser as usual blamed all the Moslem world 's problems on " imperialists . " Ayub disagreed . Parliamentary government failed in Egypt and Pakistan , he said bluntly , " through no fault of that system . I say , it was our fault . We were not yet ready . " <P> Later , when a Cairo journalist self-importantly asked what Afro-Asians might do to compel the big powers to get together to end the cold war , the Pakistan President said crisply : " The best thing we can do is to behave peacefully among ourselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans are not angels , you know .
