Meeting with reporters at his ranch home hear here , where he had come for a weekend vacation , the President mentioned Mr. Goldwater , the Republican Presidential nominee , by name in saying that he hoped the Republican party " will campaign in the same spirit " as the Democratic party on the issue of foreign relations and the quest for world peace . Question 8 , Page 56 . Mr. Goldwater , in his accept ' ance speech Thursday , said foreign policy would be the major issue of the 1964 political campaign .

Birchers and Klan Included Asked if he included the John Birch Society and the Ku Klux Klan in his indictment , Mr. Johnson declared : " I refer to all these organizations by whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread their venom . I am not one who believes that the end justifies the means . " Question 1 . Asked whether he thought Mr. Goldwater 's decision to make foreign policy a prime campaign issue would affect United States relations with other governments , the President said : " I am not in a position to honestly and accurately estimate what reaction other people may have to what some folks say . " I would hope that the other party will campaign in the same spirit , because I want to point out that what the Democrats think about Republicans , and what I might think about Senator Goldwater , is of secondary importance . " What is important , I think , is what each party thinks about America , and what the leader // ship of each party offers to the American people and to the rest of the world . " He said he believed the American people would weigh the statements of both nominees and determine " which man they , think would be the more respon- ; sible and more constructive and ; more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this world . " Today 's news conference was held in the blazing Texas sunlight on the lawn of the President 's ranch home , 60 miles west of here . He flew in by jet plane from Washington yesterday afternoon , followed a couple of hours later by a group of reporters and white house staff members aboard a chartered SOmmercial plane .

But the President also had a brief statement concerning racial violence , and answered several questions concerning the political outlook . In. his prepared statement , Mr. Johnson said that many reports came across his desk concerning organized violence " by small groups who mask their identity . " He said he condemned this kind of " savagery " as alien to the nation 's moral and political traditions . He promised Federal help to state and local governments who find themselves unable to cope with this sort of violence . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities to demonstrate peaceably In pursuit of their goals . ' A Hallowed Path ' With measured emphasis , Mr. Johnson declared : " To those seeking to secure their rights , the Constitution provides a hallowed and effective path . That is the path of peaceful petition and legal recourse , of free spech and free election . " Along that road have come , thoroughout our entire history , the great warriors in the battle to extend human freedom . Whre their cause was just , they have prevailed . As long as that road is open , those who wage daily struggle for civil rights have an obligation to follow it . " Many of those present today felt that the President was not only entreating Negro rights groups to practise restraint , but that he was also advising their white critics of the constitutional privileges of the minorities . He returned to this theme later during the question period . A reporter asked if he agreed with Governor Rockefeller of New York that statements by Mr. Goldwater had the effect of encouraging extremists groups to violence against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only opposed violence but that he also condemned anyone " playing upon the prejudices of the people of this country . " Question 2 . " I am not going to start passing personal opinions on the expressions of the other party and the other candidate at this point , because I think the American people can very well judge those matters themselves , " he declared , adding : " I certainly do n't want to get into any argument between members of the other party . They have their own . problems , and I am not going to spread any hate or rumors about them . " Mr. Johnson was asked to comment on Mr. Goldwater 's statement in his acceptance speech at San Francisco Thursday that violence in the streets was a proper area of Federal responsibility . The President responded by recalling that such police powers rest not with the Federal Government but with the states and localities .

Question 6 . Decided on Trip Late The President 's decision to come here for the weekend apparently was not made until after midday Friday . At that time , he invited reporters assembled for the regular . news briefing by his press secretary , George E. Reedy , into his oval office " for coffee and a chat , " most of which was for background purposes and off the record . He disclosed his intention to fly to his Texas ranch for the weekend to , as he put it , " soak up some sunshine and get a little work done . " He also agreed to hold a news conference . He was joined for the weekend by Mrs. Johnson , who had flown to Independence , Mo. , yesterday for a visit with former President and Mrs. Harry S. Truman and to inspect the Truman Library . Mr. Reedy said last night that the President was joined at the ranch shortly after his arrival Friday by Gov . John B. Connally of Texas , an old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had intended to go to Washington Friday on state business , but changed his plans when he learned that the President was coming home . The President 's decision to take a holiday this weekend was apparently prompted by the fact that this is likely to be the freest weekend he will have until late August .
