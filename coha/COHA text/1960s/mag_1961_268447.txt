To the big-league baseball scout , the ideal pitching prospect is a sturdy six-footer who can fire fastballs all through the long , hot afternoon . Such a pitcher was Iowa Farm Boy Bob Feller , who came off a sand lot at 17 and struck out 348 batters for the Cleveland Indians in 1946 . Such a pitcher also is moonfaced Michael Jones , a $3,000-bonus rookie who plays for Johnson City , Tenn. , a St. Louis Cardinals class D farm club . A rangy ( 6 ft. , 174 Ibs. ) right-hander with a smoky fastball , shy Mike Jones has yet another distinction : at 16 , he is the youngest player in organized baseball . <P> Jones is drawing $4,000 a year ( v. the major-league minimum of $7,000 ) , and is already a growing legend in St. Louis , where he began his baseball career as a grammar-school nine-year-old . One day in 1958 , while he was playing third base for the Brentwood Cardinals , a suburban St. Louis amateur team , the starting pitcher broke his leg , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked the first batter , struck out the next 18 , won the game-and became the team 's No . I pitcher . Over the next three seasons , he ran up such an impressive record that he attracted major-league scouts , among them a scout from the St. Louis Cardinals . <P> Before he could sign up with St. Louis , Jones had to get special permission from Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick , because he had not completed-or even started-high school . Classified as a " hardship case " ( he was helping to support his parents and eight brothers and sisters ) , Jones gave his bonus to his family and headed for the Cardinals ' spring training camp at Homestead . Fla .. where he worked out under the watchful eye of a farm system manager , Al Unser . " He would run until he got tired . " says Unser. " and then he 'd quit . We finally talked him into the idea that it was necessary for him to run a little harder . ' ' <P> In Johnson City , Coach Joe Lucco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike has a strong arm , " he explains , " but we 're just nursing him along . We do n't let him pitch more than 70 balls at a time . Then he gets four days of rest . " Object : to have Jones ready for the big league after several more seasons of seasoning . His coaches think that shy Mike Jones will make it .
