NEW HAVEN TUESDAY ART HUR SHAW arrived at the Yale Student Placement Bureau at eight-thirty in the morning . He makes it a practice to arrive at a placement office about half an hour before his first appointment , giving himself time to arrange his forms in a convenient spot on the desk , place his watch where he can glance at it quickly during an interview , and put his nameplate ? " Art Shaw , Dow " ? where students can see it , so they wo n't have to grope for his name . Also , he prefers to arrive before the demonstrators do . He expected some demonstrators at Yale . In the normal routine , a few days before a Dow Chemical Company recruiter is scheduled to arrive on a campus Shaw 's secretary phones the placement office to confirm the date and to find out how many students in each discipline have signed up for interviews . These days , just as routinely , Shaw , who is both a recruiter and the supervisor of recruiting for the Northeast , gets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demonstration is likely . flu asks about the university rules that will govern the demonstrators ' behavior , he makes certain that the university president has been informed , and he says , as diplomatically as possible , that although Dow will he happy to abide by any arrangements the university makes , it has been the recruiters ' experience that a demonstration often gets out of hand if the demonstrators are permitted inside the building . If it seems likely that there will he a particularly vehement demonstration , Shaw arranges for someone from Dow 's public-relations department to he present , thus permitting the recruiter to concentrate on his interviewing without distractions from reporters . Three campus policemen were standing just inside the door of the Yale Student Placement Bureau when Shaw arrived , but there were no demonstrators . Ordinarily , demonstrators are not certain enough of Shaw 's identity to say anything when he walks in anyway , although he looks suspiciously like a Dow recruiter . A serious-looking young man of twenty-five , with close-cropped red hair , he was wearing heavy horn-rimmed glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a striped tie . He had a wedding ring on one hand and a state-university class ring on the other , and he was carrying a gray fibre-glass attache case that looked almost too thin to hold anything . In the room assigned to him , on the ground floor of the placement office , Shaw and a university official cleared some supplies out so he could bring in a chair for the interviewees  --  the room considered least vulnerable to harassment from outside happened to be only five by eight  --  and Shaw arranged things on the desk to his satisfaction . Just before nine , a Student Placement official told him that pickets had gathered in front of the building ; there were about thirty-five of them , huddled under umbrellas against a cold drizzle that had begun to fall , and holding signs like " Better Dying Through Chemistry . " Shaw thanked his informant courteously , but he seemed only mildly interested . In half-hour interviews from nine to eleven , Shaw talked with four students about working for Dow . He called each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name often as  --  in a friendly but businesslike way  --  he asked about outside interests or outlined the first few years of a typical new employee in marketing or told of the pleasures of life in Midland , Michigan , where Dow has its corporate headquarters . The subject of demonstrations came up only at the close of an interview , when Shaw would smile and say that he hoped the student had n't had too much trouble getting in . Shaw 's last appointment before lunch was with a young man who had been described to him as the undergraduate leader of the Yale chapter of Students for a Democratic Society , but the S.D.S. man did not appear . Shaw joined two or three placement officials in a larger office and spent some time going through 1-stint 's of prospective summer employees with a woman in charge of summer placement ( who said that she had phoned the S.D.S. leader and informed him that not keeping appointments was had manners ) . There were still campus policemen in the hall , but someone said that the demonstrators had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the drizzle turned into a driving rain  --  and everyone seemed relaxed . Suddenly , flames shot up in the hallway outside the office . The placement officials rushed to the door . A wastebasket had been placed in front of the door , and its contents were blazing . A few feet from the basket stood a young man ? thin , blond , collegiately dressed . He had a book of matches in his hand . His face was slightly flushed . He looked rather frightened . " Why 'd you do this ? " a young assistant dean asked him , in a calm voice . " I 'm curious about the symbolism . " A campus policeman , looking perturbed , had dragged over an extinguisher and was putting out the fire . Shaw had remained inside the room . " Fire and fire , " the young man said . " I think the symbolism is pretty good . " AT lunch , the assistant dean told Shaw and a recruiter from a management-consultant firm that a talk with the young man had convinced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of symbolism , rather than as a way of harming anybody . " It was obviously an act of conscience , " the dean said . " He just felt he had to burn some Dow literature . He 's a nice kid . " Shaw did not seem as impressed by the symbolism as the dean was  --  a check before lunch had indicated that the fire consisted of all of the mechanical-and chemical-engineering booklets he had placed in the waiting room but he did n't disagree . " It 's funny , " the recruiter from the consulting company said . " We do a lot of consulting for the Defense Department . I guess nobody knows . " " Do n't let it out , " Shaw said . IN the afternoon , Shaw began an- other series of interviews  --  describing plant sites and travel requirements and salaries , and asking if there were any questions about Dow . " There 's one thing , " the first interviewee of the afternoon said , some what hesitantly , at the close of the interview . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth , is there a chance for a draft deferment , and so on and so forth ? " " Well , we 've been real successful so far in getting our people deferred , Dave , " Shaw said . " Both technical and non-technical . Of course , no company can guarantee anything on this . " The student looked impressed . Shaw 's schedule showed that the second appointment of the afternoon was with a Miss Alexander , a graduate student in American studies . She turned out to he a friendly-looking , dark-haired girl who began the interview by commiserating with Shaw on the weather he was having during his trip to New Haven . Shaw said he was just happy to be there . Then Miss Alexander said she was wondering why bona-fide , tuition-paying students had been refused entrance to the building by campus police , and Shaw said she would have to ask the university of-facials . " Could you tell me , Miss Alexander , " he went on , " if you 're interested in Dow workwise ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't doing something criminal , " she said . " I was wondering if a Dow employee could be prosecuted as a war criminal ten or fifteen years from now , under the precedent of Nuremberg . " She did n't sound at all angry . She had a slight smile on her face , like the fixed smile of a lady trying to be polite while having tea with peopk she does n't know very well . " I assume you 're talking about napalm , " Shaw said . " That , and crop defoliates , " 14liss Alexander said , almost pleasantly . Shaw said that he did n't consider the situation analogous to that of the manufacturers prosecuted at Nuremberg , and they spoke for a while about whether a distinction could be made between napalm and such weapons as tanks and guns  --  or between gas pellets for concentration camps and howitzers . " Ve are supplying the government with material , and the government dr.  - -  cides how to use it , " Shaw said . " 1 guess I 'm saying that Dow made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our government , and I support this . " " Do you think this is what the German manufacturers thought ? " " I do n't know what they thought , " Shaw said . His voice was even , and he did n't sound offended . " Let 's come back to Dow and you . Are you interested in Dow as an outlet for employ-ment ? " " I 'm interested in the moral position of working for Dow , " Miss Alexander said , and she handed Shaw a picture of a burned baby . " I 'm curious what goes through the head of a Dow employee when he sees some of these pictures . " Shaw said that while the picture was indeed horrible , war was horrible , and there was no pleasant way to die . " Do n't you think it 's different ? " Miss Alexander asked . " Do n't you think there 's a distinction when you use this against civilians " I guess I 'll have to say that the Secretary of Defense , Mr. McNamara , assures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Shaw said . " Does the company really believe this ? " Miss Alexander asked . She still had a polite smile on her face . " Well , Miss Alexander , " Shaw said , " I guess I can only say that I feel as an employee of Dow that we 're doing the right thing and that we 've made the right decision . I 'm proud to work at Dow . " Miss Alexander asked if there might ever he a time when Dow would dissociate itself from a government contract if the contract proved particularly repulsive , and Shaw said he could n't speak for the company in that area , since he was at Yale only to discuss specific employment . " Can you see any time that anything would he so repulsive to you personally that you could n't work there ? " she asked . " Well , that has n't come up , " Shaw said . " I have n't thought of it . I 'm not concerned about this possibility . I 'm not concerned . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to discuss , and he asked Miss Alexander if she would he interested in an application . " Yes , I would , " Miss Alexander said , politely . " And , in case you do n't have the S.D.S. statement , I 'll leave You this . " She smoothed out a mimeographed sheet that she had read from at one point during the interview  --  it was entitled " Dow 's Four Horsemen : Destruction , Famine , Pestilence and Death " ? and , apologizing for the fact that it had been smeared by the rain , gave it to Shaw . " Real fine , " Shaw said . " Thanks . Here 's an application . " Miss Alexander took the application , thanked Shaw , and left the room . GALES FERRY , CONNECTICUT WEDNESDAY BEFORE driving out to the Dow plant at Gales Ferry , near Groton , Shaw called company headquarters in Midland from his motel to check on a recruiting trip scheduled for the New York State University at Buffalo the following week . Buffalo appointments had been postponed once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in physical danger , and the university was still sufficiently concerned about maintaining order to request that Dow send an extra recruiter , so interviewing could he completed in one day . Shaw decided that he ought to consider sending a roan from public relations with the recruiters to Buffalo . Two of the plant managers at Gales Ferry had gone to the University of Connecticut as recruiters in October  --  the university had asked them to withdraw after students refused to let them enter the interviewing offices  --  and Shaw met with them in the morning to get their impression of the recruiting process in general and to " kick around a couple of ideas about napalm . " One of the men gave a dispassionate account of being greeted by a mock funeral at Brown earlier in the week , and Shaw told about his interview with Miss Alexander . He predicted that more protesters might begin to show up on interviewing schedtdes  --  one recruiter at M.I.T. had been faced with seven 4d in nine interviews  --  although most colleges are stricter than Yale about limiting interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and radical chemical engineers are not easy to come by . He said a recruiter had no choice but to talk with a protester as long as employment was being discussed . " She was cagey enough not to ask why we 're murdering babies , " he said . " She was shrewd enough to ask questions like ' What moral decisions have you made about working at Dow ? ' or ' Could a person who works at Dow he prosecuted as a war criminal ? ' ? really bordering on legitimate questions . " The man who had been at Brown said that newspapers in recruiting areas ought to be informed of the company 's policy on napalm in advance , and Shaw said that all local newspapers were sent a press kit just before any Dow recruiting visit . There was also a meeting with some young men who were about to be used as recruiters for the first time . Shaw , who wrote his Master 's thesis in business school on college recruiting , spoke about the advisability of going over resumes the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , about the necessity of writing thank-you letters to placement officers , and , eventually , about napalm . " I think it 's reasonable to assume that almost every campus will have a demonstration of some sort , " he said . " Our approach as recruiters is , first of all , to avoid any direct confrontation . They want you to talk about Dow policy , but in my case I know I 'm neither authorized nor qualified to discuss Dow policy . You should maintain a businesslike , professional attitude . Always be polite . If pressed by reporters , try to refer them to the corporate public-relations group in Midland . Basically , your approach should he that you 're there as the guest of the university and the only reason you 're on campus is to recruit . Remcmher , they wo n't get a statement from you if you do n't want to give them a statement . In the final analysis , the things you have going for you are common sense and a cool head . As these kids say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W EDNESDAY I-AjTE in the afternoon , John Pow- ers , the student-placement direc-tor of the University of Connecticut , gave Shaw the resumes of the students Dow would he interviewing the following day , and assured him that although demonstrators ( or " the beatniks , " as he called them ) would probably he present , the university was now committed to the students ' right to meet with bona-fide recruiters . " Let me tell you something , " he said . " And I 'm not he-ing facetious . This is the best thing that ever happened to the placement office . You usually have to knock kids on the head to get them in here . Last year , we used to have six kids on a schedule . Now the schedules are full  --  twelve , thirteen people . The demonstration was not the only reason , but it was the biggest single reason . I 'm beginning to think : Give me publicity  --  good or had , just so it 's publicity . Maybe your company will find the same thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we ore less of an unknown quantit ) now . " THURSDAY HAW and another recruiter , who L./ had flown in from Midland , chatted in an interviewing coons until just before nine , and then Shaw went to the door to call in the other recruiter 's first appointment and to leave for some courtesy calls on university officials . Shaw and the other recruiter planned to fly to Midland together in the afternoon . When Shaw opened the door , he found twenty or so demonstrators sitting on the floor of the hallway . Only one person seemed seriously intent on blocking the door  --  a thin young man with a blond mustache , who sat directly in the doorway , his hack to the room . He had the look of somebody consciously not speaking , as if he had taken a vow of silence . The student with an appointment jumped over the young man into the room , and Shaw tried to leave . " Excuse me , " Shaw said , but the young man with the mustache swayed in whichever direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentatively blocking his path with a banner that said " Dow Lights the Way for L.B.J. In S.E. Asia . " Shaw went hack into the room . He snakes it a practice not to push people out of the way . ( At Boston University , not long before , when a student lie-in covered the entire floor space in front of the interviewing room , Shaw declined to leave until a dean advised him that the only alternative was to spend the night . At that point , Shaw , after consultation with a Dow public-relations man , removed his shoes dnd walked out on top of the students into several inches of snow ; he was accompanied b ) the dean and two policemen , who , apparently working without benefit of public-relations consultation , left their shoes on . ) A reporter for the campus paper had managed to get in with the interviewee , and began to ask Shaw questions while , a few feet away , the recruiter was asking the interviewee what type of job he was interested in . The door would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the hallway . " Did you expect trouble ? " the reporter asked Shaw , holding a clipboard ready for the answer . " We never expect any trouble , " Shaw said , trying to keep his voice down . " We did expect a student demonstration . " In a few minutes , the provost and three other university officials arrived and picked their way through the demonstrators into the room . They greeted Shaw cordially , and he told them how happy he was to he at Connecticut . The other recruiter continued his interview . The provost led Shaw and the rest out of the room  --  everyone stepping over the young man in the doorway  --  and asked the dean of students to remain outside the door and make certain that students with appointments could get in . Shaw finished his talk with the student reporter in another room he said he was neither authorized nor qualified to comment on company policy  --  and then he went to make his courtesy              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
