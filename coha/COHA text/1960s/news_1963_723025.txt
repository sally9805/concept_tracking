txt Dorval Airport here momentarily became a Babel last night with the arrival of 200 industrial equipment buyers from 53 nations of Asia , Africa , Latin American and Europe . including Russia . Across the Dominion this week the canaman government will wine and dine the foreign buyers and show them through 150 Canadian heavy machinery factories . Next week it will follow up by flying representatives of 600 U.S. retail chains , including A &; P and Sears-Roebuck , to Toronto for a look at consumer-goods samples to be displayed by 400 Canadian manufacturers . Other waves of foreigners will arrive in the succeeding four weeks  --  all guests of a new government program dubbed Operation World Markets and described by officials as the most intensive export-promotion drive Canada has ever mounted . Operation World Markets is the latest in a series of Canadian government moves to expand Canada 's exports , cut imports and improve the Dominion 's world-trade balance . The moves already show definite signs of succeeding  --  and thereby of creating both opportunities and trouble for U.S. business . For while Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as its invitation to the 600 U.S. retailers shows , it also is interested in reducing some purchases from the U.S. and snatching for itself foreign customers of American firms . Many of the industrial equipment buyers to be shown through the Dominion this week have long done most of their purchasing in the U.S. Decade of Deficit. ; Improving the trade balance is a vital matter for Canada . Like ? the U.S. , the Dominion persistently pays out to other nations in all kinds of transactions more than it takes in . Though this balance-of-payments deficit has been whittled from a record $1.5 billion in 1959 to $850 million last year , economists consider it still far too high . A decade of deficits averaging $1 billion a year played a major role in touching off the financial panic that sent the Canadian dollar plummeting in world markets last June . For six straight years through 1960 , Canada 's foreign trade balance contributed an average annual deficit of $400 million to the balanceof-payments . gap . Under the stimulus of various government moves the trade ' balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by $121 million in 1961 , $80 million in 1962. and $38 million in January alone this year . One economist looks for a 1963 trade surplus of $300 million , highest since $480 million in 1952 . Good as those figures may seem , however , Canadian officials would like to build the trade surplus still higher to cut into the balance-of-payments deficit . In particular , they 'd like to slash the heavy deficits Canada has run since World War II in trade with the U.S. They already are making some progress ; Canada 's purchases of U.S. goods last year exceeded sales to the U.S. by $565 million , but that was down from a $649 million deficit in 1961 . Canada and the U.S. are each other 's best customers ; the value of this two-way trade , biggest in the world , was a record $8 billion last year . Impact on U.S. Dollar Drain ? All this has much significance for the Kennedy Administration as well as U.S. business . As a close friend and NATO ally , the U.S. has an interest in seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can raise sales to the U.S. , cut purchases from the U.S. , and snatch sales from U.S. goods in world markets , its efforts will hinder Uncle Sam 's attempts to wipe out his own balance of payments deficit and stop the resulting gold losses . The Canadian government 's biggest move to sharpen Canada 's world-competitive position so far has been the reduction of the Canadian dollar to a value of 92.5 U.S. cents decreed last May . As a rule , currency devaluation makes a country 's goods a better bargain for foreigners and makes imported goods more expensive . Officials particularly hoped to expand Canada 's exports of manufactured goods , as rising factory output creates more jobs than an expanded outflow of iron ore , copper or lumber . At present , manufactured goods account for less than 20% of Canada 's exports . But Bank of Canada Governor Louis Rasminsky notes 1962 exports of aircraft and parts jumped 39% to $111.4 million and sales abroad of non-farm machinery climbed 27% to $122.5 million . He credits some of the increases to devaluation . Export Credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to countries that want to buy Canadian goods but are short of Canadian dollars . The government initially laid aside $300 million for export credits ; " we 've already approved $100 million of long-term financing . " says one exultant administrator , " and other negotiations are going on . " Montreal Locomotive Works , Ltd. , says the program has helped it land export orders totaling $33 million from Argentina , Brazil and Mexico . As part of Operation World Markets . the government also will bring Canada 's 110 trade commissioners abroad back to Ottawa in the last two weeks of April , to describe specific export opportunities to Canadian manufacturers . So far , more than 700 manufacturers have requested over 8,000 individual interviews with the commissioners . In addition to these moves affecting all types of businesses , Canada has been prodding individual industries to help fulfill the nation 's foreign-trade goals . In 1961 it formulated a national oil poilcy calling on the industry to boost output from an average of 540,000 barrels a day in 1960 to an average of 800,000 a day by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil men to look for new export markets . The government has backed its exhortations with thinly veiled threats of government intervention the oil men would n't like It its goals are n't met . Result : Canada 's oil exports shot up to $233 million in 1962 from $152 million in 1961 , and the authoritative Financial Post figures oil exports to the U.S. rose 29% last year . Further gains are foreseen in 1963 . Last October the auto industry 's turn came . To cut imports of auto parts , which last year amounted to $336 million , the government clamped a 25% import duty on automatic transmissions . To boost , exports , it gave auto maklet 's two ways of escaping the duty . They can get the duty refunded to the extent that they I offset imports of automatic transmissions by exports of other auto parts . Also , subsidiaries of U.S. auto firms , which account for most Canadian auto production , can get the duty refunded to the extent that their imports of automatic transmissions are matched by Canadian purchases of auto parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . Last month General Motors of Canada . Ltd. , said it will begin assembling automatic transmissions this summer at Windsor , Ontario , instead of importing all its needs . Ford Motor Co. of Canada has started shipping wheel hubs and drums to the U.S. , and is considering other moves to offset the duty . American Motors Canada ) Ltd. has announced its U.S. parent will buy $3 million worth of auto parts annually from Canadian suppliers , and is studying making additional purchases . The government also is inviting European car makers to build plants in Canada , rather than shipping in the cars . Volvo Co. of Sweden is building a plant at Halifax , Nova Scotia , to assemble cars both for sale to Canadians and for export to Latin America . The government is letting Volvo import ear bodies duty-free : it apparently figures that 's better than continuing to import completed Volvos , of which Canadians bought 2,000 last year . Renault of France is said to be weighing a similar arrangement . Canada 's trade promotion efforts are going ahead in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 8 general election that was triggered by last month 's government crisis and cabinet revolt . Resigning in that revolt was Trade Commissioner George Flees , considered the country 's No. 1 export drumbeater . His departure , it was first feared , would kill Operation World Markets . " Right after the crisis , applications from companies " to take part in the governmertfinanced tours of Canada " fell off almost to nothing , " recalls one Trade Ministry official . " But they 've come back sharply the past two weeks . " In any event , the ministry is putting aside $600.000 for travel , hotel hills and entertainment of foreign buyers scheduled to visit Canada : this includes the chartering of seven airliners to bring them in . Ontario 's " Crusade " Ambitious as the plans for Operation World Markets are , the promotion will have to go some to overshadow the Ontario Trade Crusade which Canada 's most heavily industrialized province has been staging . Since last September Ontario has spent over $500,000 on advertising alone , and its promotion is scheduled to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has expanded existing trade offices in London , New York and Chicago . and opened new ones in Dusseldorf , Germany , and Milan , Italy . Also . it has dispatched a dozen " sales opportunity missions , " consisting of eight to 10 Ontario manufacturers each , flying abroad in search of export business . A provincial official says a single foray into Chicago recently netted over $1 million of orders for Ontario manufacturers . Ontario 's " crusade " is anti-import as well as pro-export . The province has put up 80 hillboatids proclaiming : " $100 less per person of imports a year means 60,000 new jobs . " This has riled importers , who contend that sales to Ontario by foreigners create jobs by paying for foreign purchases from Ontario . Volkswagen has run a series of ads in the province stressing that theme .
