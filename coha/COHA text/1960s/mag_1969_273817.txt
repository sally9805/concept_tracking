In 1967 , more than a year after he began using lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , a 19-year-old U.S. college freshman was admitted to New York 's Presbyterian Hospital complaining of fever and malaise . After extensive laboratory tests , his ailment was diagnosed as acute leukemia , or " cancer of the blood , " a fatal disease of the blood-forming organs . At about the same time , a 22-year-old Australian suffering from an obsessive-compulsive neurosis was treated with LSD injections for two months . A year later , suffering from fatigue , pallor , bleeding gums , rashes and an " influenza-like illness , " he too was found to be a victim of acute leukemia . <P> Chromosome Breaks . Two cases obviously do not prove that " acid " is leukemogenic as well as hallucinogenic . For more than two years , however , laboratory evidence connecting LSD and leukemia has been mounting . Cell damage from LSD was first reported in March 1967 by a team of researchers headed by Dr. Maimon M. Cohen at the State University of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence had accumulated that the National Foundation-March of Dimes called an emergency meeting of top geneticists to consider the problem . The geneticists were properly hesitant to report outright that LSD causes leukemia . Nevertheless , they observed that the cells of people who had used LSD showed a high incidence of the kind of chromosome breaks and abnormalities characteristic of leukemia . The abnormalities occurred four to five times more frequently among LSD users than among nonusers , said Dr. Cohen . <P> Discussing the young Australian leukemia victim in the June 28 issue of the British Medical Journal , Dr. O. Margaret Garson and Meryl K. Robson moved a little closer to blaming LSD directly for the abnormalities . " The association between the ingestion of lysergide and the occurrence of acute leukemia may be casual rather than causal , " they wrote , " but certain unusual features in our case suggest that it may be causal . " Among these features were the patient 's unusual bone-marrow chromosome pattern and the presence of large cells containing multiple micronucleoli . Dr. Lionel Grossbard and colleagues at Columbia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. college student in the A.M.A. Journal , were somewhat more cautious in their conclusions . Further evidence is needed , they said , before the relationship between LSD and leukemia can be conclusively established .
