txt ALBANY , March 14 ? Governor Rockefeller warned today that only quick passage of his Blue Cross program would prevent an imminent increase in hospital insurance rates for the New York City metropolitan area . Mr. Rockefeller 's warning was the first official notice that the metropolitan area 's Blue Cross plan , which increased its rates 32.9 per cent last July , I would ask for another rate inI crease this year . Senate Majority Leader Joseph Zaretzki immediately pledged the support of the Democratic majority in the Legislature for the Governor 's program . " We 'll pass it , but only as a stopgap to keep Blue Cross going pending the results of our own investigation , " he said . The Democrats , who view the Governor 's plan as merely a " temporary gimmick , " have begun an inquiry into the structure of hospitalization insurance in the state , focusing principally on the problem of spiraling hospital costs . Early Request Due The Governor said that " the State Superintendent of Insurance has informed me that within days an application for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest Blue Cross plans in the state . " Although he did not specifically mention New York City , it Iwas learned authoritatively that he was referring to the Associated Hospital Service , which is the Blue Cross plan in the metropolitan area . Associated 's president , J. Douglas Colman , confirmed the ( Governor 's prediction . He said , lin a telephone interview , that " we will undoubtedly be asking for new rates in a few weeks . " Mr. Colman , who was working lin his Manhattan office over the weekend to get the request ready , declined to comment on how large a rate increase would be sought . New Rating to Be Asked He did say , however , that the Associated plan , which has been having financial problems , would ask at the same time for a completely new rating method . Under it the State Insurance Department would change the rates each year to match the changes in hospital costs and related factors . Under the present system Blue Cross plans must ask the department 's approval for rate increases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York // City plan , the Governor said ; " applications from other Blue Cross plans will follow during the legislative session . " His two bills , would affect both Blue Cross and Blue Shield . He contends they will " relieve the immediate pressures for rate increases without imperiling the fiscal soundness of these plans . " The bills would do the following : gReduce the reserve fund the , Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are required by law to maintain for emergencies , from 15 per cent to 5 per cent of their annual income . This bill would also cut from 2 per cent to 1 per cent the amount of annual income to be applied toward reserves . Reduce the maximum amount the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans can use for administrative expenses , from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of their annual income . Blue Cross Reaction The New York City Blue Cross organization is opposed to changing the reserve requirements on the ground that this is financially dangerous , but it has no objection to the bill on administrative expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money for day-to-day expenses by freeing funds that have until now been tied up in other ways . " Unless these bills are promptly enacted , " the Governor declared , " I am informed there is no alternative under the present law but to grant substantial rate increases which will affect many millions of our residents . " When he first announced the plan in January he said it would ! release enough money to fore-i stall any rate increases for at ' least two years , except in the ' Utica area , where an increase is to go into effect soon , In today 's statement , however , Mr. Rockefeller made no prediction as to how long a rate ! rise could be avoided . Limitations Conceded He conceded the bills ' limitations . He said : " While these two bills provide no permanent solution to the spiralling cost of hospital care paid for by the ' Blue Cross and Blue Shield they nevertheless constitute an immediate , sound step pendine receipt and action upon the forthcoming report of the Gov-1 governor 's Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor last May and ! headed by Marion B. Folsom , a ' former Secretary of Health , Ed-I ucation and Welfare , is expected ' to report shortly . The study made by the Democratic majority in the Legislature is headed by Senator Seymour R. Thaler of Queens , an outspoken critic of Blue Cross and Blue Shield . He heads the Senate Committee on Public Health . Blue Cross and Blue Shield are private , nonprofit tax-exempt plans . Blue Cross provides coverage for hospitalization and certain diagnostic procedures . Blue Shield covers surgical and some postoperative costs . The eight Blue Cross plans in the state cover about 58 per cent of the population . The seven Blue Shield plans cover slightly fewer . Associated Hospital Service has 7.5 million subscribers and covers New York City , Long Island , Westchester County and the Lower Hudson Valley . There are 5.5 million Blue Shield subscribers in the same area . All Blue Cross plans in the state have had rate increases in the last two years .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
