" Like the alcoholic who takes his little glass in the morning , " the old man once said , " I take up my brushes . " Though frail , Georges Braque still takes up his brushes each morning in his Paris studio near the Pare de Montsouris . He may work standing for a while ; more often , he sits grandly on a divan and calls for his brushes and colors like a surgeon calling for his scalpels and clamps . This week he will be 80-the same age as his ebullient former partner , Pablo Picasso . <P> Though Picasso 's pyrotechnics are certainly more dazzling , Braque ranks as one of the great innovators in modern art ( see color ) . And if he has explored a more limited area , he has often probed deeper . He can find in one room more excitement than another man might find in a world . He can paint the commonest object and somehow suggest a universe . " Progress in art , " he says , " does not consist in extending one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Cylinder &; Sphere . Last fall the Louvre , anticipating Braque 's anniversary a bit , gave him the only show that venerable museum ever put on for a living artist . It was the more appropriate because , early in the century , Braque studied paintings at the Louvre , copying such old masters as Raphael . He then painted for a while in the boldly colorful style of the Fauves ( the wild beasts ) . But the man who made the deepest impression on him in his youth was Czanne , who had given the younger generation a new slogan : " Treat nature in terms of the cylinder , the sphere and the cone . " <P> On seeing an exhibition of Braque 's paintings in 1908 . Louis Vauxcelles , the critic responsible for the term Fauves , noted that Braque. " a very bold young man . " seemed to reduce everything to " cubes . " Soon , the word cubism was a part of art 's vocabulary . Picasso had also begun experimenting with geometric planes , and when he and Braque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pard. " an expression gleaned from the silent western films then popular in France , and the two men painted so much alike that even they sometimes had difficulty telling who had painted what . The partnership gradually dissolved , but not until it had changed the course of modern art . <P> Cubism did away with Renaissance perspective , which , said Braque. " forces the objects in a picture to disappear away from the beholder instead of bringing them within his reach . " It also confirmed something that men had always known but rarely recorded : that objects seen close up tend to dissolve , fragment and multiply . This fragmentation , said Braque , " helped me establish space and movement in space . I could n't introduce the object until I had created space . " <P> Mystery &; Universality . In a flurry of experimentation . Braque produced the first paper collage , mixed sand into his paint to achieve new textures , introduced lettering into his pictures to suggest themes of everyday life . He was so inventive , in fact , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the American Wilbur Wright . After World War I. in which he was badly wounded . Braque became more contemplative . His new paintings were relaxed : the rigid geometry , finally uncaged , became fluid .
