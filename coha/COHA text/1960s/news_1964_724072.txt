txt A mystery witness failed to appear yesterday before a grand jury investigating a graft conspiracy that is reputed to extend high into the Police Department . The missing witness , Rocco ' Errichetti , identified only as a civilian , refused to testify Thursday although Chief Assistant District Attorney Alfred J. Scotti had offered him immunity from prosecution . Mr , Errichetti had been ordered by Supreme Court Justice Charles Marks to answer questions in the grand jury room. , Several times during the day the jury warden went into the grand jury anteroom and into the courtroom , where he called Mr. Errichetti 's name in a loud voice . There was no response . Mr. Scotti said later that he would take " appropriate action " if the missing witness did notl appear Monday when the grand jury meets again . Payoffs Investigated The grand jury is seeking to determine how widespread are the payoffs by bookmakers and numbers racketeers for freedom from police action . Asked for comment on an account of a payoff to a police sergeant by a Harlem numbers banker that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner Michael J. Murphy said he would begin an immediate investigation . The reporter 's account appears in today 's paper . The jury questioned several police officers yesterday , including two lieutenants . All signed waivers of immunity . Questioned also was Mrs. Stanley W. Koutnik , wife of one of the 10 policemen who were dismissed from the force on Thursday for refusing to sign waivers . Mrs. Koutnik , whose husband was a lieutenant assigned to the chief inspector 's office , had refused to testify on Thursday , although he was offered immunity . She was directed by Justice Marks to answer questions , which she did for an hour yesterday . She is to return Monday for more questioning . The investigation , which Involves gamblers and policemen In several parts of the city , is expected to bring into the hearing room a hundred policemen . They will include all 48 mem- bers of the Chief Inspector 's confidential unit , which Commissioner Murphy disbanded on : Thursday after dismissing Lieutenant Koutnik . Mr. Murphy said the group of picked men , whose particular duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usefulness . It will take weeks to reconstitute the unit . Chief Inspector Lawrence J. , who is expected to retain that post , assumed it only two months ago on the retirement of Chief Inspector Michael E. L. Ledden at the constitutional age limit of 67 . Chief Inspector Kearney was then chief of detectives . The current investigation by the office of District Attorney Frank S. Hogan was begun three years ago with the full cooperation of Commissioner Murphy . Mr. Murphy 's predecessor , Commissioner Stephen Kennedy , was a severe disciplinarian whose rules were resented by some policemen . Shortly after Commissioner Murphy assumed the post in February , 1961 , he heard that some of the men were spreading the word things would be " easier " under Determined that there would be no relaxation of the standards for honesty that had been demanded by Commissioner Kennedy , Commissioner Murphy immediately set up his own confidential investigating unit . This group of about 150 picked men , now headed by John F. Shanley , supervising assistant chief inspector , is known as the Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on police performance of duty , investigated complaints of corruption and established special techniques for enforcement of the gambling laws . Mr. Murphy also established , within weeks after becoming Commissioner , the Gambling Enforcement Inspection and Review Board . This unit , headed by First Deputy Commissioner John F. Walsh , cooperates with district attorneys and grand juries and reviews the court testimony given by policemen in gambling cases . When the review board decides that a plainclothes policeman has been ineffective , either in his arrest procedure or court testimony , he Is put back in uniform . Deputy Commissioner Walsh also has his own confidential investigating unit . Neither the Commissioner 's ' nor the Deputy Commissioner 's unit has been touched so far by the scandal that led to the disbanding of the Chief Inspector 's squad . Resentment at Headquarters There was an atmosphere of angry resentment in the higher echelons at Police Headquarters yesterday that some members had again tarnished the public image of the Police Department by refusing to testify in a graft inquiry . In precinct houses and on the street the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top brass ; others , without condoning graft , said the public was too quick to criticize all policemen because of the deeds of a few . One sergeant said the newspapers were " only too eager to blow this up into another Harry Gross case before any of the facts have come out . " Harry Gross 's $20 million-ayear bookmaking empire collapsed in 1950 when it was disclosed that he was assertedly paying the police million a year " protection money . More than 100 policemen were dismissed or resigned , but a criminal case against a group of them collapsed when Gross ran out on his promise to testify against them . A patrolman in a Manhattan station house said yesterday it was too bad that each investigation " lessens the public 's respect in the police . " " There are about 26,000 men on the force , " he noted . " one bad one in every 2,600 is n't too bad . I 've got a friend who 's a salesman . Some of the deals he 's involved in , some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't justify a police officer being a crook . " " Always a Sad Story ' A lieutenant had this com-ment : " I 've been on the force since 1947 a'id have seen a lot of this stuff . It 's always a sad story for a policeman to make such a terrible mistake . We do n't like what it does to the force 's reputation , but life goes on . I would like to know why it took three years of investigation . That 's a hell of a long time . " A captain said : " We give the most hardened criminal a better deal than the police . From what I 've read , I do n't even know what these men did . I do n't think too much should be said by the department until we know what they did . " A patrolman on street duty said : " People just look at us with suspicion in their eyes . It makes our job just that much harder . People refuse to trust any of us when this happens .
