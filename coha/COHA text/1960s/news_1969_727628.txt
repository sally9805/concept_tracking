txt The outlook is good for starting some American troops home from Vietnam this year . No command decision has been made , or is likely to be in the near future . But the verdict is spreading both in the American military and civilian high commands that a " token withdrawal " is both necessary and possible . It appears necessary , because the South Vietnamese Army and Government , they feel , will not take hold of their job with full commitment , and with their newly developing skills , as long as the Americans show no signs of leaving . It appears possible because a few South Vietnamese units are now ready to attempt the full load , while the American establishment in Vietnam is top-heavy . Some American officials argue that it would be weakness to start withdrawals before the Paris bargaining is done . Others say a stiffened South Vietnamese Army , with growing success in the field , is a better argument at the big round table in Paris . Watch for agreement on prisoner exchanges as the first evidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chief American negotiator , has indicated this is one area where he expects to see early and hopeful signs that the talks are progressing . Prisoner exchanges have taken place in the past as evidence of goodwill . But they were only on a one-shot basis . Now the State Department is gearing for the possibility of more systematic and regular exchanges . Secretary of State William P. Rogers has appointed Undersecretary Elliot L. Richardson to assume " overall coordination and responsibility for State Department actions concerning prisoners of war in Southeast Asia . " The national budget is , and will remain , tight . This is now a settled fact as the Nixon White House finishes its first look-around and sizes up the siltation . There can be some economies squeezed out of the Johnson budget , but not many . A little money can be transferred to new programs that the new President wants to launch , but not much . He can get teed money , but not operating subsidies or outlays on the big scale . Hence , there is growing concern that the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . This is a project subject to large hopes and equally large doubts in the Washington community and is yet untested . Trends .. . Automakers again are pressing Congress to relax Air Quality Act standards for exhaust-fume control . This time Detroit is lobbying the Senate subcommittee on air and water pollution headed by Sen. Edmund S. Muskie ( D ) of Maine . The motor industry wants the law amended to require the Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare to set up a factual assessment of need before issuing future antismog standards . The Automobile Manufacturers Association , spokesman for the industry , contends that plans for nationwide control of fuel-tank and carburetor exhaust ( to start with 1970 models ) do n't meet the need test . " Although there is good evidence to indicate these hydrocarbon controls are needed in California , " the association noted recently , " there is serious question as to the need for such controls nationally . " But the AMA has yet to convince Sen. George Murphy ( R ) of California , a champion of stringent controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that the Golden State 's smog is due partly to touring cars from other states . And until the smog ends , they say , the need for uniform national controls should be obvious . How and why . . The economic high command is breathing sighs of relief . The economy has not been upset by the Nixon takeover . There has neither been a spurt of inflation , caused by a delusion of excess " Nixon prosperity , " nor a serious , setback caused by fear of inflation controls that are too severe . The economy is in a delicate state , with speculators ready to exaggerate any sequence of events that gets out of hand . But President Nixon 's pledge of " fine tuning " and his early action to retain the cornerstone of inflation control  --  the income surtax  --  seem to have quieted both the bulls and bears . Nevertheless , the job of inflation control remains sensitive and an anxious business .                    @
