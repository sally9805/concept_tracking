5E1 EROS RAMPANT a story by John Updike The Maples ' house is full of love . Bean , the sixyear-old baby , loves Hecuba , the dog . John , who is eight , an angel-faced mystic serenely unable to ride a bicycle or read a clock , is in love with his Creepy Crawlers , his monster cards , his dinosaurs , and his carved rhinoceros from Kenya . He spends hours in his room after school drifting among these things , rearranging , gloating , humming . He experiences pain only when his older brother , Richard Jr. , sardonically attempts to enter his room and pierces his placenta of contemplation . Richard is in love with life , with all outdoors , with Carl Yastrzemski , Babe Parelli , the Boston Bruins , the Beatles , and with that shifty apparition who , comb in hand , peeps back shiny-eyed at him out of the mirror in the mornings , wearing a moustache of toothpaste . He receives strange challenging notes from girls  --  Dickie Maple you stop looking at me  --  which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers and hectographed notices about eye , tooth , and lung inspection . His feelings about young Mrs. Brice , who confronts his section of the fifth grade with the enameled poise and diction of an airline hostess , are so guarded as to be suspicious . He almost certainly loves , has always deeply loved , his older sister , Judith . Verging on thirteen , she has become difficult to contain , even within an incestuous passion . Large and bumptious , she eclipses his view of the television screen , loudly frugs while he would listen to the Beatles , teases , thrashes , is bombarded and jogged by powerful rays from outer space . She hangs for hours by the corner where Mr. Lunt , her history 60 EROS RAMPANT teacher , lives ; she pastes effigies of the Monkees on her walls , French-kisses her mother good-night , experiences the panic of sleeplessness , engages in long languorous tussles on the sofa with the dog .

The cats , Esther and Esau. lick each other 's fur and share a bowl . They had been two of a litter . Esther , the mother of more than thirty kittens mostly resembling her brother , but with a persistent black minority vindicating the howled appeal of a neighboring torn , has been " fixed " ; Esau , sentimentally allowed to continue unfixed , now must venture from the house in quest of the bliss that had once been purely domestic . He returns scratched and battered . Esther licks his wounds while he leans dazed beside the refrigerator ; even his purr is ragged . Nagging for their supper , they sit like bookends , their backs discreetly touching , an expert old married couple on the dole . One feels , unexpectedly , that Esau still loves Esther , while she merely accepts and understands him . She seems scornful of his merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of what drastically attracts him ? But it is his big square tomcat 's head that seems puzzled , rather than her triangular feminine feline one . The children feel a difference ; both Bean and John cuddle Esau more , now that Esther is sterile . Perhaps , obscurely , they feel that she has deprived them of a miracle , of the semiannual miracle of her kittens , of drowned miniature piglets wriggling alive from a black orifice vaster than a cave . Richard Jr. , as if to demonstrate his superior purchase on manhood and its righteous compassion , makes a point of petting the two cats equally , stroke for stroke . Judith claims she hates them both ; it is her chore to feed them supper , and she hates the smell of horsemeat . She loves , at least in the abstract , horses . Mr. Maple loves Mrs. Maple . He goes through troublesome periods , often on Saturday afternoons , of heing unable to take his eyes from her , of being captive to the absurd persuasion that the curve of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confided to his care . He can not touch her enough . The sight of John Updike was born in 1932 in Shillington , Pennsylvania , and his eleventh book and fifth novel , " Couples , " was publish.ed this spring . He and his family live in Ipswich , Massachusetts . her body contorted by one of her yoga exercises , in her elastic black leotard riddled with runs , twists his heart so that he can not breathe . Her gesture as she tips the dregs of white wine into a potted geranium seems infinite , like one of Vermeer 's moments frozen in an eternal light from the left . At night he tries to press her into himself , to secure her drowsy body against his breast like a clasp , as if without it he will come undone . He can not sleep in this position , yet maintains it long after her breathing has become steady and oblivious : can love be defined , simply , as the refusal to sleep ? Also he loves Penelope Vogel , a quaint little secretary at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antiguan ; and he is in love with the memories of six or so other women , beginning with a seven-year-old playmate who used to steal his hunter 's cap ; and is half in love with death . He as well seems to love , perhaps alone in the nation , President Johnson , who is unaware of his existence . Along the same lines , Richard adores the moon ; he studies avidly all the photographs beamed back from its uncongenial surface . And Joan ? Whom does she love ? Her psychiatrist , certainly . Her father , inevitably . Her yoga instructor , probably . She has a part-time job in a museum and returns home flushed and quick-tongued , as if from sex . She must love the children , for they flock to her like sparrows to suet . They fight bitterly for a piece of her lap and turn their backs upon their father , as if he , the source and shelter of their life , were a grotesque intruder , a chimney sweep in a snow palace . None of his impersonations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial bastion , factual wizard , watchman of the night  --  win them over ; Bean still cries for Mommy when hurt , John approaches her for the money to finance yet more monster cards , Dickie demands that hers be the last good-night , and even Judith , who should be his , kisses him timidly , and saves her openmouthed passion for her mother . Joan swims through their love like a fish through water , ignorant of any other element . Love slows her footsteps , pours upon her from the radio , hangs about her , in the kitchen , in the form of tacked-up children 's drawings of houses , families , cars , cats , dogs , and flowers . Her husband can not touch her ; she is solid but hidden , like the World Bank , presiding yet immaterial , like the federal judiciary . Some cold uncoordinated thing pushes at his hand as it hangs impotent ; it is Heeuba 's nose . Obese spayed golden-eyed bitch , like him she abhors exclusion and strains to add her warmth to the tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of food , in love with the smell of love . Penelope Vogel takes care to speak without sentimentality ; five years younger than Richard , she has endured a decade of amorous ordeals and , still single at twenty-nine , preserves herself by speaking dryly , in the flip phrases of a still younger generation . " We had a good thing , " she says of her Antiguan , " that became a had scene . " She handles , verbally , her old affairs like dried flowers ; sitting across the restaurant table from her , Richard is made jittery by her delicacy , as if he and a grandmother are together examining an array of brittle , enigmatic mementos . " A very undesirable scene , " Penelope adds . " The big time was too much for him . He got in with the drugs crowd . I could n't see it . " " He wanted to marry you ? " Richard asks timidly ; this much is office gossip . She shrugs , admitting , " There was that pitch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He was the most beautiful man I ever saw . His shoulders . In Dickinson 's Bay , he 'd have me put my hand on his shoulder in the water and that way he 'd pull me along for miles , swimming . He was a snorkel instructor . " His name ? " Jittery , fearful of jarring these reminiscences , which are also negotiations , he spills the last of his Gibson , and jerkily signals to order another . " Hubert , " Penelope says . She is patiently mopping with her napkin . " Like a girl friend told me , Never take on a male beauty , you 'll have to fight for the mirror . " Her face is small and very white , and her nose very long , her pink nostrils inflamed by a perpetual cold . Only a Negro , Richard thinks , could find her beautiful ; the thought gives her , in the restless shadowy restaurant light , beauty . The waiter , colored , comes and changes their tablecloth . Penelope continues so softly Richard must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a woman divorce her husband and leave her children for him . She was one of the old planter families . He would n't marry her . He told me . If she 'd do that to him , next thing she 'd leave me . He was very moralistic. until he came up here . But imagine an eighteen-year-old boy having an effect like that on a mature married woman in her thirties . " " I better keep him away from my wife , " Richard jokes . " Yeah . " She does not smile . " They work at it , you know . Those boys are pros . " Penelope has often been to the West Indies . In St. Croix , it delicately emerges , there was Andrew , with his goatee and his septic-tank business and his political ambitions ; in Cuadeloupe , there a story by John Updike 61 was Ramon , a customs inspector ; in Trinidad , Castlereigh , who played the alto pans in a steel band and also did the limbo . He could go down to nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the only one who had followed her north . " I was supposed to come live with him in this hotel in Dorchester but I was scared to go near the place , full of cop-out types and the smell of pot in the elevator . I got two offers from guys just standing there pushing the Tip button . It was not a healthy scene . " The waiter brings them rolls ; in his shadow her profile seems wan and he yearns to pluck her , pale flower , from the tangle she has conjured . " It got so had . " she says , " I tried going hack to an old boy friend , an awfully nice guy with a mother and a nervous stomach . He 's a computer systems analyst , very dedicated , but I do n't know , he just never impressed me . Al he can talk about is his gastritis and how she keeps telling him to move out and get a wife . but he does n't know if she means it . His mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances up ; there is a glint off her halted butter knife . Her voice slows , goes drier . " No , as a matter of fact . He 's what they call an Afro-American . You mind ? " " No. no , I was just wondering  --  his nervous stomach . He does n't sound like the others . " " He 's not . Like I say , he does n't impress me . Do n't you find , once you have something that works , it 's hard to back up ? " More seems meant than is stated ; her level gaze , as she munches her thickly buttered bun , feels like one tangent in a complicated geometrical problem : find the point at which she had switched from white to black lovers . The subject is changed for him ; his heart jars , and he leans forward hastily to say , " See that woman who just came in ? Leather suit , gypsy earrings , sitting down now ? Her name is Eleanor Dennis . She lives down our street from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man ? " " I have no idea . Eleanor 's moved out of our circles . He looks like a real thug . " Along the far wall , Eleanor adjusts the great loop of her earring ; her sideways glance , in the shuffle of shadows , flicks past his table . He doubts that she saw him . Penelope says , " From the look on your face , that was more than a circle she was in with you . " He pretends to be disarmed by her guess , but in truth considers it providential that one of his own old loves should appear , to countervail the dark torrent of hers . For the rest of the meal they talk about hair , him and Eleanor and Marlene Bossman 62 EROS RAMPANT and Joan and the little girl who used to steal his hunter 's cap . In the lobby of Penelope 's apartment house , the elevator summoned , he offers to go up with her . She says carefully , " I do n't think you want to . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the lobby is garishly lit and furnished with plastic plants that need never be watered , Naugahyde chairs that were never sat upon , and pointless tessellated plaques . The light is an absolute presence , as even and clean as the light inside a freezer , as ubiquitous as ether or as the libido that , Freud says , permeates all of us from infancy on . " No , " Penelope repeats . " I 've developed a good ear for sincerity in these things . I think you 're too wrapped up back home . " " The dog likes me , " he confesses , and kisses her good-night there , encased in brightness . Dry voice to the contrary , her lips are shockingly soft , wide , warm , and sorrowing . co , " " Joan says to him . " You slept with that little office mouse . " It is Saturday ; the formless erotic suspense of the afternoon is over . The Maples are in their room dressing for a party , by the ashen light of dusk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have , " he says , thereby admitting , however , that he knows who she means . " Well you took her to dinner . " " Who says ? " " Mack Dennis . Eleanor saw the two of you in a restaurant . When do they converse ? I thought they were divorced . " " They talk all the time . He 's still in love with her . Everybody knows that . " " Okay . When do he and you converse ? " Oddly , she has not prepared an answer . " Oh ? " His heart falls through her silence . " Maybe I saw him in the hardware store this afternoon . " And maybe you did n't . Why would he blurt this out anyway ? You and he must be on cozy terms . " He says this to trigger her denial ; but she mutely considers and , sauntering toward her closet , admits , " We understand each other . " How unlike her , to bluff this way . " When was I supposedly seen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around eight-thirty . You must have slept with her . " " I could n't have . I was home by ten , you may remember . You had just gotten back yourself from the museum . " " What went wrong , darley ? Did you offend her with your horrible pro-Vietnam stand ? " In the dim light he hardly knows this woman , her broken gestures , her hasty voice . Her silver slip glows and crackles as she wriggles into a black knit cocktail dress ; with a kind of determined agitation she paces around the bed , to the bureau and back . As she moves , her body seems to be gathering bulk from the shadows , bulk and a dynamic elasticity . He tries to placate her with a token offering of truth . " No , it turns out Penelope only goes with Negroes . I 'm too pale for her . " " You admit you tried ? " He nods . " Well , " Joan says , and takes a half-step toward him , so that he flinches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who I was sleeping with Wednesday ? " He nods again , but the two nods feel different , as if , transposed by a terrific unfelt speed , a continent had lapsed between them . She names a man he knows only slightly , an assistant director in the museum , who wears a collar pin and has his gray hair cut long and tucked back in the foppish English style . " It was fun , " Joan says , kicking at a shoe . " He thinks I 'm beautiful . He cares for me in a way you just do n't . " She kicks away the other shoe . " You look pale to me too , buster . " Stunned , he needs to laugh . " But we all think you 're beautiful . " " Well you do n't make me feel it . " " I feel it , " he says . " You make me feel like an ugly drudge . " As they grope to understand their new positions , they realize that she , like a chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nowhere to go but on the defensive . In a desperate attempt to keep the initiative , she says , " Divorce me . Beat me . " He is calm , factual , admirable . " How often have you been with him ? " " I do n't know . Since April , off and on . " Her hands appear to embarrass her ; she places them at her sides , against her cheeks , together on the bedpost , oiT . " I 've been trying to get out of it , I 've felt horribly guilty , but he 's never been at all pushy , so I could never really arrange a fight . He gets this hurt look . " " Do you want to keep him ? " " With you knowing ? Do n't be grotesque . " " But he cares for you in a way I just do n't . " " Any lover does that . " " God help us . You 're an expert . " " Hardly . " " What about you and Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not for very long . " " And Freddy Vetter ? " " No , we agreed not . He knew about me and Mack . " Love , a cloudy heavy ink , inundates him from within , suffuses his palms with tingling pressure as he steps close to her , her murky face held tense against the expectation of a blow . You whore , " he breathes , enraptured . " My sweet bride . " He kisses her hands ; they are corrupt and cold . " Who else ? " he begs , as if each name is a burden of treasure she lays upon his bowed serf 's shoulders . " Tell me all your men . " " I 've told you . It 's a pretty austere list . You know why I told you ? So you would n't feel guilty about this Vogel person . " " But nothing happened . When you do it , it happens . " " Sweetie , I 'm a woman , " she explains , and they do seem , in this darkening room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bases of their marriage , to the elemental constituents . Woman . Man . House . " What does your psychiatrist say about all this ? " " Not much . " The triumphant swell of her confession has passed ; her drier manner prepares for days , weeks of his questions . She retrieves the shoes she kicked away . " That 's one of the reasons I went to him , I kept having these affairs ? " " Kept having ? You 're killing me . " " Please do n't interrupt . It was somehow very innocent . I 'd go into his office , and lie down , and say , ' I 've just been with Mack , or Otto ? ' " " Otto . What 's that joke ? Otto is ' toot " spelled inside out . " " ' ? and it was wonderful , or awful , or so-so , ' and then we 'd talk about my childhood masturbation . It 's not his business to scold me , it 's his job to get me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time I 've been jealous of him , and he 's been suffering with this for years ; he had to listen every day . You 'd go in there and plunk yourself still warm down on his couch ? " " It was n't every day at all . Weeks would go by . I 'm not Otto 's only woman . " The artificial tumult of television below merges with a real commotion , a screaming and bumping that mounts the stairs and threatens the aquarium where the Maples are swimming , dark fish in ink , their outlines barely visible , known to each other only as eddies of warmth , as mysterious animate chasms in the surface of space . Fearing that for years he will not again be so close to Joan , or she be so open , he hurriedly asks , " And what about the yoga instructor ? " " Do n't be silly , " Joan says , clasping her pearls a story by John Updike 63 at the nape of her neck . " He 's an elderly vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shards of electric light . Richard Jr . is frantic , sobbing . " Mommy , Judy keeps teasing me and getting in front of the television ! " " I did not . I did not . " Judith speaks very distinctly . " Mother and Father , he is a retarded liar . " " She ca n't help she 's growing , " Richard tells his son , picturing poor Judith trying to fit herself among the intent childish silhouettes in the little television room , pitying her for her hulk , much as he pities Johnson for his Presidency . Bean bursts into the bedroom . frightened by violence , and Hecuba leaps upon the bed with rolling golden eyes , and Judith gives . Vickie an impudent and unrepentant sideways glance , and he , gagging on a surfeit of emotion , bolts from the room . Soon there arises from the other end of the upstairs an anguished squawk as Dickie invades , Tohn 's room and punctures his communion with his dinosaurs . Downstairs , a woman , neglected and alone , locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan 's legs so she can not move . Judith asks with parental sharpness , " What were you two talking about ? " " Nothing , " Richard says . " We were getting dressed . " " Why were all the lights out ? " " We were saving electricity , " her father tells her . " Why is Mommy crying ? " He looks , disbelieving , and discovers that indeed , her cheeks coated with silver , she is . At the party , amid clouds of friends and smoke , Richard resists being parted from his wife 's side . She has dried her tears , and faintly swaggers , as when , on the beach , she dares wear a bikini . But her nakedness is only in his eyes . Her head beside his shoulder , her grave soft voice , the plump unrepentant cleft between her breasts , all seem newly treasurable and intrinsic to his own identity . As a cuckold , he has grown taller , attenuated , more elegant and humane in his opinions , airier and more mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears himself sounding like a dove . He concedes that Johnson is unlovable . He allows that Asia is infinitely complex , devious , ungrateful , feminine ; but must we abandon her therefore ? When Mack Dennis , grown burly in bachelorhood , comes and asks Joan to dance , Richard feels unmanned and sits on the sofa with such an air of weariness that Marlene Brossman sits down beside him and , for the first time in 64 EROS RAMPANT years , flirts . He tries to tell her with his voice , beneath the meaningless words he is speaking , that he loved her , and could love her again , but that at the moment he is terribly distracted and must be excused . He goes and asks Joan if it is n't time to go . She resists ; " It 's too rude . " She is safe here among proprieties and foresees that his exploitation of the territory she has surrendered will be thorough . Love is pitiless . They drive home at midnight under a slim moon nothing like its photographs  --  shadow-taped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal feet of the mechanical intruder sent from the blue ball in the sky . They do not rest until he has elicited from her a world of details : dates , sites , motel interiors , precisely mixed emotions . They make love , self-critically . He exacts the new wantonness she owes him , and in compensation tries to he , like a battered old roue , skillful . He satisfies himself that in some elemental way he has never been displaced ; that for months she has been struggling in her lover 's grasp , in the gauze net of love , her wings pinioned by tact . She assures him that she seized on the first opportunity for confession ; she confides to him that Otto spray-sets his hair and uses perfume . She , weeping , vows that nowhere , never , has she encountered his , Richard 's , passion , his pleasant bodily proportions and backwards-reeling grace , his invigorating sadism , his male richness . Then why ... ? She is asleep . Her breathing has become oblivious . He clasps her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . A receding truck pulls the night 's silence taut . She has left him a hair short of satiety ; her confession feels still a fraction unplumbed . The lunar face of the electric clock says three . He turns , flips his pillow , restlessly adjusts his arms , turns again , and seems to go downstairs for a glass of milk . To his surprise , the kitchen is brightly lit , and Joan is on the linoleum floor , in her leotard . He stands amazed while she serenely twists her legs into the lotus position . He asks her again about the yoga instructor . " Well , I did n't think it counted if it was part of the exercise . The whole point , darley , is to make mind and body one . This is Pranayama  --  breath control . " Stately , she pinches shut one nostril and slowly inhales , then pinches shut the other and exhales . Her hands return , palm up , to her knees . And she smiles . " This one is fun . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , her muscles elastic under the black cloth tormented into runs . " Oh , I forgot to tell you , I 've slept with Harry Saxon . " " Joan , no . How often ? " " When we felt like it . We used to go out behind the Little League field . That heavenly smell of clover . " " But sweetie , why ? " Smiling , she inwardly counts the seconds of this position . " You know why . He asked . It 's hard , when men ask . You must n't insult their male natures . There 's a harmony in everything . " " And Freddy Vetter ? You lied about Freddy , did n't you ? " " Now this pose is wonderful for the throat muscles . It 's called the Lion . You must n't laugh . " She kneels , her buttocks on her heels , and tilts back her head , and from gaping jaws thrusts out her tongue as if to touch the ceiling . Yet she continues speaking . " The whole theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ca n't get to the brain . " His chest hurts ; he forces from it the cry , " Tell me everybody ! " She rolls toward him and stands upright on her shoulders , her face flushed with the effort of equilibrium and the downflow of blood . Her legs slowly scissor open and shut . " Some men you do n't know , " she goes on . " They come to the door to sell you septic tanks . " Her voice is coming from her belly . Worse , there is a humming . Terrified , he awakes , and sits up . His chest is soaked . He locates the humming as a noise from the transformer on the telephone pole near their windows . All night , while its residents sleep , the town communes with itself electrically . Richard 's terror persists , generating mass as the reality of his dream sensations is confirmed . Joan 's body seems small , scarcely bigger than Judith 's , and narrower with age , yet infinitely deep , an abyss of secrecy , perfidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaves the bed as if scrambling backward from the lip of a vortex . He again goes downstairs ; his wife 's revelations have steepened the treads and left the walls slippery . The kitchen is dark ; he turns on the light . The floor is bare . The familiar objects of the kitchen seem discovered in a preservative state of staleness , wearing a look of tension , as if they are about to burst with the strain of being so faithfully themselves . Esther and Esau pad in from the living room , where they have been sleeping on the sofa , and beg to be fed , sitting like bookends , expectant and expert . The clock says four . Watchman of the night . But in searching for signs of criminal entry , for traces of his dream , Richard finds nothing but  --  clues mocking in their very abundance  --  the tacked-up drawings done by children 's fingers ardently bunched around a crayon , of houses , cars , cats , and flowers .
