The record of Bologna 's Mayor Giuseppe Dozza , 63 , reads as though it came out of a good-government primer . In four successive terms , he has stood for fiscal responsibility , a balanced budget and incentives for industry . He is campaigning for a fifth term this week on a platform of lower taxes , lower living costs and better breaks for small businessmen . He has raised Bologna 's credit so high that a consortium of banks recently offered the city an $18 million loan . Even his enemies concede that Dozza is both honest and efficient . In fact , the only unorthodox thing about him is that he is a Communist . <P> <P> His clean , competent administration of Bologna , a city of half a million people on the edge of the Po Valley , is a classic example of why non-Communists find it so hard to break the Red grip on so many Italian cities and towns . In next week 's municipal elections , 6,724 communities will vote for local officials , and sharp Communist gains could bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats and Socialists . While Italy is beset by inflation and strikes , the coalition parties are campaigning largely on the argument that Communists are Communists , one using Khrushchev 's ouster to underline the point ; the Christian Democrats even put up portraits of Khrushchev , Malenkov , Stalin and Mao right in Rome 's Via Veneto to recall the jungle warfare in the Red world . The Communists counter by sticking to Italian economic issues and by pointing to Mayor Dozza and the rinnovatori ( modernizers ) elsewhere to show that Communism has indeed changed . <P> Shaky Church . In Dozza 's pre-election pamphlet , What We Have Done , the word Communist appears only once in 63 pages . Dozza and his comrades are called the Gruppo Due Torri ( the Two Towers Group ) , a reference to the pair of medieval leaning towers in the city 's center which are the symbol of Bologna . Red election posters in the parks and piazzas are similarly bare of the hammer and sickle , and read : VOTA DUE TORRI ! <P> <P> Stocky , amiable Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle and winning over the middle class . He had organized 3,000 shop owners and storekeepers into a merchants ' federation , and helped them fight against supermarket and chain-store competition . His public officials have been well trained in Communist administration schools , and are qualified for their jobs ; each is screened for personal honesty . <P> Dozza thrives on paradox . When Bologna 's Giacomo Cardinal Lercaro ordered the shaky old church of San Giorgio torn down , it was Dozza who insisted on repairs to preserve it as an historic landmark . In 1956 , when a Christian Democratic candidate for mayor tried to undercut Dozza by promising sweeping social-welfare programs , the Red mayor branded his scheme financially irresponsible , and was re-elected by a landslide .
