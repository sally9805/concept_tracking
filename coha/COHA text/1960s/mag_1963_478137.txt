Dr. Franck is a Dutch-born New York artist , writer , and incidentally also a dental surgeon . His drawings and paintings are owned by many museums , and he will have two exhibits opening in Madison Avenue galleries on October 21 . His next book , from which this essay is taken , will be " My Eye Is in Love , " to be published by Macmillan . The drawing above is one of his many nudes ? a subject he recommends to his fellow artists for the reasons noted below . T he old-time Sunday painter , now collected so furiously , who lovingly enumerated all the leaves of the oak tree and all the bricks of the church tower , was an endearing species not yet encouraged by the advertisements . No ideas of aesthetics and " development " were drummed into his head . He did not read the art magazines or visit museums of modern art . I knew such a Sunday painter when I was a child in Holland . He was a clerk in my father 's business . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still see the faithful drawings of our city gates clone by Funs , with every stone imitated as if his life depended on precise imitation . " I just copy , " he would apologize , " but real artists make things sing . " And then he pointed out passages in the post-Impressionist local painters he adored like idols . But Fons was too true to his eye to imitate those painters instead of following his own perception , and so he was perhaps the most real artist I knew in my childhood . His eye was in love , and he worked from infatuation . He drew until he died , a salesman ? and an innocent . I surmise that it is to Fons I am indebted for taking art as a serious matter and for my faith in the vision of my own eyes . The new-type Sunday painter may start with the purest impulse . He may have been one of those many children in whom the artist was awakened , only to be submerged by the onslaught of later life . I have met many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They became gallery addicts , collectors , critics or art-haters . In others , however , the artist was completely forgotten until much later the longing returned . Perhaps they were suddenly moved by last sunrays on poplar trees , by lifting mists at dawn . After all , why should n't they try ? How many times did they not feel , looking at contemporary painters : even I could do better than that ? Maybe they could , but the new-type Sunday painter has a terrible handicap . He has become a market for whole industries : the artist-material industry , the frame makers , the mail-order art courses extract his money and flatter his vanity . After covering a number of prefabricated canvases with blobs and strokes which at first fill him with joy , he soon feels he is stuck , that something is missing . " Just take our simple , infallible course , " the advertising columns say . Only then the new Sunday painter is quite lost , for he starts to " develop . " Under the misguidance of ready-made criticism and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist-child is quickly perverted . With local exhibitions and prizes , a new competitiveness enters his life , choking the original longing to a second and final frustration and death . One can not dispense with drawing without missing the very wellspring of art , one can not attain freedom of expression without drawing oneself to freedom . All shortcuts mean the acquisition of a small bag full of tricks on which to depend : heads a la Klee , hands A la Picasso , monstrosities a la Bacon , drips a la Pollock . Dead-end alleys . But if I draw , aims will clarify themselves . While drawing . I have a chance to discover my own handwriting and through it my authenticity . To find this unique authenticity is not only the point of practicing an art , it is the point of being alive at all . It is only because of the breakdown of criteria in the visual arts ( who has not wondered how exactly juries arrive at their choice of prizes the artist , who in my nudes show myself naked for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetishism , infantilism , or callousness shows up in a man 's drawing of the nude body . But also all that is good , profound , and free becomes clear to whoever can read a drawing . Rembrandt in his nudes shows his supreme understanding of , and compassion with , human destiny ; Degas , his cold anger and irritation at the imperfections and stupidities of his models ; Maillol , his pagan , human animality ; Pascin , his nervous , melancholic sensuality ; Bouguereau , his academic petrifaction ; Felicien Rops , his sick eroticism ; Ingres , his cold-hot tenderness ; and countless thousands , their dirty little minds . Why have painters since the Renaissance preferred the female nude ? Is it because most painters until recently were males ? It may be . For it is obvious that a man gazes with higher emotional charge on a woman 's body than on a man 's . I believe Picasso said that men should paint women and vice versa . Is it also because a woman expresses herself so much more easily through her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in the attention bestowed on her ? Or is it because male models are usually so clumsy , their repertory of poses so limited that they need a staff to lean on , a rope to hang against , or a hand to support a head pretending thought ? T he importance of the model can not be overstressed . Renoir in his old age never tired of caressing the female form , his brush tied to his stiff hand . " I need the model , " he would say . " I ignite myself by this contact . " The contact is essential . There are good models and bad ones ; and it is not sufficient for a girl to take off her clothes to become a model . A bad model gives me the feeling that I can not draw anymore . But a good model practically draws herself . Elemental women , incarnations of the forces of nature , seem to make better models than intellectualized ones . Plump ones are usually preferable to modish stalks . The good model draws herself indeed , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing is put on . She is neither afraid of being ridiculous nor of being immodest . She does not give it a thought . Whether she is " beautiful " or " ugly " is immaterial . It is the movement of her body , the expression of her face , that intangible something that makes the pen move by itself . Whether she is a woman in bloom , or a woman worn out by childbearing , or a smooth little virgin , it is her inner life that informs her every movement of hand , head , and pelvis . My favorite model is at least fifty-five . She is no beauty and she talks constantly . When I first saw her in her shabby clothes , looking like a dilapidated charwoman , I resigned myself to a lost evening . When she was nude I saw at once that this old body had once been trained for the ballet , and that life had destroyed its smoothness but not its grace . A grace made heavy and poignant by the passing of the years . the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do you draw that old bag ? " men will say , thumbing through a heap of drawings . ' ' She is horrible , " say the girls , each pushing to the back of her mind the realization that in a few years she will be much like old Loulou , though without her elegance of movement . Such a model you draw with the love and the respect with which you draw a tree . That is , if the spirit moves you . In some sessions you think you draw well from the beginning , and when the next day you look at the drawings , you see that the whole batch should be thrown into the stove . In other sessions you go through hours of despair , then find you have done well , It is wise to forget the distress caused by the bad drawings , it is even wiser not to adore the good ones for more than an hour . They might seduce to mannerism and stagnation . I rarely paint nudes . Yet I can not forgo drawing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model is my landscape of flesh . She is the archetypal mother , the nymph , the imp . She is chaste or perverse , athletic or languid , bovine or spirited . She always demands worship in work . In the city she is my epitome of nature . The continuous test of my skill . The constant , pitiless measure of my growth , stagnation , maturity , or decline .
