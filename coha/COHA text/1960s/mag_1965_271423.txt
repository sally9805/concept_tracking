" If you see an Indian and a cobra , strangle the Indian first , " the saying goes in Indo-China . Javanese peasants say , " When you meet a snake and a slit-eye Chinese , first kill the slit-eye , then the snake . " Among Punjabis the proverb is , " If you spy a serpent and a Sindhi , get the Sindhi first . " <P> <P> VARIATIONS of this ugly axiom are heard the length of Asia and are as universal as the antagonisms they express . The continent 's greatest single cause of turmoil is not the struggle for food or political power but simple-and not so simple-hatred among peoples , classes , races . The U.S. is deeply and rightly troubled by its own problems of racial discrimination . They are mild compared with Asia 's endemic and murderous grudges , and America 's problems are subject to a system of social and legal redress that , tragically , most of Asia lacks . The Asian paradox is haunting : on the one hand the brooding , jewel-eyed idols from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand swirling violence and blind prejudice . These are some of the passions that years ago were described by Andr Malraux as " troubled shapes which in the evening swarm up from the rice fields and hide behind the roofs of the pagodas . " <P> Such passions are not unknown elsewhere , from Cyprus to the Arab-Israeli frontier to the Congo . But in intensity and in the numbers of people they embroil , Asia 's hostilities are the world 's most serious and in many ways most troubling to the U.S. , which now must consider Asia its foremost foreign-policy problem . These quarrels sadly refute the Gandhian view that Asian spiritualism is superior to the rationalism of the West . Gandhi liked to call for spiritual tranquillity . " Virtue , " he preached , " lies in being absorbed in one 's prayers in the presence of din and noise . " Spirituality has proved powerless to return rioting mobs to their prayers , while Western rationalism in Asia has been equally unable to mute the " din and noise " of communal clashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAOS AND CAMBODIA , the former states of Indo-China , would be locked in a vicious cycle of nationalistic enmity even if Communist aggression disappeared overnight . Vietnamese armies have harried Laos for centuries , earning the Laotians ' hate and dread . North and South Vietnamese alike look down on Cambodia , which they helped France rule . Cambodia 's dyspeptic Prince Sihanouk snubs Laos , hates neighboring Thailand ( a Thai premier once called him publicly " a pig " ) , and gibes disdainfully that " all Vietnamese are married to women with black teeth .
