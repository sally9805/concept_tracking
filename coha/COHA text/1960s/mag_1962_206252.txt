ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO 'S NEST ( 311 pp. ) - Ken Kesey-Viking ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> The world of this brilliant first novel is Inside-inside a mental hospital and inside the blocked minds of its inmates . Sordid sights and sounds abound , but Novelist Kesey has not descended to mere shock treatment or isolation-ward documentary . His book is a strong , warm story about the nature of human good and evil , despite its macabre setting . For as the boardinghouse provided a stock slice-of-life locale for another generation of writers , the sanitarium seems to appeal to many modern writers as a comparable microcosm of the times. * <P> The narrator is a giant of a man , the half-breed son of an Indian chief . Scarred by World War II and his white mother 's destruction of his proud father , he opts out of things so completely that for years the staff of the mental hospital have believed him to be deaf and dumb . His skewed observation of the ward-world is well managed ; the reader has a vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the reality behind them . <P> The ward has two kinds of citizens : the Chronics ( the Walkers , the Wheelers and the Vegetables ) and the Acutes , who have hope of being fixed up and sent back Outside , where , the Chief is convinced , everything is run by " the Combine . " Chief representative of the Combine in the hospital is a purse-mouthed Sataness known as Big Nurse . Big Nurse is a specialist in control ; she controls everyone-the patients and the doctors and the " black boys " who clean up the ward and push the Chronics around . " She wields a sure power that extends in all directions on hairlike wires too small for anybody 's eye but mine ; I see her sit in the center of this web of wires like a watchful robot , tend her network with mechanical insect skill , know every second which wire runs where and just what current to send up to get the results she wants . " <P> Savior of the ward-and especially the Chief-from the organized inhumanity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A laughing , brawling , gambling man of the world , McMurphy begins his duel with Big Nurse in sheer human exuberance and ends it in a grim , heroic struggle to the death . <P> Author Kesey , 26 , who worked as a nursing assistant in the mental wards of two California hospitals while he was writing his novel , has used his empathy with the Insider 's view of the Outsider 's world to tilt the reader 's comfortable assumption about the nice normalities , has made his book a roar of protest against middlebrow society 's Rules and the invisible Rulers who enforce them . But Kesey 's lunatics and his story are full of gaiety too-including a wild ward party complete with wine , women and song . As the Chief says admiringly of Randle P. McMurphy : " He wo n't let the pain blot out the humor no more'n he 'll let the humor blot out the pain . " <P> <P> * As witness such recent novels as : Captain Newman , M.D. , by Leo Rosten , Faces in the Water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salamanca.
