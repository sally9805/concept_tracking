In the days when student dissent took milder forms than it does now and the Death of God had not yet been widely announced , small groups of seminarians from fundamentalist Wheaton College used to appear at the edge of a 40-acre estate on the outskirts of Wheaton , Ill . They would kneel briefly in prayer and then scurry nervously away . Thirty years ago , it was an act that took courage : the estate had become headquarters of the Theosophical Society in America , a mysterious non-Christian movement often suspected of being more occult than cult . Praying for the souls of the benighted Theosophists , the seminarians feared that both they and the town would be hexed by the Devil . <P> Nothing ever happened to substantiate their fears . The Theosophists gradually became accepted by the community . They even joined the Chamber of Commerce . Last week , when leaders of the society 's 4,500 U.S. members met in Wheaton for their annual national convention , theosophy was once again under some suspicion . The scarcely adequate reason is that Sirhan Sirhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received a copy of the society 's most sacred book , The Secret Doctrine . Its author : Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky ( 1831-91 ) , the Russian-born founder and high priestess of the movement . <P> Ancient Practice .

" Not so , replied Theosophical Society President Joy Mills , a former schoolteacher , when the convention opened last week . " Mr. Capote is in complete confusion or abysmally ignorant of the society , its aims and teachings . " <P> By definition , theosophy is a cross between theology and philosophy . In practice , it is a religion-although its 34,000 practitioners in 45 countries maintain that it is not . Theosophists have always claimed divine insight , revealed in some cases on shafts of mystical " astral light . " <P> Their practice is an ancient one . Theosophy was taught by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zarathustra . To one degree or another , its tenets are alive today among the Brahmans , Buddhists and Hindus of India , not to mention all the world 's hippies . In the West , however , theosophical thought had been all but dead since the 7th century , when Moslem armies swept out of Arabia and disrupted communications between Europe and the East . Then , in the 19th century , came Madame Blavatsky.
