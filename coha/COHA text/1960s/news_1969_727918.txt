txt You 've seen the scene so many times you know it by heart . First there 's the close-up of the native hula girls , handsome in leis and grass skirts and moving their hands and hips expressively in the traditional dance . Then there 's the native youth , gracefully climbing the coconut free . And then there 's a sweeping shot of the whole scene ? dancing girls , little grass shack , row of coconut trees , white sand beach and rolling surf of the blue Pacific . It 's all been shown repeatedly in the living rooms of nearly every tourist who has ever taken a camera to Hawaii . The pictures were taken at a free 90-minute show put on two or three times a week by the Eastman Kodak Co. since 1937 . The show had become to Honolulu what the Empire State Building is to New York , what the Golden Gate Bridge is to San Francisco and what Jackie Gleason is to Miami Beach . But the new mayor did n't like it , and last month he closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here since Queen Liliuokalani was dethroned in 1893 . Mayor Frank Fa.si , it turns out , does n't care for tourists . " I 'm not going to see this island developed for tourists , " flatly states the 49-year-old mayor , who " came into office in January . " It will be developed for our own island people . I do n't care how many tourists come here or how many dollars they bring . " More specifically , he says the Kodak show was " a commercial eyesore that returned no financial benefit to the city . " Those are fighting words in this state , - where tourism is the largest private industry , and so the battle was quickly joined . As soon as Mayor Fast told Eastman Kodak it would have to vacate Kapiolani Park , the picturesque site of the show , Gov . John A- Burns , a fellow Democrat , jumped in . Some Moves &; Countermoves The park was state property , he said , even though it had for years been maintained and operated by the city . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the show , rent-free as usual , and with his blessing . The mayor did n't stand still for that . He promptly ordered city workers to remove the bleachers that the hula visitors sat in , and the stands were trucked to some Little League baseball fields . In response , the state dug up some of its own stands and put them up , and the company rushed to clean them and repaint them a bright orange and green . That did it . Mayor Fasi went to court seeking an injunction that would close the show for violating city zoning laws that prevailed no matter who owned the real estate . Eastman Kodak never had formal city approval to use the park , anyhow , the mayor says . Letting one company use public property for private gain would , he fears , open the door to others out to exploit Waildki 's shrinking beach parks . Circuit Court Judge Yasutaka Fukushima ruled in the city 's favor , holding that the show was an " amusement facility " illegally located in a residential zone . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , the governor is mad and Eastman Kodak is trying to be rather diplomatic about the whole thing . The most pointed thing a company spokesman will say is that the show had " a promotional benefit to Hawaii that perhaps has been overlooked by Mayor Fasi . " The - company hopes to set up its show later in a commercially zoned site , though most people here agree no site can match the beauty of Kapiolani Park . The Eastman Kodak spokesman says the company " certainly hates to disappoint so many people , " and it 's clear that among the most disappointed is Eastman Kodak itself . For one thing , a film store near the site was selling $200 to $650 of film on each show day , according to the mayor 's office , and much of this film presumably was Kodak 's . But others also are disappointed . " It 's just a tragedy , " says Edith W. Loomis , head of the Waikiki Beach tourist information office of the Hawaii visitors Bureau . Complaints From Abroad Len Gorrell Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints about the closing from clients as far away as New Zealand and Australia . " Why did the mayor have to make such a big deal about the show ? " Other tour operators agree . They regularly ran buses to the site and some scheduled it as the main event of a morning 's activities . Not everyone is mad at Mayor Fast , however ( though a local disk jockey does play the Lone Ranger theme song to introduce news front city hall ) . A housewife in the area says the traffic is n't nearly as bad now that the show is over . And one long-time resident says the show was misleading , anyway . " That whole deal gave people a totally false impression of Hawaii , 12 he says . " Hell , they bad about the only guy in town who can climb a coconut tree . "
