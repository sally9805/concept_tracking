the battle 's ending anytime soon seems remote . It may die down to an angry ! nutter , though , for Michigan at least has learned that it does the state no good to shout about its shortcomings in tones that all the world can hear . There arc also plans afoot to send out emissaries to beat the drums for its advantages , in the hope that this joyful noise will drown out the sounds of strife at home . " We have been so busy advertising our adversities , we have ignored our assets , " one doleful Nlichigander said . " We 've got to reverse that emphasis . We surely ca n't sweep our troubles under the rug , but we do n't have to flaunt them . " To an outsider with no particular bias one way or the other , Michigan 's problems seem to stem from the operation of social and economic forces that even a state which was not divided against itself would find hard to control . In the first place , the state is in the wrenching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a century ago Democrats were as rare in Michigan as alligators , and they enjoyed about the same social standing . The state was solidly and complacently Republican , and stubbornly antiunion and pro-open shop . Today the state is almost evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans , and is the stronghold of two of the nation 's most powerful unions  --  the Teamsters and the United Automobile Workers . The change-over began in the ' 30 's , when , with Franklin D. , Roosevelt in the White House and a liberal governor , Frank Murphy , in the Statehouse at Lansing , the automobile workers employed the new technique of the sit-down strike against the auto makers . Murphy resisted all urging that the strikers be prodded out with bayonets , and the sit-downs were successful . General Motors and Chrysler were the first to fall , and Ford , after a bitter fight , capitulated to a Federal order in 1941 . Since then , under the banner of the Democrats , labor has grown in strength , and the Democratic Party has grown in numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties will east about 1,9.00,000 Republican votes .

The Democrats , therefore , will elect a governor and the state 's administrative officers . But , by what the Democrats denounce as malapportionment and by what the Republicans praise as a " balanced legislature , " the Republicans will end up even Stephen in the lower house and with overwhelming control of the state Senate , where the apportionment is heavily weighted in favor of the less populous " out-state " counties . The result has been a political stalemate  --  and the near breakdown of the democratic process . The Republicans , representing the point of view of industry and the conservative farm element , over .1 period of a dozen ya . gleefully wrecked liberal programs advocai , by a Democratic governor , G. Mennen ( Soapy ) Williams .

They favored , instead , legislation that would increase th state sales tax from S to 4 per cent . fight it . 15 This controversy raged for a year , with the contestants butting heads like two bull elks with their antlers locked , neither side being willing to budge an inch . The outcome was inevitable . As a result of the impasse , the state in I 959 found itself in a classic financial jam . From taxes on property , on business activities and franchises , and on sales , the state had been collecting about a billion dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was earmarked for special purposes , such as roads ! / and schools , and was unavailable for the routine operation of the state government . Also , by law , the state was forbidden to borrow more than $250,000 annually . Slowly a huge state deficit built up , which the legislature fought to control by various stopgap measures  --  such as asking business to prepay taxes , which brought in $30,000,000 ; liquidating part of the state 's liquor inventory , which provided $18,000,000 more ; passing some $50,000,000 worth of nuisance taxes on liquor , tobacco , telephone calls and telegrams . Finally , though , the moment of truth arrived . The deficit was nearing $100,000,000 . The general fund was nearly empty . The legislature was stubbornly resisting Williams 's insistence that the Veterans Trust Fund be liquiI dated to provide ready cash . When , for the first time , state // ( Continued from Page 15 ) employees missed a payroll , the legislature capitulated . The $50,000,000 Veterans Fund was tapped for 540,500,000. and a few days later the employees got their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word had spread that Michigan was broke , and wags in bars began ordering a new drink , " Michigan on the Rocks . " Last December Williams had to do some capitulating himself . The people , in a referendum , had approved a constitutional amendment permitting a 1 per cent rise in the sales tax  --  on the purely human reasoning perhaps that , though an income tax must be paid in chunks , a sales tax is paid in dribbles and therefore is less painful . In December Williams somewhat morosely called the legislature into special session for the purpose of legalizing this new tax . With the brusqueness with which he customarily handled the lawmakers , he warned them that none of the increase should be allocated ; all should go into the general fund . This irritated the legislators , who had no intention of doing otherwise , as they knew Williams was aware . It was one of Williams 's last official acts as governor , Weary and scarred after twelve years in office , he had not chosen to run again in 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve on a larger stage  --  perhaps as Democratic presidential or vice presidential nominee . This call had not come , possibly because of the fiscal fiasco the state had suffered during his governorship . In fact , some Democrats accuse the Republicans of deliberately leading the state to the verge of financial chaos out of a malign desire to wreck Williams 's national political ambitions . Whether or not this is true , it is a fact that the Republicans were highly pleased when President-elect Kennedy chose Williams as his Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs . " lf I 'd known Jack Kennedy was going to send Soapy to Africa , " one stanch Republican is quoted as having said , " I would have voted for him myself " The departure of Williams served to clear the air somewhat , for , despite his honesty and his sincere dedication to his liberal beliefs , it was clear after twelve years that he would never be able to command the confidence of the business community nor overcome the Republicans ' stern opposition to him personally and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swainson , the former lieutenant governor , is still an unknown quantity . The more intransigent Republicans consider turn to be the mouthpiece of August Scholle , the state president of the AFL-CIO  --  just as Scholle looks upon the Republican state senators as the captives of the auto makers and the big chemical interests . There are a few hopeful gleams , however , on the political horizon ; before his inauguration in January , Governor-elect Swainson called in leaders of industry for an exploratory chat , a peaceful gesture which , his critics say , never would have occurred to Williams . As a former state senator , Swainson is also expected to deal more gently with the legislature than did Williams . " We do n't know yet how he 's going to turn out , " a Republican said . " It may be we are going to get along pretty smoothly . But if he starts pushing for an income tax or a corporation profits tax , the fight is going to start all over again . " This makes a renewal of the battle almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made in recent years by experts from both within and without the state . All agree that , if Michigan is to provide the services her people want , some form of income tax and corporation tax is the only answer . The increase in the sales tax , though it will provide about 5120,000,000 in new revenue in a normal business year , is considered as merely a palliative . It will , however , give the state a breathing spell while sounder tax measures can be worked out , Governor Swainson , in his first budget , which called for expenditures of 5461,200,000 for fiscal 1961-62 , anticipated a surplus of $15,700,000 , which can be applied to the state 's over-all deficit of $55,800,000 . Thus , with the help of the sales tax , the state will be freed from the hand-to-mouth financing of the past few years . The tax economists are agreed , however , that the state 's problems are far from solved . Business is not merely crying wolf when it complains that Michigan 's present taxes fall heavier on industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the franchise tax and the business activities tax all add up to a heavier burden in Michigan than in the competing industrial states of Ohio . Indiana and Illinois . The business activities tax also falls unequally on those businesses which feel its bite . In essence a " value-added " tax , it hurts the small business which is just getting started , and the big business which is doing a lot of buying and selling , but showing little or no profit . " What do you expect , " growls Scholle , the state AFL-CIO leader , a truculent man . " G.M. 's lawyers wrote the law . " After years of squabbling , the mood of the citizens at the moment is one of anger and impatience with both Democrats and Republicans  --  and with the powerful economic forces which they represent . The state , its citizens feel , has been need lessly hurt by the stubbornness of men in both parties , who have put political partisanship above the needs of the state . One prominent Michigander who has sensed the growing spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment is trying to harness and direct this discontent into useful channels . George Romney , president of American Motors , has organized a group called Citizens for Michigan , which brings together labor leaders , industrialists , Democrats , Republicans and independents dedicated to doing what they think is best for Michigan without regard to party or the labor-management struggle . The group recently came out for flat-rate personal and corporate income taxes , a recommendation which did not endear Romney to his fellow industrialists . With a membership of some 5000. organized in small groups al ! over the state , the Romney organization is also beating the drums strongly for a constitutional convention . One of the most obvious needs , nearly everyone agrees , is a complete revision of the fifty-two-year-old constitution . which is by now a patchwork of amendments . In a referendum next April , the voters will approve  --  or disapprove  --  a proposal to rewrite the constitution in light of the needs of 1961 and thereafter . A few of the tougher problems which a convention would consider are a reapportionment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a return to the legislature of more control over the allocation of state funds and a removal of the $250,000 limitation on state borrowing . Economists know , however , that great forces are at work in Michigan over which political reapportionment and tax revision can have but little control . During World War 11 and the Korean War . Michigan was proud to be the armorer for the United States and its allies , turning out tanks , trucks , wheeled guns and bombing planes . Today the pattern of defense production has changed radically , from wheeled vehicles and aircraft to missiles and the myriad electronic components which serve them . Michigan realizes now that in her traditional concentration on the things she had always made , she let the Space Age pass her by . The new electronics industry and the missile industry grew up around the great universities of New England and California , leaving Michigan still dependent upon the automobile and the truck . Nobody worried much at first , as defense jobs dwindled from 230,000 in 1953 to fewer than 30,000 today . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1955 it had the biggest year in its history , turning out 7,942,125 cars . In 1960 it had its second biggest year , producing 6,697,252 . But here , too , great changes that were damaging to Michigan have been taking place . For reasons that basically have little to do with taxes or wages or politics , or a so-called " bad business climate . " but with changes in freight-rate regulations , the auto industry has begun to decentralize . New engine and body plants have gone up in states nearer to the steel mills , to save transportation costs . New assembly plants have been scattered all over the United States , to bring the industry nearer to its markets . The auto makers are also beginning to build more and more components of the finished car in their own facilities , to the economic distress of their Michigan suppliers . Even when the auto industry expanded within the state , the expansion was of a different form than in the past . Millions were spent on huge and complicated machines that did not create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation was not sudden and dramatic . It was a creeping thing . Today fifteen assembly-line workers would be replaced by a machine , tomorrow twenty more , next week thirty . The figures , however , did tell a dramatic story , revealing that the auto industry not only was producing more cars with fewer men , but Michigan was employing a smaller and smaller part of the total work force . In 1953 , 929,000 auto workers , 503,000 of them in Michigan , produced 6,100,000 cars . In 1960 , about 800,000 workers produced 6,697,000 cars , but the number employed in Michigan had dropped to 310,000 . Both management and labor understand the implications of this vast industrial and social change . Neither yet knows how to soften its impact , other than through the long , slow process of developing new , diversified industries and retraining men to serve therein . There is a story , probably apocryphal , of Henry Ford II showing Walter Reuther a huge new plant at Cleveland where one man at a console was operating a gigantic machine that was turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ford is supposed to have said , " where are your members ? " " Henry . " said the president of the U.A.W .. " where are your customers ? " The story illustrates a point which Gus Scholle , the state president of the AFL-CIO. is fond of making . The fact of automation is not something for labor alone , or for management alone , or for Michigan or Detroit alone , to worry about . In time it will affect every facet of the nation 's economy and will become the concern of every agency of government . Right now , in Michigan , it is the concern of the agencies dealing with welfare and the social services . As a result not only of automation but also of decentralization and the changing pattern of defense production , in Michigan today some 193,000 men and women are out of work . Thousands more  --  white February sb , 1961 / immigrants from the hills of Kentucky and Tennessee , and Negro workers from Alabama and Mississippi who came to Michigan during the war boom  --  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who stayed on , hoping things would get better , is not a cheerful one . They can live awhile on unemployment compensation . Michigan business complains  --  with justification  --  that the state pays a higher unemployment tax than competing states , and there is grumbling that the Democrats have turned Michigan into a welfare slate . The man who has lost his job would hardly agree . The most he can receive is the maximum benefit of fifty-five dollars a week for twenty-six weeks , but only about 2 per cent ever qualify for this amount . The average " draw " is thirteen weeks at thirty-six dollars a week . Once this is finished , he must use up all his sayings , borrow until his credit runs out and cash in whatever he owns until his last resource is exhausted . Then , when he is destitute , he becomes eligible for relief . The state is not nearly as badly off as it was in the recession of 1958 , when 360,000 persons drew 5323,000,000 in unemployment compensation . This year 's payments will total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worried about 1961 ; the auto industry went into the new year with 997,620 unsold cars in dealers ' hands , of which 100,000 were 1960 models . This was the biggest inventory in history for January , and it presages a cutback in this year 's production to an estimated 5,800,000 cars , with consequent increased unemployment . Today in the Detroit area , where some 100,000 men and women are jobless , there are 9000 families , totaling 36,000 people , on the welfare rolls , and 1700 other applications for relief are pending . Eighty-one per cent of them are Negroes , for the Negro , often lowest in work skilIs and education , has been the first to feel the pinch of hard times . Throughout the state as a whole , 29,190 families arc receiving some form of assistance . Contrary to a popular notion , these are not all newcomers who allegedly would rather draw a $130-a-month relief check in Detroit than work at a job in the South . Most were born in the state or have lived and worked there for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who need help . Only those who have been self-supporting for a year are eligible for relief . More recent arrivals , who presumably still have roots in their native soil , are urged to go back where they came from . Wayne County , in which Detroit is located , pays the transportation home for about 450 families a year . " it 's tough to get on the relief rolls here , " a welfare official said . " It 's tougher to stay on . Every time a man endorses his welfare check , he reaffirms his need for help . If our investigators find he 's using his money for nonessentials , off he goes . " The Wayne County welfare officials watch their S23,000,000-a-year budget with a careful eye , Payment is strictly according to need . An active man gets a food budget of 539.50 a month . A sedentary man gets 528.10 . An active woman gets $30.70 , a sedentary woman twenty-six dollars . Clothing is issued only as needed , and the clothing budget is limited to a little over one dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed for school . " We have n't got a man on welfare , " the official said , " who had n't rather be working than going through what he has to go through to draw his welfare check . " This appraisal seems true . One of the most miserable of all winter jobs is that of washboy at the innumerable quick-carwash places to which Detroiters bring their automobiles in the interminable fight to save the metal and finish from the salt the road crews spread on icy streets and highways . Yet every morning , when the car-wash places open , a dozen men are queued up , hoping to get a day 's work . One specter that haunts Detroit is the possibility that unemployment will aggravate racial tensions . The Negro population of Detroit has increased from 150 , - 000 in 1940 to an estimated 450,000 now . Within six miles of City Hall the population is almost one half Negro , and there is a small but constant movement from this downtown area into former all-white neighborhoods , nearly every one of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes out . Since the bloody riots of 1943 , a hard-working city Committee on Community Relations , with the help of the unions and the churches , has managed to keep peace between the races . But tension exists , and hunger and discontent could cause an explosion . Detroit and Michigan both feel that they can handle the problems of the immediate present , but they can see trouble 87 looming in the years ahead . Even without the great in-migration of the past , more than 800,000 youngsters will come to working age between now and 1970 , and their presence in the work force will create a need for thousands of new jobs . Where will these jobs come from ? The automobile industry can not be expected to provide them , for decentralization will continue , and automation will continue . The obvious answer is for Michigan , with its great reservoir of highly productive workers , to diversify , to start manufacturing new things for a new age . ' iii E But what new things ? To find that answer Michigan will turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ann Arbor has always been famed for its research in the fields of human relationships , and Michigan State at East Lansing has held an equal eminence in agricultural research . Neither has been notably outstanding in their exploration of the far frontiers of physics , chemistry and electronics . Today at Ann Arbor , though , a $7,000,000 research laboratory is under way , which will concentrate in these fields from which new industries are born . " We 've quarreled our way into a mess , " one Michigan professor said . " Now we 've got to think our way out of it . " There are , of course , many factors in Michigan 's favor which hold out the promise of a busy future once the troubled time of political and economic transition is over . The state 's one greatest asset , perhaps , is her geographical location in the industrial heartland of America  --  an area reaching westward from New Jersey and Pennsylvania through Ohio , Indiana , Michigan , Illinois and Minnesota . All the southern part of her lower peninsula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of the great urbanized region which is moving westward along the shores of the Great Lakes , from Buffalo and Cleveland to Detroit , Toledo and Chicago . Her markets , therefore , are all around her , and they are growing . In a nation growing thirsty for municipal and industrial water , Michigan , with her thousands of Lakes and rivers , is truly , as her automobile tags boast , a Water Wonderland . Her climate , too , is an asset , though a visitor from farther south , arriving in Detroit in a blizzard , would not think so . Her winters , however , are relatively mild compared with those of her more frigid neighbors , and Chamber of Commerce drum beaters like to point out that , when Buffalo gets fourteen inches of snow . Detroit gets an inch . Her summer climate , too , is salubrious enough to attract 10.000,000 visitors a year to camp . swim , sail , fish and spend some $650,000,000 , and fall brings in more than 400,000 deer hunters from all over the Midwest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience of her people , drawn from all the nations of Europe and from most of the regions of the United States . The state has known great prosperity before and periods of deepest depression , for in a state which has always depended on raw materials or heavy durable goods for its wealth , the cyclic swings have been violent . " When times are good , " said Dr. William Haber , University of Michigan economist , " we eat higher on the hog than anybody else . When times are bad , we get hungrier . " Always , though , when the hungry times have come , the state has turned to something else to build a prosperity greater than it had known before . When Jean Nicolet , the French explorer came down from Quebec , he was so sure he was on the Northwest Passage that would lead to far Cathay that he brought along a robe of silk damask in which to greet the Great Khan of Tartary . He did n't find the treasures of the Orient , but he did find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muskrat , and Michigan 's first source of riches was its furs . When the fur trade died with the near extinction of the muskrat and the collapse of the beaver hat , the assault on the great forests began . The sons of the fur trappers became lumberjacks , felling the great stands of pine and hardwoods , and Michigan 's first millionaires started building their rococo mansions along the SATURDAY EVENING T. , ' shores of Lake St. Clair . Before the forests had been completely despoiled , mining began in the upper peninsula , and other fortunes were built on copper and iron as the sons of the lumberjacks turned now to the miner 's trade . The opening of the great Mesabi range in Minnesota crippled the iron industry . and the discovery of surface copper in the West killed the copper mines , for Michigan 's remaining iron and copper lie deep under glacial drift and are expensive to produce . By this time , though , the turn of the century was at hand . R. E Olds had gone chugging through the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodge brothers were tinkering with their gasoline-powered buggies , and Michigan was plunging headlong into the age of the automobile . It has since cared for little , and thought of little , but building automobiles . It has n't needed to . And the discovery that this once all-powerful industry can no longer support the state in the manner to which it has become accustomed has left her citizens with a profound sense of bewilderment and shock . For it is clear now that the years ahead , as Michigan desperately casts about for other jobs to do , will be rough ones , and things well may get worse before they get better . How bad they may become depends in large degree on the two power groups  --  big labor and big industry  --  which have transferred their ancient tug of war from the picket line and the bargaining table to a new arena  --  the legislative halls . If they stop fighting and work together to meet the challenge of the great social and economic forces that confront them both , the future may be brighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oho went into the bar and ordered a " Michigan on the Rocks " may prove to have been more a prophet than a clown .
