" All economic progress is essentially an incessant struggle between the call of the future and the defense of the past . " So said French Economist Jacques Rueff last week as he presented the report of a 16-man government committee appointed last year to find out what is hampering France 's efforts to expand . The committee , guided by Rueff , architect of the successful franc devaluation in 1958 and a fervent apostle of free enterprise , and Louis Armand , postwar boss of the French nationalized railroads and later first president of Euratom , found that plenty ails French business-much of it a legacy of protectionism and special privilege from the past . The Rueff-Armand report called for a sweeping liberalization and restoration of free enterprise in French economic life , from the way bread is made to the number of taxis in Paris . <P> Too Many Laws . Encumbered by too many laws and overlapping rules , France relies too much on faith in paper regulations , not enough on enforcement . Cartels that restrict competition are all too blithely tolerated , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far too many subsidies supporting inefficient businesses , e.g. , in the alcohol , sugar and flour-milling industries . Farms are often too small to reap the harvest of mechanization , and inefficient tenant farmers are kept in business by state grants . The food distribution system is archaic , encouraging low turnover and high profit margins . The report 's solution : a telecommunications system to create a nationwide produce market in which prices can respond to supply and demand . <P> The professions and trades are full of abuses . Qualifying exams for licenses and permits are often run unfairly by those already in the closed circle , and even those candidates who pass must frequently buy their way in . The bakers run a tight , tough trade association , and in preserving the " little shop ' ' also perpetuate obsolescent , often unhygienic baking methods . The report recommends the introduction of large-scale industrial baking , and real competition in bread pricing . <P> Too Much Pressure . Since the report steps on nearly every Frenchman 's toes-except the consumer's-and since nearly every French worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cries of outrage were predictable . Sniffed the Confederation of Small and Medium Enterprises : " A perfect insignificance and a complete platitude , a collection of all the commonplaces . " <P> At week 's end Premier Debr scheduled the first ministerial committee session to debate the report and draw up parliamentary bills . No French official believes the Rueff-Armand recommendations have any chance of complete adoption , but even piece by piece their gradual enactment would signal a far-reaching stride toward a freer , more productive French economy .
