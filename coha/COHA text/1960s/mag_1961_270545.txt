For years people have talked back to their television sets - " Why do n't you shut up ? " " Give ' em hell , Harry " - but not until Mitch Miller came along did viewers sling an arm around the old tube and sing along with it . A three-year-old phenomenon of the record industry , Miller 's eleven Sing Along with Mitch albums have sold well over 4,000,000 copies . Now appearing fortnightly on NBC with a 28-man chorus of bald basses and potted tenors - last week 's show was the third of the series - he has set new rating highs with such material as Toot , Toot , Tootsie ! , I 've Been Working on the Rail road and Beautiful Ohio . <P> Schmalted Milk . The show uses female soloists but concentrates on the chorus ( " These guys look like people at home , " says Mitch , " the man in his undershirt , or the banker " ) . Mitch directs , tossing his own baritone into the ground swell , and when there is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there droppin ' his g 's an ' spittin ' out words like " vittles " and " shucks " through forever ripplin ' smiles . But he keeps his comments to less than four minutes in the hour-long show . <P> The rest is mail-order melody all the way . Juggling metaphors , Showman Miller says : " You 've got to hook the audience fast and never let them step off the edge of the curb . " Who really sings along on the curb ? Evidence is that a great many people do , variously primed by nostalgia , beer , 200-to-1 martinis , or schmalted milk . In their living rooms , viewers may be less inhibited than they once were when the old bouncing ball of the movie shorts went thud-thud-thud into oblivion . <P> Woofing to Mars . A 49-year-old man with a 20-year-old beard , Mitch Miller is something more than a jolly Shylock demanding his pound of flats . Trained at the Eastman School of Music , he played the oboe with the Syracuse Symphony and with the Rochester Philharmonic , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury Records asked him to supervise some popular recordings . One munch of that pop coin was all he needed . Becoming an artists-and-repertory man , responsible for selecting songs , singers , bands and arrangements , he soon shifted to Columbia Records , where he became the top operator in the business , " inventing " stars ( he never says he has " discovered " them ) from Johnny Mathis to Guy Mitchell , Tony Bennett , Frankie Laine and Rosemary Clooney . <P> Now a leading performer himself , he receives sacks of fan mail , which are duly piled in his office in Manhattan 's Columbia Records Building among Picasso lithographs and a stereo system that seemingly could woof its way to Mars . Turning up every working morning at 8 a.m. , Miller sits alone in the quiet building and contemplates the bags of mail , while he dutifully practices on his oboe and sends its melancholy notes into the empty halls . He does not regret his departure from serious music ( " Classical musicians today , " he observes , " are worse off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own best invention .
