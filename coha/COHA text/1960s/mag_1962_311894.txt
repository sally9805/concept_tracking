THE VIKING BOOK OF APHORISMS ( 405 pp. ) - Selected by W. H. Auden and Louis Kronenberger - Viking ( $6.50 ) . <P> An aphorism forces the eye off the page and into the contemplative middle distance ; it takes a moment 's time to decide whether the author has skewered a truth or merely shaken it up . The collectors have selected from the great aphorists such as G. K. Chesterton and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg , but also from such little-known men of perception as Claude Bernard and the late Cesare Pavese . <P> Samplings : <P> &gt; The man who is too old to learn was probably always too old to learn . - Henry S. Haskins . <P> &gt; To deprive elderly people of their bogeys is as brutal as snatching from babies their big stuffed bears . -L . P. Smith . <P> &gt; Art is I ; Science is We . - Claude Bernard . <P> &gt; All women become like their mothers . That is their tragedy . No man does . That is his . - Oscar Wilde . <P> &gt; Perched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on our own behind . - Montaigne . <P> &gt; Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices . - Emerson . <P> &gt; The anarchist is disappointed with the future as well as the past . - Chesterton . <P> All in all , it is a book to beguile an idle interval , to start a line of thought , or at least to glean a nugget suitable for dropping into the next dinner-table pause .
