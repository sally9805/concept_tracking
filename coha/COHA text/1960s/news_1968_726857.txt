txt As nearly as a single event can date a long-term relationship between nations the " special relationship " between the United States and Great Britain began in Manila Bay in the spring of 1898 . A British admiral put his squadron be- Secretary of State Rusk . . . urges prevention of sudden British withdrawal east of Suez . tween ' Admiral Dewey 's fleet and a German fleet . Shortly after , the German admiral hoisted anchor and steamed away . To this day The Ends of the Earth Club ' in London celebrates that first incident of Anglo-American military cooperation . Between then and now , the relationship grew into the great partnership of World War II . It survived through the Korean conflict . It was set back sharply by disagreement over the Suez crisis of 1956 . It has further declined during the Vietnam fighting.Tor the first time since 1898 one of the partners has remained disapprovingly aloof from a major military effort by the other . Now further and heavy strains are put upon it . Britain 's economy has been weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget savings which would help to restore the balance has led in London to the cost of Britain 's world role . This has meant the cost of maintaining a military presence in Southeast Asia , the Indian Ocean , and the Persian Gulf . This has meant also the cost of buying 50 American F-111 fighter-bombers . Rusk-Brown talks Washington much wants a continued British presence " east of Suez . " In Washington last week United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk urged British Foreign Secretary George Brown to do his utmost in ' London to prevent any deep or sudden British withdrawal from anywhere " east of Suez . " Washington has its own balance-of-payments problem . British withdrawal , from anywhere , means a heavier burden on the American military establishment . The hope in Washington has been that Britain would Britain 's George Brown . . . does n't want to stop the world to have his country get off . continue to keep the peace from Singapore to Suez . And the hope in Washington has been that Britain would go through with the standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with trimmings , is worth nearly a billion dollars of foreign exchange to the United // States . Any cutback in existing British orders for American military equipment adds just that much to the American balance-of-payments deficit . Mr. Brown needed no urging in Washington . He himself is a sincere believer in a world role for Britain . He does not want to stop the world to have his country get off . He went back to London and the final Cabinet decisions there armed with talking points and arguments . But we have now come to a point in Anglo-American relations where the decisions being taken by governments are being influenced more heavily by isolationist tendencies than by " internationalist " urges . Britain will probably suffer as much as any other country from the holdback of both American tourists and American investment dollars . The idea of balancing the tourist flow is made unrealistic by Britain 's own L50 limit on foreign travel allowances . How many British people can visit the United States on 50 newly devalued pounds ? Shrinking-down process Britain to this day remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons and weapons delivery systems . And only three are today still interested in the whole world . Britain is one of the three . The other two are the United States and the Soviet Union . Washington has been so long accustomed to sharing responsibility , and problems , and the thinking about such things , with Britain - . that it faces with concern and deepest regret the trends of the day in London .. Britain is visibly withdrawing from the world and turning toward Europe . A world power is in the . process of shrinking down into the role of a European city state . That process is not yet complete . The decisions are not yet irrevocable . The withdrawal from " east of Suez " can not be completed in a month , or a year , or even two years . Until it is complete , it could be reversed . But the trend is in that direction . And the meeting in the State Department between Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Foreign Secretary George Brown had , to those present , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila Bay in the spring of 1898 . Present at that meeting with the principals were teams of diplomats whose lives and habits of thought have been spent within the assumption of a special Anglo-American relationship . Every man there began his career during the partnership of World War II . And every man there began to practice diplomacy in the partnership of the " cold war . " To men like Sir Paul Gore Booth , Britain 's top professional diplomat , the Anglo-American relationship has been the normal way of life . His generation grew up regarding it as the finest vehicle ever fashioned for sustaining Western civilization and protecting the peace of the world . Costs become decisive But to survive it requires that Britain remain a world power with worldwide interests . And that is where the costs become decisive . To the left wing of Harold Wilson 's Labour Party free pills are more to be desired than a British voice in Asia and pensions than fighter-bombers . And Mr. Wilson dare not alienate his left wing , which always has been passionately anti-American anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance . George Brown did come to Washington just before the budget decisions had to be taken in London . And he did have a good talk with his close personal friend , Robert S. McNamara . But Mr. McNamara will not be Secretary of Defense when Mr. Brown comes next to Washington . Nor can things be quite the same between President and Prime Minister when Harold Wilson arrives next month following a visit to Moscow . The chapter will not end suddenly , any more than it began suddenly . And one can not yet discern the shape of the chapter which comes after . Some people today are talking and thinking about an Atlantic free trade area . It would be mostly Britain , United States , and Canada . Perhaps it would include Britain 's partners in EFTA . Some would include Australia and New Zealand . But is this more than a nostalgic clutching to the past ? No one can say what happens ahead . But the events of this week are a twilight sequel only to the great story of Anglo-American partnership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
