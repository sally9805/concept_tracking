At a midnight press conference in Baghdad 's Defense Ministry , Iraq 's " sole leader , ' ' Major General Abdul Karim Kassem . <P> last week threw down the boldest chal lenge to Western oilmen since Iran 's Mohammed Mossadegh expropriated the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. in 1951 . Kassem 's move : the establishment of a government-owned company to produce and market Iraqi oil . <P> Ever since he seized power in 1958 . Kassem has been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Iraq Petroleum Co. , the international consortium that since 1942 has held exclusive oil exploration rights for virtually all of Iraq and has already found there proven reserves of 26.5 billion bbl. of oil . In the last four years alone , I.P.C. has invested nearly $300 million in Iraq , and Kassem 's government is largely financed by its 50% cut ( $266 million last year ) of I.P.C. 's profits . But this was not enough for Kassem , who demanded that I.P.C. surrender 20% of its stock to the Iraqi government and relinquish some of its exploratory concessions as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily gave ground un til at last it offered to surrender 75% of its concession area immediately and give up another 15% within seven years . But the more the I.P.C. offered , the more Kassem asked . Last October , crying ' ' we shall rid ourselves of wickedness , " Kassem finally broke off the talks , revoked all I.P.C. concessions save those covering 740 sq . mi. in which the company was currently producing oil . Then he began laying the groundwork for last week 's establishment of a national oil company . <P> Because of the worldwide oil glut and Iraq 's shortage of skilled technicians , some Western oilmen insist that Kassem 's venture is foredoomed to failure . But unlike Iran 's Mossadegh . Kassem has prudently allowed the foreign oil company to continue production , thus assuring himself of a continuing income while he dickers for help in getting his own company on its feet . And help may not be hard to find . The Soviet Union might aid Kassem simply for political advantage . And in Rome sits hawk-faced Enrico Mattei , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defying the big Western oil companies . Though Mattei is getting oil more cheaply from Russia than he probably could from Iraq , he is under mounting pressure from other Common Market members to cut back his imports of Soviet oil . A deal with Kassem could offer Mattei the one strength he now lacks : a reliable major oil supply of his own . <P> <P> - Jointly owned by British Petroleum ( formerly Anglo Iranian Oil ) , Royal Dutch/Shell , Compagnie Francaise des Petroles .
