U.S. housewives , long on gadgets and short on help , often look enviously to the Old World as a place where washing machines may be few but willing hands are plentiful , where every household is stuffed with old family retainers or cheerful peasants delighted to cook , clean , mend and mind the children for a pittance . The maidless American may be glad to know that this dream of domestic bliss is flickering out ; all through the Western world , servants are increasingly in short supply . <P> Revolution of Expectations . In Italy , where just after the war a cook could be had for $3 a month and a housemaid for $2.50 , servants are scarce at $70 a month in Rome and $100 in the more prosperous northern cities such as Milan and Genoa . And a law passed in 1958 forces the employer to pay fringe benefits and bonuses that double the basic wage . Even at that , housewives are combing the desperately poor regions of Sicily and Sardinia for the underprivileged , down to eight-year-old orphans who cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants with various blandishments , including medical care and pensions to a maid 's parents . <P> The appeal of Italy 's booming factories accounts only partly for the change . More basically , sociologists blame that well-known " revolution of expectations , " which has now reached Italian youth . What they see at the movies and on television leads those on the economic fringes to want more out of life . Says one Italian householder : " The unhappier our maid gets , the more we let her look at television . And the more she looks at television , the unhappier she gets . " <P> <P> Many domestics are working only as a temporary expedient to better themselves on the installment plan . One American housewife in Rome recently discovered this the hard way when she invited an important Italian couple to dinner . No food appeared . Out in the kitchen , the housewife found the maid in tears . " I ca n't serve tonight , " she sobbed . " You see , I 'm buying an apartment , and your guests live next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , they 'll never accept me socially . " <P> In West Germany , where there are now fewer than 500,000 servants in a population of more than 55 million , employers advertise with wheedling humility : " We are seeking a young domestic employee who has joy in independence , in a cultivated , modern , mechanically well-furnished household . Cooking can be learned . " <P> Germany 's traditional Putzfrauen ( cleaning women ) are coming to work in hairdos and stiletto heels . Even the name Putzfrau is disappearing . Now it is Raumpflegerin ( room tender ) , or Bodenkosmetikerin ( floor cosmetician ) . " Nowadays , " the saying goes , " instead of choosing between guns and butter , the middle-class German has to choose between having a Putzfrau or having a Mercedes , a vacation in Majorca and a TV set . And when he opts for thetPutzfrati , it 's she who goes to Majorca , buys the TV set and makes a down payment on a car . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
