Ever since he wrote the opinion in the 1954 school case , the mere mention of Chief Justice Earl Warren has been enough to redden the neck of any good segregationist . When Warren agreed to speak last week in Atlanta at Georgia Tech , authorities began preparing for trouble . <P> Their concern was only prudent . Some 25 signs appeared in Atlanta neighborhoods , pleading " Help Impeach Earl Warren , " most of them paid for by Frank H. Benning , 36 , a member of the John Birch Society . The Atlanta Committee to Impeach Earl Warren wired Warren : YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE . The North Side News , a scruffy Atlanta weekly , called Warren " a California politician who has the Fascist heart of a dictator . " Handbills signed by an " Alumni Committee to Combat Communism at Georgia Tech " begged people to " let this unwelcome visitor speak to the empty hall he deserves , or attend and boo . " <P> Agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation , Atlanta and airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airliner landed last week . Two police cruisers followed the limousine that took him to the Biltmore Hotel . Next day eight uniformed Pinkerton guards , five plainclothesmen and six state and local security cops screened the crowd at Tech 's Alexander Memorial coliseum . <P> But as it turned out , Southern hospitality overcame Southern hostility . When the 71-year-old Chief Justice was introduced , he received standing applause from some 3,600 persons-four times the number that turned out for a lecture in December by Georgia 's newly elected Governor , Carl Sanders , a moderate segregationist . Warren 's serious talk on the relations between science and law ( " Law has not kept abreast of science . . . A world without law is hell-bent for destruction with or without scientific discoveries " ) drew long applause at its end . There were no pickets , no boos , no threats .
