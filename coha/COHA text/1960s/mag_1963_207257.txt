In the gloomy British Railways headquarters on London 's Marylebone Road , a room has been kept carefully locked for months , with its key entrusted to only one man . The room 's treasure : the data for a top-secret report on Britain 's rail system prepared by burly , brusque Dr. Richard Beeching , 49 , who resigned two years ago as technical director of Imperial Chemical Industries to become the nation 's rail-car czar and the highest-paid civil servant ( $67,000 a year ) in British history . Last week the report was finally made public , and Beeching 's thoroughgoing case for a historic revamping of Britain 's railway system proved so compelling that the expected grumbles were outnumbered by the cheers . Said the Daily Mirror : " It 's tough , it 's brilliant , and it 's right . " <P> Cutting the Queen . The British invented railways , and oversold themselves on them . Britain has more track per square mile than any other nation and a rail station for every 2 miles of track . Historically inefficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalization in 1948 , have lost money each year since 1953 at an increasingly alarming rate . In 1961 the loss was $381 million on revenues of $1.3 billion . As a businessman who believes that even a public service should be able to show a profit , Beeching was appalled by what he found . Fully half of the railways ' 17,830 route miles accounted for only 4% of the total passenger traffic and only 5% of the freight ; half of the 7,000 rail stations produced only 2% of passenger revenues . Beeching hired away executives from such well-run firms as Unilever and Royal Dutch-Shell , surveyed every British firm that spent more than $28,000 a year on freight . The finding : British business was bedeviled by nearly 200,000 different freight rates . <P> Dr. Beeching 's prescription for what ails the rails is to cut service drastically . He recommends the closing of 2,363 passenger stations , and the suspension of passenger service on 5,000 route miles , most of which are already served by parallel bus routes ; there would be no trains left on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparing nothing , Beeching even wants to shut down as uneconomical the station that serves the Queen 's Balmoral Castle in Scotland . Earmarked for scrapping are 1,200 of Britain 's beloved " puffing billy " steam engines , 350,000 freight cars and 7,800 passenger cars . By taking such measures , Beeching hopes to save as much as $412 million annually and eliminate much of the Railways ' deficit by 1970 . But with Britain already plagued by rising unemployment , there will be labor pains if his ideas are adopted : he wants to pare at least 70,000 workers from the railways ' 475,000-man work force . <P> Liner Trains . Like most U.S. railroaders , Beeching also wants to carry more freight and fewer passengers . Hoping to attract more business from industry , he will ask for $280 million to start " Liner Train " service , in which piggyback trains would run between major British cities on frequent , fast schedules . Under Beeching 's plan , which Parliament is expected to adopt , the comfortable sound of the puffing billies chugging through the British countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to trade it for the rustle of pound notes .
