This summer 's prize for odd and ag onizing theatrical experiments goes to Broadway Director Harold Clurman ( Bus Stop , Shot in the Dark ) . For six days every week since July 15 , he has been directing a Japanese version of Eu gene O'Neill 's The Iceman Cometh . <P> The genesis of this cultural obstacle course was a 1965 State Department project , in which Clurman took five U.S. actors to Tokyo and there staged Long Day 's Journey into Night for the edification of Japanese actors and di rectors . Later , Tokyo 's prestigious Kumo ( Cloud ) theater company mount ed a Japanese version of the play , which was so successful that it actually broke even - a rare feat for any Japanese pro duction that is not traditional kabuki . <P> <P> Encouraged by this ( and more State Department money ) , Kumo this year invited Clurman to direct it in another O'Neill play . Tennessee Williams , Thornton Wilder and Arthur Miller have been successfully performed in Japan . But O'Neill especially , says Translator Koji Numazawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortuous groping for an answer to the overwhelming question of God 's existence . " Wiggy Look . Clurman expected formidable difficulties : his Japanese vocabulary consists of only ten words . But communication was a comparative cinch . First , he had to pry his cast loose from the stylized posturing of the kabuki influence . " The actors would play for the audience instead of for each oth er , " says Clurman . " This is just the opposite from the technique of modern re alism , in which the actors are supposed to play to each other as if there were no audience at all . " Kabuki also goes in for exaggerated emotions . " When a few tears were called for , " Clurman explains , " I would get a torrent . When a character should be moved , he would go into hysterics . I constantly had to tell them to be natural . " <P> The script 's demand for a passionate kissing scene , for example , brought on only a fit of bashful giggles followed by a friendly peck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department than Americans , but Clurman demonstrated with binoculars that this was not really so ; a glance through the glasses at lovers in a Tokyo park convinced the cast that their stage kisses had been too tame . The uniformly black-haired actors wanted to wear wigs of different colors to make them look more like Americans , but Clurman vetoed the wiggy look . Only Noboru Na-kaya , in the central role of Hickey , was given a shock of red hair . <P> Rehearsals were slow work . Watching the action , Clurman would dictate comments to two translators ( " That girl drops her handbag as though there 's not a yen in it " ) , then pantomime the parts as he wanted them played while the notes were read in Japanese to the actors . Despite this cumbersome procedure and the actors ' difficulty with naturalism , Clurman thinks that he 'll have a hit when the play opens on Sept. 4 . <P> " The cast is really sensitive to direction , " says Clurman-san . " I have never seen such a compliant company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
