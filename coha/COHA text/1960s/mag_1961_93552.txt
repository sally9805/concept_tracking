Deane Beman , a buoyant young man who likes his hair cut short and his cars cut low , is the prospering proof that amateur golf can yield up a spectacular living to the sportsman energetic enough and shrewd enough to play the angles as well as he plays his shots . This can be done without recourse to cash prizes , under-the-table payments , fraudulent betting coups or any of the other nimble trappings of semiprofessional-ism . It can be done merely by selling  --  selling insurance , selling oil or lumber or stocks or even good will  --  and it only partly matters if the salesman is good . As long as his golf is good , other golfers will buy from him  --  and generously . // In recent years dozens of amateurs have discovered this delightful idiosyncrasy of the American golfing public , but few of them have capitalized on it with quite the unflinching determination that characterizes Deane Randolph Beman . One very good reason is that almost none of them can play golf as well as Beman , who at 23 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named to two Walker Cup teams and last year won the U.S. Amateur Championship . Last week in Seattle , Beman teamed with Jack Nicklaus to beat James Walker and Brian Chapman 6 and 5 in the foursomes , then won 3 and 2 over British Amateur Champion Mike Bonallack as he helped the U.S. retain the Walker Cup , 11 matches to one . Next week he will defend his Amateur Championship against 199 golfers at Pebble Beach . // Born into a family of middle-class means and still without his college degree ( he dropped out of the University of Maryland when his business and golf commitments became too heavy ) , Beman has industriously transformed his golfing titles and talents into a fully equipped , air-conditioned , five-bedroom house in a comfortable growing suburb of Washington , D.C. ; also into a fully equipped , air-conditioned 1961 Thunderbird sedan for himself and a 1961 Comet for his wife Miriam ; and into an insurance business that probably will make him a millionaire before he is 30. // On a recent summer morning Beman stood in the front hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to begin a typically businesslike workday . After saying goodby to his two daughters  --  Amy , who will be 3 next month , and Priscilla , born last January  --  he stared dolefully at three tall and bulky silver golf trophies that squatted on the floor . He had held them for a year and it was now time to return them to tournament sponsors . // " I 'll crate these up and send them out tonight , I promise , " he called to Miriam , who was in the kitchen stuffing breakfast dishes into the automatic dishwasher . He ignored the muffled but clearly dubious reply and slipped into the jacket of his neat , dark summer suit . The summer air smote him with a furnace blast as he stepped from the cool of the house into the front yard , but he hurried down the walk with the same crisp , jaunty stride that carries him around a golf course and slid under the wheel of his maroon Thunderbird . Beman enjoys driving this car , but he considers it less a luxury than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you be successful , " he says with more conviction than originality . " When you drive up in a car like this people get the idea that you solid mean business . " ( Solid is a word Beman frequently tosses into sentences for emphasis . To be a business success , he says , you have to " solid like to sell . " ) // The picture of solid success , Beman was now headed toward his office in Arlington , Va. , about 30 minutes by car . Here he and his 29-year-old partner , Bill Buppert , a longtime golfing companion , head up Beman &amp; Buppert Associates , an insurance brokerage firm that handles business and industrial clients mainly in the East but sometimes in places as far distant as California . As he drove , slouched low in the bucket seat , his white straw hat tipped forward on his light-red hair , his fingertips toying casually , insolently with the steering wheel , Beman explained the workings of the company that he and Buppert had formed a year and a half before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Once we 've made an agreement with a company , we go in and help service their existing employee-benefit program , acquaint the employees with their benefits under this program and then sit down individually with each person to work out just how much additional life insurance he needs . This is done through us on a purely individual , optional basis , but the main advantage to the employee is that he can have-his premiums deducted from his paycheck . We have found that better than one in four will take out a policy with us. // " Naturally , the company has to buy the idea before we can put it into effect , but our approach is a strictly informal one . We figure we have to go right to the top man , or the head operations man , anyway , and throw the idea at him . It solid has to click with him . If he buys the concept then the battle 's half won . The sales stimulus now comes from the top down . Right ? Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful at tossing their ideas at the top men that they expect to produce an estimated 5250,000 in new life-insurance premiums this year . At 50% to 60% in commissions , this amounts to at least $125,000 net , and does not include stock options that B. &amp; B. frequently get . This figure would make them one of the major underwriters of personal life insurance in metropolitan Washington , an area that encompasses some 1,500 agents and general agents . They 've had no offers , but the company 's potential is so great that both say they would n't sell out now for even $1 million in cash . // Old high school friends may be startled by the figure , but using hindsight they could have guessed Deane Beman would do well . A skinny boy of medium height , Beman was something of a super-active rascal . " He was the type who 'd always park in the teachers ' parking lot and cut afternoon classes , " recalls Miriam Beman , who started dating her husband at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School . " When I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen glowering teachers . But he 'd tell a funny story , they 'd all laugh and he 'd whiz right off . Then he 'd drive to school the next day and park in the teachers ' lot again . " // Beman has so much brass that while waiting to take Miriam Orndorff out on a date he would recount to a horrified Mrs. Orndorff numerous , if wholly imaginative , disasters that had befallen the Beman family . Even Beman 's longtime golfing friend and principal rival for the Amateur Championship , Jack Nicklaus , has learned to appreciate his artistry with a yarn . " Deane can be a great talker , " says Nicklaus . " When he starts telling some of his stories you 've got to take the square root of what he says and divide by eight to get anywhere near the truth . " // A fine athlete // While Beman may have been a light-hearted storyteller , he was also a proficient and serious athlete . As a junior-high-school undergraduate he starred for the Bethesda-Chevy Chase recreation center 125-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On offense he played right halfback and , though not exceptionally fast , he was as slippery as a wild piston , pumping his knees so high when he carried the ball that he proved a difficult target to tackle . The year he was 13 , in fact , he scored 125 of his team 's 158 points . // Beman started playing golf when he was 12 . His father , Delmar Jr. , is a former football player , golfer and , during high school days , a 220-yard sprinter . Father Beman 's nervous energy makes even his restless son seem sleepy by comparison . Delmar wasted no time getting his family into golf . He came home from his public relations job one day , announced that he had just joined the Bethesda Country Club , and produced six sets of $34.95 golf clubs : one for himself , one for Mrs. Beman , and one each for the four Beman children , Arlene , Del III , Louis and Deane , the youngest . Deane , however , did n't really begin to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately a winner . While still 15 , he was low qualifier from the Washington area for the National Junior . At 16 he went south and pulled a big surprise by winning the South Florida Amateur . And at 17 he qualified for the U.S. Open , one of the youngest golfers ever to do so . // It was not until the spring of 1959 , when Beman was 21 , that he first gained national prominence . He played in Great Britain on the Walker Cup team and then , though his cash ran out , stayed on to score an astonishing victory in the British Amateur . // " I was solid the worst player on the Walker Cup squad , " Beman admits , " but I was determined to play myself back into form . " Beman hit 200 practice shots a day , then , when the tournament began , marched steadily through the Amateur . Leonard Crawley , the London Daily Telegraph golf writer , was so impressed by Beman that he described him as " ' a magnificent player , fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an ecstatic , yet still accurate , description of Beman in action on a golf course . It is when Beman holds a putter in his hands that he is at his efficient best . Beman himself feels that putting is the essence of his game . " I do n't mind being outdriven , " he says , " but I start getting mad if the fellow I 'm playing with outputts me. " // Beman describes his putting stroke as " a little wrist , a little arm , a little shoulder , " but in its most vital element the shaft of the putter rests between the pads at the base of the left hand , not under the bottom pad . " This grip just solid keeps the club face square , " he says . " There 's almost no way you can pull the putt . " Beman developed his stroke in high school through hours spent at night on the sparsely lighted practice green at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase , near the Beman home . Often the patient Miriam would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother believed when I told her we 'd spent the evening out putting , " Miriam says , " but I guess I would have gone anywhere Deane wanted me to go . " // The result of all this practice is a putting grip , stance and stroke that seem as effortless as breathing . " Look at that stroke ! " exclaims Nicklaus , who coils excruciatingly over his own putts like a man searching for four-leaf clovers . " It has feel , it has touch written all over it . How he can putt so well under pressure I do n't know . He must have no nerves at all . " // " Jack may be right , " agrees Beman . " If I had jumpy nerves and got excited on the green when the going was rough I probably would n't have a chance . But if your nerves are tough enough this is the best way to putt . " // Obviously , the same qualities of toughness and confidence , plus a frank , open manner , help make Beman the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beman &amp; Buppert Associates . Beman started selling insurance for Bill Buppert while majoring in business at Maryland . Buppert , a Maryland economics major who left school in 1951 , is a big , dark , round-faced man with a slow drawl and a fast eye for a dollar . He went into the insurance business in 1954 after two years as an assistant golf professional . By 1960 Buppert knew so much about insurance and Beman had corralled so many accounts that the two incorporated the present partnership . The firm is housed in a modern five-room office and consists of themselves , a sales force of five and an office staff of two . // Beman 's current share of the lush harvest ( aside from his co-ownership ) is a drawing account of $1,000 per month , two company-paid-for cars and a golfing expense account of some $6,000 per year . " I do n't know what Joe Dey over at the USGA would think about that , " Beman says of the golf expense item , " but since the company 's half mine it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // A company asset // The taxes , of course , are a matter between Deane Beman and the U.S. Government . There is no doubt , however , that Beman 's many tournament , pro-am , member-guest and social appearances are among the company 's biggest assets . They bring him into close contact with countless business and industrial leaders , most of whom are delighted to throw some insurance his way . // " Here 's a typical example of how this works , " said Beman , sitting at his desk and showing a letter from a California airplane executive . " I met this fellow on the practice tee when I was playing in a member-guest over at Burning Tree . He 's invited me to come down and play his course in L.A. while I 'm in California for the Amateur . When I play down there I 'll maybe meet several other aircraft people . I 'm certain a few of them will be interested in our insurance ideas . " // It is , of course , vital to Beman these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more he becomes involved in the intricacies of fringe benefit insurance , the more his game suffers . " Right now , " he explains , " my game is sort of dormant . I have n't had time to practice the refinements mostly lengthening his tee shots I 've been trying to work into it . But in a couple of years I expect to be able to get away from the paper work and concentrate on making contacts . Then I 'll have a chance to practice and pick my spots . I see no reason why I ca n't compete on an even basis with the pros and someday win the Masters or the Open , or both , as an amateur . " // These are ambitious goals that have eluded most of the best golfers in the world , but Deane Beman is industrious enough to match his ambition . No one knows any better than he that Beman the Masters and Beman the Open champion could also be solid Beman the multimillionaire.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
