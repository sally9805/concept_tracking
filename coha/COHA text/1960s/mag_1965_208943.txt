A six-year-old Indian girl named Nancy Prasad was grabbed last week from her sister 's arms at Sydney airport , bundled into a car and driven away . It was no ordinary kidnaping , for within 15 minutes the sister , Shasti Powditch , got word that Nancy was safe and would be returned as soon as the plane she was to board had taken off . <P> The kidnaper turned out to be Charles Perkins , an aboriginal student at Sydney University who early this year led " freedom riders " through New South Wales to protest discrimination against Australia 's dark-skinned aborigines , who number nearly 80,000 . Perkins saw in Nancy Prasad an even more dramatic way to argue his case . In 1962 the child had come to Australia from Fiji with her father on visitors ' visas . The father returned to Fiji when his visa expired , but Nancy was allowed to remain for medical treatment . The courts turned down an appeal that the child be allowed to stay on permanently after she recovered , and she was ordered deported last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters argue that Nancy could have stayed in Australia if she were white . Though the Australian government insists there is no discriminatory racial policy in immigration , European immigrants are welcomed at a rate of 150,000 a year , while Asians are limited to a few hundred annually . At week 's end , the police tracked down little Nancy , put her aboard the next plane to Fiji .
