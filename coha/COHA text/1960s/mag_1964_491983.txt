A freezing wind whipped through Har- lem , stirring the trash in the gutters , tugging at rattling windows , blowing down long , dark hallways left open to the street . It was warmer inside the well-lighted gymnasium on West 118th Street . but the men and women packed into 600 chairs on the basketball court kept their overcoats on . This was not the kind of audience that checked its coats . These people were slum tenants , inhabitants of the wasteland of crumbling buildings and decaying garbage heaps which covers the northern end of Manhattan Island . Most of them had gone for months with no heat in their icy radiators and no hot water in their sinks and bathtubs . Gray rats as big as squirrels prowled through their kitchens and scurried under their beds . Now , encouraged to believe that if they acted together , " the Man " could not put all of them " on the street , " they had stopped paying rent . All together , on that bleak mid-January day , 3.000 Harlem families were holding back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had persuaded these people to strike , climbed up on a plat  --  form at one end of the room and began to speak . Gray has a large moustache and widely spaced buckteeth and , be  --  cause he was once a tailor , his suits fit well . His voice , however , is far more aggressive than his appearance . That day it shook with belligerence and outrage . " In Harlem the landlords have been on strike for a long time , " Jesse shouted . " Now ive 're going on strike . " " That 's right , " chorused the crowd . " We 've got to clear all the rats out of this town , " Jesse said , pointing to two large placards in front of the platform . One portrayed the head of the Demo  --  cratic donkey joined to the body of a rat . The other depicted the Republican elephant similarly transformed . " Harlem , " said Jesse , " has got to let Mayor Wagner know that there 'll be no votes for him this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we vote , we 'll write in our totes for rats . At least they live with us up here in Harlem . " " That 's right , " they shouted . " We 're going to say to the mayor and to the governor and to the President of the United States that in all the ghettos of this country , it 's time to stop paying rent to keep rats alive and landlords fat . They ca n't evict twenty million Negroes from this country ' ! " The crowd roared . Jesse Gray 's rent strike is not im  --  portant only to New York . If this tactic is successful in Harlem , it will spread to all the other American cities where Negroes are cooped in grimy ghettos . For the strike  --  along w ith New York 's recent school boycott in his ' ) 360,000 students walked out in protest against racial imbalance in the city schools  --  is dramatic evidence of the Negro 's new militancy in the North . Said Bayard Rustin , the 53-year-old Negro who or  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the one-day school strike , " The boycott and the rent strike are fair warning that the civil-rights revolution has reached out of the South and is now knocking at our own doors . " As an indication of the effect this is having , a number of city and state poli  --  ticians , union leaders and civil-rights chieftains , types ranging from U.S. Con  --  gressman William Fitts Ryan to novelist James Baldwin , had chosen to sit on the platform that afternoon with Jesse Gray . As one endorsement followed another f " It is always hopeful for democracy when the people turn out to air their grievances " ) , one veteran New York newspaperman watched in amazement . " For ten years Jesse Gray 's been com  --  plaining about living conditions in Har  --  lem , but nobody would listen to him . Now all of a sudden he 's holding press conferences , he 's on the front page and all the pols are scrambling to sit on a platform with him . You know why ? The slums have n't changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those slums are Negroes . " In these days of the Negro Revolution a man does not need a downtown office , letterhead stationery and frequent invi  --  tations to dine at the White House in order to become a civil-rights leader . All he needs is a following . Jesse Gray , born 39 years ago in Louisiana , a mer  --  chant seaman during the war , and after that a tailor in Harlem , has a following . To the people of Harlem it does n't matter that the articulate leaders of the N.A.A.C.P. , C.O.R.E . and the Urban League deplore splinter movements and independent leaders such as Jesse Gray . Nor do they care that Jesse Gray has been accused by anonymous postcards of being a Communist . ( Gray supported the right of American Communist Benjamin Davis to run for the New York state senate in 1958 , and he took the Fifth Amendment when asked to name other Communists he knew . In heated argument  --  ments he makes statements such as , " If private property means that rats can eat my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he has denied under oath any Communist Party affiliation , and no contrary evidence ever has been pro  --  duced . ) The only thing that matters in Harlem is that Jesse Gray has been de  --  manding for 10 years that something he done about living conditions in J-larlem 's slums . Now , in its awakening sense of power , Harlem itself has begun to make this demand . And on this issue at least , it has made Jesse Gray its angry voice . To understand why Jesse Gray and Harlem arc protesting , it is necessary to walk through the blighted streets north of Central Park . Dirty sidewalks are lined with five-story houses , each divided into 15 apartments . Windows are patched with cardboard , doors wobble loose on their hinges , hallways smell of age and dirt and poverty . In such a house Mrs. Joyce Borden , a tall , serious woman of 31 , lives in conditions that arc appalling even by Harlem 's miserable standards . A steady stream of water In the basement . of her building at 105 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remains of a dismantled boiler . The boiler was destroyed a year ago , and Joyce Borden has been without heat and hot water ever since . There is a broken pipe in the apartment above Mrs. Bor  --  den 's , and for six weeks a steady down  --  pour of cold water has drenched her bathroom . Worse , since the week before Christ  --  mas Joyce Borden 's apartment has been without electricity . She can not even get light from outside ; her window shades are drawn to preserve a few extra degrees of the thin heat that filters from her kitchen oven . Ten-year-old Samuel Borden does his homework in the after  --  noon by the light of a kerosene lamp . After supper , when his mother goes off to clean an empty , well-heated office in midtown New York , Samuel Borden gets into bed and tries to keep warm . To call on Joyce Borden , a visitor must walk in from the sunlit street , grope down a damp , dark hallway and up a set of creaking stairs . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curlers , Joyce Borden shows a surprisingly even temper toward her misfortunes . " I 've lived here for eight years , and I 've always paid about fifty dollars a month rent . Now the landlord says he ca n't afford to fix the boiler and give us heat . Con Edison says they ca n't give us electricity because that 's the landlord 's responsibility . We 've called all kinds of city inspectors , but they just conic and make notes and go away . Since it did n't seem to be anybody else 's responsibility , 1 decided to make it mine . I went to Jesse Gray , and he helped me organize this huilding . Now we 're on strike . " Joyce Borden knows the name of her landlord . City records list him as Walter Giles , 155-23 116th Avenue , Jamaica , N.Y . Mr. Giles has moved , however , to New City , a small town up the Hudson River from New York . He admits owning the house in which Joyce Borden lives but has declined to discuss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . They hide behind the facade of quickly erected corporations , or place titles in the names of their wives , their secretaries , their lawyers . Some landlords choose to live outside New York state ; some are across the river in the suburbs of New Jersey , others live in Florida or Puerto Rico . There is at least one house in Harlem , at II West 107th Street , which nobody owns . A Buildings Department investiga  --  tion revealed 17 different names listed as owners , co-owners and mortgagees , but all of these people disclaim ownership and responsibility . Presumably the last owner , unable to face the massive costs of repairing the house , simply gave up and disappeared . The pipes have been ripped out of the basement , and the building has neither heat nor running water , The tenants remain , paying no rent , hoping that the city will take over the building under receivership law . One of these tenants is Mrs. Eunice Bates , a short , round-faced grandmother who talks with a heavy wheeze . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment next door and carries it up to her apartment in buckets and wastebaskets . She does not seem to have much hope that conditions will improve . You reporters come , the city inspec  --  tors come , but nothing ever gets better . I had to send my two boys to Connecticut this winter to live with my sister . One of them has asthma , and he ca n't keep alive in this cold . I do n't know what we 're going to do . " In the apartment directly above Mrs. Bates , Shirley Williams , an attractive young woman in her 20 's , has not yet given up . This is because James Williams , Shirley 's husband , is a head shipping clerk at a Seventh Avenue dress house , and his weekly income , S75 , is enough to qualify him for one of the city 's low-income housing projects . There is a long waiting list , but the Williamses have been promised an apartment fairly soon . Meanwhile , Shirley Williams carries wa  --  ter from next door and keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , - flush a toilet or wash the diapers of her 10 ? month-old daughter . " We 've been here five years , and we 've tried to make this a nice place , " she says , gesturing toward the new couches in her living room and the new encyclopedia on her shelves . " We want to pay rent , but nobody comes to collect it . Instead , we pay S70 a month for gas to keep the oven going for heat . We worry about it causing a fire , we worry about the rats get  --  ting into my baby 's crib . My son has had double pneumonia , and my daughter has had meningitis . My husband works hard , because we want something better for our kids . But we just ca n't go on like this . " Her eyes , which had been flashing with indignation , began to fill with tears . Spreading her arms and shaking her head slowly , Shirley Williams said , " Nobody would believe how we 're living here . No  --  body would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would believe Shirley Williams ; for one , there is Mrs. Annabelle Alexander of 2174 Lexington Avenue . On January 2 her five-year-old son John was bitten on the lower lip by a rat , and rushed to a hospital for the first of a series of 14 anti-rabies shots . Annabelle Alexander easily recognized the creature that bit her son ; he had lived with the family for months . Richard Moore , a 22-year-old stock clerk , would also agree with Shirley Williams . On January 11 , in his apart  --  ment at 1787 Madison Avenue , he found a large rat in the crib with his baby son . Moore chased the rat before it could bite , and killed it by his usual method . " They do n't run too fast . I just take a box and mash ' em against the wall . " At night the temperature inside Moore 's unheated apartment sometimes drops to 18 ? , But he is tired of moving . " I moved into this place four months ago from a place that was worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his monthly rent of $65 , he has organized his on building and helped Jesse Gray organize nine others . There probably would not have been a rent strike in Harlem if the city of New York had been able to enforce the mini  --  mum housing standards required by law . But one million people still live in 43,000 buildings erected before 1901 . To replace these buildings would cost an estimated $17 billion . Landlords complain that New York 's rent-control law holds rents so low that they can not afford to make repairs . So far , however , no city administration has dared risk voter displeasure by removing these controls . On January 23 , with controls due to expire on February 1 , the City Council held hearings to listen to both sides . A group of small property owners showed up and one of them began shout  --  ing that the continuance of rent controls would he " compromising with Commu  --  nism and Fascism . " Outside , Jesse Gray and a group of strikers picketed the hear  --  ings , then burst inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Disorders broke out and a number of the more vehement landlords were ejected . Gray led his followers outside and relative calm returned . On January 28 , the council extended rent controls another two years , leaving mutters about where they were in the beginning . But while both sides argue , buildings continue to decay . Even when violations are found and landlords arc convicted , penalties remain low . Fines for housing violations may be as low as five dollars ; the average fine is $30 . Says Mayor Wagner , " The slumlord will say  --  if you can find him -- hl would rather pay that low fine than all the money it would take to make these places proper . ' " For several years Wagner has asked the legislature to set minimum housing-viola  --  tion fines at S100 , but he has been unsuc  --  cessful . In 1962 Wagner did persuade the legislature to enact a receivership law , empowering the city to take over build  --  ings in violation , collect the rents and use the money to make repairs . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 12 buildings . Delay is compounded by confusion and overlapping authority . If Joyce Borden has no heat , she must call the Health Department to complain . If she has no hot water , she must call the Buildings De  --  partment . If she has no water at all , she must call the Department of Water Sup  --  ply , Gas and Electricity . If Shirley Wil  --  liams has a rathole , she is supposed to ask a Building Department inspector to call . if a rat emerges from the hole , she must ask for a health inspector . Leaky pipes arc Buildings ' responsibility , big leaks belong to Water Supply , overflow from i he apartment above is a police matter . Sometimes inspectors may call simultaneously from three separate de  --  partments . Each writes on his clipboard and goes away . More often , tenants are shunted from one telephone switchboard to another and simply give up . Until now Harlem has always accepted delay and despair . But in 1963 , with fel  --  low Negroes braving fire hoses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  gan to sweep through Harlem 's tene  --  ments . In October Jesse Gray 's Com  --  community Council on Housing persuaded the tenants of Numbers 15 , 16 and 18 East 117th Street to stop paying rent . By Christmas 58 buildings in Harlem were on strike . In Shirley Williams 's building a gas leak was discovered on Christmas Day , and the gas had to be turned off . For Christmas dinner she served her family spiced-ham sandwiches . The rent strike got a crucial lift on December 30 . On that day i 3 of the strik  --  ing families living at 16 and 18 East 117th Street were to be haled into court by their landlord .. The tenants were pre  --  pared to list the 157 uncorrected viola  --  tions in the two buildings , but Jesse Gray had an additional dramatic idea . " Bring a rat to court , " he told the strikers . On the morning of December 30 Gray tint ) his followers can ied right dead rats down to the City Courthouse at 111 Cen  --  ter Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners to check the rodents in a cloakroom . But 1+ ? e rats. , concealed under clothing and in ? ? omen 's pocketbook. , made it into the courtroom . Judge Gu ) Colbert Ribaudo ruled that the 13 tenants thereafter should turn over their accruing rents to his court . The landlord could get the rent from the court once he had repaired the violations . Gray dangled the rats before a mob of photographers and TV cameramen. tossed them into a wastebasket , and went home happy . The strike gathered additional legal support from a decision handed down in Brookl4n b ) Judge Fred G. Moritt . Judge Moritt ruled that tenants in sub  --  standard dwellings were not required to deposit rem with ann body until repairs were made . " My decision means that the landlord in extreme cases is not entitled to any rent until the conditions are remedied , " he declared . " Some of the buildings are n't fit for pigs .... If it takes the landlord two years to make the repairs . he gets no rent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary law that you do n't owe for what you do n't get . " Many New York lawyers doubt that the law is quite so elementary as Judge Morin behe4es . " Judge Moritz decided that case On purely emotional grounds . Ili ' decision w ill be thrown out by the appellate courts , " said one Manhattan lawyer . Mrs. Hortense W. Gabel , the city 's rent and rehabilitation administra  --  tor , also doubts that Judge Moritt 's de  --  cision 4gill he upheld b ) the higher courts . Therefore , said Mrs. Gabel , " it would be most unfortunate if tenants were not required to pay their rents to the courts , " Privately Mrs. Gabel ex  --  plained that she feared landlord re  --  prisals against tenants if the ruling is over  --  turned . But Jesse Gray interpreted her statement as an attack on the rent strike . " Hortense Gabel helps landlords , and Hortense Gabel has got to go , " he tells his rallies . Hearing this , Mrs. Gabel shrugs and smiles . " If Government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , " I think we could have managed this one a little better . " Jesse Gray himself does not worry about the legality of the rent strike . " Once you 're got 15.000 people not pay  --  ing rents , it 's not a legal problem . It 's a political problem , " he says . Now it 's up to the mayor and the governor . " New York Gov . Nelson Rockefeller does not accept Gray 's placement of re  --  sponsibility . Gray 's response was to call for a " Rats to Rockefeller " campaign and to order 3,000 black rubber rats from atoy manufacturer which his followers could mail to the governor . This hit of showmanship finally provoked Rocke  --  feller to reply . Climbing out of a plane from New Hampshire , he accused New York City of failing to enforce housing and sanitation laws . " The rent strikers know where the problem is . It 's right in City Hall , " said the governor . He added that if he found any rats in his mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ner . In rebuttal to Rockefeller 's attack , city officials point to the omission from Governor Rockefeller 's annual message to the legislature of any proposals for new low-rent public housing . Instead , Rocke  --  feller 's message promised a commission report on the " feasibility of providing low-rent housing with private capital . " Mayor Wagner , during his 10 years in office , has periodically announced " a massive attack " or a " new and more ef  --  fective attack " on slumlords . These battle cries come in cycles , as do elec  --  tions . This year 's slogan is " a pocketbook attack on the slumlords . " Immediately after Judge Ribaudo 's decision , when the number of buildings on strike had jumped to nearly 200 , the mayor an  --  nounced a new program . It included end  --  ing duplication and overlap among city agencies with housing responsibilities , stiffer fines and jail sentences for slum  --  lords , a speedup in the processing o and , most important , a legalizing of rent withholding if the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A week later the mayor announced that the city would spend one million dol  --  lars to kill rats beginning in March . " Wagner has talked about helping us for ten years , " says Jesse Gray , as he sits in his tiny , windowless office at 6 East 117th Street , " but conditions are worse now than they ever have been . The mayor has authority under the receivership law to take over these substandard buildings . " The more he talks , the madder Jesse Gray gets . " Wagner wo n't act unless the pressure 's on him . We 're going to keep it on . I do n't care what Wagner does , or Rockefeller , or even L.B.J. It would be the simplest thing in the world for L.B.J. to put up half a billion dollars to tear down these slums and give our people decent housing . Rockefeller ? Ha ! He owns a whole lot of raggedy property all over this town . He 's just like any other landlord . The landlords are fat , fat , fat ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks , most Harlem landlords have stayed undercover . A few have written to newspapers , stating that their tenants " urinated in the halls , threw garbage in the backyard " and " lived it up on welfare money at the corner gin-mills . " Two landlords , Arnold Schild  --  haus and Lee Sterling , appeared on a local television program with Jesse Gray and counterattacked directly . Sterling , who owns a building at 100th Street and First Avenue , said , " I went in last summer and tried to put the building in shape . We plastered and painted , but two weeks later the holes were all back again . Some tenants went up on the roof and tore down the chimney and threw the bricks at the police cars in the street . " Schildhaus went even further . The truth is that in Harlem today the average family is very destructive , " he said . Both landlords claimed that rent controls pre  --  vented them from making repairs . " We are losing thousands of dollars , " said Schildhaus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The law wo n't even permit us to give them away . " According to several city officials , Schildhaus 's statement is not completely accurate . " The owner has an absolute right to withdraw from the rental market if he can prove that the cost of repairing violations is greater than the assessed valuation of the building , " said one top city official . " Under the law , when you do n't pay taxes for four years , the city may foreclose on a building , " added Milton Mollen , Mayor Wagner 's chief housing adviser . " But the great majority of landlords , and the slumlords particu  --  larly , continue to pay taxes because they are making money . " But while the argument goes on , the rent-strike tactic continues to gather momentum . By mid-February there were 300 buildings and 4,500 families on strike in Harlem . The Congress of Racial Equality already has conducted limited rent strikes in other parts of New York City and in Cleveland , and is planning them for other northern cities . But C.O.R.E . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse Gray 's , and C.O.R.E . ' s Executive Director James Farmer is not pleased with this situation . " Rent strikes are a C.O.R.E . project , " says Farmer . " I announced last spring that they would be one of our tactics . We are very glad to see others join us . But I would not wish to comment on Mr. Gray . " In 10 days of trying , N.A.A.C.P. Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins could not be reached for comment . Fighting slums in a huge metropolis is discouraging work . In 1957 Mayor Wagner told New York World-Telegram housing reporter Woody Klein , " There 's nothing you can do about slums , you know that . They 're always going to be that way . " But living in slums is dis  --  couraging too . Especially when the people who live there realize that their society could build new buildings if it really wanted to .

They are the gleaming , well-heated halls and palaces scattered through the Flush  --  ing Meadow site of the 1964 New York World 's Fair .
