txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 36 Letters to the Editor of The Times Future of Trade Unions To the Editor : The 25-millionth vote in National Labor Relations Board elections hardly justifies your editorial ( March 2 ) " Milestone in Labor Democracy . " It reflects rather a millstone around the neck of organized labor , Three decades after the enactment of the Wagner Law should have produced by this time the 250-millionth N.R.L.B. vote , considering turnover , deaths , dropouts and replacements in a labor force that now approximates 75 million . What is more significant to me is the fact that only 15 million of the 75 million are members of unions in spite of Wagner and because of the deterrents created by TaftHartley and Landrum - Griffin . Hardly a cause for celebration or a demonstration of " labor democracy . " Unions in most of the countries of the free world include an overwhelming majority of the workers . In fact , several either control or represent the balance of power politically . Employer ' free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward conservatism , with its attendant suspicion of so-called " labor power , " have cast a pall of gloom over trade unionism in much more than the Southern states . Arbitration Resisted Grievances are not " universally " settled through arbitration . Judicial bulls in the delicate china shop of labor arbitration emasculated the process for the last thirty years until the Warren Court turned the tide . Now employers resist and delimit arbitration to the point where arbitration is confined to few and insignificant issues . As counsel over the years for teachers , engineers , telephone and a variety of other unions , I have observed nothing but retrogression in organizing , inclusion of arbitration , granting of union shop , job security , etc. , which marked the first ten years of the Wagner Act . No , I do not see any " Milestone in Labor Democracy . " I envision , rather , an Armageddon if labor is to be a force for good in this country and if trade unionism is to survive . HENRY MAYER New York , March 3 , 1967 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Page One of your issue of March 3 as follows : " We have had bombing pauses of five days in 1965 , 37 days in DecemberJanuary 1965-66 , and six days just two weeks ago  --  and we encountered only hostile actions in response . " The Secretary is fully aware that this statement is not so . The facts of the first two pauses cited and other occasions on which imminent prospects for negotiation were sabotaged by United States escalation are documented in the book " The Politics of Escalation " by Franz Schurmann et al , ( foreword by Arthur Schlesinger Jr . ) . Much of this information was presented on the Senate floor by Senator Hartke of Indiana in a speech given June 30 , 1966 . CARL BARDS Swarthmore , Pa . March . 4 , 1967 Cancer-Smoking Link To the Editor : I feel impelled to join the controversy being developed in your column by the recent exchange of views between Joseph Cullman and Dr. Donald T. Fredrickson on the subject of lung cancer . Since it has been brought to the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all facets of the matter . Mr. Cullman is whipping a dead horse . Modern medical thinking no longer permits denial of the essential interrelationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer . With regard to the argument about cancer in the lung being primary or secondary to a different site of origin , the whole matter of the interpretation of death certificates is irrelevant , for a certain number of mistakes is made in both directions in these documents . This in no way seriously contradicts the fact that primary lung cancer is the number one cancer killer among American males . I am a pathologist , responsible for establishing the cause of death by postmortem examination , and I can verify the high incidence of primary lung cancer and the high correlation between this disease and heavy cigarette smoking . I know of no other pathologist who feels differently . To deny these relationships at this late date is equivalent to denying the germ theory of tuberculosis . It would be far more appropriate for officials of the tobacco industry to work energetically to discover and eventually eliminate the cancerigenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rapidly put a stop to the terrible toll which lung cancer now takes . DANIEL ROTH , M.D. Roslyn Heights , L. L March 4 , 1967 ? Stables in Central Park To the Editor : I read with interest Bethuel M. Webster 's March 4 letter regarding the stables in Central Park . While I am impressed by Mr. Webster 's affection for the park , which I share in full measure , I must confess to being depressed by his insensitivity to the real needs of the park and the people who use it . When Mayor Lindsay and I first proposed this stable complex we did so not to cater to the interests of any one group , not even to accommodate the police alone , but because we believed and continue to believe that the best interests of all New Yorkers would be served . The tremendous enthusiasm which the plan has generated and which was so well articulated before the Board of Estimate by the Citizens Committee in Support of the Stables in Central Park , has reassured the Mayor and myself that the stables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . Public Riding Facility " My kingdom for a horse " may be sentimental and extreme in the twentieth century , but surely the horse is not yet ready to join the dinosaur . The activity around Claremont Stables , the only remaining private stable serving Central Park , would certainly refute that possibility . Claremont , which will be torn down within the year as part of the West Side urban renewal program , is already too small to accommodate the many New Yorkers who enjoy riding and the many more who wish to ride but have been unable to do so because of space limitations . Riding enthusiasts are a diverse group , cutting across all income and age groups . Many more youngsters would ride , however , if it were not dangerous for them to ride through heavy traffic in order to reach the park from Claremont . A public riding facility in the park would undoubtedly increase the number of riders and decrease the price . The Police Department , it seems to me , has made a persuasive case for the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't agree with them more that mounted patrols are the most effective deterrent to crime in the park that we have . The Kelly and Gruzen design , in its emphasis on landscaping , in its blending of facilities into the configuration of the area ; in its responsiveness to the needs of the park , the police and the public , seems to me a beautiful solution to the problem of housing the stables , the police precinct and the mounted police . Painstaking Planning One final , albeit less fragrant , note : Mr. Webster worries about the manure disposal problems for such a large number of horses . The most modern techniques will be utilized to obviate the odor and the unsightliness of this very functional function and Mr. Webster is welcome to come . in to the Parks Department at any time to examine the plans . The program for the stable competition was drawn up by the firm of Bentel &; Bentel , which spent four and a half months researching stable facilities throughout the world . New York will be getting the very best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner of Parks New York , March 7 , 1967 ? Powell 's Contribution To the Editor : I have read numerous editorials and letters in The Times castigating Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr . for what is considered his improper actions . Although I am an admirer of his in many ways , I can not in fair conscience condone all his actions . However , I feel , as do many others of my race , that he has not been treated fairly to some degree by Congress and the press . There is a pertinent and vital question that should be asked by all fair-minded persons , regardless of race . That is , what manner of man is he who IN MY ECHO DAYS In my echo days , In the days of the loud shout Over bark and branch , Over hill and hollow and tippled trees I raged like a blast of fire through the fern . I was a chased fox , I was a red buck deer , I was racing on through my childhood years . I was happy then , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest years It came , A. black dot out of the white horizon 's glare , And in the naked uplands Among the splashing fern , Suddenly looked up and stared At the rent in the whiteness of my years . KEITH KEENAN can be re-elected through the years by his constituents without effort on his part ? There is profound gratitude in the hearts of the people of his community , because he has contributed more than any one else with his assiduous and courageous efforts to improve their economic status by placing them in positions hitherto denied them . This fact has been made obvious throughout the city . No one dare minimize or ignore this fact . He made himself a unique politician time and time again , placing the interest of his race above party . First Negro Chairman His long years of continuous service won him the distinction of being the first black American ever to be made Chairman of the powerful House Education and Labor Committee . While we feel it was incumbent on him to preserve that honor for himself and our race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say all black Americans are incensed because a member of our race should be the first member of Congress to be penalized for what is considered ' to be unethical . In all fairness , neither Mr. Powell nor anyone else should be disciplined until a code of strict ethical procedure is established as a guideline for all our national legislators . I should like to exhort all ambitious young black Americans who aspire to policy - making positions in government or elsewhere to be straightforward in their dealings and on the alert at all times , because , with the exception of appointments through the channels of politics , there are some who do not like to see us in policy - making positions . This accusation comes from one who has known the kindness of many white friends , whose friendship I cherish . And I want to make it clear that I do not in any way condone wrongdoing in or out of office by anyone . WALTER L. BLAIR New York , Feb. 27 , 1967 ? Brain-Drain ' by Draft To the Editor : I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors of the Marshall Report . In proposing a national lottery , they have performed the invaluable service of concretely identifying the draft system as it really is : an unjust , arbitrary , but legalized , system of involuntary servitude . Of the three rights listed in the " Declaration of Independence , " the right to life is the most fundamental . Yet the draft ? any form of draft ? is in direct contradiction to this right . When the burning issue facing a nation is shifted from " How can we best preserve the rights of our citizens ? " to " How can we most ' justly ' violate the rights of our citizens ? " one wonders how long that nation can survive . The current proposal gives the " brain drain " a new and somewhat startling twist . While Great Britain is striving desperately to keep her intellectuals from fleeing the country , Uncle Sam proposes to equalize the ? situation by sending his to Vietnam  --  before they even have a chance to become intellectuals Editorial March 8 .
