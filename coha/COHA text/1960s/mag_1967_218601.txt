" I 've had a bellyful of this mess . I 'm fed up to the top of my head , " says Texas Oil Millionaire Algur H. Meadows , still smarting under the allegation by Manhattan 's Art Dealers Association of America that his personal collection of French moderns may contain as many as 44 fakes ( TIME , May 19 ) . But this has not kept Meadows from plunging again . Last week he announced that he had bought 13 more paintings , mainly by Spanish masters , valued at $2,000,000 and destined for Southern Methodist University . This time when Meadows went to market , however , it was with a difference . Rather than put his trust in itinerant art dealers , he bought from Manhattan 's top galleries . And to advise him he had at his elbow Dallas Museum of Fine Arts Director Merrill C. Rueppel . Said Meadows : " I am convinced that I am now getting the best advice on art . I am absolutely certain that I am in good hands . " <P> Several of Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonnard-are intended for his personal collection in Dallas . There they will help to fill the gaps left on the walls by the suspect paintings , now being examined in Paris . A $150,000 Jackson Pollock will go to the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts . But the lion 's share , ten paintings bought from Wildenstein &; Co. - including four Goyas , three Murillos , a Zurbarn , a Juan de Sedilla and a Jos Leonardo-will go directly to S.M.U. , to become part of a collection that includes some 300 other Spanish paintings and drawings , valued at $3,000,000 , given by Meadows in recent years . <P> Some of Meadows ' bad luck was still trailing along with him . About 18 of the works earlier donated by him to S.M.U. , including three attributed to El Greco and two each to Rubens and Van Dyck , may have to have their name tags changed , according to S.M.U. Dean of Arts Kermit Hunter . Meadows is content to let the experts thrash it out . Nothing , he feels , must stand in the way of satisfying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southwest-to go hand in hand with the vast technical and industrial development of the area . " In his latest haul , he is certain that he has netted at least two beauties : Zurbarn 's Mystical Marriage of St. Catherine ( " It gives you a feeling of serenity " ) and Goya 's Man on Horseback ( " It 's fabulous-a joyful painting ! " ) .
