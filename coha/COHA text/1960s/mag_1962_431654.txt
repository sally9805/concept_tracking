 | WHY I BELIEVE THERE IS LIFE ON MARS @# EVERYTHING points to it ? and not just low life ' like algae or mosses ? but really developed higher plants .... " It could be a sea of fern , tall as Iowa corn but supple like wheat . Or something broadleafed and brown like cured tobacco . More . likely it 's something so fiendishly adapted to Mars that it wo n't be like anything on Earth . . Dr. Frank B. Salisbury enjoyed speculating. - The handsome botanist rocked back on the heels of his chair , hands clasped behind his head . : And once you have higher forms , " he went on , " there 's no reason you ca n't have animals to eat them . And if animals , why not intelligence in some form or other ? After all something has to account for those satellites " " What satellites ? " I asked . @#  | " Mars has two satellites , - Phobos and Deimos , " he said . " They 're both small and they orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it accelerates during part of its orbit is best explained by assuming it 's hollow . " He paused . " And naturally formed moons do n't come that way . " Not only that , " he went on while I sat staring , " nobody could spot them in 186:1 , ? the best year for viewing Mars in the 19th century . They showed up for the first time 15 years later . " " You mean there could be intelligent beings on Mars who launched artificial satellites ? " " Could be , " Salisbury said . " Of course the idea is pretty far out . I 'd settle for reasonably clever plant life . " " Yes , let 's get back to your everything-points -- to-it statement . " @#  | " Sure , " he said , and the chair dropped forward on the floor as if it had been called to attention . : The main reason I think there are plants on Mars is the seasonal change in the surface markings . " The changing seasons . " When it 's spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pole begins to disappear and another one forms up north . Observing over a period of months you see a pattern of rich , dark colors spread out until it reaches a peak in triangular-shaped shadowy areas around the equator . " Oddly enough , the colors do n't go from ice-blues to greens , but from pastels to dark browns , tinged with red . Occasionally you do see green , but the brown is more common . " He paused again . " The other striking evidence comes from spectrum analysis . We know that every chemical compound or element reflects light in a distinct way . When the light gets separated-out in a spectrum , a unique pattern of bands shows up . Lately William M. Sinton at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Ariz. , has spotted bands that suggest carbon compounds . And in the dark areas only . " That 's exciting . Sinton 's bands are the only positive sign we have that suggests life ? or at least the kind of complex organized molecules that make up life as we know it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start orbiting telescopes or land a space probe on Mars . " " But that could be in the next few years , could n't it ? " " Right . That 's why there 's so much interest in Mars right now . Frankly I. @#  | would n't mind making the trip myself . " " Hmmm , " I said . " I guess present telescope photographs and spectrographs ? no matter how good ? are n't conclusive . " " I 'm afraid not , " he agreed . " You can usually see Mars better just watching with a telescope instead of filming it . The earth 's atmosphere is so wobbly that the time exposures come out blurred . " Same thing applies to spectrographs , " he continued . " The atmosphere 's a nuisance , but for other reasons . We ca n't tell how much water vapor or oxygen there is on Mars ? we suspect very little ? because there 's so much in our air . " Martian weather . " Can you describe what you expect to find once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Cold , of course . It 's that much farther from the sun . An average for the whole planet might be 40 below , as compared with 60 above for Earth . But averages are foolish . It depends where we land and at what time of day ? or year . Around the tropics it can get up to 70 or 80 degrees during a summer day ( but dip 100 degrees below freezing at night ) . " " Okay . Suppose we drop down some place near the equator at high noon on a summer day . What would we see ? " Salisbury beamed and leaned back , half closing his eyes . " Let 's say we land at Syrtis Major . That 's the place I 'd like most to see . It 's sort of the Africa of Mars ? the largest , lushest-looking of the dark triangles , roughly the size of Mexico . " He got up . " Want to see it ? There 's a map around some place . " He went to the filing cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick Manila folder , Mars . He took out a map and put his finger on Syrtis . " We wo n't land on Syrtis itself , but on its edge . " He settled back in the chair again . " We are still in the spaceship looking out . The sky is a kind of hazy bluish white . We do n't see the sun distinctly ; the Martian atmosphere contains particles that scatter the light ? especially toward the blue end of the spectrum . They could be ice crystals . " A mysterious cloud . " The terrain is flat . ( There is no evidence of shadows that volcanoes or mountains might cast . ) There may be some white Earthlike clouds overhead . Toward the horizon there 's a menacing sight : a massive yellow cloud swirling up 10 or 15 miles . Sometimes clouds like that storm over the whole planet and color it yellow . " " What are they ? " I asked . " Maybe gas . More likely dust ? blown @# @#  | up from the desert area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You mean dunes ? " " Well , as you know , Mars generally looks orange-red ? even without a telescope . Many observers think the planet is covered with reddish iron oxide dusts ? rusty deserts . " " Not very inviting , I must say . Let 's get to the markings . Are maps like this one fairly standard ? " " The shapes vary a little from year to year . Sometimes a new marking shows up , or an old one disappears . But Syrtis , for example , has been mapped consistently for 100 years . " " Nov you 're making me restless . Let 's get out of this spaceship and move there . What 's the atmosphere smell like ? " " I do n't know . " Salisbury grinned . " If I step out of my space suit I 'm dead ! " We both laughed . " Seriously , " he added , " you have to carry your oxygen with you , and you need a pressurized suit . At Mars ' low pressure ? 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm sorry I asked , " I said . " Okay . Now let 's have a look at Syrtis . But I warn you that what I see will be sharply different from what many astronomers expect . There are half a dozen physical theories that attempt to explain the changes on Mars in nonliving ways . " " But you think they 're wrong ? " " Yes . Of course for every argument there 's a counterargument , even mine . I just think it 's easier to defend life . " " Fine . Start defending . " " We 've said already that the color change fits neatly into a spring-summer vegetation cycle . " A second point in favor of life is that when the yellow clouds do cover the planet they do n't permanently tinge the markings yellow . Within a couple of weeks , whatever is there shakes it off or grows up through the cover . You ca n't do that unless you 're tough ? and tall . That , for my money , rules out lichens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might see on Mars , mostly because we know lichens can survive the worst extremes of Earth temperatures . " But I 'm against lichens ? not only because they 're flat . They also take a heck of a long time to achieve anything like a widespread cover ; they need lots of water to grow much ; and they do n't change color . Finally , a lichen can only exist if there are algae and fungi . If Mars has lichens it 'd probably be easier to detect the stuff they depend on first . " " Okay . No lichens . What else then ? " The requirements . " Let 's consider how we might modify an Earth plant to suit life on Mars . What we want is something that can thrive on almost no oxygen or water ; on extremes of temperatures ; and that can take doses of ultraviolet light that get through . The ultraviolet problem is probably the simplest . You suppose built-in shielding pigments . You do n't even have to suppose them . There are fungi in Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't so tough either . A plant would have to  | maximize the amount of solar radiation it gets by day , and be adapted to store it at night . Think of a perfect black-body kind of plant that shrivels or curls up tightly into itself at night . " The leaves of the plant should be thin and broad-surfaced enough to absorb the most heat ( like a tobacco leaf ) , and at the same time have the flexibility to withstand the winds ( like fern ) . " A more drastic solution would be plants that could simply freeze up overnight and thaw out in the morning . It 's not impossible . Over at the greenhouses I can show you some alpine plants that do just that . " " What about the water requirement ? " " That 's harder . When the Martian polar caps melt we ca n't seriously suppose there 's a flow of liquid water toward the equator . " " But maybe Martian plants do n't use water the same way , " I suggested . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In which case they would n't need as much . " Still , that does n't solve the problem of storage , " he added . " Earth plants wilt if they lose too much water . So what could Mars ' plants do ? " Salisbury asked himself , moving the chair around so he could lean on the desk and cradle his head in his hand . " Well , there 's a way out here , too , " he answered his own question . " Surface coatings . We know some compounds can be spread very , very thinly on water to prevent the water from evaporating and yet let gases through . An Israeli scientist has been experimenting along these lines to prevent losses from plants . " " Hmmm . Life is n't getting any easier . So far we 've got these black-bodied plants with surface coatings that maybe freeze up at night . What about oxygen ? " The oxygen problem . " Yes . That 's the most serious problem the life ' theories have to face . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later has to exhale oxygen . Where is it ? " It could be tied up in the iron oxides @# on the deserts or under the topsoil . o1 course . Maybe these Martian plants arc clever enough to break iron oxides down the way Earth plants do water . " " Maybe they do n't need oxygen ? " I suggested . " Well , that 's a neat way out , too . They might breathe nitrogen instead . As 1 said before , we should he prepared for some surprises as to what we find " " Yes , let 's get back to those still higher forms you talked about . " " First there 's this business of the satellites . . . There are the canals , too . " " You really believe they exist ? " " I do . I know some people say they 're just isolated points that the eye connects up . Yet independent observers . .. " " You sound like a TV commercial . " " See for yourself . " Salisbury led me to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set it under a microscope . Next to it he put a drawing . " Here are two views , made at different times by different people . " Those Martian canals . With one eve cocked into the microscope and the other looking at the drawing , I had to admit that the patterns were remarkably similar . Especially in the " star clusters . " Salisbury nodded with satisfaction . " To me. the fascinating thing is that the patterns are so regular . At instants of good seeing ' you spot a closed grid of lines that extends over the whole surface , never dead-ending in the deserts . " No one really thinks they 're superhighways or intersecting Suezes and Panamas . But some respectable scientists do think they could he underground waterways that feed surface farms . " Which is another good reason why I think it 's better that we make the trip to Mars ourselves rather than send robots . Imagine how you 'd feel ? an intelligent nitrogen breather or whatever you are ? if some fuming , monstrous , metal blob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look now , " I whispered to Dr. Salisbury , " but there 's a Mysterious Creeper moving up behind you .
