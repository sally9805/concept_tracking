Out of the hearing room and into the arms of waiting newsmen stepped Arizona 's Democratic Senator Carl Hayden , a member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration . " No comment , " grumbled Hayden . Next out was Nebraska 's Republican Senator Carl Curtis . " I ca n't tell you a thing , " said he . <P> The remaining members of the nine-man committee were equally uncommunicative about what they had found out so far in their investigation of Bobby Gene Baker , 35 , who last month precipitously resigned from his $19,600-a-year position as Secretary for the Senate Majority ( TIME , Oct. 18 ) . Indeed , not even Delaware 's Republican Senator John Williams , who appeared before the committee as a witness against Baker , would say what was going on . <P> Why this sudden affliction of senatorial lockjaw ? The answer seemed obvious : Baker is involved in a scandal of major proportions , and the Senate plainly feared that some of its own members are in it with him . Yet the Senate 's self-protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which talk and speculation flourished with tales of illicit sex , influence peddling and fast-buck financial deals . <P> Carole . One subject of considerable curiosity was Carole Tyler , 24 , a shapely ( 5 ft. 6 in. , 35-26-35 ) Tennessee girl who won the title of " Miss Loudon County " before she turned up in Washington in 1959 . Three years later she was Baker 's private secretary at $8,000 a year . Chain-smoking , martini-drinking , party-loving Carole also became a favorite in Baker 's high-flying circle of acquaintances . <P> Last December Carole took up housekeeping in a cooperative townhouse at 308 N Street S.W. , just a short ride from the Capitol . It was a well-furnished apartment , with prints on the walls , silk draperies in the bedrooms , lavender carpeting in the bathrooms . The parties there were lively . The twist was danced both inside the house and on the patio outside ; the convivial drinking and animated chatter lasted long into the night . Some nearby residents noted that visitors appeared in the daytime as well as the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back gate , " recalls one neighbor . " That struck us as strange . Most of our guests come through the front door . " <P> Carole shared the house for a time with another girl , Mary Alice Martin , a secretary in the office of Florida 's Democratic Senator George Smathers . But neither girl owned the heavily trafficked house they lived in . The owner was Bobby Baker , who bought it for $28,000 on a down payment of $1,600 . On the FHA forms that he signed , Baker listed both girls as the tenants of the house , said that Carole was his " cousin . " She resigned from her job as a Senate employee at the same time Baker did , and has not since been available to inquiring newsmen.
