txt Ranger 6 crashed onto the moon precisely on target today at 4:24 A.M. , Eastern standard time . But it was unable to send back the pictures of the lunar surface it was to have taken in the final minutes before impact . Engineers of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here gathered later in the morning , after a few hours ' fitful sleep , to begin tracing the trouble . They had little heart for the job . But it was urgent that the problem be solved as quickly as possible . A repeat flight is scheduled in less than a month . It will be delayed if the cause of failure is not nailed down . There was an undercurrent of concern that the latest breakdown in the Ranger program  --  the sixth straight ' would generate a clamor in Congress that could jeopardize the future of the $252 million project . Close-up photographs of the moon are urgently needed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to put a manned expedition on the moon by 1970 . The agency must have a better idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm the soundness of design of the spacecraft being built or start designing something different . Program Months Late The Ranger program already is many months late . So is the Surveyor program in which spacecraft are to be ' ' soft-landed " with cameras and devices to analyze lunar soil . The first flight is set for late 1965 . A third project , Lunar Orbiter , was undertaken recently . Spacecraft are to he put in orbit around the moon and take endless strips of lunar photographs from there . But the first flight is not until 1966 . " It was a sad finish to something that was going so good , " Dr. William Pickering , head of the laboratory , said . The laboratory is part of the California Institute of Technology . The civilian space agency , which had 17 straight orbital successes behind it until today , has been bedeviled by the Ranger program since the first flight in August , 1961 . Rangers 1 and 2 were not aimed at the moon but launched on deep-space missions . Both failed when secondstage rockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 and 5 were to take close-up lunar photographs and " hard-land " devices to detect lunar quakes . But one Ranger flew past the moon because of excessive speed . Critical electronic devices failed on the others . Then NASA halted flight plans while the program was thoroughly evaluated . The study team confirmed the soundness of the concept , but the project was reorganized . The spacecraft scheduled for the sixth flight was sidetracked for brutal ground tests . And numerous design changes were made , with stress on alternate components of key parts . Thursday morning , after a flight hiatus of 15 months , Ranger 6 was launched . The initial aim would have missed the moon by a scant 600 miles ? well within the cor // rection capability of a smalls ; rocket on board . About 16 hours after takeoff , the acrobatic midcourse correction was performed . The extra rocket thrust was exerted so as to send the 804-pound spacecraft to a landing point in the Sea of Tranquillity . The midcourse aim was so accurate that , yesterday afternoon , laboratory officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera aim . It looked as if Ranger 6 would make ft . More than 20 , difficult steps were behind it. , Everything now was up to the battery of six Radio Corpore ation of America cameras on board and their associated equipment . Officials , noting ' there were two independent sets of cameras , seemed confident ' that at last one would work . About midnight here , officials , newsmen and engineers and their friends began gathering in the auditorium at the foot of the hillside complex of laboratory buildings . Huge lunar maps were displayed on stage . Cameras hummed and clicked . A. closedcircuit TV system took the au ( Hence into the nearby operations center , where technicians sat listening to encouraging spacecraft signals . An announcer gave a running account of what was happening . Finally , the critical time arrived ? 19 minutes before impact ? when the first Ranger cameras were to turn on . They were to start sending pictures five minutes later . " As yet we have no Indication of full power , " the announcer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded matter of fact . An Ominous Report Moments later , he said : " As yet we have no video . " It sounded more ominous . Spirits began to plummet . Spectators whispered anxiously to neighbors . The announcer said , it again and again for the next ' 18 minutes , interspersing the words with the time left to ime pact . Three times emergency sig- , nals were sent from ground to spacecraft . Three times there was no response . The failure of both " independent " camera batteries puzzled observers the most . Engineers ) acknowledged later that there was a single electronic line for issuing on-board commands to the two sets of cameras . That was but one area of suspicion . The let-down was excruciating . The week in space had started with a Saturn flight that outdid the Russians in the weight of payloads put in orbit . The Ranger launching raised prospects of the most productive week in the history of the nation 's program .
