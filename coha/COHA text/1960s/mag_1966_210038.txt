CUSTOMS Toward Nationwide D.S.T. <P> Ever since the U.S. began experimenting with daylight-saving time in 1918 , the nation during the spring , summer and fall has turned itself into a chaotic crazy quilt of conflicting time patterns . Eighteen states observe D.S.T. on a uniform statewide basis . In another 18 states , individual communities decide for themselves whether or not they will follow D.S.T. and set for themselves the dates on which it goes into and out of effect . Fourteen other states , including almost the entire South , remain on standard time all year long . <P> The great timekeeping hodgepodge costs railroads , airlines and bus companies millions of dollars a year just for printing and distributing revised timetables . But the obvious answer , nationwide D.S.T. , has long been opposed by farmers who argue that " fast time , " as they call it , wrecks their harvests since they can not begin work until the dew is off the hay . Furthermore , they complain , it is one thing to tell a man to get up an hour earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week , by a decisive 281-to-91 vote in the House , Congress approved a bill previously passed by the Senate that takes a major step in the direction of uniform nationwide D.S.T. Effective this year , the bill requires that D.S.T. commence on the last Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October for all states and communities that choose to observe it . Next year , under the bill 's provisions , all states will have to observe uniform D.S.T. statewide unless their legislatures opt for uniform standard time for the entire state . But as early risers know , the sun is already up before 6 a.m. , tennis courts in the South have been readied for after-work play , and early gardening has begun . So why not begin D.S.T. on the last Sunday in March rather than April ?
