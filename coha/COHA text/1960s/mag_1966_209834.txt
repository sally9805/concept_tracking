U.S. skiers almost always promise more than they produce . There was a flurry of excitement in 1964 , when the U.S. won a few minor medals at the Olympics , but things quickly went from better to bad . Last year Americans failed to beat Europeans in a single important race . There was no reason to expect anything different this year-until a lanky desperado named William Winston Kidd went hunting in the Alps . <P> A sophomore at the University of Colorado , Kidd , 22 , finished second in the special slalom at Innsbruck in 1964 , thus becoming the first American ever to win an Olympic medal in men 's skiing . Two weeks ago , in the season 's first big meet at Hindelang , Germany , he was up against the fastest man in Europe : France 's Jean-Claude Killy , 22 , winner of seven major slalom races in 1965 .

When the Frenchman beat Billy by 1.04 sec. on opening day , sportswriters called his performance " a sovereign victory . " Kidd 's second-place finish was pretty remarkable too , considering that the shorter special slalom , not the ' giant slalom , is his specialty . Kidd proved next day that he needed no alibis . Crouched low over his skis , he flashed through the 56 gates and zipped across the finish line in 1 min. 49.59 sec . No one came really close - including Killy , who crashed headlong into a gate at 45 m.p.h. and was disqualified . <P> The victory earned Kidd the Adelboden combined title . More important , it boosted his personal score after two meets to 60 points-20 more than his closest individual competitor , four more than the combined teams of Austria and Italy . So far at least , the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
