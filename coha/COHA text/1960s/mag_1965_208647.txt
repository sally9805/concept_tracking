The mercurial man who is President of the U.S. is given to periods of great ebullience and monumental gloom . Lately Lyndon Johnson has found himself at the perigee . He is more somber , subdued and preoccupied than at almost any time since he entered the White House . <P> <P> This brooding mood was apparent in his lackluster performance at the United Nations ' 20th anniversary celebration in San Francisco two weeks ago . In Austin , Texas , last week , he slipped away from church services without stopping for the usual round of friendly handshaking . The green fields and warming sun at his Texas ranch normally soothe him , but he was so restless that he cut short a projected ten-day stay there after only two days and headed back for Washington-despite the fact that he has come to refer to the White House as " Lonely Acres . " During ceremonies inaugurating the Early Bird satellite 's commercial operations , the President sat glumly in the Cabinet Room , his chin on his fist , as speeches by Britain 's Harold Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> He could record a new legislative victory-House approval of his $5.3 billion housing bill . But the key vote , on a controversial rent-subsidy plan for low-income families , was too close ( 208 to 202 ) to give him much comfort . And next day he bolted from the swearing-in ceremonies for General William F. ( " Bozo " ) McKee as new Federal Aviation Agency Administrator without lingering to greet the guests , even though they included the kind of people he usually likes to see-retired Air Force Generals Curt LeMay , Tommy Power and Nate Twining . <P> The Big Worry . There were reasons enough for President Johnson to fret . Congress was beginning to resist , and that attitude went not only for the Republican opposition but also for liberal Democrats , who were getting tired of hearing about how they jump through a hoop whenever L.B.J. cracks the whip . On Wall Street , the stock market was bouncing back , but its recent gyrations betrayed nervousness about the durability of the record U.S. boom . In the Dominican Republic , the stalemate between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . <P> <P> What worried the President more than anything else was the Viet Nam war . A lifetime of negotiating with reasonably fair-minded men in the cloakrooms of Congress hardly prepared him for coping with an enemy that rejects any negotiations . As he has come to see it , practically the only alternative left to him is to raise the ante-more equipment , more men and , worst of all , more casualties . He does not like the idea , but he sees no other way out . Lately he has taken to asking friends and critics alike , " What would you do ? " So far , no one has come up with an answer that satisfies him .
