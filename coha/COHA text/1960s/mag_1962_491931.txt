Aspotlight glints on a steel wire thirty-five feet above a playing field in Roseburg , Oregon , then follows the wire slowly through the darkness . The crowd gasps as the light stops at the figure of a tiny girl poised on a pedestal . " Ladeeze and gentlemen ! You are about to sec the youngest high-wire walker in the world . " As the words of a towheaded young ringmaster reach the bleachers , a frantic blast of sixteen circus horns introduces a member of the remarkable Wenatchee Youth Circus . From the seven-year-old high-wire walker to the seventeen-year-old boy on the flying trapeze , these are ordinary small-town youngsters who every summer become part of the magic world of wailing calliope and dancing clowns . Rolling into Northwestern farm town 's in a bright-red caravan  --  an old school bus and three ancient trucks  --  they set up secondhand circus equipment in a ball park or football field and put on an open-air show that would astonish three-ring professionals . The circus goes on tour as soon as school is out , visiting twenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngsters put on three or four one-night stands in a week and stay away from home for a month at a time . None of them receives pay . Applause and the fun of touring are the sole rewards for blisters and bruises suffered during winter practice at the Y.M.C.A. in Wenatchee , a town of less than 17,000 in central Washington . The man behind it all is Paul Pugh , thirty-fouryear-old vice principal of the H. B. Ellison Junior High School in Wenatchee . Pugh has been in love with the circus for as long as he can remember . While he was at Whitman College in southeastern Washington , he performed as a guest clown with the Clyde Beatty and Cristiani Brothers circuses when they came to town . In 1953 Pugh was coaching a class of Y.M.C.A. tumblers who put on a half-time act at football games . Soon the junior-high school bought a Trampoline , and the Y.M.C.A. purchased a tightwire . The young tumblers staged performances for money , which Pugh used to buy more secondhand equipment . The kids gave an indoor show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearby town of Cashmere . The trip was a big success , and by 1954 the young performers , dubbed the Wenatchee Youth Circus , had all the bookings they could handle . Operating on a percentage basis  --  usually 70 per cent to the circus , the rest to a sponsoring group such as Rotary or Kiwanis  --  the circus does well to break even . But it reaps a dividend in the joy it brings to the young performers . Every town promises glorious adventure when viewed from the top of a gaily painted circus wagon . The kids are fiercely proud of the equipment , which would cost $50,000 to replace , and they keep it in good repair . They have three tents  --  a cooking tent , a dressing tent divided for boys and girls and a tent for Pugh , his wife Kay and their three young children . Not only do the troupers put up all the tents , nets and trapezes themselves , they also appoint a cleanup detail to police the grounds after each performance . Most of the show 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enables even the shy or awkward ones to face the audience with confidence . Other children spend their first season handling the props or blowing one of the dented but durable horns in the eighteen-piece band . Pugh , a rugged , handsome man who understands children , manages the young performers with a fine balance of firmness and affection . Any child who really wants to be in the circus can join if he is willing to practice three nights a week and every Saturday afternoon all through the winter . Little by little the natural agility and enthusiasm of a novice are transformed into skill and confidence . Pugh watches for latent talent and guides the youngster toward the act which will make best use of his Skills . " You ca n't push them , " the director says . " When they 're ready to try something new , they 'll let you know . " Barbie Meek , the tiny seven-year-old who performs on the high wire , is a good example . At first , traveling with the circus while her mom was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat quietly and watched . Then she tried the low wire and conquered that easily . " We were all surprised , " said her mother , " when she asked to go up on the high wire . " After a few tries , using a safety belt , she became frightened and " froze " in mid-wire . Pugh brought her down and told her to let him know when she wanted to try it again . For almost a week Barbie sat quietly on the ground , studying the high wire . She solved the problem herself and never faltered again . One of Pugh 's young stars , Benny Meyers , went on to professional circus work . A competent juggler , clown and tightwire performer , he now appears with a California circus . But most of Pugh 's present troupers plan less glamorous careers  --  as engineers , dancing teachers , businessmen . Unhappily the circus has had less than glorious success with the few animals it has tried to keep . Most fondly remembered is a baby baboon named BoDee , who survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidentally hanged himself just before a performance in Lewiston , Idaho . The youngsters sadly went through with the show , then buried him behind home plate at the ball park . While the circus has kept mainly to the smaller towns in the Northwest , it did venture to Alaska by airplane in 1957 and made a tour of British Columbia in 1960 . The Canadian trip was broadening for the kids , but it proved almost fatal for the vehicles . One father , a mechanic , had gone along for the ride as a vacation and found himself working harder than he did back at the garage . Scarcely beyond sight of the border , one of the vintage trucks heated up . Every drop of water aboard the caravan was poured into the steaming radiator , and the troupe limped into town  --  the last five miles on water that two chaperons dipped out of ruts in the road . Nothing , however , seems to discourage the tender-aged troupers and the schoolteacher . They have , to date , taken the Wenatchee Youth Circus more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people a year . Plans are now afoot for the circus to appear at the Seattle World 's Fair this year , and in another summer the talented youngsters may realize their fondest dream  --  a trip to the continent of Australia . Certainly no ambassadors we might send could carry a more heartening message : that America 's youth is as strong , as energetic and as self-reliant as any new generation in the world today .
