Hud is a provocative picture with a shock for audiences who have been conditioned like laboratory mice to expect the customary **26;3447;TOOLONG reward in the last reel of a western . Paul Newman , the title-role bad guy , is a cad to the end . <P> <P> But if Hud Bannon is a bounder , he is never a bore . With his good looks , appetite for hell-raising and rootless amorality , he follows his code of don't-give-a-damn with snakelike charm on the cattle ranch where he lives with his decent old father ( Melvyn Douglas ) and his idolizing 17-year-old nephew ( Brandon de Wilde ) . Hud sleeps with married women , blitzes the countryside in a pink Cadillac convertible , and devils the ranch 's devoted and attractive housekeeper ( Patricia Neal ) with whispered propositions . <P> When the Bannons ' herd of prize cattle is infected with foot-and-mouth disease , Hud suggests that they sell the cattle " up North " and get their money , instead of accepting the Government 's 50-on-the-dollar bounty when they are destroyed . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , uncluttered by more than a few words of dialogue , a bulldozer scoops a giant grave out of the grassland and the cattle are driven into it ; then a platoon of men with shotguns and rifles stand around the edge and systematically shoot them dead . Hud , sardonically , fires the first shot . <P> Hud 's meanness is a petty evil : most of his schemes backfire on him , and in the end he is left alone . His father is dead , the housekeeper has taken the Greyhound , and even de Wilde decides to strike out for some greener grassland where men like Douglas may still be . Unrepentant , Hud gives the nephew a parting shot of philosophy : " The world is so full of crap a man is going to get it sooner or later , whether he is careful or not . " Then Hud swaggers into the empty house , opens a can of beer , and slams down the shade on the kitchen door against the sunlight of the late afternoon . <P> <P> Hud 's producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple realism as their strongest tool . They evoke it with sounds : a transistor radio in de Wilde 's shirt pocket twanging hillbilly anthems , the slamming of a screen door on a hot night , the screak-screak of the ice-cream freezer on the back porch , the relentless whistling of the wind scorching in off the plains , the brutal whump of the springs of the Cadillac as it guns across the railroad tracks . They also evoke it with the black-and-white camera of Old Master James Wong Howe : Dr. Pepper signs , juke joints , a greased-pig rodeo . <P> Despite its gimmicky title and selfconscious promotion campaign ( " Why Hud ? " ) , the film is on the level , and the four principal actors-Newman , Neal , Douglas , and de Wilde-are so good that they might well form the nucleus of a cinematic repertory company . The point of the picture is as dry and nihilistic as a Panhandle dust storm . Once , when Douglas is berating his son , de Wilde asks : " Why pick on Hud , Grandpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
