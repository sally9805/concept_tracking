txt A new breed of machines with eagle-sharp electronic eyes and nimble mechanical fingers is taking on tricky product assembly jobs in a growing number of manufacturing plants . While automation techniques have long been widely employed in other phases of production ? materials handling , packaging , stamping and machining  --  they 've moved more slowly into the final assembly stage of manufacture . Now , with the solution of some formidable engineering problems , dexterous machines are putting together such varied products as roller skate wheels , transistors , ballpoint pens , safely razors , electric motors and power steering units for autos . The assembly machines are achieving some sizable savings in labor costs for their users , an important consideration in a period when many companies are troubled by rising Costs and slipping profits . In a few cases , they 're resulting in price reduction on products . " We were able to reduce the price of one series of transistors to 03.50 from $5.50 when we began assembling automatically , " says Leslie J. Woods , Philco Corp . ' s vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic assembly machines frequently make more uniform , higher quality products than can be turned out by human operators . Inevitably , the new machines bring problems along with benefits . The high initial cost is one problem : some of the machines run well over $100,000 each . Also , companies introducing the equipment must often take steps to quiet the apprehensions of union leaders and members about possible job losses stemming from increased automation . Neal Edwards , president of the United Auto Workers local at a plant of General Motors Corp . ' s Delco-Remy division in Anderson , Ind. , voices concern " because people used to stand shoulder to shoulder along the assembly lines , but now you can see only a guy or girl standing here and there along a line . " Automatic assembly machines produce motor tune-up devices at Delco-Remy 's Anderson plant . Sales of Assembly Machines Up Despite these occasional difficulties , companies that make automatic assembly machines report a steady increase in business . Some $253 million will be spent for such machines in the United States this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Automation Magazine , a trade publication . One indication of the field 's growth : All the major auto makers ' 1961 models have parts ' put together by machines which have replaced human hands ; the machine-assembled parts include spark plugs , engine blocks and heads , dimmer switches and push-button tuners for radios . Previously , auto parts industry automation was largely confined to machining operations and was rarely employed for assembly . Equipment for automatic assembly of products is incredibly complex . The mechanical limbs , electronic eyes and other devices automatically sort , feed , fasten and inspect .. Assembly machines are generally built around a Lazy Susan type of revolving . table or a conveyor belt which moves the article being assembled with a jerky motion to several " work stations , " where various tasks are performed . At each work station are automatic tools such as screw drivers , hammers , wrenches , tweezers , drills and riveters  --  each of which would be manned by human operators under old production methOds . Watch an automatic assembly machine in operation at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed by Ferguson Machine Corp. , a subsidiary , of Universal Match Corp. , turns out 12,000 roller skate wheels a day . The job of putting together the wheel 's nine parts and 20 ball bearings is performed at 15 work stations spaced around a rectangular table . A conveyor chain moves the wheels from station to station . Making a Wheel The wheel-making process starts with a small metal sleeve which serves as the center of the wheel . The sleeve slides down a trough from a hopper and onto a spindle on the conveying chain . The chain then moves on to successive stations , at each of which other parts drop around the sleeve . At the second station , for example , a bearing Cone tails into place around the sleeve . The chain : novel to the next station , and 10 tiny conve : ? 0114 more in from all sides to deposit 10 hall hearings In the cone . At . later stations , the rim of the wheel drops into place , then a side of the wheel , then more bearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where necessary . When the wheel is finished , E metal finger ejects it from the spindle and into a carton . While this process goes on , a single attendant keeps the machine stocked with wheel parts , makes occasional adjustments and clears jammed parts or wheels . Manufacturers offer numerous examples of reductions in costs stemming from introduction of automatic assembly equipment . Parker Pen Co .. Janesville , Wis. , recently began using a machine to assemble the six parts making up the top section of a ballpoint pen : the machine cut the number of workers needed for this job to two from 17 . Gilman nrzincering &; Manufacturing Co. , a Parker subsidiary which developed the machine , estimates it will save its $85,000 cost in 13 months . At Gahriel Co . Cleveland , clanking and hissing machines assemble the live parts of a valve which regulates the flow of oil inside an auto shock absorber . The machines assemble the valves at the rate of 2.000 units an hour . Two workers tend the machines . Before the advent of automatic assembly at Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a , rate of about 400 an hour . Western Electric Saves Money Western Electric Co. , manufacturing arm of American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. ' s Bell system . calculates a system for automated final assembly of one type of flexible cable . installed at a cost of $7 million , saves the company $108 million a year . The automatically produced cable consists of a core of conductors surrounded by layers of aluminum , steel and an outer jacket of polyethylene . Inspection devices on the cable production line stop operations instantly if flaws are detected . Murray Manufacturing Corp . located in Brooklyn , says It was able to lop 25% from the price of the biggest-selling model in its circuit breaker line when the model started rolling out of fast new assembly machines . These machines perform such tasks as coil winding , soldering and cutting as they handle wire , insulation material and washers . Transistor makers have proved especially receptive to automated assembly . Early transistor production was done entirely by highly paid operators who cut tiny metallic ribbons , soldered , welded and trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny electrical devices was often difficult to achieve . With machines now assembling parts around the semi-conductor " heart " of transistors , uniformity is improved and production is speeded . Machines feed the minuscule parts to the proper place at the proper time and then weld , etch , solder and test . " Automation is the only way to make quality transistors at low cost , " declares Mr. Woods of Philco . I.B.M . ' s Maehine Texas Instruments , Inc. , Dallas , now pours out transistors for computers at the rate of 1,800 an hour  --  five times faster than the production pace before an assembly machine designed by International Business Machines Corp . was installed six months ago . I.B.M . owns the machine and uses its output Under an agreement with the Texas first . The machine , working with tolerances as close as five ten-thousands of an inch , automatically assembles six transistor parts . Some of ths parts would fit on the head of a pin . A need for high-quality transistors in large volume led to creation of the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new assembly machines in secrecy , hoping to get the jump on competing firms . General Electric Co. , for instance , is mum about machines it uses to put together the delicate parts of miniature light bulbs ; only a handful of G.E . employes has glimpsed them . The machines . which slash the amount of hand labor involved in miniature bulb assembly and speed production , should help G.E . compete with sellers of imported bulbs made in Japan and Hong Kong , where labor costs are low . Among the machinery manufacturers experiencing rising sales of equipment for automatic assembly is Gray Equipment Co. of Detroit . Gray , the designer and builder of Gabriel Co. ' s valve-making machines , says orders for automatic assembly equipment are currently running about 30% above the level of a couple of years ago . One of Gray 's most spectacular machines produces complicated pumps for auto transmissions for Ford Motor Co . Universal Match 's Ferguson subsidiary also reports rising orders . " Our orders for specialized custom machines , the bulk of which are related to automated assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to grow even more , " says a company official .
