The Assassin <P> Sir : I had hoped to save your excellent summary of the Warren report Oct. 2 , but I find that Artzybasheffs ghost is more than I can bear . <P> PAUL ANTHONY ROSS Lexington , Mass . <P> Sir : If it was the intent of Artzybasheff to convey the image of a man with a sick mind , he has succeeded admirably . The smirk , the dead color , the vacant eyes-he has painted a most penetrating portrait of Lee Oswald . <P> HAROLD R. SNYDER JR . <P> York . Pa . <P> Sir : To display the picture of " those who achieve importance by doing evil " might suggest to warped minds like Oswald 's that they try to gain " importance " by committing more such crimes . People wo n't bother to read your explanatory apology for this mischief . <P> JOHN L. MOUSLEY <P> Hackensack , NJ . <P> Sir : Lee Harvey Oswald lived for only one thing : to commit a deed which by its very nature would place him far above the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TIME compounds the dastardly act by using his repulsive likeness on its cover . <P> JOHN T. WHITEMAN <P> Lewisburg , Pa . <P> Sir : May I be among the first to congratulate the artist on a magnificent portrait . Its stark drabness makes one swallow and look again ; Oswald 's searching eyes reveal the madman he really was . Moreover , it is interesting to speculate on the meaning of the stained wall behind him . <P> HERBERT W. SWAIN JR . <P> Kent , Conn . <P> Sir : I believe you have written a concise and accurate synopsis of the Warren report and , as always , have done a magnificent job . <P> THOMAS F. CRONIN <P> Jersey City <P> Sir : Now that the Warren report is published , I am waiting for the journalists and television commentators to correct the gross errors that they made . Immediately after the tragic act , these opinion molders started a campaign trying to convince the public that the assassination took place because of the " extreme right-wingers " in Dallas . In fact , Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every one were partly guilty . Even university professors wrote books and articles about this guilt . The FBI and the Secret Service were criticized because they should have " rounded up " or done something or other with Oswald . But if the FBI and Secret Service were more reluctant to keep watch on extreme left-wingers than on ultrarightists , then did n't these breast-beating , so-called liberals help the assassin ? <P> J. L. LEVKOFF <P> Miami <P> Sir : Along with thousands of other Americans , I am deeply disturbed about the generous and friendly , though carefree way in which our President Johnson is mingling with crowds . It is n't the 999 normal , friendly Americans , anxious to see our President , who worry me . It is that one psychotic , with hate in his heart and a gun in his hand , who frightens me . <P> HARRY B. CLARK <P> St. Cloud , Minn . <P> Broad Accusations <P> Sir : In your cover story about Charles Percy Sept. 18 , you say : " Into the race swept State Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who accused Percy of everything , from being in cahoots with Chicago mobsters to being soft on Communism . " I would appreciate it if you would correct this false charge . <P> WILLIAM J. SCOTT <P> Treasurer of the State of Illinois <P> Springfield . Ill.
