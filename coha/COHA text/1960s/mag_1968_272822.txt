Of the millions of persons who have taken flu shots , fully one-third have paid for their protection with such discomforting side effects as chills , fever and minor infections . Last week Government scientists announced the development of a new flu vaccine that causes reactions in less than 6% of those inoculated . <P> The new vaccine , tested on over 1,200 flu sufferers by the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company of Indianapolis , is now being marketed under the trade name Zonomune . It was developed by Lilly in cooperation with scientists at the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Institutes of Health . Using a modified high-speed centrifuge , a research team headed by Dr. Norman G. Anderson of the AEC 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory was able to remove 95% of the vaccine impurities that have caused side effects in the past . The Lilly Co. has bought three of the $40,000 , 32,000-r.p.m . K-2 centrifuges from the AEC , last month began producing the new vaccine for use during next fall 's pre-influenza season .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
