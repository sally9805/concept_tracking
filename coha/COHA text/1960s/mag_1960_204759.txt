New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller got back in the Republican presidential race this week . <P> Faced with Vice President Nixon 's overwhelming claim on the nomination , Rocky had withdrawn last December as an active challenger . Republicans of every hue , including Dick Nixon , immediately and persistently began to woo him as the most promising vice-presidential candidate around , but Rocky straight-armed every proposal . Last week Rockefeller announced that , to avoid any possible vice-presidential stampede , he would stay away from the Republican convention in Chicago . <P> This was the signal for New York 's Republican state chairman , L. Judson Morhouse , to issue what amounted to a stinging challenge to Nixon . Urging the 96-vote New York delegation to go to Chicago uncommitted , Morhouse said : " We must recognize that the place for Rockefeller 's broad appeal , reaching beyond party lines , is at the head of the ticket . Unless our national ticket this fall is headed by a candidate capable of the appeal that thrusts across and beyond Republican Party lines , we stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the state legislature and many of our local offices . <P> " I believe that Governor Rockefeller should not be ruled out of consideration for the presidency-and that he should not rule himself out . He is not an active candidate and he will not seek the nomination : he has made this plain . The fact remains that he-alone with the Vice President-is one of the truly forceful and distinguished leaders on the national scene . The Republican Party as a whole therefore must look to one or the other of these men as its best hope in 1960 , and it must designate the wisest choice in the July convention . "
