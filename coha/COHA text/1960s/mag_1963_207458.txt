More Roman Catholics are being born than made : there are nearly a million more in the U.S. than a year ago , but just 125,670 are new converts , fewer than at any time in a decade . The 1963 Official Catholic Directory , a 7-lb. , 1,540-page volume released last week , puts the Catholic population in the U.S. at 43,851,538 baptized church members , 23.3% of the whole U.S. population . That total marks a dramatic 44.1% increase in ten years . The largest concentration of Catholics is in the archdioceses of Chicago ( 2,293,900 ) , Boston ( 1,733,620 ) and New York ( 1,704,350 ) . Ordained Catholic priests number 56,540.
