Pierre Cardin is the Parisian fashion designer who first put models in crash helmets , matched short skirts with colored stockings and more recently dressed men and women in futuristic space suits . Fashion experts rank him among the top five trend-setting designers , along with Yves St. Laurent , Courreges , Ungaro and the House of Dior . As haute couture 's top entrepreneur , however , Cardin has no equal . <P> Cardin shocked the French fashion world when , in 1962 , he began to sell copies of his creations . He argued that ready-to-wear clothing manufacturers were already copying Paris creations , " so why should n't we run the show ? " Today he heads a marketing organization that sells clothes to men , women and children in dozens of countries on five continents . <P> Cardin-designed or Cardin-approved products are sold in special boutiques-located in the U.S. , Canada , Italy , Lebanon and France-and through licensees , who pay him a 7% to 10% royalty . Last year , sales amounted to $27 million , more than double the 1965 total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , but the figure runs into the millions . <P> Countless Copies . This week in Paris , Cardin will hold his first 1969 show of the women 's fashions that will later flow out , in the form of countless copies , to the U.S. , Brazil , Japan , Australia , Germany and other countries . Skirts for day wear will be ankle-length and flaring . Like Cardin-designed men 's wear first marketed in more than 100 U.S. stores last fall , the women 's line will be sold in department and specialty stores next fall . Last month Cardin signed a deal with Gunther Oppenheim of Modelia to market Cardin women 's clothes in the U.S. Cardin also markets men 's hosiery through Vanguard , jewelry through Swank , shirts through Eagle Shirtmakers , ties through Cravat-Pierre , pajamas through Host and wallets through Prince Gardner . <P> Most of the products are made in the country where sold , primarily to avoid import duties . An aide handles administrative details while Cardin-often dressed in a white turtleneck sweater , black felt tunic and wide leather belt-creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accessories , though they have his " approval . " His prices run about one-fifth as high as the originals ; among the copies , men 's suits sell for $175 and up , belts for $10 to $25 and shirts for $15 to $40 . <P> Just a Technician . At 46 , Bachelor Cardin may appear to be an affected dandy , but he works in a frenzy , often forgetting to grab even a sandwich for lunch . He learned design in Paris at the House of Paquin , at Christian Berard and at Christian Dior . Equally important was his job as an accountant for the French Red Cross during World War II . " It was there , " he recalls , " that I learned about balance sheets , paychecks and tax schedules . All of that seemed absurd , but it later helped me handle business affairs .
