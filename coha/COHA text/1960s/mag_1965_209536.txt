Few Supreme Court decisions have been so universally admired as Gideon v. Wainwright ( 1963 ) , which reversed the burglary conviction of Clarence Gideon , a Florida indigent , because he had been denied free counsel at his trial . The Constitution entitles every defendant to a lawyer , said the court . <P> Why jeopardize him because he can not afford one ? <P> All American courts were ordered to provide lawyers for indigents in trials of serious crimes , and since 60% of all defendants are indigents , the decision was bound to have enormous impact . <P> Moreover , the Supreme Court not only made Gideon retroactive ; it later ex tended the ruling to all defendants who plead guilty rather than stand trial ( up to 90% in some states ) . In addition , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last January that Gideon applies to misdemeanors as well as felonies ( Harvey v. Mississippi ) . <P> Learning by Defending . As a result of all this , says Research Attorney Lee Silverstein of the American Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Bar Association Journal , Silverstein reports that the Gideon case has particularly affected Alabama , Florida , Mississippi , North and South Carolina , where a poor man 's right to free counsel previously covered only capital cases . The right now covers felonies in all five states . Florida , which produced Gideon , has set up a statewide public-defender system and now permits law students to defend indigents-as do New York , Colorado , Connecticut and Massachusetts . <P> As another Gideon effect , says Silverstein , states have begun to follow the federal rule that a defendant must know what he is doing when he waives the right to counsel . Written waivers are now required in North Carolina , West Virginia and Massachusetts . In other states , the number of waivers is declining . Moreover , indigents who request lawyers at the preliminary hearing in any felony case now get them in Utah , Idaho , Illinois , Virginia and New Mexico . As for misdemeanors , Massachusetts now requires counsel in any case punishable by imprisonment . Texas and New York will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually be extended to juvenile courts which , being noncriminal courts , do not yet guarantee even affluent delinquents the Sixth Amendment right to counsel " in all criminal prosecutions . " As a start , the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges plans to provide lawyers for indigent delinquents in Chicago , Newark , Cleveland and parts of North Carolina . <P> Pride &; Problems . Widely praised as it is , though , Gideon has inevitably raised problems . It pointed the way for Escobedo v. Illinois ( 1964 ) , which recognize an accused 's right to see his lawyer during police interrogation and started the current U.S. confession controversy , and it has not been easy to apply in such judicial crises as last summer 's Watts riot , which swamped Los Angeles courts with more than 4,000 indigent Negro defendants . The N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund charges that the arrested Negroes got almost no legal aid . But the California Supreme Court has refused to hear the Fund 's Gideon-based appeal-as did the U.S. Supreme Court last week .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
