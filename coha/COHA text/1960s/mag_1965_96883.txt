The 70-odd university presses in the U.S. now publish around 1,300 books a year . Most of these are of decidedly limited interest , with such titles as Sound and Form in Modern Poetry , published by the University of Michigan Press . Lately , however , the professors appear to have discovered sport . Here are some examples from this season 's lists : // Hounds and Hunting in Ancient Greece by Denison Bingham Hull ( Chicago , $15 ) . An architect and Greek scholar , Denison Hull first rode to hounds at the age of 40 , became a Master of Foxhounds at 43 and made new translations of Greek texts on hunting when he discovered that previous translators had no practical hunting experience . The result is a valuable contribution to hunting lore , covering hunting practices in ancient Greece that were very much like present-day beagling . Laconian hounds were the size of very large beagles , had a bold , confident manner , black , sparkling eyes and bore such names as Vital , Havoc , Impulse , Cheerful , Bright Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheep by James L. Clark ( Oklahoma , $6.95 ) . The famous sculptor and taxidermist of the American Museum of Natural History here traces the stamping grounds  --  from Sardinia through Turkey and Iran into Asia , and from Alaska through the Rockies  --  of " the keenest-eyed , wariest and most cunning of all big game . " A miscellany and gazetteer combined , the book includes scientific data , hunting anecdotes , record head measurements and casual , offhand recollections of the author 's own hunts long ago in the Russian Pamirs , the Himalayas and Mongolia . // The Birds of Arizona by Allan Phillips , Joe Marshall and Gale Monson ( Arizona , $15 ) . One of the most beautiful of recent bird books , this is illustrated with 51 magnificent color photographs by Eliot Porter and 12 delicate field sketches in color by George Miksch Sutton . The authors , naturally , write most of species found only in the Southwest , like the quaint little red-faced warbler . But so many birds winter in Arizona that the book is also a good guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice Ford ( Oklahoma , $7.95 ) . In 1917 Francis Herrick published a massive two-volume biography which guardedly replaced with facts many of Audubon 's audacious fictions about himself . Professor Herrick did so scrupulous a job that later students hesitated to deal with Audubon 's career , though mysteries still remain . Alice Ford 's book is the first complete biographical study since Herrick 's . It includes new material she discovered in France on Audubon 's father and foster mother , and episodes from Audubon 's storekeeping days in Kentucky . Alice Ford is altogether admiring in her view of Audubon , but she resolutely includes facts about her hero that Audubon 's many enemies did not print . The result is a highly feminine volume , sentimentalized but unsparing. // The Field Notes of Captain William Clark , edited by Ernest Staples Osgood ( Yale , $12.50 ) . A newly discovered journal by the captain of the Lewis and Clark expedition may seem a long way from sport , but in fact the first 1,600 miles of the journey from St. Louis to the Pacific was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye for flavorsome details , recording hunting exploits almost every day  --  a total of 77 deer , 11 bear and one elk killed between May 19 and July 22 , and deer tracks on the prairie " as plentiful as hogs on a farm . " No slaughter addict , he liked to watch the young deer feeding on the willows and playing along the sandy beaches of the Missouri . He reported on wild plums , crabapples , wild cherries , grapes , hazelnuts and raspberries , and commented , " What a field for ... a natirless "  --  his way of spelling naturalist . On Christmas Day he wrote , " The men frolicked and hunted all day . Several Turkeys killed . " But he was also a hard , farsighted military man , and among these papers , lost for almost 150 years , were the plans that he and Meriwether Lewis worked out for the defense of the West . Discovered in an attic in St. Paul , Minn. in 1953 , his lost journal has been made into a book that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its comments . // Down the Colorado by Robert Brewster Stanton ( Oklahoma , $5 ) . In 1889 a Denver businessman named Frank M. Brown promoted a daring transcontinental railroad that would thread its way through the Rockies on water-level grades along the Colorado and through the Grand Canyon . As the first survey party entered the Grand Canyon itself , Brown and two companions were drowned . His chief engineer , Robert Stanton , was so convinced that Brown was right that he led another party through at his own expense . This was the first expedition after that of John Wesley Powell to go all the way through the Grand Canyon . Stanton found the Colorado a wonderland of deer , geese , ducks , fish , waterfalls , springs , hidden glens , cliff dwellings , awesome colors and shapes , and innumerable rapids , each of which he detailed with almost Proustian exactitude . He became a prominent engineer , but remained so embattled about the Colorado railroad route that he wrote a book on his survey ( unpublished ) and a two-volume history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative has been extracted .
