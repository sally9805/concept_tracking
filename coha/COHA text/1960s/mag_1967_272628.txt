It has been 500 years since an anonymous German artist finished off an exquisite engraving of the Madonna enthroned with eight angels , then added the date 1467 and the inscrutable initials E.S . To this day , nobody knows his identity . Some scholars believe he was Egidius Steclin , a 15th century goldsmith who worked in the Duke of Burgundy 's court . Others insist that he was Erwin von Stege , onetime mintmaster to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III . Or , as one archivist suggests , was he really Endres Silbernagel , an obscure Freiburg painter who died of the plague in 1503 ? <P> Whoever he was , Master E.S . is considered the first major engraver . To commemorate the quincentenary of his last known work , the Philadelphia Museum of Art this week opens the largest display yet of his prints , providing critics of all persuasions with a rare opportunity to sleuth for themselves . To be sure , the work itself is the liveliest source of clues . Besides the initials , it is full of crests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , where the artist probably lived . <P> His interest in heraldry suggests he may have been a nobleman , though his faulty Latin-the patrician language at the time-contradicts it . He very likely was well traveled ; a Bern watermark appears on several prints . <P> Knaves &; Saints . The surest fact that can be gathered from his work is that Master E.S . was a goldsmith whose crisp , fine-lined incising in gold and silver undoubtedly led him to explore engraving on copper plates . Gutenberg had just discovered a way to print words , and perhaps the notion that pictures too could be printed in much the same way led E.S . to experiment . He may have started simply by making studies for goldsmith work . Some of his prints , indeed , seem to be design patterns for chalices and monstrances . But he went on to fashion in copper a Gothic world in microcosm . <P> His subjects were often religious , but he set them in a provincial milieu : his every window opens onto a Rhine castle , his every Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in the ballads of troubadours who wandered from manor house to manor house . E.S . captured the spirit of it ; his saints and sinners , knights and ladies tiptoe through dainty Alpine primroses to dally on wattle fences . At times he was downright satirical . His Samson is a knave in a tunic and Tyrolean hat , his Delilah a Hausfrau who has slipped away for an afternoon assignation . As for St. Sebastian , E.S . portrays him peppered with arrows by a merry lot that looks for all the world like Robin Hood and his men . <P> Pudding Faces . In an artistic sense , Master E.S . was handicapped . He knew nothing of the magical discoveries in perspective being made at the time in Florence by Piero della Francesca . His was strictly a two-dimensional world . As if straining to portray flesh-and-blood emotion , he gave his people big noses , pudding faces , puffy eyelids , and the result was often close to caricature . He himself was not capable of the profound humanity expressed by Flanders ' Rogier van der @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sublimely anguished figures of his countrymen to come , Drer and Grnewald . <P> What he did do was pioneer a new technology that gave later , greater artists a medium for more powerful expression .
