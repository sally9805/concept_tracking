Separating the Boys <P> Sir : The childish pronouncements on the draft June 3 of those who would enjoy the harvest without the labor are empty and redundant . Joe College ' 66 is a sad , disgusting example for my children to have to follow . He tempts me to resign to avoid contributing to the security in which he is free to demur and complain . <P> GARY D. BELCHER <P> Captain , U.S.A.F. <P> San Angelo , Texas <P> Sir : Whenever the Class of ' 66 feel sorry for themselves , they should count the graves at Arlington , or the crosses on Iwo Jima , or the Chosin headstones , and then thank God that they have the privilege of an education and free choice of career . And instead of fearing the unknown , they should look forward to military service . Most ex-servicemen will tell you that some of their best times and most lasting friendships were in the armed forces . <P> HOWARD G. BLAIR <P> Peoria , Ill . <P> Sir : Although my advanced age ( 29 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 , I would remind them that few if any Americans have been enthusiastic about the prospect of military service . It is , as it was , an experience unmatched in monotony , unequaled in frustration , unsurpassed in futility-but unavoidable if peace and freedom are to be maintained . If the world is full of contradictions , it is also full of opportunities and hope , and it is a challenge to graduates individually to correct the one by pursuing the other . <P> CHARLES R. MCDOWELL <P> Administrative Assistant to the Superintendent <P> Department of Public Instruction <P> Phoenix , Ariz . <P> Sir : These boys may be over 21 , but they wo n't be men until they realize that no war can be fought at a convenient time or place . We have only today 's war , and it must be fought today , on today 's battlefield . <P> CHARLOTTE DUNN <P> San Diego <P> Sir : Why , pray tell , did Wilson wait until his senior year to apply for an academic deferment ? Why did he not plan ahead for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why did he avoid the ROTC program , which takes at least some of the uncertainty out of pre-Army life ? Come off it Gary , David , Douglas , Paul ! How about a little less whining and a little more determination as we thank God that we were not born in time for Okinawa , Iwo Jima , Omaha Beach and Guam . Those young guys were inconvenienced too , you know . Because they were , you 've got your precious freedom and college education . <P> CHARLES R. GRIZZLE <P> Burbank , Calif . <P> Sir : I agree with the students who object to military service . For some people the military is a complete waste of time . For those who will learn a useful skill or gain valuable experience in human relations and management , military service might be worthwhile . For others , like those working toward an academic career , it is valueless , a loss of time that could be put to better use . Furthermore , what does a future history or biology professor have to offer the armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not need everyone of eligible age . Let it bypass those who will contribute least and lose most by being required to serve . <P> RICHARD A. HORVITZ ' 66 <P> Harvard College <P> Cambridge , Mass.
