still with us . There have , to be sure , been successes , but no spectacular metamorphosis of the urban scene . What went wrong ? For one thing , renewers discovered it was no great problem to take a bulldozer and of a sunny afternoon go out and demolish a slum . But finding better housing for the people who had lived there was quite another matter . It was easy , too , to build elegant , high-priced apartment buildings ; the complication came in finding tenants able to pay the rents . Private developers , often at their own considerable expense , had to learn that successful renewal did not admit of their making a great killing every time out . In some early ventures ? such as Boston 's West End and St. Louis 's Mill Creek* private developers cleared a site , only to discover afterward that the market would not support rapid or extensive redevelopment . So the land stayed empty ? a yawning , dusty symbol of renewal 's failure . Certainly in the great majority of cases every effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But good will and genuine concern could not create livable vacant apartments where none existed . Thus , as it did away with sonic slums , urban renewal sometimes added to the crowding in others . Chicago 's much talked about Hyde Park ? Kenwood project is an example . There a rundown , crime-ridden neighborhood ? " apache territory " we used to call it when I was an undergraduate at the adjoining University of Chicago ? was transformed into a handsome community of tidy town houses and comfortable apartment buildings . At the outset , the Hyde Park ? Kenwood Community Conference , a model grass-roots citizens ' participation group , wanted the neighborhood not only sightly and safe but racially integrated as well . They also wanted it economically homogeneous . So they turned down a two-hundred-unit public housing project , and all new housing was in the middle-income range ? beyond the means of most Negroes who had been living in the area . Integrated the neighborhood was ( and is ) , but along economic strata . Poor families ? both Negro and white ? had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsewhere ? as is said to have happened in Atlanta ? " Negro removal " was the result of racist rather than class motives , a weapon to keep Negroes from encroaching on white neighborhoods . But , in general , urban renewal has displaced more Negroes than any other group for the simple reason that Negroes inhabit the very worst see- * Both are now on the way toward development . For Mill Creek , see " St. Louis Takes the Cure " by A. M. Watkins ( Harper 's , August 1964. ) tions of our cities . The slums , our greatest technological failure , and racial discrimination , our greatest moral failure , are brutally enmeshed . There were other problems . Slum landlords , particularly in large cities like New York , Chicago , and Boston , saw the renewers coming and practically salivated with greed . Urban renewal offered a way to get a respectable price for their worn-out buildings along with a final chance to wring them dry ? at the expense , as usual , of their tenants . With renewal in prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrens were often redivided again , and even minimal upkeep ceased . But sometimes two or three years elapsed before a project actually got under way , and in the interval a slum landlord made a handsome buck . Yet despite the accusations of the Neilans and the Dowdys , the administration of the urban-renewal program itself has been free of scandal . Indeed , there has been an almost frantic effort to close any loopholes which might precipitate charges of graft and corruption . In a country where the idea of planned , federally financed urban change is far from popular , one scandal could well have toppled the works . So the government men in charge set up an elaborate system of bureaucratic checks and records . Maddening 58 THE ROW OVER URBAN RENEWAL delays have often resulted . But there has been no misuse of public funds . Attesting to this rather remarkable record , Texas Congressman Albert Thomas , whose subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations has reviewed the operation of the program since its inception , not long ago said : " It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of different pieces of property involved , Sixty to sixty-five thousand pieces of property have been bought . I have not heard of any public scandal . " Neighborhood Face-lifting Apart from the virtue of honesty , renewers can point to substantial achievements in Philadelphia , Hartford , Baltimore , Chicago , Little Rock , Washington , Detroit , Pittsburgh , New Haven . Worthy of mention , too , is the Baylor Area Project in Waco , Texas , which has replaced sixty-three acres of miserable shacks and ramshackle buildings with neat open streets and over $4 million of new construction . Renewal-agency tabulations show that home ownership among the people there displaced has increased by 8 per cent and that only 5 per cent of them now live in substandard homes ? compared to 85 per cent before relocation . Successes of this kind are often forgotten or disdained by die-hard opponents of urban renewal , who , in the words of Federal Housing Administrator Robert Weaver . " like to picture it as a bureaucratic monster , armed with a bulldozer that ruthlessly uproots people and lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their bill of indictment includes shoving poor people and small businesses out of their homes and established locations , making the hard life of non-whites harder , leaving valuable areas to stagnate while planners plan , doling out benefits that the federal government ca n't afford to local governments which do n't need them . " The trouble with this caricature is not only that it is totally untrue but that it ignores much that has changed in urban renewal 's aims and methods . These changes have been brought about through successive amendments of the original 1949 Housing Act . Among the most significant has been the attempt , as of 1954 , to complement the clearance and total redevelopment of slums by rehabilitating those gray areas soon destined to slither over into the slum category . The process generally costs far less than tearing down and redeveloping an entire neighborhood and it also helps check the dismal cycle whereby oneslum is cleared only to have another quickly take its place . To date , Philadelphia perhaps has employed this new tool of renewal with more intelligence and success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brings frustrations of its own . For one thing , how is a poor man to pay the cost of fixing up his home to the standard of an urban-renewal plan ? Such problems are not actually insurmountable though they are made to seem so in The Federal Bulldozer , a new book-length attack on urban renewal by Martin Anderson , an assistant professor of finance at Columbia University ( published by the M.I.T. Press ) . He believes that our urban housing problems can be overcome through the efforts of private enterprise buttressed by more public housing . Robert Weaver disagrees . He points out that we simply can not meet the country 's housing needs unless we rehabilitate the buildings that are worth saving and replace the ones that are not . " Rehabilitation will work because it has to work , " he says , " if we are to establish and maintain healthy cities . " On this premise , the 1964 housing bill authorized federal below-market interest loans for rehabilitation to owners of homes and businesses in urban-renewal areas . Other assistance programs are planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery of large apartment buildings in Chicago has been rehabilitated successfully through low-interest loans with only nominal increases in rents . Renewers have come to place so high a value on rehabilitation that it is now standard practice before beginning a project to determine if the job ca n't be done by rehabilitation alone . And , in fact , the majority of urban-renewal projects in recent years have been a combination of rehabilitation and clearance . Thus the old image of the renewer as the man behind the bulldozer has been rendered obsolete . " The Rich , the Poor , and the Peculiar " The rehabilitation program is only one of several significant changes in urban-renewal activities . Perhaps more far-reaching in its effect has been the decision to permit the use of federal funds to improve commercial and industrial areas . The resulting program of downtown renewal has had some exciting successes ? among them Baltimore 's Charles Center , Constitution Plaza in Hartford , the new sports arena with the movable roof in Pittsburgh , Norfolk 's Gateway Project , and Capitol Mall in Sacramento . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would help lure some of the city 's affluent residents back from the suburbs . This has indeed come to pass . When the central city was refurbished , many middle-class families returned to live alongside former residents in mixed neighborhoods that include what one observer has called " the rich , the poor , and the peculiar . " This has happened with no disturbance and little accompanying fanfare . Although it can not be statistically proved , it appears that downtown renewal has brought about more integrated housing than President Kennedy 's 1962 Executive Order on Equal Opportunity in Housing . ( That order brought down the color bar on almost one million additional housing units , but not that many Negroes have chosen to " bust " white neighborhoods and put up with the agonies such a move often involves for their families . ) Downtown renewal has also fulfilled a second hope ? that it would improve the city 's tax base . In Washington 's Southwest Project , for instance , a former slum area that yielded only $443,409 a year in taxes will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million a year . The site of the Gratiot Project in Detroit , which used to earn $71,700 , now yields $375,000 . Elsewhere , assessed values have been increased five-fold by redevelopment . To be sure , the city 's tax revenues from its downtown area shrink while a project is under construction . Martin Anderson , in The Federal Bulldozer , makes much of this fact . But he fails to note that in Boston , for instance , 14,000 jobs in the downtown area disappeared between 1950 and 1960 , before renewal , and $78 million of taxable assessments vanished . Downtown renewal may seem a far cry from slum clearance . But in fact it can play an important part in creating better job opportunities and improving housing conditions . This has been demonstrated , for example , in Atchison , Kansas , a city which had been sliding downhill , both financially and spiritually . As rail traffic dwindled , there seemed little reason ( and less hope ) for the city 's survival . In 1960 , almost as a last-ditch effort , downtown Atchison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree-lined shopping mall . The effect was dramatic . The new downtown inspired the people of Atchison to refurbish their own homes without any formal program . Many did the job themselves , obtaining free technical advice from the local urban-renewal agency and local architects . Meanwhile , sales-tax revenues in the downtown area have risen 30 per cent ? as have , obviously , sales ? and a number of new jobs have opened up . The city is undergoing something like a renascence , from the center outward . This same pattern will doubtless be repeated elsewhere . Waiting for Utopia Downtown renewal projects , of course , generally do not involve moving people out of their homes . But any direct attempt to eradicate the slums , whether through urban renewal or any other means , runs head-on into the stark fact that we are desperately short of decent low-rental housing throughout the nation . In 1960 , the National Housing Conference , the AFL-CIO , and the National Association of Home Builders estimated that to reduce overcrowding , replace substandard housing , and accommodate the exploding population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built by 1965 . But in the past fifteen years we have actually constructed just over one million annually , faith privately and publicly . In short , something like a half-million to 700,000 much-needed housing units are not going up each year . In New York , that city planner 's nightmare . there is even a shortage of substandard housing . Nor will public housing presently scheduled fill the gap . Although the figure may soon be increased , only 37,500 new units annually are now authorized . One melancholy effect of the anti-renewal clamor has been to mute public ? and Congressional ? enthusiasm for the vast public housing program we still need . To argue , as do some of the more fanatic anti-renewal brigade , that private enterprise can do the job alone if left to its own resources is to ignore the plain historical evidence that our present urban mess is the result of that same private enterprise , untrammeled and unplanned . A new approach to the low-cost housing problem has been made possible under Section 221 d3 of the 1961 Housing Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonprofit or limited dividend basis , these developments are given extremely low-cost financing and can obtain mortgages of up to 100 per cent . The National Association of Home Builders has endorsed the 221 d3 program ? and little wonder , since it enables the private builder to put up low-rental housing with a virtually guaranteed profit . These developments , which are called 221 d3s , are manna to mayors and urban-renewal directors seeking homes for displaced people. * In North Little Rock , where I myself am involved in renewal , we hope that three hundred of these apartments can he built . To qualify we must first establish that the apartments are needed and that prospective tenants can afford the rents . In the fall of 1964 , out of 391 families queried in a sample survey , 361 were seriously interested in the new housing . But 170 of them , including fourteen elderly couples , were not financially eligible because the FHA 's rather middle-class standards hold that no more than 25 per cent of a family 's income should go for housing costs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them are already paying more than the 221 d3 rentals . Thus we have the sad situation in which nearly half the group are demonstrably too poor to afford the best buy yet produced by the partnership of government and private enterprise . In North Little Rock as elsewhere , the only answer for them is a vastly increased program of public housing . " What the devil are we supposed to do in the meantime ? " one urban-renewal director recently asked me . " Of course I 'd like to have more first-rate housing to move our people into ; it would make both their problems and my own job easier . I 'd also like to provide the battery of social services so many of them need . But until we do have these things , we have to scratch and scramble to do what we can . The alternative is simple : do nothing ! " Moment for Miracles Within the next decade in Boston , which has embarked on a particularly bold renewal program , half the city 's two million inhabitants may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will be uprooted elsewhere as we rebuild our cities ? some hardships are inevitable . This has also been true , however , for the far greater numbers who have been displaced by highway * These developments are also among the best rental bargains in the nation ? centrally heated , capacious , equipped with modern kitchens , sometimes even with central air conditioning . A one-bedroom unit usually rents in the $55 to $75 range , with all utilities paid . So far , 18,000 such apartments in 120 projects have been built , another 10,300 in an arld:tional 78 projects are committed , and applications for 40,000 more are anticipated in 1965. construction and other public works . On the other hand , uprooting need not inevitably be a disruptive experience . Indeed when relocation experts have helped a family establish a new home , and have brought them into contact with the community 's social agencies ? this may be precisely the moment when miracles of human rehabilitation can he accomplished . A promising effort to achieve such miracles is now under way in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project will include high- , medium- , and low-income housing and will be racially as well as economically integrated . The aim is no less than the social as well as the physical rebirth of the community . To this end , as few people as possible will be forced to leave the neighborhood during construction . As relocation becomes necessary , it will proceed in three stages . First to be moved will be stable households able to relocate readily . The second group will include low- or middle-income families who want to remain in the neighborhood but face some sort of obstacle . Finally , plans will he made for households with severe or complex difficulties . Almost every urban renewal project has its share of the last category . Here in North Little Rock , for example . I not long ago called on Samuel McG. , an illiterate Negro with a wife and ten children . For all practical purposes , the McG.s ? like all too many other Americans ? are a one-family underdeveloped nation . Sam McG. is at once a victim of automation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to express itself only in the self-defeating habit of producing more and more children . Somehow , over the years , he accumulated enough money to buy a small lot and a two-room shanty without plumbing in a Negro slum which is the site of the city 's first major urban-renewal project . On my first visit , I was astonished by the children 's good behavior . Ten kids were crowded into two dank rooms . yet there was no fighting , teasing , quarreling , or complaining . A Negro colleague of mine who knows the MeG.s well explained that this was not unusual ? when the rest of the world seems to be lined up against it , a family learns to stick together and not make trouble for one another . In the McG.s ' case , urban renewal is asked to undo what long years of ignorance and indifference have done . It can not . But it can make a start . We found them a roomy if inelegant house , structurally safe , on a spacious lot adjoining woodlands . The McG.s bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a few dollars left over . The McG.s ' oldest child Jenny is very taken with the new house . She is fourteen , very bright , and now learning secretarial skills in high school . Here , in the person of Jenny , is a starting point . In a sense , urban renewal itself can be said to be at a starting point . Thousands of new homes and apartments have been built and the face of a number of American cities has been changed . And 1,500 projects are either completed or under way in nearly 750 cities across the nation . These efforts have shown , above all , how much remains to be done . Originating as a simple real-estate venture with a simple humanitarian thrust ? to tear down slums because they are unfit for human beings ? urban renewal has brought into public view multitudes of people who , through years of economic deprivation and psychological hopelessness , are in themselves walking slums . It has found an entrenched pattern of city ghettos and cold indifference , if not outright hostility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , indeed , that much of the animus directed against urban renewal is an angry reaction to the sordid realities of American society which the program has exposed . For it is now evident that curing these social ills is essential to the rebuilding of our cities . Thus , for example , we need better and more comprehensive welfare services to ease the task of relocation ; genuine civil rights would , among other things , open up more housing to minority groups ; and a serious frontal attack on poverty is the essential social counterpart of physical renewal . It would seem only common sense that those who approve these social goals should also endorse urban renewal . But , instead , too many avowed " liberals " have supplied carping criticism , mercurial enthusiasm , and inconstant political support . Much of this criticism has been accurate and useful . While Jane Jacobs ' ideas on city planning seem to me altogether wrongheaded , her writing has certainly spurred the efforts of renewers to minimize the difficulties of relocation . But the critics of the Left have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate , since the renewal program needs the support of liberal-minded Americans . As it is , the renewers are blasted from the Right and sniped at from the Left . And since they are enormously sensitive to pressure and , for the most part , no braver than most , they have tended to grow cautious , to sell urban renewal not because it is morally imperative but because it is good , sound business . It probably is good , sound business . But more importantly , renewal is necessary business . It can be slowed down but not stopped ? not , that is , unless we intend to sit back and watch the weeds of congestion and decay quietly grow over our cities . With the support of those who genuinely want to save our cities and the people who live in them , urban renewal may one day help achieve the cities of order , spaciousness , and beauty envisioned by such sophisticated urbanists as Lewis Mumford . One day , who knows , urban renewal , so long made to seem a dragon in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a St. George .
