The Florida sun was smiling , and so were the New York Yankees ; Mickey Mantle was looking good at first base , and the team was winning again . The Mets were losing as usual , but at least they were losing big - 23-18 , to the Boston Red Sox . The San Francisco Giants ' Juan Marichal , baseball 's reigning pitcher , was having such a good time skindiving back home in the Dominican Republic that he decided to ask for $125,000 instead of a mere $100 , - 000 . Baseball 's opening day was less than a month away . So what were most sport fans talking about ? <P> Football . <P> <P> After years of bitter competition for talent , the National Football League and the American Football League joined forces in Manhattan last week for the first common draft of college players . As a spectacle it was a tribute to marital bliss-and the unassailable fact that two can live cheaper than one . Gone were the dark tales of interleague raiding , of burly " baby sitters " keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the fantastic bonuses of yesteryear . The most a top draft choice could expect was a mere $200,000 or so-which is nice enough , but nothing like the $485,000 that Quarterback Joe Namath got from the New York Jets in 1965 . <P> <P> Even so , there were enough crunching blocks and backfield razzle-dazzle to satisfy the fans . The general idea of a draft is for the weakest teams to pick first , thereby spreading the wealth . But the two days of haggling over 445 players produced such a blizzard of trades among the 25 teams that hardly a single player ended up where expected . <P> Age Before Promise . The fledgling New Orleans Saints , the N.F.L. 's newest team , had first pick . But the Saints opted for age , not promise , and they , traded their No. 1 spot for the Balti more Colts ' first-class , second-string Quarterback Gary Cuozzo . Baltimore , which finished a strong second in the N.F.L. 's Eastern division last year , happily grabbed Bubba Smith , Michigan State 's mammoth ( 6 ft. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chants of " Kill Bubba , kill . " The hapless New York Giants ( 1-12-1 ) were supposed to be No. 2 in line . But the Giants had already traded their position-plus a lot more-to the Minnesota Vikings for Quarterback Fran Tarkenton ( TIME , March 17 ) , and the Vikings lost no time hauling in Bubba 's All-America teammate , Halfback Clint Jones . The Atlanta Falcons were slated for No. 3 , but they passed that privilege on to the San Francisco 49ers in return for three veterans . San Francisco , in turn , chose Florida 's Heisman Trophy-winning Quarterback Steve Spurrier , who had been earmarked for the Giants in all the pre-draft maneuvering . <P> Crazy ? Maybe . Before all the prime beef was gone , the A.F.L. 's Miami Dolphins grabbed Purdue 's Star Quarterback Bob Griese ; the Denver Broncos took Syracuse Halfback Floyd Little ; and the Detroit Lions snapped up U.C.L.A. Halfback Mel Farr . After that , the pros were mostly going through the motions and hoping for a sleeper .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
