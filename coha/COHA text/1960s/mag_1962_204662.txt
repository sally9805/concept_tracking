The pride of Holland 's city of Arnhem is a sturdy 11th century Gothic structure called the Eusebius Church . Badly damaged during World War II , this Dutch Reformed church has gradually been rebuilt in strict accordance to medieval style . But when Architect Theo Verlaan came along to rebuild the steeple , things changed fast . <P> One of Verlaan 's assistants was a sculptor named Hendrik Vreeling . Last winter he began to think about the gargoyles that Verlaan had planned to surround the steeple at the 230-foot mark . Why not , Vreeling suggested , have a little fun with the job by imitating the medieval builders and carving some unconventional gargoyles ? Great idea , replied Verlaan . He suggested something " eternal " - comic strip characters , perhaps . The delighted sculptor went off to work , within three months hacked out 23 stone figures copied from the cartoons of Hollywood 's Walt Disney and from a popular Dutch cartoonist named Maarten Toonder . Among his figures were Donald Duck , Mickey Mouse , the wisest of the Three Little Pigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Up went the steeple , gargoyles and all , until a local paper reported the startling innovations . Then everyone awoke in alarm . " A sculptor who lets himself be inspired by the pitiful figure of Donald Duck is to be pitied himself , " fumed the Rev. G. C. Foeken , one of the preachers at Eusebius Church , who had not heard about the lofty figures until the papers arrived . The Netherlands Christian Women 's Association of Arnhem , 800 strong , demanded that town officials defend the " dignity of the steeple . " <P> Soon all of Arnhem , and half of Holland , was talking about the gargoyles . Cartoonist Toonder wrote in to suggest that his copyright was being infringed . At last report , no protest had arrived from Disney , and Arnhem 's burgomaster thought the affair more funny than vulgar . go right ahead , he told Verlaan after trudging topside for a look . That was just enough to spur Sculptor Vreeling on to greater artistic heights . Not far from Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dragon peeping out from a mushroom-shaped cloud . The dragon 's face is unmistakably that of the enraged Pastor Foeken .
