" When I was very much younger , " wrote Oscar Hammerstein II in the introduction to a collection of his lyrics , " I thought that if I ever made all the money I needed out of writing musical comedy , I would then sit back and turn to straight dramatic plays in which I could say whatever I wanted to say and state my reactions to the world I live in . " His rhyming verse made him a millionaire many times over , but Hammerstein never stopped writing it . While becoming the most popular lyricist in the history of American musical theater , he learned that he could say all he wanted to in song . <P> With his collaborator , Richard Rodgers , he set a new standard for the modern musical play , integrating verse with dialogue , music with plot , in a theatrical form that once demanded little more than a loose collection of songs , skits and dances . Hammerstein 's lyrics were almost always written first , often completed after weeks of agony walking mile upon mile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases to be wrapped in melody by Rodgers . Whether he was writing about Austrian singers , New England factory workers or a Siamese king , there was always a steady undertone of old-fashioned American positivism in Hammerstein 's lyrics . As he frequently admitted : " I just ca n't write anything without hope in it . " <P> Short &; Simple . " When you walk through a storm , hold your head up high , " he wrote in Carousel , " and you 'll never walk alone . " In a hurricane , he could unerringly find the calm center : in 1943 , when wartime headlines were black with death on coral beaches , Oklahoma ! opened on Broadway , and Hammerstein 's words carried across the world the picture of a beautiful morning , " a bright golden haze on the meadow . " Just then , many people everywhere were grateful for the reminder that such a thing existed . In a slicker mood , he could be both cute and funny . As the Hammerstein June busts out all over , <P> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be new sheep . <P> <P> Master of stylized vernacular and the dropped g , he was also a minor poet , attaching long insights to short , simple words : <P> <P> Who can explain it ? Who can tell you <P> why ? Fools give you reasons , wise men never <P> try . <P> <P> Like Cole Porter , he could dip into a source play , borrow a line and spin a lyric . In Ferenc Molnar 's Liliom , the heroine wonders aloud what it would be like " if I loved you , " then pauses to reflect silently . Adapting the play as Carousel , Hammerstein and Rodgers filled the pause with unadorned grace : If I loved you , <P> Time and again I would try to say <P> All I 'd want you to know . . . <P>
