One or more large park benches . Some low stools at the edges of the stage indicate bushes . Enter Patrolman Avonzino , a policeman from the Keystone comic movies with a waterfall mustache , thick black eyebrows and a large silver star . Swinging his billy club jauntily , he shades his eyes and peers down the paths for trouble . Reassured , he extracts a small memorandum book from an inner pocket of his jacket and reads : PATROLMAN AVONZINO " Wednesday , April 26 " Right .

( Hotly ) Why ca n't they do their nuisances at home ? That 's what homes are for : to do your nuisances in .

Tommy , now invisible in the carriage , is to be played by a full-grown man . Millie brings the carriage to rest by a bench . She peers up the various paths in search of Officer Avonzino . Disappointed , she prepares to make herself comfortable . From the foot of the carriage she brings out a box of chocolates , another of marshmallows , and a novel .

WILCHICK ( Laughing girlishly : ) Why , Mr. Avonzino , you 're like the author of this book I 've been reading .  --  Dr. Kennick . He says babies are regular geniuses in their first fourteen months . He says : you know why babies sleep all the time ? Because they 're learning all the time , they get tired by learning . Geniuses , he says , imagine ! p. 8 PATROLMAN AVONZINO What he say ? WILCHICK They learn more than they 'll ever learn again . And faster . Like hands and feet ; and to focus your eyes .

Miss Wilchick , I see one thousand babies a day . And what I say is : stop ' em . That 's your business , Miss Wilchick ; that 's my business . There 's too many ingeniouses in Centra ' Park right now : stop ' em . ( Tommy begins to howl . Avonzino points at him with his billy club ) What did I tell you ? They all understand English . North'a Eighth Street they all understand English . WILCHICK ( Leaning over Tommy 's carriage : ) There , there . Nice policerman do n't mean one word of it .

WILCHICK Well , you have some of my marshmallows and candy . MRS . BOKER Marshmallows ! Oh , I know I should n't !  --  Have you noticed that being around babies makes you think of eating all the time ? I do n't know why that is . ( Pushing Millie in raucous enjoyment of the joke ) Like , being with babies makes us like babies . And you know what they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Boker , what will you say next !  --  How is Moe , Mrs. Boker ? MRS . BOKER ( Her mouth full : ) How is he ! ! Sometimes I wish he 'd be sick for one day  --  just to give me a present . ( Lowering her voice ) I do n't have to tell you what life with a baby is : ( Looking around circumspectly ) It 's war  --  one long war .  --  Excuse me , I ca n't talk while he 's listening . ( She rises and wheels Moe 's carriage to a distance ; returning , she continues in a lowered voice ) My husband believes that Moe understands every word we say . p. 11 WILCHICK Mrs. Boker ! MRS . BOKER I do n't know what to believe , but one thing I do know : that baby lies on the floor and listens to every word we say . At first my husband took to spelling out words , you know  --  but Albert Einstein , there  --  in two weeks he got them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those big eyes ! And then my husband took to talking in Yiddish  --  see what I mean ?  --  but no ! In two weeks Albert Einstein got Yiddish . WILCHICK But , Mrs. Boker ! ! It 's just a baby ! He do n't understand one word . MRS . BOKER You know that . I know that . But ( Pointing to the carriage ) does he know that ? It 's driving my husband crazy . " Turn it in and get a dog , " he says . " I did n't ask for no prodigy , " he says . " All I wanted was a baby  --  " ( Lowering her voice ) Of course , most of the time my husband worships Moe only only we do n't know what to do with him , as you might say . WILCHICK Oh , you imagine it , Mrs. Boker ! MRS . BOKER Listen to me !  --  Have some of these pretzels ; they 'll be good after those sweets . Listen to me , Junior 's at the crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband calls him Christopher Columbus .  --  My husband 's stepped on him five times . p. 12 WILCHICK Mrs. Boker !

Now listen to me : Christopher Columbus follows us wherever we go , see ? When I get supper  --  there he is ! He could make a gefilte fish tomorrow . That child  --  mad about the bathroom ! Know what I mean ? My husband says he has a " something " mind  --  you know : d. i. r. t. y . WILCHICK Mrs. Boker . MRS . BOKER Sometimes I wish I had a girl  --  only it 'd be just my luck to get one of those Joans of Arcs . ( Moe starts to howl ) There he goes ! Like I said : understands every word we say . Now watch this : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her mouth ) You must n't let them smell what you 've been eating , or else  --  Listen , Moe , like I was telling you : New York City is divided into five boroughs . There 's the Bronx , Moe , and Brooklyn and Queens  --  ( Moe quiets almost at once ) See how it works ?  --  Richmond and Manhattan .  --  It 's crazy , I know , but what can I do about that ?  --  Yes , Manhattan ; the largest , like I told you , is Manhattan . Yes , Manhattan . ( She looks in the carriage . Silence ) Is n't it a blessing that they get tired so soon ? He 's exhausted by the boroughs already . p. 13 WILCHICK But he does n't understand a word of it ! ! MRS . BOKER What has understanding got to do with it , Miss Wilchick ? I do n't understand the telephone , but I telephone . ( Tommy has raised his head and is listening big-eyed . ) TOMMY N'Yak Citee divi fife burrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't say it .

WILCHICK ( Loud : ) But I do n't know the boroughs . Please , Mrs. Boker , just once , you show me . MRS . BOKER I 'll try something else . Watch this ! Listen , Tommy , are you listening ? " I pledge legions to my flag and to the republic in which it stands . " You were a girl scout , were n't you ? " Something something invisible with liberty and justice for all . " ( Tommy has fallen silent ) " I pledge legions to my flag " WILCHICK ( Awed : ) Will anything work ? p. 14 MRS . BOKER ( Lowering her voice : ) They do n't like those lullabies and " This little pig went to market . " See , they like it serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby .  --  Well , now we got a little quiet again . WILCHICK Mrs. Boker , can I ask you a question about Moe ? Take one of these ; it 's pineapple inside Is Moe , like they say , housebroken ? MRS . BOKER Moe ? ! Gracious sakes ! Moe makes a great show of it . I guess there is n't a thing in the world that interests Moe like going to his potty . ( She laughs ) When he wants to make us a present : off he goes ! When he 's angry at us oh , no ! He plays it like these violinists play their violin which reminds me ! ( Looking about her speculatively ) Do you suppose I could just slip behind these bushes a minute ? is that police officer around ? WILCHICK Well-ah Officer Avonzino is awfully particular about nuisances , what he calls nuisances . Maybe you could go over to the avenue there  --  there 's a branch library MRS . BOKER Will you be an angel and watch Moe for me ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week and the months of the year . He loves them .  --  Now where 's this library ? p. 15 WILCHICK Why , the Museum of National History 's right over there . MRS . BOKER ( Scream of pleasure : ) Museum of Natural History ! ! How could I have forgotten that ! Just full of animals . Of course ! I wo n't be a minute , dear ! ( They exchange good-byes . Mrs. Boker goes out . Millie eyes Moe 's carriage apprehensively , then seats herself and resumes her novel at the last page . ) WILCHICK " Roger came into the room . His fine strong face still bore the marks of the suffering he had experienced . " Oh ! I imagine his wife died . Is n't that wonderful ! He 's free ! " He drew her to him , pressing his lips on hers . Forever , he said . " Oh ! " For-ever .

Moe , why are you thatway at me ? p. 16 MOE ( Surging up again , glaring : ) My daddy says I 'm stupid . He says , " Stupid , come here ! " He says , " All right , stupid , fall down ! " I do n't want to talk . I do n't want to look . G'bye ! ( He disappears ) TOMMY What does " stupid " mean ? MOE ( Invisible : ) I wo n't tell . ( Surging up , showing his fingers ; a rapid-fire jumble ) Do you know what these are ? Sometimes you call them fingers ; sometimes you call them piggies . One , two , six , five , four , two , ten . This little piggie stayed at home , I do n't know why that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud bell rings ? You do this : ( Telephone business ) " Hello jugga jugga jugga , " and when you do n't like it any more you say , " G'bye !

I hate him . But I watch him and I learn . You see : I learn . And when I get to walk I 'm going to do something so that he wo n't be any more . He 'll be away  --  away where people can walk on him .  --  Do n't you hate your father ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like , once a year . MOE You mean : once a day . TOMMY Moe , what does " year " mean ? MOE Year is when it 's cold . TOMMY ( Brightening : ) Yes , I know . MOE Sometimes he holds out his hands and says : " How 's the little fella ? How 's the little champ ? " And I give him a look ! I was n't born yesterday . He has n't got anything to sell to me . TOMMY Moe  --  where 's your mommy ? ( Silence ) Moe , she 's not here . Where 's your mommy ? You do n't hate your mommy , do you ? MOE ( Turning his face sideways , cold and proud : ) I do n't care about her . She 's always away . She goes away for years . She laughs at me with that man . He says : " All right , fall down , stupid , " and she laughs . I try to talk to her and she goes away all the time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  goo-bye !

Maybe I 'll never be able to walk or make talk . Maybe they did n't give me good feet or a good mouth .  --  You know what I think ? I think they do n't want us to walk and to get good and get better . They want us to stop . That 's what I think . ( His voice has risen to a hysterical wail ) Goddam ! Hell ! ( He starts throwing cloth elephants and giraffes out of the carriage ) I 'm not going to try . Nobody wants to help me and lots of time is passing and I 'm not getting bigger , and and ( Anticlimax ) I 'm sleepeee ( He continues to whimper ) ( Millie wakes up .

( Moe has hushed ) And then there 's West End Avenue . ( She can hardly believe her luck ; she whispers ) And then there 's Riverside Drive . ( She peers into the carriage a long time , then tiptoes to the other end of the stage ; with clenched fists ) I hate babies . ( Toward Tommy ) I hate you  --  sticking your crazy face into my business  --  frightening Officer Avonzino , the only man I 've talked to in six months . I hate you  --  always butting in .
