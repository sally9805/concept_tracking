txt Letters to The Times at stake . ALFRED E. KAHN . Ithaca , N.Y. , Oct. 9 , 1962 . Letters to The . Times Investigating Corporations Stand on Privacy Rights , Asserted in Steel Case , Challenged The writer of the following letter is a former member of the senior staff of the Council of Economic : Advisers and of the Attorney General 's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws . He is chairman of the economics department at Cornell . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Having studied history under Prof. Henry Steele Commager 25 years ago , I took special pleasure and pride in his brief letter in your issue of Oct. 2 , contrasting the decision of the Department of Justice to retry eight alleged Communists for contempt of Congress with the Senate Judiciary Committee 's decision not to institute such proceedings against the four major steel corporations that had refused to supply cost information to its antitrust and monopoly subcommittee . Professor Commager drew from these contrasting decisions the possible implicatiqn that we have " one law for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the powerful . " I would suggest another , equally anomalous , implication : that we are often more solicitous of the privileges and immunities of corporations than of people . The contrast is particularly provocative in that one of the committee 's reported reasons for rejecting the Kefauver subcommittee 's recommendation with respect to the steel companies was that " the data were n't pertinent to the subcommittee 's lawmaking business " ? the very reason many others would cite for questioning the appropriateness of the questions asked of the offending eight human witnesses . In an age in which revered concepts like liberty and resistance to tyranny are so misused as to be proffered in justification of a Governor 's defying the orders of a Federal court to admit a Negro to a state university , it should perhaps not be surprising that the very Congressmen who are so willing to invade the privacy of natural men are chary of doing so in the case of corporations . Dispute on Retraction The same confusion was blatantly manifested in the dispute engendered last spring by the President 's efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price increase , when numerous commentators and businessmen professed to see in those efforts an imminent threat to the personal liberties of all of us . It is time to restate , as Justice Brandeis did so eloquently in his historic dissent in Liggett v. Lee . " the essential difference between corporations and natural persons . " A corporation is a creature of the state . It enjoys numerous valuable privileges , all of them conferred by the state . I know of no philosophic , economic or legal reason for supposing it enjoys or ought automatically to enjoy the rights of natural men . It is anomalous , to put it mildly , for these beneficiaries of state bounty and privilege to assert rights of privacy against governmental inquiries in the public interest , when natural persons are forced to answer the most intimate questions about their beliefs and associations . Governmental investigation of the prices charged by billion-dollar steel corporations is not by any definition an infringement of personal freedom , any more than are governmental influences brought to bear on the wage bargains fixed in negotiations between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchised public utility companies . - On the contrary , the Government has a responsibility to protect the economic interests of ( natural ) consumers against these exercises of market power . The time and place to defend human liberties are when the liberties of humans are at stake . ALFRED E. KAHN . Ithaca , N. Y. , Oct. 9 , 1962 . Do-It-Yourself Exchanges TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your Oct. 2 editorial on the AntiDigit Dialing League prompts me to submit a partial solution to this vexing problem : Let the telephone subscriber create his own name exchange . Suppose , for example , that the telephone user is confronted with a new number , ' say , something like 682-0000 . From the telephone dial , 6 corresponds to M , N or 0 and 8 corresponds to T , U or V. The subscriber can then compose any exchange to suit his fancy : MUltiflora 2-0000 , OVoviviporous 2-0000 , OThello 2-0000 , etc . The subscriber is limited only by the imagination . Thus , when the subscriber gives out ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very own personal exchange and even put it on personal or business stationery . My plan will not interfere with the telephone company 's desire to number all exchanges , nor will it cause inaccurate dialing . Thus , all parties should be happy . NORMAN FINE . East Brunswick , N. J. , Oct. 2 , 1962 . Arthur Levitt Backed Re-election as Controller Urged on Basis of Experience To THE EDITOR OF THE NNW YORK TIMER : It almost seems that the principal qualification for public office in many instances is that the candidate be totally unfamiliar with the duties of that office . The quadrennial charade which goes by the name of nominating convention inevitably results in a slate of nominees selected mainly because they happen to be members of the party in good standing . Yet now and again the electorate votes into office the best man in spite of his party label . Specifically I refer to the important office of New York State Controller , occupied with distinction for the last eight years by Col , Arthur Levitt , the sole Democrat ele. - .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . The Republican Governor and Senator , who have been renominated , are certainly men of ability and the highest character . Apparently they are favored to be elected . However , it Is an incredible waste of eight years ' experience to bring into the Controller 's office a new man who has no knowledge of its complex nature and intricate financial problems . As an example , Colonel Levitt spent $2.3 billion of state funds in fiscal 1961 , much of it received from refunded bond issues , on which he saved the taxpayers over $200 million by his own skillful method of judging the world money markets and paying reduced interest rates . He conceived the School Board Financing Authority , which has eased the tax burden of New York 's cities , towns and villages . His administration of the huge ( $1.7 billion ) Teachers ' Pension Fund has won him the plaudits of financiers and economists , Republican and Democrat . In effect , why train a new man to replace Colonel Levitt as guardian of the state funds ? Why is public office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? NUEL SEFF . New York , Oct. 8 , 1962 . Who Uses Crowded Highways ? To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEs : At times one is forced to wonder whether Park Commissioner Newbold Morris is living in the world of reality . He was recently quoted as saying that the main users of our parkways are pleasure drivers and that drivers use the parkways more for their beauty than because of their utility . Is n't it astonishing that these lovers of pleasure and beauty should gather during rush hours ? Perhaps the pleasure is enhanced by having multitudes of other cars present to slow the journey . Since former Commissioner Moses voiced the same inanities , I assume this distorted view of reality is an occupational hazard which has afflicted Commissioner Morris . It is time for a little more objectivity on the part of the Commissioner . E. JACK HARRIS , M.D. Massapequa , L. I. , Oct. 3 , 1962 . Treating Narcotic Addicts TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a doctor who has been involved in the treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great difficulty in treating these patients , I want to congratulate you on your Oct. 8 editorial pointing out the need for fresh approaches to the problem of narcotics addiction . It has been obvious to many of us that the punitive approach to drug addiction has not been successful . We welcome your editorial and take it as support for our view that the treatment of addicts should be left in the hands of the medical profession , as in England . EDWARD GORDON , M.D. , Resident in Psychiatry , Metropolitan Hospital . New York , Oct. 9 , 1962 . Support on Mississippi TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The undersigned law teachers in a Southern university would like to associate themselves with the statement of Law Professors supporting the President 's actions in Mississippi which you printed- on Oct. 5 in your columns .
