<P> The dominant characteristic of Polish art has always been its steadfast alliance with Western Europe . This Slavic nation , situated on plainlands , has been invaded from all sides , by Mongols , Cossacks , Tartars , Teutonic Knights and Nazis ; yet across the centuries it has remained a stronghold for artistic styles as familiar in Paris and Venice as in Warsaw . In no small part this allegiance comes from Poland 's 1,000 years as a Christian nation oriented toward Rome . <P> To celebrate the millennium this year , Chicago 's Polish community-the largest outside of Poland-requested and got from the present Communist government an exhibition of 127 historic objects that display the nation 's artistic heritage . The exhibition of treasures from Poland , which is currently at Chicago 's Art Institute and will travel next to Philadelphia and Ottawa , makes it clear that the Polish were as responsive to Gothic and Renaissance styles as the rest of Europe . <P> Backbreaking Gesture . The reliquary bust of St. Sigismund ( see color page ) demonstrates the multiple origins of Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cathedral in Plock in 1370 , the gilt object commemorates the martyred king of Burgundy , killed by the Franks during the 6th century , who became so popular that three kings of Poland took the name of Sigismund . The crown , studded with tourmalines , diamonds , pearls and sapphires , was commissioned in Venice nearly 150 years before the making of the bust , which was fashioned in Germany . <P> Polish artistry drew on the resources of Europe . During the early 16th century reign of Sigismund I , Italian Renaissance artists were at work in Poland . Even two centuries later , the most famous master in the country bore the name of Bernardo Bellotto , a nephew of Canaletto . A court painter from 1767 to 1780 , he used a camera obscura to obtain perfect perspectives for his city scapes . After the destruction of Warsaw during World War II , his paintings were so accurate that they were used to reconstruct demolished monuments and buildings . The horn of the Wieliczka salt miners , made in 1534 from a bison that roamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . Offered in the king 's name by the mine-owner to his well-organized craft guild , its backbreaking gesture seemingly turns their burdens into the symbol of an elegant cornucopia full of goodness for all men . <P> Wooden Birds . Just as in Holland , where Hals and Rembrandt painted citizen companies of harquebusiers , Polish burghers formed shooting fraternities . Their aim was to defend their city walls ; more often they were social militias . Their targets were wooden birds atop staffs , a custom recalled in the Cracow fraternity 's emblem , which was the gift of Sigismund Augustus in 1565 , with its silver cock resplendent in royal crown and symbolically attached by a chain to its perch . Poland has been partitioned out of existence only to re-emerge as a nation , changed again under present-day Communism , but its ancient traditions are preserved in its art . In fact the shooting fraternity of Cracow still exists . Each year they parade with a replica of their royal bird to their ritual gunnery .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
