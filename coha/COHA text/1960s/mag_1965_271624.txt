The judge sent for the jury . The twelve white men filed into their seats . " Gentlemen , " said the judge , " have you made any progress since the last time ? " <P> " Judge , " said Farmer Clifford McMurphy , the foreman , " I would n't say we 've made any progress . We 've been hung at the same almost from the outset , judge . It 's been right constant . " <P> With no hope for an end to the deadlock , the judge declared a mistrial and sent the jury home . And so , last week , in the county courthouse in Hayneville , Ala. , ended the murder trial of Collie Leroy Wilkins , 21 , who had been charged with murdering Detroit Housewife Viola Gregg Liuzzo on the Selma-Montgomery highway in March . <P> Wilkins was the first of the three men accused of the Liuzzo murder to stand trial ; the other two , Eugene Thomas , 42 , and William Orville Eaton , 41 , are scheduled to go to court on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high courtroom drama with a rich cast of characters : the jury , all natives of Alabama except for one man , a transplanted Floridian ; Circuit Judge Thomas Werth Thagard , 63 , a gently humorous man with a long and respected record of public service ; the soft-spoken prosecutor , Circuit Solicitor Arthur E. Gamble Jr. , 45 ; the melodramatic defense attorney , Matt H. Murphy Jr. , 51 , self-described " Imperial Klonsel " of the Ku Klux Klan ; the defendant himself , a bored auto mechanic , potbellied despite his youth ; Robert Shelton , Imperial Wizard of the United Klans of America , who sat at the defense table providing moral support and advice until the judge requested him to take a seat elsewhere ; and the two key prosecution witnesses-Negro Leroy Moton , 20 , who was riding in the car with Viola Liuzzo on the night of the murder , and FBI Informer Gary Thomas Rowe , 34 , who was in the car with the accused killers . <P> Overcome . Leroy Moton took the stand and told how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 and left Selma just after 7:30 p.m . At about 8 o'clock , Moton was " fiddling with the radio dial , and she was humming We Shall Overcome , ' " when " a car pulled up beside us and shot into the car two or three times . " When the car came to a stop down the road , Moton shut off the ignition , turned off the lights and waited for five minutes . Soon " a car came back , " shone its lights at the Liuzzo car , then drove off . When Moton tried to stop a passing car , he was nearly run over , so he " went back to the car and passed out for about 25 or 30 minutes . " <P> Star Witness Rowe , who had been an FBI informant in the Klan for more than five years-during which the FBI paid him a total of $9,000-told a story that for sheer throat-gripping drama could scarcely be equaled except in fiction . <P> " Looka There ! " On the day of the murder , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas and Eaton . Late in the afternoon they got a warning ticket for speeding from a state patrolman.
