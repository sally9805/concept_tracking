In the early days of Islam , when conquering Arab armies swept across Christian Syria , mosque making consisted of seizing Christian churches , closing their western entrances , opening new doors to the north , and praying facing south across the aisles toward Mecca . A few decades later , Moslem caliphs began to raise the first authentic mosques , blending Byzantine and Persian architecture , and in 691 A.D. the Caliph of Damascus , Abdul Malik Ibn Marwan , completed the great shrine called the Dome of the Rock . <P> Over the centuries , the lead-sheathed wooden dome and most of the rest of the structure had to be restored on several occasions , but never in history did it suffer so much as from Israeli mortar fire in 1948 . Architects reported that the entire structure had been so weakened by bombardment and the ravages of time that it needed renovation at once , and the Moslem nations set about raising $2,000,000 for the job . Last week Jordan 's King Hussein , 28 , surrounded by Moslem and Christian representatives from Arab nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the way it was during the Middle Ages . <P> The original mosque , in what is now Jordanian Jerusalem , was built around the rock from which Mohammed supposedly rode to heaven on horseback in 632 A.D. The architecture was plain : a dome , 72 ft. in diameter , raised on a colonnaded drum to a peak of 116 ft. and set in the center of an octagon . But the decoration was splendid : quartered-marble paneling and glass mosaics on gold backgrounds . <P> Curved sheets of aluminum bronze alloy have replaced the lead on the dome , thus lightening the load from 200 to a mere 40 tons , and Egyptian and Jordanian architects have added an aluminum staircase inside it . New mosaics , tiles and marble from Italy , Greece , Turkey and Belgium have been set into the walls . The mosque is most resplendent after dark : for the first time , the Dome of the Rock is illuminated like a thousand Arabian nights , with indirect lighting inside and huge spotlights set on the grounds outside .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
