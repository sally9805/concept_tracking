THE SPANIARD AND THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS by Fernando D/az-P/a/a. 223 pages . Scribner's. $4.50 . <P> " For many years , we Spaniards have done nothing but praise ourselves . Maybe it 's as well , after so much flouting of our virtues , for us to meditate on our sins . " Author Diaz-Plaja , after due meditation , decided that Spanish sins are very human sins , and , when practiced by Spaniards , almost virtues . <P> Historian , anthologist and member of the Spanish Academy of Letters , Diaz-Plaja uses as his yardstick the seven deadly sins of medieval theology . His countrymen , he says , are completely free of the sin of avarice , largely because it conflicts with their dedication to the sin of pride- " The man who is obliged to keep up appearances shows off first and then counts the pennies . " Spaniards , he says , are openly lustful ( " There is nothing clandestine about Spanish appreciation of sex " ) , but not particularly gluttonous : they consider clothes more important than food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but mostly because they regard work as an indignity . They are envious to the point where they find it almost impossible to praise anyone else . And they are usually angry , explosively so , at injustices , real or imagined . <P> To Diaz-Plaja , the origin of all Spanish sins is the sin of pride . Spaniards have never forgotten that in the 16th century even stable hands wore swords and boasted family shields . They are convinced , he says , that they are the equal of any man , even if they happen to be shining his shoes . No government , not even a dictatorship , can impair their basic dignity , which often reaches the point of anarchy , because " the Spaniard always adapts the laws to his personality and never the other way around . " Diaz-Plaja , in fact , sees his countrymen 's pride as so overbearing that , for all its wit and insight , his book might have been better if he had not even bothered with the Spaniard 's subsidiary sins .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
