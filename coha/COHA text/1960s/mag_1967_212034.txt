Violence in America 's cities , a burning issue in the nation today , seems likely to persist as a major theme through the 1968 presidential elections . With that thought in mind , Lyndon Johnson last week flew to Kansas City , Mo. , to present the forgathered police chiefs of 350 U.S. and Canadian cities with his own program and prescriptions for coping with urban anarchy . To judge by the reception accorded him at the 74th annual convention of the International Association of Police Chiefs ( see THE LAW ) , the President and the professionals are on the same wave length . <P> Johnson asked the cops ' backing for two riot-related Administration bills : the " safe streets " act , now through the House but still in subcommittee in the Senate , which proposes better pay and training for police ; and long-delayed gun legislation that would curb mailorder sales and require a degree of licensing for all small arms . Hitting out at lobbies like the National Rifle Association 's , the President maintained that his firearms legislation was well within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the blessings of individual freedom . " <P> <P> Poisonous Propagandists . In response to the common feeling among police that federal crime and gun laws would infringe on local authority , L.B.J. assured the chiefs : " I did not propose that the Federal Government take over the job of dealing with crime in the streets . Washington can not patrol a neighborhood in the Far West , stop a burglary in the South , or prevent a riot in a great metropolis . " <P> Johnson 's loudest applause-after the round that greeted his support for higher police pay-was evoked by his condemnation of racial violence in the slums . " Much can explain but nothing can justify the riots of 1967 , " he said . Condemning Black Power agitators , " whose interests lay in provoking others to destruction while they fled its consequences , " Johnson declared : " These wretched , vulgar men-these poisonous propagandists-posed as spokesmen for the underprivileged and capitalized on the real grievances of the suffering people .
