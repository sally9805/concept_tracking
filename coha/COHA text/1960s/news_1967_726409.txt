txt Two diametrically opposed views of the United States ? destroyer of peace and builder of peace  --  have been laid before the international world here . They were neither as serious as they sounded , nor as harmless as a battle of propaganda . The debate on these two concepts , put forward by Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin and President Johnson , proceeds at the General Assembly here on two quite different levels . One is an intensive East-West struggle for votes and for the political leadership of the uncommitted world . This was pursued relentlessly by Premier Kosygin who attacked like a prosecuting attorney , driving hard for a conviction of Israel and by implication of the United States . Mr. Kosygin gave no credit to President Johnson for declining to intervene in the Middle East crisis . On the contrary , in the spirit of giving no quarter in debate , he charged the United States with directly sponsoring and aiding the Israeli victory . Mr. Kosygin likewise gave Mr. Johnson no credit for pledging that the territorial integrity of the Arab countries would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean what it said . While the Soviet Premier gave battle on the level of parliamentary debate and of the cold war , President Johnson conspicuously took the high level . He spoke very mildly of the Soviet guest in his country . He laid out a broad five-point program , whose ingredients were already familiar from his earlier // *It 's rugged : UN shivers a little // statements of policy , for laying the foundations of " durable peace " in the Middle East . Mr. Johnson seemed to be playing for the second phase of the conference when the struggle for votes will be past , and private diplomacy begins . He appeared to hope also that his high line would attract the more sober of the underdeveloped countries . By general agreement this remains to be seen here . At present writing the temper of the Assembly has yet to show itself , and it may not yet be formed . The UN is accustomed to rugged debate , but shivers a little when the stakes are as high as they are this time . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East settlement which is the basis of President Johnson 's policy , reaffirmed once again in his Monday address to the nation . This is generally conceded here . The President hopes to let the working of economic and political pressures on both sides bring them , over a period of time , to see that they must coexist . The Arabs , if this is to come about , will have to concede the existence of Israel and leave its supply lines alone . With Soviet help , or even abstention , this would be an extremely difficult task . With Moscow pushing the other way , it would be impossible . And in that case , Israel is expected to be equally intractable . On the American side , the President 's aides hope he will be able to lift the debate above the level of the local conflict , even above the level of the East-West cold war , and onto an admittedly high plane of negotiation . Mr. Johnson is prepared to say to the man he talked with over the hot line recently that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , and that both could be greatly endangered by it . That the logic of events is on the side of agreements to protect all the countries in the area , because this is what the big pow ers would have to come to , in the end , in their own interest . There are hints that Mr. Kosygin will listen . But none as to what his decision will be . Hence the impatience to get beyond the first highly dramatic round of arguments here , and into the private talks that will surely follow . There have been some private exchanges already , between the two countries ' ambassadors , but these are understood to have been more on arrangements than on matters of substance at this writing . There is no sign that Messrs . Kosygin and Johnson have had extensive secret talks and have reached tentative agreements of any importance , except on the one point of nonintervention in the recent fighting . If it turned out that such talks had taken place , many close observers would be completely surprised . The available evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constructive outcome would be considered a very great fortune indeed .
