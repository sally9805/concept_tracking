With tongue in cheek , Christianity Today noted the renascence of a fine old Puritan practice . In Pottstown , Pa. , teen-agers have banded together in the Society to Bring Back Bundling as a distinct improvement over the variable climate and other distractions of , say , the drive-in theater and dead-end street . Reports the magazine : " Parents and preachers , roused by a badly bungled moral code , banned bundling ; better heating in larger homes cooled it . Bundling has been rekindled by a spark from a new moral code . " Said the president of the Pottstown bundlers : " In many colleges , boys and girls today are allowed in the dormitories without supervision . Surely our conduct is far above this . " Concludes Christianity Today : " Perhaps it is - if bundlers abed by the rules . "
