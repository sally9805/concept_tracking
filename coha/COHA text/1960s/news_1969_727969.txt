txt Three of New York 's largest stores  --  Gimbels , Abraham &; Straus and E. J. Korvette  --  have independently agreed to extend credit to welfare recipients . On the urging of welfarerights organizations , the stores will issue scrip or shopping coupons to the welfare clients , who will be asked to repay the face value from their welfare payments . Retailers ' policy has been traditionally to grant credit accounts only to individuals based on their earning ca ? pacity . In soliciting the city 's big stores , merchants said , the welfare-rights groups pointed to the " discriminatory " nature of such credit-granting policy and insisted that their members do have income through obtaining welfare benefits . Applicants granted either the scrip or shopping coupons will first be screened by either the // City-Wide Coordinating Committee of Welfare Groups or by the Brooklyn Social Welfare Action Committee , which represent thousands of welfare recipients . The credit-granting plan will go into action after the welfare-rights groups submit lists of applicants to the stores . Retailers generally declined to go into details over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitations from many welfare recipients . However , it is understood that Gimbels is planning to issue scrip for sums up to $150 each to as many as 200 applicants . A spokesman for Abraham &; Straus , Brooklyn , said that the store " has worked out a program with the Brooklyn Social Welfare Action Committee whereby A. &; S. shopping coupons are sold to credit applicants previously screened by the action committee and passed on by A. &; S. 's credit department . " The big Brooklyn department store reportedly will issue its standard $1 shopping ' coupons to welfare recipients in the form of $30 and $50 coupon books , to be repaid over a period of time . The coupons are the same ones used by A. &; S. in its " convenient shopping plan . " Korvette 's method of granting credit to welfare recipients could not be learned . In each case , however , the credit will be granted to the applicants without the store 's going through the normal process of checking their credit record or financial condition , other than the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Macy 's New York has not been approached by welfarerights groups to participate in ' a similar credit plan , a Macy 's executive said . ' We have had a lot of contact with people making demands of this kind , but we have not deviated from our policy of granting credit on an individual basis , " he said . According to local merchants , most of the other big stores in the city , including Macy 's , are to be solicited to join in the program . On July 3 , about 30 persons demonstrated before the Sears , Roebuck store at 31st Street and Ninth Avenue because , as a representative of the demonstrators said , Sears had declined to grant credit to welfare recipients .
