Since Lockheed Aircraft Corp . built its final turboprop Electra seven years ago , the Burbank , Calif. , company has been searching for ways to get back into the passenger plane business and balance its space and military contracts with airline orders . Supersonic jets were one way , but Lockheed lost the SST contract to Boeing . Air buses-giant planes carrying double today 's passenger load at subsonic speeds-were another way , and here Lockheed has at least been successful . In a joint announcement last week , TWA , Eastern Air Lines and a British firm called Air Holdings , Ltd. , disclosed that they will purchase 144 of Lockheed 's 256-passenger L-1011 air buses-50 each for Eastern and Air Holdings , 44 for TWA-at a total cost of $2.16 billion . The order was not only by far the biggest ever placed for commercial airplanes , but also one with international significance . <P> Rolls ' Engines . Among other things , it will sizably affect both the British and U.S. balance of payments . Each $15 million L-1011 will have three fanjet engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base of the tail for balance and easier servicing . Competing to provide the engines were Britain 's Rolls-Royce and the U.S. 's General <P> Electric and Pratt &; Whitney ; the Rolls RB-211 turbofan was the engineers ' choice because of efficiency and lower noise levels . But at $2,500,000 a plane , the British-made engines meant a $235 million drain on the U.S. balance of payments . Lockheed solved this with an arrangement in which Ah " Holdings will sell 50 of the early L-1011s abroad . This will bring in $625 million for a favorable U.S. balance of $390 million , and further sales in a market estimated at 1,000 planes by 1980 could raise the U.S. excess to well over $5 billion dollars . <P> The 175-ft. air bus , a civilian spin-off of Lockheed 's C-5A military transport program , will carry passengers eight across in coach class and six across in first class . Two aisles toward the sides of the plane will separate the eight seats into a two-four-two arrangement . The plane can also carry 345 people , all in tourist class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent by elevator to the passenger level . The Rolls engines will carry the big jets 3,160 miles at speeds equivalent to today 's jets , but the L-101ls will need less landing and takeoff space and will arrive and depart more quietly than present jets . Beginning with the first delivery in late 1971 , both TWA and Eastern plan to use the planes on high-density routes like New York-Miami or San Francisco-Los Angeles . <P> McDonnell 's Setback . Lockheed Chairman Daniel J. Haughton announced that the present L-1011 work force of 1,200 will increase to 11,000 by next year . Haughton was equally pleased that with last week 's order , Lockheed had outflanked rival McDonnell Douglas , whose DC-10 is a similar air bus . McDonnell two months ago sold 25 DC-10s to American Airlines at $16 million apiece ; American also has an option to buy 25 more . Lockheed 's response was to slash L-1011 prices from $17 million to $15 million each , and coolly advise prospective customers to buy fast-before the price went back up .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
