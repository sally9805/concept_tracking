On the banks of the Wabash , near Lafayette : one large strong tree , with a swing . A path through grass , around and about . A Man sits on a rock : his feet are tied , and behind him his hands are tied . Nearby is a Boy of seventeen or eighteen , and a Girl who is a little younger . Both are attractive : the Boy Negro , the Girl White . Everybody is a little mussed up . The man 's hat lies near the rock . The Man appears to understand that he is in some sort of preposterous and unaccountable trouble : he looks from the Boy to the Girl , astonished , angry , speechless , but at the same time fascinated . It 's hard to guess what 's going on . All the same , everything is simultaneously peaceful and charged with energy . GIRL ( Sings softly ) " If a body  --  BOY Careful he do n't kick you . GIRL Oh , I 'm ready for him , do n't worry about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may be one of those Houdini guys who can get himself out of a tight spot as if it were nothing . Check his wrists , check his ankles , do n't let him start anything he 'll regret . ( Man looks at Boy , amazed . ) GIRL ( Half-dancing , half-singing ) Wrists O.K. Ankles O.K. ( Moves around Man ) p. 3 BOY And hang onto that stick , in case you have to hit him over the head again . GIRL ( Swings stick dangerously near Man 's head ) I hit him a real good one , did n't I ? ( Pantomines baseball swing with stick ) BOY Right out of the ball park . GIRL ( To Man ) Does it hurt ? ( Man answers with a disgusted glance . To Boy . ) You ought to see the bump I put on the back of his head . BOY You were batting one hundred percent all right . Did you play a lot of baseball as a kid ? GIRL Football , too . BOY We had a girl one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Tippecanoe meets the Wabash , played better football than anybody else on the team , except me . ( Picks up Man 's hat and wears it for a moment . As Girl calls signals he uses hat as a football , assumes the center position . Girl catches the hat and runs . ) GIRL Girls are all right calling signals . All right you guys , get the lead out  --  18 , 21 , 33 , 74 , hike , but not too good in the line . BOY Up to thirteen or so they 're all right in the line , too , but after that they go kind of soft . p. 4 GIRL Well , a girl 's got to do something . She just ca n't be a boy all her life . BOY ( Takes apple out of pocket ) I would n't want to put a flying tackle on a girl over the age of fifteen . It would be like tackling your mother or something . You might follow through on baseball , though . ( Tosses apple to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) GIRL I just play for fun . BOY ( Pantomines baseball pitcher 's wind-up ) One of these days you 're going to see a girl pitching for the Cincinnati Reds . GIRL Oh no , it would be a lot easier for a girl to be President , would n't it ? BOY One of these days we 'll have a girl President , too . ( Assumes runner 's " on your mark " position ) Her husband will hang around and entertain diplomats from Afghan , is , tan . ( Girl looks as if she does n't understand . ) Pour tea , you know , and wear a new suit three or four times day . GIRL ( Girl duplicates his stance ) And smile all the time , and say nice things ? BOY ( Both change to " get set " position ) It is n't always going to be what sex you are , and things like that . It 's how you play the game . ( As if on signal both " go " . Girl stops , notices Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflexion ) Would you be good enough to just scratch the end of my nose , please ? GIRL ( To Boy ) Shall I ? BOY I 'm not sure . It could be a trick . GIRL I wo n't , then . MAN Well , in that case , would you just hold out that stick ? GIRL ( To Boy ) How about that ? BOY Well , that might be all right , but watch him carefully . I do n't trust him . GIRL Who does ? ( Holds out stick , Man leans forward , rubs his nose against it . ) MAN ( Softly ) Thank you . ( Pause ) Now , perhaps you wo n't mind letting me know what this is all about . GIRL As if you do n't know . MAN I most certainly do n't . Why am I here ? Tied this way ? BOY I do n't know why you 're here , but you 're tied because I tied you . MAN When ? BOY A little while ago , when you began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand . BOY It 'll come to you . MAN ( To Girl ) Who are you ? GIRL You 're not very sincere , are you ? MAN I most certainly am sincere , and I would rather you did n't dispute everything I say . GIRL Everything is you , is n't it ? BOY The sun rises and sets on you , does n't it ? MAN No more than it does on you . I 'm not very good at games . I never have been . So please just tell me what this is all about . GIRL Oh , we 'll tell you all right , do n't worry about that . ( Goes to Boy ) Wo n't we ? BOY I do n't believe a hangman needs to be told the story of his life . MAN Why should I be considered a hangman ? BOY I do n't believe anybody needs to be told who he is . MAN I 'm not asking to be told who I am , I know who I am . I 'm asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordinarily I 'm not required to try to communicate with undeveloped minds . I have nothing against youth , as such . ( Girl goes to swing and sits ) It 's just that for thirty years or more my relations have been with only the most developed minds , where the conflicts are not quite so primitive , and the contest is essentially abstract and impersonal . ( The Boy squats and traces a pattern on the ground as the Man speaks ) Nobody has ever before needed to tie me to establish a point . If I have been cherished at all , it has been precisely in that I have been free , not just a man of the world , which I am , but also a man whose study has been time itself , light itself , energy , and the actions and relation-ships of these universal , but mysterious things . ( Girl applauds ) Thank you , I feel awkward tied , even if only physically . I do n't like it . p. 7 BOY ( Erases pattern with sweep of hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 've got to put up with them just the same , and you 've got to put up with being tied . MAN Well , are you mad then , the both of you ? Is that it ? BOY We could ask you the same question . MAN And my answer is  --  no , I am not mad . Therefore , please be good enough to untie me and let me go about my business . BOY Plenty of time . ( Does setting-up exercises ) MAN There is not plenty of time . I have so far deliberately preferred not to make known who I am , but now I have no choice . BOY Not so fast . Remember , I 'm in this , too . Anything you say , I want witnesses to hear . MAN Witnesses ? BOY Witnesses . MAN Very well , then , where are your witnesses ? BOY They 'll be here . MAN I take it you 've telephoned for somebody ? BOY I have not , because there is no phone around here . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BOY There has n't been anybody to send . MAN Well , how about going yourself ? BOY And leave you here alone with her ? MAN Why would that be so unconscionable ? Now , look here , who are you ? Both of you ? BOY ( Goes to swing where girl is sitting and pushes swing ) Well , you can see who I am , I suppose . And I 'm sure you know as much about her as I do . MAN Am I to understand you 're strangers to one another ? GIRL Well , not any more . ( To Boy ) Would you say ? BOY Not total strangers , at any rate . Any more . ( To Man ) Thanks to you . ( Girl jumps out of swing and Boy and Girl stand together ) MAN Well , now , I do n't want to obstruct the continuation of this acquaintanceship , but I do offer that it is only fair and reasonable either to send for somebody , to untie me . BOY There is n't anybody to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along that path . p. 9 MAN When is somebody likely to come along ? BOY Might be in a minute , might be in an hour , might not be all afternoon . GIRL Sometimes people do n't come here for a whole day . MAN This is ridiculous . I demand that you  --  ( Suddenly ) Would you be good enough to hold the stick out again , please ? ( Girl does so , he rubs his noseA small boy with a butterfly net comes up path , notices the situation , stops . SMALL BOY ( Approaches , looking from one person to the other ) What are you playing ? Missionaries and canibals ? Where 's your pot ? You 're supposed to dance first , ai n't you ? I seen ' em do it in the movies , but they always had a fat guy . Most of the time it 's a Presbyterian , but once in a while it 's a business man , or an anthropologist , or somebody from the United Nations . How about letting me get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep down underneath . I got a good voice for hollering . And I can shuffle around like a real hungry aborigine . ( He turns suddenly , watching an unseen butterfly ) Do n't go away , I 've got to catch this Coriopsis Alianthias for my biology class , but I 'll be right back . ( Chases butterfly . A moment of quiet. ) p. 10 BOY Well , he came along . Why did n't you speak to him ? MAN I did n't quite know how . BOY You could have interrupted him . MAN To be perfectly honest I became fascinated . What butterfly did he say ? Well , no matter , but I hope he gets it . GIRL ( Sings ) Should a body MAN ( Shakes head ) My head is beginning to clear . I 'm beginning to remember , I believe . BOY I knew you would eventually . MAN I have very important work to do . BOY You can remember more important things than that , ca n't you ? MAN Perhaps I have been foolish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even so , what is to be gained by keeping me here in this useless and unfair manner ? ( Girl extends the stick , he rubs his nose upon it . ) Thank you . ( Boy does exercises again ) Well ? BOY Well , what ? MAN What about telling me what 's to be gained by prolonging this absurd game . If you 're holding me for ransom , forget it . I 'm not a rich man . ( Stands ) Now , untie me. p. 11 BOY ( Forces Man down on rock . Removes scarf from around his neck ) I think you 've talked enough . MAN Oh , now , please do n't do that . I think being tied hand and foot is enough for all practical purposes , whatever they may be . Please continue . I wo n't interrupt . BOY ( Puts away scarf . To Girl ) If I act a little mean now and then , as if I might be a son being rude to his father , believe me , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOY I do n't happen to think a son should ever be rude to his father . Most fathers are pretty sorry stuff , of course , but even so , if a man 's your father , he 's your father , and I think it 's up to you to make the most of it . GIRL You 're only doing the right thing . BOY Not for myself alone , you understand . For my father , for anybody 's father . GIRL Is there something you might say about his mother ? BOY Yes , there is . She 's nice . GIRL Do you mean she 's kind of pretty but at the same time kind of unreasonable ? BOY That 's right . I mean , for as long as possible , let 's at least try not to be rude . p. 12 GIRL ( Sings ) " Comin ' through the rye . " ( Speaks ) I do n't know about your mother , but my mother went mad , you know . BOY No , I did n't know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOY I wish she had n't . I 'm not really much of a mother 's boy . I can take Mama or leave her , but when I hear of somebody 's mother going stark raving mad , I wish somebody understood why , and knew how to let her have what she wants , because that might just be the answer . GIRL Sometimes what she wants is more than there is , almost . BOY Yes , I know , but even so . What did your father do ? GIRL Before , after , or while ? BOY Well , by turns , I guess . GIRL Well , before , he did n't do anything , really . Got up , went to work , came home , ate , looked at TV , went to bed . On Sunday he slept late and read the paper from Chicago . BOY For several years ? GIRL From the beginning . From a little before the beginning . I mean , before my father married my mother , he lived that way , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there were kids . p. 13 BOY Including you . GIRL Yes , everybody else was there , and then I was there , too , but by that time my mother was beginning to lose the fight . I noticed it just as soon as I was able to notice anything . Otherwise , why would she be on the telephone smoking cigarettes all day long ? BOY Well , it certainly could n't have been on account of the advertising alone . GIRL No , she was just plain bored and nervous . Lots of coffee , too . There was always a pot going . While she was going mad , my father just sort of watched , I guess . She tried to make contact with the outside world . She phoned everybody she could think of and talked , but all it really sounded like to me was somebody hollering for help . And nobody helped . ( Girl moves to swing ) And my mother never helped any of the women who hollered to her for help . She just told them the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hollered for help . They were all trying to make contact with the outside world , but all they ever reached was somebody else 's inside world , and it was pretty much the same as their own inside world . One husband each , so many boys and girls each . Everything , but it just was n't enough , I guess . After she went mad , there really was n't anything else he could do , so my father started going fishing . p. 14 BOY Fishing 's a way of life , all right . GIRL Five boys , all just like my father , and finally me , and then no more . BOY Baseball players ? GIRL For a while . Nobody professional , though . A real game , on a real field , is beautiful , of course , but none of my brothers were good enough for that . BOY All of them like their father ? GIRL Well , you know how it is . Pretty much like him . Afraid , I mean . Being afraid is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at all , would it , if everybody was n't afraid ? There would n't be anybody to take out the trash , even . BOY There might not be any trash to take out . MAN Excuse me . BOY Yes ? MAN May I speak ? BOY Provided you do n't go off on some high faluting rampage about who you are and what an outrage this is to a great man . MAN I 'd just like to ask how you mean there might not be any trash to take out . BOY Is that what I said ? ( Girl pantomines walking on stepping stones in a stream. ) p. 15 MAN Yes . How do you mean ? BOY Well , it actually does n't seem to make any real sense , does it ? O.K. , I said something senseless . First man in the world to do that , I suppose . MAN No , I wish you would n't give up so easily . BOY There is always trash . Now , we know that , so there is no need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then there is trash to take out , period . MAN Might it be in order to ask , what is trash ? BOY O.K. , what is trash ? MAN I believe I 'd rather ask you . BOY And I believe I 'd rather ask her ? GIRL ( Stops , turns ) Trash ? Trash is old newspapers , cigarette butts , coffee grounds , egg shells , ashes and dust . MAN That 's the answer of a woman , a daughter , a wife , a mother , but is it the whole answer ? BOY Well , now you 're talking again , are n't you ? MAN Sorry . I felt you might very well be on the verge of something , but ignore it if you like . p. 16 BOY I suppose you mean I really think everything is trash . Well , I do n't , that 's all . Some things are n't trash . ( Softly ) At least not for a while . Everything starts and stops . When something starts , it is n't trash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl pretend to be walking on large stones in a stream . ) MAN When does something start ? BOY Do n't ask me . I do n't know . MAN Do n't you ? ( Boy stops and turns ) Are n't you thinking of something that started here not long ago , something very important to you ? Something you would rather feel might never stop ? Might never become trash , as you put it ? BOY What I 'd rather is this . ( Takes scarf off ) I 'd rather you did n't compel me to put a gag over your mouth , because for some reason all of a sudden I want you to hear me . I want you to hear her , us , and I feel that if you 're gagged you might not be able to do that . GIRL ( Sings softly ) " Through the sycamores " p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT 1 : SCENE 2 An hour later . The Girl goes from path to swing . The Boy is out of sight . Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tied Man stirs , as if with hope or expectancy . The Fisherman barely pauses to notice the Man and the Girl in the Swing , and then goes on , after a glance at the three catfish he has caught . The Man watches the Fisherman until he is out of sight . MAN I should have called out to him , I suppose . GIRL Why ? Do n't you like it here ? MAN Hungry , thirsty , confused , hurt , a bump on my head that keeps beating out the time , and a nose that keeps itching , would you like it ? GIRL I 'd hate it . But , it could be worse , could n't it ? MAN How ? GIRL It 's not as if you were at death 's door , or dead . It could be worse a lot of ways . Everything can always be worse , ca n't it ? MAN Yes , of course , but at the same time , everything can always be better , too . I meant to call out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then all of a sudden I did n't call . Why ? We 've got to try to understand these things that we do , or do n't do . Did I expect him to come over without being called ? Fisherman tend to be shy , they tend to mind their own business , that 's why they fish , so why did n't I let him know my nose itches ? p. 18 GIRL ( Gets out of swing , goes to Man ) Do you want me to hold the stick in front of your nose again ? MAN No . Let it itch . But I must say I am puzzled by your contradictions . On the one hand you have been most alert about the discomfort of my nose , but on the other hand not long ago you struck me on the head with that stick . I might have been killed . Why did you do it ? GIRL Do n't you know ? MAN No , of course not . GIRL You 're just pretending you do n't know . MAN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me . GIRL If I loved him , would I have stood there as if he had n't walked by on his way home with the catfish he 'd caught ? ( Goes back to swing . ) MAN That man was your father ? GIRL Yes . And if he loved me , would n't he have said hello , at least ? MAN I would have imagined your father to be a different sort of man entirely . Younger , for one thing . Not quite so heedless of his posture for another . And not quite so unconscious . He seemed lost , even if he had taken the path , and was on his way home . p. 19 GIRL Where else is there to go ? MAN Well , did your father see you ? GIRL Yes , he saw me . And you , too . And then , on he went . I guess nothing surprises him anymore . ( Puts stick down . ) MAN At first that 's hard to believe , and then it 's perfectly clear , although a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely when you were born he was pleased , since all his others , all five of them , were sons . Why was n't he pleased to see you now ? GIRL ( Sits in swing ) He is n't especially pleased to see anybody , and as a daughter I 'm not much of a bargain . MAN I ca n't believe that , but even if it were true , why should you be a bargain ? GIRL I do n't know what he expected of me , but whatever it was , he did n't get it . I suppose he expected me to be awfully beautiful , and wonderful . MAN But you are awfully beautiful , and wonderful . GIRL ( Jumps out of swing and goes to Man ) Me ? Oh , you do n't know me , I can see that . I 'm terrible . Do you know what I mean ? I mean terrible . p. 20 MAN You 're no such thing . GIRL ( Picks up Man 's hat and puts it on . ) I 'm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . They 've got nothing on me . Do you think you know what goes on in my head ? MAN Well , what does go on in your head ? GIRL It would be too much for you . Too much for anybody , except another girl , maybe . Men have never known the things girls know . How could they ? They 're men . But the terrible girls of long ago were remembered by the men they knew . ( Sits on swing ) What the men remembered was n't the truth , but it was something , anyway . So who 's going to remember me ? MAN Well , perhaps I am . GIRL ( Jumps down from the swing , runs to him with her head down , stops suddenly , leans forward . ) You know you 're breaking the rules . You yourself agreed that while he was gone you would n't talk , you would n't say one word . Why did you agree if you did n't mean to keep your promise ? ( Man shakes his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all part of a plan to get him out of the way , why do n't you go ahead with the plan ? ( Man shakes his head again . ) If you thought that once he was gone , you could get me to untie your hands and feet and let you run away , why do n't you try ? ( Man shakes his head again . ) Are you afraid , the same as everybody else ? Do you think I 'm liable to hit you over the head again ? You agreed not to talk , but not more than one hour after he had gone you began to talk , and you 've been talking ever since . Why ? p. 21 MAN Look here , if you 're terribly lonely and troubled , and really want somebody to talk to , well , go ahead , talk . I 'll listen , and if there 's anything I can possibly do to help , I 'll do my best . GIRL That was awfully deceitful , you know . That is n't what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the better side of me , so I 'll let you go . MAN Not at all . I 'll help you , if I can . GIRL You 're afraid , I know you 're afraid , or you would have used every moment to try to get me to turn you free . Instead , you 've just sat there , as if there were nothing else you could possibly do . You are afraid , are n't you ? ( Man shakes his head . ) Yes , you are , you just shake your head that way because you know my mother went stark raving mad and like everybody else you believe that a daughter is always like a mother , so there 's no telling what I might do next . Well , I 'm not like mother , I 'm worse . I almost feel sorry already for any man who gets the notion in his head that he wants me and needs me . And you feel sorry for him , too , do n't you ? ( Man shakes his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to do everything possible to get him to see the light before it 's too late . ( Man shakes his head . ) Yes , you do . p. 22 MAN Now , I simply must speak , even though I promised that I would n't , because I must make you understand that I do n't want him to see the light , as you put it . It is n't necessary at all . Whatever the light is that you believe will expose you in some preposterous manner , I do n't want him to see that light , because you 're not who you think you are , you 're who he thinks you are , and who I know you are . GIRL You expect me to believe that ? After you encouraged him to go ? MAN Yes , I do . GIRL ( Turns away ) Oh , you 're a bigger liar than I thought . MAN I am not lying , and in any case lights change . ( Girl turns back to him ) I happen to know . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know you 've got this theory about your own light that I wo n't say is untrue , but I will say it 's irrelevant , and I will say it may very well be that you 're a little mistaken about it in any case . GIRL If you know so much about everything , would n't you say he 's already seen the light ? And is n't coming back . ( Man shakes his head . ) After all , why should he come back ? ( Man shakes his head . ) Well , how long does it take , then , to go and come ? And I do n't mean running , either . I mean just loping along , easy like ? Even if you tried , it could n't take longer than an hour , and it 's already almost two , so where is he ? p. 23 MAN I 'm afraid I do n't know . I certainly hope he has n't been run over , for instance . GIRL Do you think I ought to go look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to stay right here until he got back , but suppose he did get run over , and needs me ? ( Goes to Man again . ) Will you sit still while I go and see ? MAN Now , please calm yourself . When you go to the Police about a thing like this , there are certain formalities that must be observed , and they take time . GIRL Police ? MAN Yes , of course . He went to fetch the police , did n't he ? GIRL Is that what he said ? MAN Well , he did n't say it , but I distinctly remember getting the impression that that was the reason , and the only reason , for his going . GIRL But if he comes back with the police , then he has seen the light , and if he 's seen the light , I 'll be damned if I 'm going to be here , so he can turn his back on me and walk away . MAN Why should his coming back with the police mean he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GIRL Why ? I 'll tell you why . Because once you 're untied and off that rock and on your feet , in jail , or back where you belong , wherever that is , there wo n't be any reason , there wo n't be any excuse , for him or me anymore . p. 24 MAN Surely you ca n't mean that your only chance is for me to stay tied this way ? GIRL That 's exactly what I mean . MAN Until when ? GIRL I do n't know . You 're the first real thing that has happened to him and me . And I mean you , as you are now . Well , I guess he 's not coming back , so I might as well untie you . ( She goes to him ) MAN No . I 'd rather you did n't . GIRL You do n't want to go back where you belong ? MAN No , I do n't . Not now , at any rate . Not until things work out just a little better for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not coming back . Why should I be humiliated ? MAN Go back and sit in the swing . It is n't necessary to hurry . GIRL Why should you be uncomfortable that way ? MAN I 'm no longer as uncomfortable as I was . In fact I 'm used to it now . Even if you were to untie me , I would n't go , you know . GIRL Why not ? MAN Well , I 'm not really sure yet . The fact is , though , that I have a daughter of my own , and it just would n't do for me to run out on her , or you , at a time like this . p. 25 GIRL Are you trying to be kind or something , because if you are , I do n't like it , because I hate kindness , because kindness makes everybody weak . I have n't been kind to you . What right have you got to be kind to me ? MAN You offered to untie me . GIRL Not out of kindness , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading home , he bolts and runs for his life . ( Goes to swing . ) MAN I think he 's coming back , and I think you 're being awfully stupid . GIRL That 's better , but be careful , I might just bat your head out of the ball park again , or something even worse . I do n't care if I am stupid . A girl has got to be a little stupid to get along in the summer time . ( She sits and swings ) I 'm going to swing , and the hell with him , and you , and my father , and my mother , and me , and my kids , too . ( She signs " Row , row , row your boat . " ) p. 26 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT 1 : SCENE 3 A little later . The Boy comes walking . He carries a bottle of water and a bunch of wildflowers and weeds . BOY I 've got to laugh just a little , that 's all . Damned if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he 's not laughing , certainly not out loud . ) GIRL You 've been gone two long hours . What happened to you ? BOY I forgot . ( Hands her the flowers . ) GIRL Forgot what ? BOY Just everything , that 's all . And my family made me remember . ( Hands her the bottle . ) I went home to see about getting some food and drink  --  for him . For you , and for me . For the three of us in this crazy place . ( Girl drinks and takes bottle to Man . ) I could n't wait to get back . And that 's crazy . There is nothing else you can call it in God 's green earth . Get back to what ? GIRL There 's a little boat down there we can steal . BOY There 's a little boat nowhere we can steal . A little stolen boat is n't ever going to do it . p. 27 GIRL It was just a thought . BOY ( Moves restlessly ) Dead  --  as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in my life all of a sudden I 'm really alive , and I want , and I ca n't have , period . But I had to come back at least , because I said I would . ( To Man . ) If I walk away from here right now , and go home , that will be a dead man back there . This morning , he was n't a dead man , but he was n't a live man , either . He was just there . Well , O.K. , then , if that 's how it is . ( Pause , to Girl ) You better go home . GIRL ( At swing ) That 's the easiest thing in the world to do . But I do n't like easy things to do . BOY Look at me , will you , please ? ( Girl looks . He speaks softly . ) Go home . So long , good luck , and that 's enough . It 's damned tiring to be alive . ( He leans somewhere , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIRL ( Walks about , while the Man watches . ) I am kind of cold , and kind of hungry , too . And I like my bed , I really like my bed best of everything I 've ever known . I really want to go back , you know , but I hate the idea . I guess it scares me . Even so , I do n't know , maybe I will go back . I have a friend , got a job in the furniture factory in Delphi . She says it 's a lot of laughs , and the money 's pretty good , too . Told me something kind of funny . Said the monotonous work makes you think all the time about being with a man . By the time the work 's finished there is n't anything else in the whole world worth a damn . She says it 's that way with the boys who work there , too , so the whole thing kind of works out pretty good . I do n't suppose there 's anything wrong with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of scared me . I could use the money all right . I 'd like a nice apartment of my own , or even a room , somewhere , all right , but it kind of scared me . The boys are a lot of laughs , she says , but I do n't know if I 'd like that . ( Almost in the same breath ) What are we keeping him tied for ? ( The Boy does n't look at her , or answer . ) We do n't have to keep him tied any more , do we ? As far as I 'm concerned , I do n't care . p. 28 BOY Untie him , then . GIRL He did n't keep his promise while you were gone . He talked a lot . He started after the first hour , but maybe it was my fault , because I did n't think you were coming back . One thing I 'll say for him , whoever he is . He 's interested . He cares . Tied the way he is , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me worry a little about having him tied , and the reason for it . He thought you 'd gone to get the police , so then of course I thought maybe you had , too . Did n't you go to the police ? BOY No , of course I did n't go to the police . I just could n't get out of that house any sooner . Do you want me to be the one to untie him , is that it ? GIRL If you want to , now . If we 're all going home , I guess you might as well . BOY You figuring on taking the job at the furniture factory ? GIRL I do n't know , I suppose so . I 've always wanted a little apartment of my own . BOY Yes , a place like that can help a little , I guess . GIRL Pictures and all , you know , and my own stuff , little by little , with the money I make . BOY ( Goes to the Man ) Yes , you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untie the Man 's hands. ) p. 29 MAN I wonder if you might permit me to remain tied a moment longer ? BOY I think we 're all going home . MAN Even so , let 's talk a moment , still . BOY O.K. MAN ( To Girl ) I 'd like to know what I did that impelled you to knock memory itself out of my head . I can only remember walking here on my way to the river as any animal might have walked since the beginning of time , to drink , and rest , and reflect a moment , and that 's all I remember . GIRL If you do n't remember , and I really do n't think you do , I used to think you were an awful liar , but now I know you 're not , maybe it does n't matter any more , and it might be better if I did n't tell you . MAN No , no , please . Several things are involved that I think I owe it to myself to know . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I cherish kindness , and the greatest kindness you can do me  --  is to let me know why you did what you did , so I can think about it a moment and perhaps understand it , and possibly even make some sort of use of it . GIRL It seems kind of silly , now , with everybody about to go home . Really , I 've forgotten . I think . Wo n't you just let him untie you and forget it ? p. 30 MAN Well , of course , you understand I am in fact terribly eager to get along myself , to get back to my work , to go home , I 'm sure my wife is a little upset , and perhaps my daughter , too , but I 'm afraid I ca n't forget it . ( Pause , softly ) Is it possible that I made some sort of preposterous fool of myself , about you ? GIRL Yes , I think you could put it that way . MAN ( Softly , astonished , ashamed . ) Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed . That 's what brought him . MAN ( Softer . ) Did I frighten you ? GIRL Not really . I guess all of a sudden I kind of frightened myself . I never was really afraid of you . It was something else . I was surprised , I guess , at first . I mean , about myself . Nothing happened , you know . Nothing could have happened that I did n't want to happen . I guess that 's why I screamed . MAN Thank you very much . GIRL Can he untie you now ? MAN Is there anything else I ought to know ? ( He looks at the Boy. ) p. 31 BOY Yes , there is . ( He turns toward the Girl . ) I do n't know why , but I did n't believe you really needed any help . Maybe it 's because things are different out here  --  cool and quiet , and it does n't matter that you have n't got a nickel in your pocket or a thought in your head . It 's kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not happening the way they do in sleep . I was carrying that stick all the time . As a silly weapon of defense I guess . I tossed it where you 'd find it , and before I arrived , he was out cold . GIRL ( To Man . ) I do n't know why I did it , I really do n't . I did n't need to , at all . I 've been feeling badly about it ever since . I 'm sorry . MAN ( To Boy ) Anything else ? BOY I never touched her . ( To the Girl ) I 've never touched you , have I ? GIRL No . BOY ( To the Man . ) You ready to be untied now ? MAN Yes , thank you . ( Boy unties man quickly and Girl hands him hat . ) GIRL Do you remember any of it , now ? ( Man rubs wrists and ankles. ) p. 32 MAN Strangely , all of it . If in fact I had ever forgotten it . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . BOY Are you going home , then ? MAN I 'm afraid I must , but do you know , I do n't want to ? GIRL Why ? MAN You . For one thing . ( To the Boy ) You for another You are the human race itself , in a sense , with all of its promise of youth . I rather believe you 've restored me to that race . I had forgotten what science is for , I 'm afraid . ( Puts hat on . ) What are you going to do ? BOY Go home . GIRL No . BOY Yes . MAN Listen , both of you . This is here , and now , and green , and it 's gone already , flown along with the river flowing . ( He smiles ) Go home , and forget it . GIRL Suppose it is n't possible ? MAN It is , though . Anything is . ( To the Boy . ) You have n't lost anything by having come to life , as you 've put it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . That 's our story , you know . p. 33 BOY Is it ? MAN Yes , it is . This afternoon you happened to find her , tomorrow afternoon you 'll find somebody else . BOY ( Goes to rock and sits ) I found her years ago when she was just a little kid around here with her brothers , and sometimes with her father and mother , on picnics . You get to be a kind of crazy spy , you know . What 's God doing with her now ? Is she all right ? Is nobody going to see who she really is ? Is it left for me alone to do that ? Is such a thing possible ? GIRL ( To the Man ) And if I ca n't forget , a job at the factory , is that it ? MAN ( Goes to Girl , nods ) Yes , a job at the factory . GIRL ( Throws flowers at Man and picks up stick ) Go home to your wife , and your work , if all you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Go on home . ( Suddenly begins to swing the stick like a baseball bat , the Man does n't flinch , the Boy jumps at her and stops the swing . ) BOY For God 's sake , leave the poor man alone . He 's had nothing but understanding for both of us . Do you want to kill him for that ? Where do you think you 're living ? ( Takes stick and walks away ) What country do you think you 're in ? Afghanistan , or some civilized country like that ? We 're home . ( Quietly . ) Now , straighten yourself out . ( To the Man . ) I only held her to stop her from committing murder . ( Tosses stick to Man . Begins to go . ) And that 's the way it 's going to stay . ( Stops , looks back . ) But I 'll never really want anybody else . ( He turns quickly and runs off. ) p. 34 GIRL Well , what shall I do ? MAN ( Hands her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September about a year later . Everything seems pretty much the same , except that the swing no longer has a seat-board . The Boy stands at the swing , holding the rope . He flings the rope out , goes to the rock , sits , and pantomines being tied hand and foot . A very stylish young woman who is reading a paperback as she comes along the Path stops , removes her glasses , cleans them , puts them on again , notices the Boy , goes to the swing , pushes it . The Boy looks up , notices her , gets to his feet . YOUNG WOMAN Oh , no , please do n't stand . BOY I 'm afraid it was n't courtesy . You took me by surprise . YOUNG WOMAN Are you expecting somebody ? BOY Not really . YOUNG WOMAN Then , you are . Would you rather I moved along ? BOY Not at all . Wo n't you sit down ? Sixty or seventy generations of Indians have probably sat on this rock , but it still seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sits on the rock . ) Thank you . I like to read while I walk , and so I hardly ever notice how far I 've walked or how tired I 've become . Would you like a cigarette ? p. 36 BOY No thanks . YOUNG WOMAN Mint ? Chewing gum ? Candy ? ( Boy smiles no . ) I always carry around a little of just about everything so many of us believe we might suddenly need  --  desperately , I mean . We might die for want of a stick of chewing gum , for instance . I have aspirin , too , and a little bottle of smelling salts . Would you like to smell the smelling salts ? BOY Well , the fact is I did n't know they had them any more . I saw a mother wave smelling salts under the nose of a girl who had fainted in a movie once , but I never saw it happen to real people . YOUNG WOMAN My mother handed the tradition down to me . All young ladies who are young ladies carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at any rate ought to be . It 's a sign of quality to be faint . ( Removes the cap from the small jar , holds it out to the Boy . He goes to her , bends and she waves the bottle gently under his nose . He leaps back . ) BOY What is that ? YOUNG WOMAN ( Simply , with a touch of laughter ) Smelling salts . Perhaps you 'll accept a Life Saver , after all , to take the bad smell out of your nostrils . BOY Well , O.K. ( He accepts one . ) Thanks very much . ( He goes back to the swing. ) p. 37 YOUNG WOMAN ( Fishes around inside the great handbag she is carrying . ) There 's really no telling what else my mother has put in here . Sewing kit , in case my life depends on getting a button sewed-on somewhere . ( Shows it . ) A small hammer , for when I might be lost in the wilderness and must build a log cabin suddenly . Compass . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true north means . Parachute , I suppose . Police whistle , yo-yo , although I ca n't imagine how my Mother expects a yo-yo to save my life . I once found a small revolver in here . I was n't even sure it was n't some kind of cigarette lighter . I might have shot off my nose . ( Softly ) Do you mind my chattering this way ? BOY No , I enjoy hearing you talk . YOUNG WOMAN Really ? I 'm manic , I know . That means I have enormous ups and downs . BOY I know what it means . YOUNG WOMAN ( Sincerely ) I did n't mean to imply you did n't . BOY ( Also sincerely ) I did n't mean to sound defensive , either . YOUNG WOMAN ( Raises her glasses to her forehead to look at him again . ) Well , that 's out of the way , is n't it ? With some people it takes ten or eleven years to get a thing like that out of the way . ( They exchange smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing all too well that I am manic . It 's practically an invitation to kill myself . Would you do a thing like that ? p. 38 BOY I would n't think of putting a revolver in your hand-bag . YOUNG WOMAN No , kill yourself . BOY Well , of course , that depends , does n't it ? YOUNG WOMAN I 'm glad you think so , because I do , too . I adore my Mother . I think she 's preposterous . I think had she been poor she would have been committed , it 's impossible even to suggest the kind of glittering idiot she is  --  a work of art almost by a lunatic creator . I love her , but I live in terror of being just like her . If I 'm ever sure of that , I will kill myself . If only there had been another daughter , for purposes of comparison . Or even a son . A lot of boys are like their mothers , and a lot of girls are like their fathers . But no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ? BOY Hardly . YOUNG WOMAN There are several of you ? BOY Seven . YOUNG WOMAN And you 're the youngest of the lot ? BOY How would you know a thing like that ? YOUNG WOMAN Just a guess . Beware of the first born in large families . BOY O.K. p. 39 YOUNG WOMAN That 's the trouble with me , I 'm sure . ( Rises ) I 'm the first born in a large family that never showed up . What does your father do ? ( Sits on rock again . ) BOY He was a preacher  --  until three years ago when he died . YOUNG WOMAN Preacher 's sons are always such fun . Look it up for yourself some time . Doctors ' sons are pretty good , too . Lawyers ' sons are fifty-fifty . Some architects have exciting sons , but best of all are preachers ' sons , especially the youngest . BOY What does your father do ? YOUNG WOMAN I believe he 's helping nature solve its most troublesome current problem . BOY What problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist , a far-out one . One of the most brilliant in the world . Imagine him , married to my mother . Now , there 's a marriage that was n't made in heaven at all . As a matter of fact it was made in Mayfair . That 's in London . BOY I know it is . YOUNG WOMAN Oh yes , I keep forgetting you do n't need pictures . BOY How is he helping people ? p. 40 YOUNG WOMAN He 's not helping people , he 's helping nature solve the problem people have become . There are too many of them . At the rate they 're going  --  well , it will be inconceivable that in fifty years there will be one mother left in the world who can afford to provide her daughter with smelling salts , revolvers , hammers , and sewing kits . And the people just wo n't stop , will they ? ( Stands , above rock ) They keep trying and trying for one interesting son and one beautiful daughter . And suddenly there 's no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock ) The un-interesting and plain sons and daughters are standing all over Texas , they 're standing straight across the Sahara Desert , and they 're standing on every square inch of Indiana . ( Sits on rock ) I really feel most fortunate to have this rock to sit upon . May I have it forever ? BOY If you 're sure that 's long enough . YOUNG WOMAN Thank you . Now I do n't feel so insecure . And so my father is busy night and day , awake and asleep , drawing the great secrets out of the darkness of the universe and bringing them down into the light , to us . BOY How to get power from the sun , and food from the sea ? So the people can have the things they need ? YOUNG WOMAN Oh , no , that would only mean more people . Along with hundreds of his friends all over the world , my father is providing the wisdom by means of which the millions of poor people , on the verge of exhaustion from standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fall-out , fall-in . My father actually believes he 's finding secrets that are for the people , but all he 's really doing is helping nature get rid of them , in a new way , instead of the old way  --  famine , flood , pestilence , and all the other jolly Little Nature 's Helpers . p. 41 BOY That wo n't be nature , that 'll be us . YOUNG WOMAN But we are nature . It 's just that we do n't know we are . We like to think we are special , very special , with smelling salts and bank accounts , but all we really are is a little part of nature , and nature could n't care less . BOY Is he at the University ? YOUNG WOMAN On loan , from London , yes . Almost two years now . Exchange , and all . A little British know-when for a little American know-how . ( Suddenly ) What 's she like , the girl you 're waiting for ? BOY I 'm not really waiting for her . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's an American girl . She 's from right here . YOUNG WOMAN And with her you plan to have the same kind of wonderful family that your father had ? BOY I have n't even seen her in a year . I guess she move to Delphi . YOUNG WOMAN Well , you could go to Delphi to see her , could n't you ? BOY No , I could n't . YOUNG WOMAN Of course you could . It 's not more than eighteen miles . I know . I 've been there . ( She stands . ) It 's really silly to wait here for the girl you love . ( She goes to the Boy , they dance a few steps , and stop . ) Or even the girl you think you love . Why should she come here ? This is the sort of place one reaches only when one is half-lost . Surely nobody comes here twice . Or on purpose . Now , you 've been most enchanting , and I 've been most horrible . ( Without any warning she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth . ) Oh , dear , I am just like my mother . Now , I 'll have to kill myself.She goes quickly . p. 42 p. 43 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT 2 : SCENE 2 A little later . The Boy sits on the rock , reading the book left by the Young Woman . A young man in the costume of a lion comes up the path , unnoticed by the Boy . ( The Lion makes one grand roar , the Boy leaps to his feet , studies the Lion a moment , and then sits down again . ) LION ( Calling back ) Well , now , come along , will you ? We have n't got forever , you know . ( A young woman lion , comes up the path . She tries a roar , but it is not very good . ) LION ( Takes her arm ) No , no , you 've still got it wrong . Like this . ( He roars again . ) Once more , please . ( Girl roars again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swig from a small bottle . ) LIONESS I ca n't help it if I ca n't roar like a real lion . LION Do you want to be an actress , or not ? LIONESS I had in mind a more appropriate part . Cleopatra . Juliet . Ophelia . Portia . St. Joan . Sadie Thompson . Alice of old Vincennes . I ca n't ask my mother to come all the way from Terre Haute to hear me roar , can I ? LION Why not ? p. 44 LIONESS Because a roar does n't say anything about anything to anybody , that 's why not . LION Once more , please . LIONESS I am not a roarer . What 's the roar for ? LION Rage against wrong , that 's what the roar is for . LIONESS What wrong ? LION The wrong that passes for right , that 's what wrong . LIONESS Oh , that ? LION Once more , please . LIONESS ( Roars ) Am I getting something ? LION Yes , you 're getting something . You 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're getting . ( Shouts ) Snakes ! Will the snakes please be good enough to wiggle on up here and hiss ? ( The Snakes come along , a slick young man and a slick young woman , walking in a tight slick way . ) LION Hiss , please . SNAKE Hisssss . ( Lioness sits on ground ) SNAKESS Hissssss . LION Thank you . That 's not everybody , is it ? p. 45 SNAKE I thought we were supposed to hiss at Male and Female created He them , but there was only one snake in the original story . So how come there are two now ? LION Where would you get little snakes from if you did n't have two ? ( Shouts ) Will the Human Couple be good enough to join the rest of us , so we can get going ? ( A Man , rigged out to represent Adam , and a woman rigged out to represent Eve , come running . ) ADAM Sorry . EVE Sorry . LION O.K. , we 're all here . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . LION How do you mean ? LIONESS Posterity ! EVE The children ! My son , my daughter . SNAKE There 's another mistake . It used to be two sons , Cain and Abel . LION When you rewrite the story of the human race make it rabbits if you want to . Well , where are they ? EVE Yes , where are my children ? LION ( Shouts ) Will the Juvenile Delinquents kindly get the hell up here toot sweet , avec plaisir , and like voila . p. 46 SNAKESS Well , he 's drunk again . LIONESS He 'll pass out just when we need him most , too . LION Who was that spoke without raising his hand for permission ? LIONESS I , said the little arts , - sciences , - and - humanities major . LION One demerit . Who else ? SNAKESS I , said Miss Muck Crop of 1961 . LION One demerit for you , too . LIONESS Big deal . The Fall of Man , and one demerit . LION The Name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again . LIONESS Why ? LION Because I said so . LIONESS Good morning , God . LION It happens to be afternoon . ( Shouts ) Juvenile Delinquents front and center . SNAKE Toot sweet , avec plaisire , and like voila.Everybody watches the arrival of the Kids : a jazzy boy , a dreamy girl . EVE My children . p. 47 LION What 's the matter with you two ? Crazy or something ? JAZZY Knock it off , Dad . We do n't like the pad . DREAMY Just because you make the scene does n't mean we 've got to make the scene . LION You 're out of context , Kids . Save your lines for the context . JAZZY What kind of a context is it ?  --  poetry writing ? DREAMY If you want to get out , do n't stay in . Did I win ? ( Snakess hands Dreamy a mirror . Dreamy checks her hair and makeup . ) LION Will you two just please save your philosophical lines for the proper psychological moment ? If somebody was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not . LION Choreographer . Will the choreographer please step forward . LIONESS You 're the choreographer . LION And do n't you ever forget it . ( Blows a police whistle ) All right , everybody . Places . ( Nobody moves . ) Take your places , please . That 's fine . Now , hold it . Pitch . ( He blows a pitch pipe . ) Rondolay is the form  --  rondolay . Ready ? p. 48 EVERYBODY No . LION Fugue everybody . Fugue . I 'll start with the roar , and then you come in with the various other animal sounds . ( Roars . ) EVERYBODY Roar . LION That 's it . Keep going , and this time let 's give it truth . EVERYBODY Roar . LION Again . ( Everybody goes through the rigmarole again ) Thank you . I think that 'll be very effective . Do n't you ? EVERYBODY No . LION To walk , that 's what we want . To walk in indignity . SNAKE You mean to walk in dignity , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . Every order of animal life , including man . And out of this walk must come the real meaning of the Pageant . I 'll lead the way along this path  --  this path . What is a path ? It 's where we walked , is n't it ? What does that mean ? Everything , does n't it ? EVERYBODY No . LION And you follow . ( Takes drink . ) LIONESS Are you going to go on drinking ? LION You know perfectly well I 'm fighting a cold . Ready , then ? Everybody . No. p. 49 LION Get the beat . Numbers . Everybody knows how to count . One two three and so on ad infinitum . Pride is what we want . Dignity . ( Hands bottle to Jazzy who takes drink . Begins to walk proudly . ) One two three . To walk in dignity , then . ( He walks , wobbles , and falls . Only Jazzy follows , tries to help him up . ) LION ( Waves Jazzy off ) Never mind . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures disdain , dusts off a place , lies down . Dignity , thank you . ( Goes to sleep . ) EVERYBODY ( Sings ) Rockabye baby . LIONESS Now , what ? SNAKE Let 's go down to the river and think . JAZZY Let 's go down to the river and thwim ! ADAM Thwim ? DREAMY ( Running off ) Last one in is a Communist ! JAZZY ( Places bottle in Lion 's hand . ) Thanks , Dad . They all go off , as the Butterfly Boy comes back . SMALL BOY Boy , if they were only butterflies . p. 50 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT 2 : SCENES 3 A little later . The Boy sits on the rock . The Man who had sat on the Rock comes up the path , accompanied by a man from the Drama Department , who in turn is accompanied by Dreamy , who now carries an open shorthand book and a poised pencil . DRAMA Now , here 's the scene . Down there , the Wabash cornfields , historic monuments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , constellations , and stars . ( Lyrically ) Here  --  the green September banks of the Wabash . ( To Dreamy ) You might jot that down , if you like . ( Dreamy nods and jots . ) In short , the earth itself . A mere speck , as we know , in the vast universe . A flyspeck , so to say , on the wallpaper of time . ( Pause ) I sometimes believe it would have been better if we had never found out that this earth is n't everything . DREAMY Shall I jot that ? DRAMA No , that 's just personal . ( To Man ) Our scene , then . The earth . Indiana . ( Over sleeping Lion ) And us . Fast asleep , just as they said he 'd be , and it 's just as well , because we need a moment or two to go over what we 're trying for , and how you can help . p. 51 MAN I wonder if in fact I can help . I do n't really see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But of course you can . MAN Am I to take it your purpose is to convey a sense of alarm , a feeling of impending doom  --  as if doom were a recent discovery rather than the constant possibility it has always been ? DRAMA Precisely . I knew your choice of words would be better than mine . DREAMY ( To Man . ) Shall I jot it ? MAN Oh , no , please . You should be swimming . ( To Drama ) But you must understand I do n't agree at all . DRAMA Of course not . Our whole point is simply to sound a warning . In a good-humored manner , with appropriate costumes , as you saw . Assuming  --  I call your attention to the very sound of that word  --  assuming that we , the human race  --  assuming  --  I call your attention to the meaning of the word , that is , an assumption , not a reality at all . Assuming that the awful trigger were tripped , what would happen ? MAN How do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the human race , of the whole animal kingdom for that matter , to be scientifically accurate . Agree , then , hypothetically , that the fearful event has taken place . What would happen ? p. 52 MAN Why , I do n't know . DRAMA Theoretically , what would happen ? MAN You are saying , I presume , that we have the means to destroy ourselves . The fact is that what we have is something else entirely . A slight , a very slight , understanding of how to engage and control energy which in the nature of things is unlimited and inexhaustible . We do not have a weapon , certainly not a new one . The only weapon is ourselves , and we certainly were n't discovered in 1945 . DRAMA All over the world people are afraid . They 're not afraid of themselves , are they ? MAN It comes to that , I think you could say . DRAMA All the same , we do have the actual physical means by which to destroy ourselves , do n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRAMA And so far we have n't found out how to agree not to use the weapon , have we ? MAN No , but that does n't mean we may not find out . DRAMA If we do n't find out , and if we do use the weapon , what will happen ? MAN Well , I can see you must have the answer you prefer . Very well , then . p. 53 DRAMA As scientifically as possible . MAN Well , this part of it ca n't be put scientifically , I 'm afraid . It is in fact fantastic , although if you insist not beyond the realm of possibility . As a party to the achievement involved , I would unwittingly be one of the executioners of the human race . The hangman , so to say . A role I certainly had never had in mind . DRAMA It would not be your fault . MAN Thank you . DRAMA What would happen ? MAN First , the sound , of course . The sound of the first explosion , which must in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar sounds all over the world , as the attacked government retaliates . Simultaneously with the sound , but actually long before it , or at any rate long before it is heard by human hearing , force . Extraordinary force  --  God 's own , if I might be permitted to put it that way  --  misused . Force , which simply must disintegrate whatever it reaches . DRAMA Good . Good . MAN Any order of life not instantly destroyed by the force would be contaminated . DRAMA Yes . Yes . p. 54 MAN And could not possibly continue for very long . I must say , it is fearfully embarrassing to be put in the position of speaking in this deplorable and boring manner . DRAMA Not at all , not at all . The truth is the truth , and must be spoken . Now , I 'll just run back to the group , and get them organized . MAN Will I be needed any further ? DRAMA No , I think we have everything understood now , but you are certainly welcome to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be itching again for the first time in months for some unaccountable reason . DRAMA It was my idea to bring them out here , along the banks of the Wabash , for the rehearsal , because it seemed to me that it would be foolish to have so much so near and not use it , not to learn from it . Here , in the very midst of a highly developed agricultural and industrial society , flows that noble river immemorially . MAN Yes , it does , does n't it ? Although I ca n't imagine what else it might do instead . ( Quickly ) Look here , I 'm sorry to be so irritable , and I know you mean well , but do n't you think it would be better to forget the pageant and let the people go on swimming ? p. 55 DRAMA That 's the trouble with people . They 're always swimming . ( To Dreamy ) Jot that down , please . ( They go off quickly . ) The Man stands and examines the rope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Woman . Voices are heard of people having fun at swimming . The collective voices fade away and only two voices are heard in laughter : and then the Girl with a Boy from the factory come up the path and embrace . The Girl sings , If a body . The Boy listens , turns , gets to his feet , moves toward the Girl just as she and the Factory Boy go off . Girl sings " Would a body . " The Man moves toward the Girl , too . The Man and the Boy come face to face . MAN Well , now , we meet again , do n't we ? BOY I did n't think you 'd remember me . MAN Of course I 'd remember you . BOY I mean , I did n't think you 'd choose to . ( Sits on rock ) And if you did n't , then I would n't choose to , either . MAN I 'm awfully glad to see you . And this place , too . And that rock , where I sat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only kind of time that has any real use for any of us  --  human time . And now you 're sitting on the rock . Not tied , I hope . Have you come here frequently since then ? p. 56 BOY Six or seven times . On Sundays mostly . I have a job now . MAN Something you like ? BOY No , but that 's all right . I have a few little responsibilities I want to see about meeting , that 's all . But then , who has n't ? I still like to come here once in a while . MAN For its own sake ? The place ? BOY Yes , and a few associations , too , most likely . I 've known this place since I was a kid . My Father and I put up that swing the year before he died . MAN I 've thought of you frequently . And of her , too , of course . That was her just now , was n't it ? BOY Yes , it was . MAN Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) No , I have n't . MAN I wish you had , so that you would know for yourself that on its own terms , as flawless and perfect as it promised perhaps to be , as right as it perhaps was in fact , it would soon be attacked from the outside , and perhaps from the inside too , and then quickly appear to have been a terrible deception , part of a foolish fable . But now , as it is , I should imagine you might be impelled to believe that that which scarcely began was your real truth , and that would be a pity , an awful mistake . p. 57 BOY Yes , I suppose it would be , at that . MAN Do you mind , especially ? BOY I 'm not sure , because just now when I saw her , it suddenly seemed kind of silly to be hanging around this way .
