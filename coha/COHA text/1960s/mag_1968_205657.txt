With his kindly Kris Kringle smile , his Katzenjammer accent and his snow-white hair , Professor Herbert Marcuse of the University of California 's San Diego campus seems too charmingly ge nial to be a revolutionary . He coos over the fine fur of his rust-colored cat , Freddie , and holds a lifetime membership in the San Diego Zoo , where he affectionately favors owls , elephants and hippopotamuses . Yet whether in Berkeley or Berlin , today 's youthful radicals , who are challenging the most basic premises of industrial society , increasingly turn to the writings of the aging ( he will be 70 in July ) German-born philosopher to find a satisfactory rationale for rebellion . <P> <P> On their protest marches , the militant student leaders who recently forced the closing of the University of Rome bore a banner inscribed with the three Ms of a new trinity : Marx , Marcuse and Mao .

" <P> Agent of Domination . In the U.S. , Marcuse 's most recent book , One-Dimensional Man ( 1964 ) is one of Beacon Press 's bestselling paperbacks and a growing campus favorite-even though it is on few required reading lists . Almost as popular is his earlier , Freudian interpretation of social change , Eros and Civilization , which intrigues students seeking an intellectual basis for today 's hippie culture . Taking advantage of the rising interest in Marcuse , Beacon Press next month is publishing a collection of early essays called Negations . <P> What makes Marcuse a guru of the student rebels is his chilling and strident critique of modern industrial civilization , which he sees as an impersonal , all-pervasive agent of domination over the individual .

Marcuse concedes that modern technology provides man with material well-being and even admits that more men may be happier today than ever before-but it is a happiness born of an ignorance ( " a state of anesthesia " ) of what they could become . Men may think they have more freedom and more choices , he says , but the options open to them are not meaningfully different . In this state , man rejects all thoughts that challenge society 's rationale-hence Marcuse 's definition of man as " one-dimensional .

They have innumerable gadgets that keep them occupied and divert their attention from the real issue-which is the awareness that they could both work less and determine their own needs and satisfactions .
