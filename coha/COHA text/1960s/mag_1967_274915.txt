POETS <P> ( See Cover ) <P> In a scene that draws forever the line between the poet and the square , Hamlet , prince and poet , converses with the busy bureaucrat Polonius : <P> Hamlet : Do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a camel ? <P> Polonius : T is like a camel , indeed . <P> Hamlet : Or like a whale . <P> Polonius : Very like a whale . <P> Poets , their heads being in the clouds , are those who see whales and camels where others see only a chance of rain . That is why poets will always be more important than meteorologists . Poetry is a great imponderable , since it describes and changes the climate of the mind . It is a touchstone by which the spiritual condition of man may be tested . <P> In that respect , the testing is proceeding at a pace never before felt in the history of American literature . Two generations ago , many poets were at work in the U.S.-probably a greater number of major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The literary quarterlies spent more space and passion discussing poetry , but their audience was limited . Slowly , poetry moved out of the parlors of overstuffed gentility into the academy . Now it is moving out of the academy-out of college lit courses and esoteric coteries-back to where it was when minstrels sang their verses in the marketplace . It exists once again in an ambiance of instant feeling . Poets are declaiming their works before large , theater-size audiences in the cities and on the campuses . Government grants , foundation funds and universities with chairs for poets-in-residence are all conspiring to strengthen or at least amplify their voices in the world at large . Their poetry books trip ever more briskly off the presses , and their phonograph recordings feed a flourishing market . <P> " There 's poetry all over the place , " says Robert Lowell . " The world is swimming with it . I think more people write it , and there are more ways to write it . It 's almost pointless-there 's no money in it-but a lot of them become teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read to a lot of people . Poets are a more accepted part of society , and I do n't know if it 's bad for us or not , but it 's pleasanter . I do n't suppose even now parents are very glad when their children become poets , but it 's not such a desperate undertaking . Still , being good is n't any easier . " <P> Robert Lowell , 50 , is better than good . As far as such a judgment can ever be made of a working , living artist , he is , by rare critical consensus , the best American poet of his generation . <P> What They Seek . As Critic Edmund Wilson puts it , Lowell has achieved a poetic career on the old 19th century scale . Of the score or so of American poets who now stir the campuses , he is easily the most admired . Not that the suspicious young readily take to heroes , literary or otherwise , or are very clear about what they seek in poetry . Says Mount Holyoke Poet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more shocking and ever more new . They are looking more for emotional release than purely artistic merit . " Verse for edification or moral uplift ; he adds , " is totally dead . A poem like Tennyson 's Merlin and the Gleam would be the laughingstock of a coffeehouse today .
