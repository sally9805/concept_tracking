The myth about the slum brat who makes it big in the underworld is curlicued with familiar movie romance . Clearly , Joseph Vincent Moriarty , who grew up in a rundown section of Jersey City , N.J. , never had romance in his soul-or never saw the right movies . Known as " Newsboy " because in his youth he sold tabloids in the bars and restaurants of his neighborhood , Moriarty got into the policy numbers racket* when he was only 13 , went on and upward to become Jersey City 's No. 1 numbers boss . He was arrested no fewer than 25 times on gambling charges , but he never learned to play the part that this record entitled him to . <P> Bloody Denial . Newsboy , now 52 , was a loner who never took on a partner , never played with the big-time syndicate hoods , their molls or their tailors . He never married , lived with his two sisters in a decrepit three-story house in his old neighborhood . He neither drank nor smoked , and attended church regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled around Jersey City 's streets unshaven and dressed in shabby clothes . Says a cop who knew him : " If you saw him on the street , you 'd give him a quarter out of charity . " Despite this , police estimated that Newsboy operated a $10 million-a-year policy racket . <P> Newsboy was so penurious that he would dun a debtor for a few pennies , but his attachment to cash frequently led to his losing it . The cops sometimes found money in the secondhand cars that Newsboy kept stashed around the city-and invariably Newsboy had to disclaim ownership of the money to avoid explaining where it came from . Once he turned up at a hospital bleeding from stab wounds , and the police discovered $3,000 in his car . Said Newsboy : " I never saw it before . " Again , he was picked up on the street near an auto that yielded $11,000 . Newsboy said it was n't his . Federal tax agents found $49,000 in his home-and still he declined to claim ownership . <P> In the Trunk . Newsboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he is serving a two-to-three-year sentence on a gambling conviction ( his third ) . Last week , despite the prison bars , Newsboy 's money losing continued . This time a fortune was at stake . Walking into Newsboy 's cell , the county prosecutor announced : " You 've just lost $2 million . ' ' Back in Jersey City , two carpenters working on an ancient garage had pried open the trunk of an abandoned 1947 Plymouth sedan . Inside they found a cache of several guns and a small mountain of large-denomination bills . The trail led straight to Newsboy : with the money were bonds made out to him and his deceased brother , as well as a dossier on one of Newsboy 's arrests , which had been lifted from the county prosecutor 's office some time ago . Naturally , Newsboy declined to admit that the money was his . So did a redheaded girlfriend who once owned the car in which the money was found .                 @ @ @ @
