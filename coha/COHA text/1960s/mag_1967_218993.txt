WILLIAM MORRIS , HIS LIFE , WORK AND FRIENDS by Philip Henderson . 388 pages . McGraw-Hill. $9.95 . <P> Karl Marx was very rude about people like William Morris , the poet , artist-craftsman and social revolutionary . " Christian Socialism , " he wrote in the Communist Manifesto , " is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat . " <P> It was an unfair , but not altogether untrue summary of Morris ' lifelong attempt to replant some of the virtues of medieval Christendom into the sooty soil of 19th century England . <P> Morris ' new biography , written with sympathetic irony , draws on J. W. Mackail 's exhaustive work of 1899 and adds psychological material once thought improper . Morris shines through the pages as a prodigious Victorian , one of a long line of self-confident zealots whose faith and energies gave them a stature that the modern mini-man can only wonder at . A dozen specialist scholars - in politics , poetry , architecture , painting , interior design , cabinetry , fabrics-would be needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to restore craftsmanship and beauty to a deprived industrial working class . He was concerned with the deep discrepancy between the dark satanic mills of industrial England and the idyl ( real or imagined ) of rural life hedged in tradition . It is a discrepancy still known in 20th century America , and it makes Morris ' life relevant reading today . <P> Dancing on the Greensward . When Morris died in 1896 at 62 , almost his last words were : " I want to get mum-bo-jumbo out of the world . " He had put a good deal into it . His vision of a materialist Utopia with an art-craft peasantry , and Morris himself dancing on the greensward , bordered on the ridiculous . The masterpiece printed by his Kelmscott Press was a massive edition of Chaucer , illustrated by himself and the painter Burne-Jones . It cost 20- probably the equivalent of a half-year 's wages of one of the men who toiled in the Devonshire copper mine from which Morris derived his fortune . <P> Morris was only partly conscious of the absurdity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was naturally a playful , jovial fellow , yet the end of his life was cursed by explosive rages , which may have betrayed his awareness that the world was not following the course he had set for it . He believed that industrial division of labor , which Marx saw as a tool of the socialist apocalypse , was simply the proliferation of stultifying jobs . Yet the descendants of Morris ' socialist working men have now settled for the machine-made blessings of the welfare state , stultifying or not . They would sooner be caught in drag than dancing on the greensward in homespun or chipping gargoyles on a cathedral .
