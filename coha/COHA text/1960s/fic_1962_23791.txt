REENA A Story by Paule Marshall L ike most people with unpleasant childhoods , 1 am on constant guard against the past  --  the past being for me the people and places associated with the years I served out my girlhood in Brooklyn . The places no longer matter that much since most of them have vanished . The old grammar school , for instance , P.S. 35 ( " Dirty 5 's " we called it and with justification ) has been replaced by a low , coldly functional arrangement of glass and Permastone which hears its name but has none of the feel of a school about it . The small , grudgingly lighted stores along Fulton Street , the soda parlor that was like a church with its stained-glass panels in the door and marble floor have given way to those impersonal emporiums , the supermarkets . Our house even , a brownstone relic whose halls smelled comfortingly of dust and lemon oil , the somnolent street upon which it stood , the tall muscular trees which shaded it were leveled years ago to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceless warren for the poor . So that now whenever I revisit that old section of Brooklyn and see these new and ugly forms , I feel nothing . I might as well be in a strange city . But it is another matter with the people of my past , the faces that in their darkness were myriad reflections of mine . Whenever I encounter them at the funeral or wake , the wedding or christening  --  those ceremonies by which the past reaffirms its hold  --  my guard drops and memories banished to the rear of the mind rush forward to rout . the present . I almost become the child again  --  anxious and angry , disgracefully diffident . Reena was one of the people from that time , and a main contributor to my sense of ineffectualness then . She had not done this deliberately . It was just that whenever she talked about herself ( and this was not as often as most people ) she seemed to be talking about me also . She ruthlessly analyzed herself , sparing herself nothing . Her honesty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not changed , I was to discover in meeting her again after a separation of twenty years . Nor had T really . For although the years had altered our positions ( she was no longer the lord and I the lackey ) and I could even afford to forgive her now , she still had the ability to disturb me profoundly by dredging to the surface those aspects of myself that I kept buried . This time , as I listened to her talk over the stretch of one long night , she made vivid without knowing it what is perhaps the most critical fact of my existence  --  that definition of me , of her and millions like us , formulated by others to serve out their fantasies , a definition we have to combat at an unconscionable cost to the self and even use , at times , in order to survive ; the cause of so much shame and rage as well as , oddly enough , a source of pride : simply , what it has meant , what it means , to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself  --  at the funeral of her aunt who had been my godmother and whom I had also called aunt , Aunt Vi , and loved , for she and her house had been , respectively , a source of understanding and a place of calm for me as a child . Reena entered the church where the funeral service was being held as though she , not the minister , were coming to officiate , sat down among the immediate family up front and turned to inspect those behind her . 1 saw her face then . It was a good copy of the original . The familiar mold was there , that is , and the configuration of bone beneath the skin was the same despite the slight fleshiness I had never seen there before ; her features had even retained their distinctive touches : the positive set to her mouth , the assertive lift to her nose , the same insistent , unsettling eyes which when she was angry became as black as her skin  --  and this was total , unnerving and very beautiful . Yet something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sameness . Aging even while it remained enviably young . Time had sketched in , very lightly , the evidence of the twenty years . a As soon as the funeral service was over , I left , hurrying out of the church into the early November night . The wind , already at its winter strength , brought with it the smell of dead leaves and the image of Aunt Vi there in the church , as dead as the leaves  --  as well as the thought of Reena whom I would see later at the wake . Her real name had been Doreen , a standard for girls among West Indians ( her mother , like my parents , was from Barbados ) , but she had changed it to Reena on her twelfth birthday ? " As a present to myself " ? and had enforced the change on her family by refusing to answer to the old name . " Reena . With two e'sl " she would say and imprint those e 's on your mind with the indelible black of her eves and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had not been friends through our own choice . Rather , our mothers , who had known each other since childhood , had forced the relationship . And from the beginning , I had been at a disadvantage . For Reena , as early as the age of twelve , had had a quality that was unique , superior , and therefore dangerous . She seemed defined , even then , all of a piece , the raw edges of her adolescence smoothed over ; indeed , she seemed to have escaped adolescence altogether and made one dauling leap from childhood into the very arena of adult life . At thirteen , for instance , she was reading Zola , Hauptmann , Steinbeck , while I was still in the thrall of the Little Minister and Lorna Doone . When I could only barely conceive of the world beyond Brooklyn , she was talking of the Civil War in Spain , lynchings in the South , Hitler in Poland  --  and talking with the outrage and passion of a revolutionary . I would try , I remember , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult masquerading as a child , which meant that I could not possibly be her match . For her part , Reena put up with me and was , by turns , patronizing and impatient . I merely served as the audience before whom she rehearsed her ideas and the yardstick by which she measured her worldliness and knowledge . " Do you realize that this stupid country supplied Japan with the scrap iron to make the Pattie Marshall spent most of her childhood in Brooklyn , scene of her first novel , " Brown Girl , Brownstones , " and of this story . She won the 1962 Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award for her second book , " Soul Clap Hands and Sing . " weapons she 's now using against it ? " she had shouted at me once . I had not known that . Just as she overwhelmed me , she overwhelmed her family , with the result that despite a half-dozen brothers and sisters whu consumed quantities of bread and jam whenever they visited us , she behaved like an only child and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with skin the color of dried tobacco and with the nose Reena had inherited jutting out like a crag from his nondescript face , had come from Georgia and was always making jokes about having married a foreigner  --  Reena 's mother being from the West Indies . When not joking , he seemed slightly bewildered by his large family and so in awe of Rcena that he avoided her . Reena 's mother , a small , dry , formidably black woman , was less a person to me than the abstract principle of force , power , energy . She was alternately strict and indulgent with Reena and , despite the inconsistency , surprisingly effective . They lived when I knew them in a cold-water railroad flat above a kosher butcher on Belmont Avenue in Brownsville , some distance from us  --  and this in itself added to Reena 's exotic quality . For it was a place where Sunday became Saturday with all the stores open and pushcarts piled with vegetables and yard goods lined up along the curb , a crowded place where peuple hawked and spat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had just stepped from the pages of the Old Testament with their profuse beards and long , black , satin coats . When Reena was fifteen her family moved to Jamaica in Queens and since , in those days , Jamaica was considered too far away for visiting , our families lost contact and I did not see Reena again until we were both in college and then only once and not to speak to . ? . I had walked some distance and by the time I got to the wake which was being held at Aunt Vi 's house it was well under way . It was a good wake . Aunt Vi would have been pleased . There was plenty to drink , and more than enough to eat , including souse Barbadian favorites : coconut bread , pone made with the cassava root , and the little crisp codfish cakes that are so hot with peppers they bring tears to the eyes as you bite into them . I had missed the beginning when everyone had probably sat around talking about Aunt Vi and recalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Someone , I 'm sure , had told of the time she had missed the e%ccutsion boat to Atlantic City and had held her own private picnic  --  complete with pigeon peas and rice and fricassee chicken  --  on the pier at 42nd Street . ) By the time I arrived , though , it would have been indiscreet io mention her name , for by then the wake had become ? and this would also have pleased her  --  a celebration of life . I had had two drinks , one right after the other , and was well into my third when Reena , who must have been upstairs , entered the basement kitchen where I was . She saw me before I had quite seen her and with a cry that alerted the entire nom to her presence and charged the air with her special force , she rushed toward me. - Hey , T'in the one who was supposed to be the writer , not your Do you know , I still ca n't believe it , " she said , stepping back , her blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both your hooks over and over again and I ca n't really believe it . My Little Paulie ! " 1 did not mind . For there was respect and even wonder behind the patronizing words and in her eyes . The old imbalance between us had ended and I was suddenly glad to see her . I told her so and we both began talking at once , but Reena 's voice overpowered mine , so that all I could do after a time was listen while she discussed my books , and dutifully answer her questions about my personal life . " And what about you ? " I said , almost brutally , at the first chance I got . " I , Vhat 've you been up to all this time ? " She got up abruptly . " Good Lord , in here 's noisy as hell . Come on , let 's go upstairs . " We got fresh drinks and went up to Aunt Vi 's bedroom where , in the soft light from the lamps , the huge Victorian bed and the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its surface looked as if they had never been used . And , in a way , this was true . Aunt Vi had seldom slept in her bed or , for that matter , lived in her house , because in order to pay for it , she had had to work at a sleeping-in job which gave her only Thursdays and every other Sunday off . Reena sat on the bed , crushing the roses and I sat on one of the numerous trunks which crowded the room . They contained every dress , coat , hat , and shoe that Aunt Vi had worn since coming to the United States . I again asked Recna what she had been doing over the years . " Do you want a blow by blow account ? " she said . But despite the flippancy , she was suddenly serious . And when she began it was clear that she had written out the narrative in her mind many times . The words came too easily ; the events , the incidents had been ordered intime end the meaning of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved had been painstakingly analyzed . She talked willingly , with desperation almost . And the words by themselves were n't enough . She used her hands to give them form and urgency . I became totally involved with her and all that she said . So much so that as the night wore on I was not certain at times whether it was she or I speaking . F rom the time her family moved to Jamaica until she was nineteen or so , Reena 's life sounded , from what she told me in the beginning , as ordinary as mine and most of the girls we knew . After high school she had gone on to one of the free city colleges where she had majored in journalism , worked part-time in the school library , and , surprisingly enough , joined a houseplan . ( Even I had n't gone that far . ) It was an all Negro club since there was a tacit understanding that Negro and white girls did not join each other 's houseplans . " Integration , Northern style , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purpose and a plan in joining the group . " I thought , " she said with a wry smile , " I could get those girls up off their complacent rumps and out doing something about social issues . . . . I could n't get them to budge , I remember after the war when a Negro ex-soldier had his eyes gouged out by a bus driver down South I tried getting them to demonstrate on campus . I talked until I was hoarse but to no avail . They were too busy planning the annual autumn frolic . " Her laugh was bitter but forgiving and it ended in a long reflective silence . After which she said quietly , " It was n't that they did n't give a damn . It was just , I suppose , that like most people they did n't want to get involved to the extent that they might have to stand up and he counted , if it ever came to that . Then another thing . They thought they were safe , special . After all , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so had escaped the Southern-style prejudice : their parents , like mine , were struggling to put them through college ; they could look forward to being tidy little schoolteachers , social workers , and lab technicians . Oh , they were safer ' The sarcasm scored her voice and then abruptly gave way to pity . " Poor things , they were n't safe , you see , and would never be as long as millions like themselves in Harlem , on Chicago 's South Side , down South , all over the place , were unsafe . I tried to tell them this  --  and they accused me of being oversensitive . They tried not to listen . But I would have held out and , I 'm sure , even brought some of them around eventually if this other business with a silly boy had n't happened at the same time .. .. " Reena told me then about her first , brief , and apparently innocent affair with a boy she had met at one of the houseplan parties . It had ended she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was it , " she said and the flat of her hand cut into the air . He was forbidden to see me . The reason ? He could n't bring himself to tell me , but I knew . I was too black . " Naturally , it was n't the first time something like that had happened . In fact , you might say that was the theme of my childhood . Because I was dark I was always being plastered with Vaseline so I would n't look ashy . Whenever I had my picture taken they would pile a whitish powder on my face and make the lights so bright I always came out looking ghostly . My mother stopped speaking to any number of people because they said I would have been pretty if I had n't been so dark . Like nearly every little black girl , I had my share of dreams of waking up to find myself with long blonde curls , blue eyes , and skin like milk . So I should have been prepared . Besides , that boy 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us " ? and her hands , opening in front of my face as she suddenly leaned forward , seemed to offer me the whole of black humanity . " We live surrounded by white images , and white in this world is synonymous with the good , light , beauty , success , so that , despite ourselves sometimes , we run after that whiteness and deny our darkness which has been made into the symbol of all that is evil and inferior . I was n't a person to that boy 's parents , but a symbol of the darkness they were in flight from , so that just as they ? that boy , his parents , those silly girls in the houseplan  --  were running from me , I started running from them ... " I t must have been shortly after this happened when I saw Reena at a debate which was being held at my college . She did not see me , since she was one of the speakers and I was merely parr of her audience in the crowded auditorium . The topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( McCarthyism was coming into vogue then ) and aside from a Jewish boy from City College , Reena was the most effective  --  sharp , provocative , her position the most radical . The others on the panel seemed intimidated not only by the strength and cogency . of her argument but by the sheer impact of her blackness in their e- ' ' ' - midst . Her color might have been a weapon she used to dazzle and disarm her opponents . And she had highlighted it with the clothes she was wearing : a white dress patterned with large blocks of primary colors I remember ( it looked Mexican ) and a pair of intricately wrought silver earrings  --  long and with many little parts which clashed like muted cymbals over the microphone each time she moved her head . She wore her hair cropped short like a boy 's and it was not straightened like mine and the other Negro girls ' in the audience , but left in its coarse natural state : a small forest under which her ace emerged in its intense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph that day . surrounded by a noisy entourage from her college  --  all of them white . " We were very serious , " she said now , describing the left-wing group she had belonged io then  --  and there was a defensiveness in her voice which sought to protect them from all censure . " We believed  --  because we were young , I suppose , and had nothing as yet to risk  --  that we could do something about the injustices which everyone around us seemed to take for granted . So we picketed and demonstrated and bombarded Washington with our protests , only to have our names added to the Attorney General 's list for all our trouble . We were always standing on street corners handing out leaflets or getting people to sign petitions . We always seemed to pick the coldest days to do that . " Her smile held long after the words had died . " 1 , we all , had such a sense of purpose then , " she said softly , and a sadness lay aslant the smile now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having endless discussions , arguing , shouting , theorizing . And we had fun . Those parties ! There was always somebody with a guitar , We were always singing . , .. " Suddenly , she began singing  --  and her voice was sure , militant , and faintly self-mocking , " But the banks are made of marble With a guard at every door And the vaults are stuffed with silver That the workers sweated for ... " When she spoke again the words were a sad coda to the song . " Well , as you probably know , things came to an ugly head with McCarthy reigning in Washington and I was one of the people temporarily suspended from school . " She broke off and we both waited , the ice in our glasses melted and the drinks gone flat . " At first , I did n't mind , " she said finally . " After all , we were right . The fact that they suspended us proved it . Besides , I was in the middle of an affair , a real one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about anything else . " She paused again , frowning . " He was white , " she said quickly and glanced at me as though to surprise either shock or disapproval in my face . We were very involved . At one point  --  I think just after we had been suspended and he started working  --  we even thought of getting married . Living in New York , moving in the crowd we did , we might have been able to manage it . But I could n't . There were too many complex things going on beneath the surface , " she said , her voice strained by the hopelessness she must have felt then , her hands shaping it in the air between us . " Neither one of us could really escape what our color had come to mean in this country . Let me explain . Bob was always , for some odd reason , talking about how much the Negro suffered , and although I would agree with him I would also try to get across that , you know , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved our children , liked making love  --  that we were human beings , for God 's sake . But he only wanted to hear about the suffering . It was as if this comforted him and eased his own suffering  --  and he did suffer because of any number of things : his own uncertainty , for one , his difficulties with his family , for another . . . " Once , I remember , when his father came into New York , Bob insisted that I meet him . I do n't know why 1 agreed to go with him . . She took a deep breath and raised her head very high . " I 'll never forget or forgive the look on that old man 's face when he opened his hotel-room door and saw me . The horror . I might have been the personification of every evil in the world . His inability to believe that it was his son standing there holding my hand . His shock . I 'm sure he never fully recovered . I know I never did . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way he kept repeating : ' Did you see his face when he saw you ? Did you ... ? ' He had used me , you see . I had been the means , the instrument of his revenge . " And I was n't any better . I used him . I took every opportunity to treat him shabbily , trying , you see , through him , to get at that white world which had not only denied me , but had turned my own against me . " Her eyes closed . " I went numb all over when I understood what we were doing to , and with , each other . I stayed numb for a long time . " As Reena described the events which followed  --  the break with Bob , her gradual withdrawal from the left-wing group ( " I had had it with them too . I got tired of being ' their Negro , ' their pet . Besides , they were just all talk , really . All theories and abstractions . I doubt that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers of the world , any of them had ever been near a factory or up to Harlem " ) ? as she spoke about her reinstatement in school , her voice suggested the numbness she had felt then . It only stirred into life again when she talked of her graduation . " You should have seen my parents . It was really their day . My mother was so proud she complained about everything : her seat , the heat , the speaker : and my father just sat there tong after everybody had left , too awed to move . God , it meant so much to them . It was as if I had made up for the generations his people had picked cotton in Georgia and my mother 's family had cut cane in the West Indies . It frightened me . " I asked her after a long wait what she had done after graduating . " How do you mean , what I did . Looked for a job . Tell me , have you ever looked for work in this man 's city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up my hand . " Do n't tell me . " We both looked at my raised hand which sought to waive the discussion , then at each other and suddenly we laughed , a laugh so Loud and violent with pain and outrage it brought tears . " Girl , " Reena said , the tears silver against her blackness . " You could put me blindfolded right now at the Times Building on 42nd Street and I would be able to find my way to every newspaper office in town . But tell me , how come white folks is so herd ? " " Just bo'n hard . " We were laughing again and this time I nearly slid off the trunk and Reena fell back among the satin roses . " I did n't know there were so many ways of saying no ' without ever once using the word , " she said , the laughter lodged in her throat , but her eyes had gone hard . " Sometimes I 'd find myself in the elevator , on my way out , and smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , before it would hit me that they had really said no , not yes . Some of those people in personnel had so perfected their smiles they looked almost genuine . The ones who used to get me , though , were those who tried to make the interview into an intimate chat between friends . They 'd put you in a comfortable chair , offer you a cigarette , and order coffee . How 1 hated that coffee . They did n't know it  --  or maybe they did  --  but it was like offering me hemlock . . " You think Christ had it tough ? " Her laughter rushed against the air which resisted- it . " 1 was crucified five days a week and half-day on Saturday . I became almost paranoid . I began to think there might be something other than color wrong with me which everybody but me could see , some rare disease that had turned me into a monster . " My parents suffered . And that bothered me most , because I felt I had failed them . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided me more than usual . He was ashamed , I think , that he had n't been able , as a man and as my father , to prevent this . My mother  --  well , you know her . In one breath she would tryto comfort me by cursing them : ' But Gor blind them , ' " ? and Reena 's voice captured her mother 's aggressive accent ? " ' if you had come looking for a job mopping down their floors they would o ' hire you , the brutes . But mark my words , their time goin ' come , ' cause God do n't love ugly and he ai n't stuck on pretty . . . ' And in the next breath she would curse me , Journalism ! Journalism ! Whoever heard of colored people taking up journalism . You must feel you 's white or something so . The people is right to chuck you out their office . . . . ' Poor thing , to make up for saying all that she would wash my white gloves every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were a little girl again . Once she went out and bought me a suit she could n't afford from Lord and Taylor 's . I looked like a Smith girl in blackfare in it .... So guess where I ended up ? " " As a social investigator for the Welfare Department . Where else ? " We were helpless with laughter again . " You too ? " " No , " I said , " I taught , but that was just as bad . " " No , " she said , sobering abruptly . " Nothing 's as bad as working for Welfare . Do you know what they really mean by a social investigator . A spy . Someone whose dirty job it is to snoop into the corners of the lives of the poor and make their poverty more vivid by taking from them the last shred of privacy . ' Mrs. Jones , is that a new dress you 're wearing ? ' ' Mrs. Brown , this kerosene heater is not listed in the household items . Did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that a telephone I hear ringing under the sofa ? ' I was utterly demoralized within a month . " And another thing . I thought I knew about poverty . I mean , I remember , as a child , having to eat soup made with those white beans the government used to give out free for days running , sometimes , because there was nothing else . I had lived in Brownsville , among all the poor Jews and Poles and Irish there . But what I saw in Harlem where I had my case load was different somehow . Perhaps because it seemed so final . There did n't seem to be any way to escape from those dark hallways and dingy furnished rooms . . . All that defeat . " Closing her eyes , she finished the stale whiskey and soda in her glass . " I remember a client of mine , a girl my age then , with three children already and no father for them and living in the expensive squalor of a rooming house . Her bewilderment . Her resignation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess she was in ? People say that , you know , including some Negroes . But this girl did n't have a chance . She had been trapped from the day she was born in some small town down South . She became my reference , " Reena added , opening her eyes , but they might have been closed still , for they were remote and unseeing . From then on and even now , whenever I hear people and groups coming up with all kinds of solutions to the quote Negro problem , I ask one question . What are they really doing for that girl , to save her or to save the children ? ... The answer is n't very encouraging . " I t was some time before she continued and then she told me that after Welfare she had gone to work for a private social-work agency , in their publicity department , and had started on her master 's in journalism at Columbia . She also left home around this time . " I had to . My mother started putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarks  --  and you know my mother was never the subtle type  --  her anxiety , which made me anxious about getting married after a while . Besides , it was time for me to be on my own . " In contrast to the unmistakably radical character of her late adolescence ( her membership in the left-wing group , the affair with Bob , her suspension from college ) , Reena 's life of this period sounded ordinary , standard  --  and she admitted it with a slightly self-deprecating , apologetic smile . It was similar to that of any number of unmarried professional Negro women in New York or Los Angeles or Washington : the job teaching or doing social work which brought in a fairly decent salary , the small apartment with kitchenette which they sometimes shared with a roommate ; a car , some of them ; membership in various political and social action organizations for the militant few like Reena ; the vacations in Mexico , Europe , the West Indies , and now Africa : the occasional date . " The interesting men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one affair during that time . She had found out he was married and had thought of her only as the perfect mistress . " The bastard , " she said , but her smile forgave him . " Women alone ! " she cried , laughing sadly , and her raised opened arms , the empty glass she held in one hand made eloquent their aloneness . " Alone and lonely , and indulging themselves while they wait . The girls of the house-plan have reached their majority only to find that all those years they spent accumulating their degrees and finding the well-paying jobs in the hope that this would raise their stockhave , instead , put them at a disadvantage . For the few eligible men around  --  those who arc their intellectual and professional peers , whom they can respect ( and there are very few of them ) ? do n't necessarily marry them , but younger women without the degrees and the fat jobs , who are no threat , or they do n't marry at all bocause they are either queer or mother-ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accept this . In fact , some of my best friends are white women . . " And again our laughter  --  that loud , searing burst which we used to cauterize our hurt mounted into the unaccepting silence of the room . " After all , our goal is a fully integrated society . And perhaps , as some people believe , the only solution to the race problem is miscegenation . Besides , a man should be able to marry whomever he wishes . Emotionally , though , I am less kind and understanding , and T resent like hell the reasons sonic black men give for rejecting us for them . " " We 're too middle-class-oriented , " I said . " Conservative . " " Right . Even though , thank God , that does n't apply to me . " " Too threatening . . . castrating . . . " " Too independent and impatient with them for nor being more ambitious . . . contemptuous . .. " " Sexually inhibited and unimaginative . . " " And the old myth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , " Reena cried . " Not supportive , unwilling to submerge our interests for theirs . . " Lacking in the subtle art of getting and keeping a man . . . " We had recited the accusations in the form and tone of a litany and in the silence which followed we shared a thin , hopeless smile . " They condemn us , " Reena said softly but with anger , " without taking history into account . We are still , most of us , the black woman who had to be almost frighteningly strong in order for us all to survive . For , after all , she was the one whom they left ( and I do n't hold this against them : I understand ) with the children to raise , who had to make it somehow or the other . And we arc still , so many of us , living that history . " You would think that they would understand this , but few do . So it 's up to us . We have got to understand them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one hand , persons in our own right and , on the other , fully the woman and the wife . . . . Christ , listen to who 's talking ! I had my chance . And I tried . Very hard . But it was n't enough . " T he festive sounds of the wake had died to a sober murmur beyond the bedroom . The crowd had gone , leaving only Reena and myself upstairs and the last of Aunt Vi 's closest friends in the basement below . They were drinking coffee . I smelled it , felt its warmth and intimacy in the empty house , heard the distant tapping of the cups against the saucers and voices muted by grief . The wake had come full circle : they were again mourning Aunt Vi . And Reena might have been mourning with them sitting there amid the satin roses , framed by the massive headboard . Her hands lay as if they had been broken in her lap . Her eyes were like those of someone blind or dead . I got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You met my husband . " She said quickly , stopping me . " Have I ? " I said , sitting down again . " Yes , before we were married even . At an autograph party for you . He was free-lancing  --  he 's a photographer  --  and one of the Negro magazines had sent him to cover the party . " As she went on to describe him 1 remembered him vaguely , not his face , but his rather large body stretching and bending with a dancer 's fluidity and grace as he took the pictures . I had heard him talking to a group of people about some issue on race relations very much in the news then and had been struck by his vehemence . For the moment I had found this almost odd since he was so fair-skinned he could have passed for white . They had met , Reena told me now , at a benefit show for a Harlem day nursery given by one of the progressive groups she belonged to , and had married a month afterwards . From all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life for a long time . Her words were so vivid , that I could almost see them : she with her startling blackness and extraordinary force and he with his near-white skin and a militancy which matched hers : both of them moving among the disaffected in New York , their stand on political and social issues equally uncompromising , the line of their allegiance reaching directly to all those trapped in Harlem . And they had lived the meaning of this allegiance , so that even when they could have afforded a life among the black bourgeoisie of St. Albans or Teaneck , they had chosen to live if not in Harlem so close that there was no difference . " I  --  we  --  were so happy I was frightened at times . Not that anything would change between us , but that someone or something in the world outside us would invade our private place and destroy us out of envy . Perhaps this is what didhappen . . " She shrugged and even tried to smile but she could not manage it . " Something slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " Maybe it started when Dave took a job with a Negro magazine . Pm not sure . Anyway , in no time , he hated it : the routine , unimaginative pictures he had to take and the magazine itself which dealt only in unrealities : the high-society world of the black bourgeoisie and the spectacular strides Negroes were making in all fields  --  you know the type . Yet Dave would n't leave . It was n't the money , but a kind of safety which he had never experienced before which kept him there . He would talk about free-lancing again , about storming the gates of the white magazines downtown , of opening his own studio  --  but he never acted on any one of these things . You see , despite his talent  --  and he was very talented  --  he had a diffidence that was fatal . " When I understood this I literally forced him to open the studio  --  and perhaps I should have been more subtle and indirect , but that 's not my nature . Besides , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Dave 's work was too experimental to be commercial . Gradually , though , his photographs started appearing in the prestige camera magazines and money from various awards and exhibits and an occasional assignment started coming in . " This was n't enough somehow . Dave also wanted the big gaudy commercial success that would dazzle and confound that white world downtown and force it to see him . And yet , as I said before , he could n't bring himself to try  --  and this contradiction began to get to him after awhile . " It was then , I think , that I began to fail him . I did n't know how to help , you see . I had never felt so inadequate before . And this was very strange and disturbing for someone like me . I was being submerged in his problems  --  and I began fighting against this . " I started working again ( I had stopped after the second baby ) . And I was lucky because I got back my old job . And unlucky because Dave saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't convince him otherwise : that I had to do it for my own sanity . He would accuse me of wanting to see him fail , of trapping him in all kinds of responsibilities After a time we both got caught up in this thing , an ugliness came between us and I began to answer his anger with anger and to trade him insult for insult . " Things fell apart very quickly after that . I could n't bear the pain of living with him  --  the insults , our mutual despair , his mocking , the silence . I could n't subject the children to it any longer . The divorce did n't take long . And thank God , because of the children , we are pleasant when we have to see each other . He 's making out very well , I hear . " S he said nothing more , but simply bowed her head as though waiting for me to pass judgment on her . I do n't know how long we remained like this , but when Reena finally raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dawn was a still gray smoke against the pane . " Do you know , " she said and her eyes were clear and a smile had won out over pain , " I enjoy being alone . I do n't tell people this because they 'll accuse me of either lying or deluding myself . But I do . Perhaps , as my mother tells me , it 's only temporary . I do n't think so , though . I feel I do n't ever want to be involved again . It 's not that I 've lost interest in men . I go out occasionally , but it 's never anything serious . You see . I have all that I want for now . " Her children first of all , she told me , and from her description they sounded intelligent and capable . She was a friend as well as a mother to them , it seemed . They were planning , the four of them , to spend the summer touring Canada . " I will feel that I have done well by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of themselves and their worth and importance as black people . Everything I do with them , for them , is to this end . I do n't want them ever to be confused about this . They must have their identifications straight from the beginning . No white dolls for them ! " Then her job . She was working now as a researcher for a small progressive news magazine with the promise that once she completed her master 's in journalism ( she was working on the thesis now ) she might get a chance to do some minor reporting . And like most people she hoped to write someday . " If I can ever stop talking away my substance , " she said laughing . And she was still active in any number of social action groups . In another week or so she would be heading a delegation of mothers down to City Hall " to give the Mayor a little hell about conditions in the schools in Harlem . " She had started an organization that was carrying on an almost door-to-door campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the blood stickers : all those slum lords and storekeepers with their fixed scales , the finance companies that never tell you the real price of a thing , the petty salesmen that leech off the poor . . . . " In May she was taking her two older girls on a nationwide pilgrimage to Washington to urge for a more rapid implementation of the school-desegregation law . " It 's uncanny , " she said and the laugh which accompanied the words was warns , soft 14 ith wonder at herself , girlish even and the air in the room which had refused her laughter before rushed to absorb this now . " Really uncanny . Here I am , practically middle-aged , with three children to raise by myself and with little or no money to du it and yet I feel , strangely enough , as though life is just beginning  --  that it 's new and fresh with all kinds of possibilities . Maybe it 's because I 've been though my purgatory and I ca n't ever he overwhelmed again . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings after I put the children to bed . I sit alone in the living-room ( I 've repainted it and changed all the furniture since Dave 's gone , so that it would at least look different ) ? I sit there making plans and all of them seem possible . The most important plan right now is Africa . I 've already started saving the fare . " I asked her whether she was planning to live there permanently and she said simply , " I want to live and work there . For how long , for a lifetime . I ca n't say . All I know is that I have to . Fur myself and for my children . It is important that they see black people who have truly a place and history of their own and who are building for a new and , hopefully , more sensible world . And I must see it , get close to it because I can never lose the sense of being a displaced person here in America because of my color . Oh , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though , frankly , I question whether I want to be integrated into America as it stands now with its complacency and Ma - teri a 1 ism , its soullessness ) but to help change the country into something better , sounder  --  if that is still possible . But I have to go to Africa ... . " Poor Aunt Vi , " she said after a long silence and straightened one of the roses she had crushed . " She never really got to enjoy her bed of roses what with only Thursdays and every other Sunday off . All that hard work . All her life .. . Our lives have got to make more sense , if only for her . " We got up to leave shortly afterwards . Reena was staying on to attend the burial later in the morning , but I was taking the subway to Manhattan . We parted with the usual promise to get together and exchanged telephone numbers . And Reena did phone a week or so later . I do n't remember what we talked about though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was giving before leaving the country . But she did not come . Harper 's Magazine , October 1962
