ITALY THREATENED WITH CIVIL WAR , shrieked wire-service bulletins last week . <P> Italy was threatened with nothing of the sort . The fact was that Italy 's Communist Party had made a major effort to topple the Tambroni government , had succeeded only in producing a series of bloody riots up and down Italy that unhappily cost eleven lives , but left the vast mass of Italy 's citizens indifferent and even outraged . <P> It all began when the small neo-Fascist party scheduled a party congress in Genoa . The Communists , who have been chafing under the political ostracism they have suffered of recent years , saw a splendid opportunity to take advantage of the smoldering resentment many Italians felt when Fernando Tambroni accepted the support of the 24 neo-Fascist Deputies to form his government . As the neo-Fascists assembled , a gang of Red-led picketers charged into the Piazza de Ferrari . Genoa 's celere ( riot police ) were waiting for them . They circled around the rioters in jeeps like Indians around a wagon train , clipping heads with their stout billies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Special riot trucks doused the demonstrators with automatic hoses . <P> When the melee was over , some 200 were in jail , several hundred more injured . <P> Raising the cry of " Fascism , " the Communists briskly organized other riots , happily saw many non-Communists join them for once in common cause . In Reggio Emilia in northern Italy , a policeman was trapped in a crowd of Communist toughs . He panicked and began shooting , and five rioters were killed . <P> In Rome , a crowd including 50 parliamentary Deputies led by tough , balding Communist Giancarlo Pajetta and Republican Ludovico Camangi marched to Porta San Paolo to lay a wreath on the Partisan Plaque , which commemorates Italian resistance to the Fascists during World War II . The celere , under orders to permit no demonstrations of any kind , quickly moved to disperse the mob . The crowd charged the police , heaving bricks and wielding staves . Then a troop of mounted carabinieri rode into the mob . <P> Moments later , Pajetta strode into the Chamber of Deputies dramatically waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hurt in the cavalry charge . " Assassins ! " shouted the Communists , and the chamber quickly became a free-for-all . Communists and Christian Democrats knocked aside ushers , grappled along the chamber 's steep aisles . Only after hours of battling was order restored . <P> Next day the Reds called for a nationwide general strike . But the cry went largely unheeded , even by many of the Communist-dominated unions . Premier Tambroni turned down a resolution calling for a 15-day truce between the rioting factions . Argued Tambroni : established governments maintaining law and order do not make truces with the forces of violence .
