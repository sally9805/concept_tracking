since a young Paul Muni landed in Hollywood some thirty years ago . Steiger was such a ruthless animal in the title role of the film Al Capone , for instance , that he destroyed whatever illusions anyone may base had about the late Chicago mobster . He gave a frightening performance as a psychotic movie producer in The Big Knife . J. Arthur Rank imported him to England and paid him 5100.000 to play a crooked banker in Across the Bridge . He won an Academy nomination for his work in On the Waterfront , a surprising tour de force considering that he had made only one other picture , a box-office flop called Teresa , and that he was a Hollywood beginner up against Marlon Brando . He and Brando , incidentally , have been feuding ever since . In an interviewlafler the picture was released , Brando made a couple of cracks about Steiger 's ability , and Steiger says : " I never got over that . I thought that was very unprofessional of him . " Steiger made the reviewers use up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They Fall , Juba , and five other major films . On television he created the role of Marty , and won the Sylvania Award for a series of amazing performances in which he portrayed such diverse characters as Dutch Schultz , Rudolf Hess , Andrei Vishinsky , Romeo and Rasputin . Variety columnist Army Archerd wrote : " Steiger 's versatility is staggering . " Far more staggering is Steiger 's private and personal performance , a continuing masterwork rarely seen by the critics . The essence of his one-man revolution against status-seeking contemporariesmay be found in a verse by the English poet , William Somerville , who wrote : " So safe on shore the pensioned sailor lies , And all the malice of the storm defies . " Steiger and his new bride , Britain-born Claire Bloom  --  she was his leading lady in their Broadway play . Rashornon  --  live in a weathered , slightly askew old house at Malibu Beach . There is , or was , a vast scraggly lawn and a murky , weed-choked fish pond without fish . And in the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master , the furniture is scarred and sagging . There is defiance in the ramshackle garage , too , where the Steiger family car is faded and old . In this relatively Spartan atmosphere  --  a place of simple and frugal comforts that would appall his more flamboyant movie neighbors  --  Steiger the actor and Steiger the man are practically indistinguishable . Because there are few visitors , Steiger can dress as he pleases , and when the weather is right his complete costume is apt to be a pair of shorts or swimming trunks . He likes loose , velvetlike shirts with large sleeves , but wears anything that appeals to the mood of the moment . Hollywood columnist Sid Skolsky once impulsively asked Steiger to accompany him to a party on the U.C.L.A. campus , and he agreed to go only after he heard that poet Carl Sandburg was the honor guest . At Skolsky 's insistence , Steiger stopped off at a Beverly Hills hotel and borrowed a necktie from a hat-check girl , but there was no time to go home and change his red-checkered shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests were more formallydressed for the occasion  --  Sandburg took one look and said , " I like you , boy . You 've got a bit of the bum in you . " At home , when the wind churns up the ocean and the big breakers are crashing outside his door , he is likely to rush outside and yell curses at the sea . " I see those enormous waves crashing against the beach , " he says , " and I have to cry out to the ocean : ' C'm on , you devil ! ' This is a masculine thing only a man would understand . " Now and then when the moon is full at midnight and the sea shimmers under the soft light , Steiger will climb to the roof of his house and sprawl there . completely nude , and write poetry . He knows these are unorthodox impulses and after he talked about the roof episode he said with a self-conscious grin , " Do you think they 'll put me away ? " Nude or otherwise , Steiger has composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poems in a red-leather scrapbook given to him by his wife and he needs no coaxing to read them aloud . Reading each poem as though it were part of a play , Steiger surges with emotional excitement and , at certain passages , may exclaim , " Oh-1 love that ! " The poems , by the way , are the only items he keeps in a scrapbook . He is one of the few stars who has no organized fan clubs , and he never reads or sees newspaper reviews or other clippings about himself , a peccadillo which disconcerts his press agents . Moreover , newspaper readers who follow the daily activities of the stars almost never hear about Steiger 's eesantricities , because he claims to abhor this kind of publicity and has ordered his flacks not to feed these items to the columns . On the other hand , he does n't mind what he calls legitimate news , such as his recent and sudden marriage to Miss Bloom . Miss Louella Parsons had predicted this event and Steiger had no sooner said " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lomita . " I did n't want to make her article look invalid , " he says . There was a time when Steiger refused to have a telephone in a rented beach house , and urgent messages reached him via a real-estate man next door . Now that he is a celebrity , however , he has capitulated and has an unlisted phone . " When I first came to Hollywood , " he explains , " I was on guard and did n't want a phone . I made the mistake of being rebellious because I thought this town was going to do me damage . There had been a sort of show-business war between the people in New York and Hollywood , and I was a young actor , and I came out ready to fight . But I found out it was not the town that was wrong . It was who was rebellious . l was creating my own problem .

Aldrich pulled Steiger to one side and said , " Rod , do you want me to do anything about Jack ? " " Heil , no ! " Steiger muttered . " I do n't need the bum and I 'll do my lines without him . " When the scene was shot , Steiger was " so superb , " Aldrich says , that Palance impetuously grabbed a pile of phonograph records and hurled them at his younger rival . Aldrich admits he was furious with the attitudes of both men . " I just thought these two guys had behaved very badly in terms of professional discipline , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this behavior was devastating in terms of economics . I told both of them to call me at home and apologize or my lawyer would be talking to their agents . They called . " Aldrich says Steiger comes to work better prepared than most actors . " He 's a theatrical loner , " he says , and he works hard . It 's difficult to catch up with him , and this causes a good deal of hostility . Rod compounds the felony . He never lets them forget that he 's worked harder than they have . A challenging , provocative man to work with , and it 's a pleasure . " Producer Syd Boehm had a similar head-on collision with Steiger and , as mentioned earlier , was rewarded with an ulcer . Henry Hathaway , whom Boehm describes as " our terrible-tempered Mr. Bangs , " was directing the picture , and he and Steiger were snarling and snapping at each other from the first day . Steiger complained that Hathaway insisted on showing him how each scene should be acted , whereas Hathaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed . On the seventh day Boehm heard there was serious trouble on the set . When he got there Steiger stormed up and said , " Syd , it 's me or Hathaway . Get yourself another boy . " " O.K. , " Boehm said . " You can get out of this picture . " " I thought you were my friend ! " Steiger yelled . " You 're no friend , " Boehm said . " Listen to you . You 're screaming at rnc . Come and look at the rushes . You 're terrible and they 're terrible . " Steiger looked at the film and sheepishly admitted Boehm was right . Hathaway and Steiger shook hands , and there were no further outbreaks . " Rod dearly loves to suffer , " Boehm says . " and he hurts easily . But he has an unbelievable talent and I would take him tomorrow on any picture .

I grew up with a certain sense of freedom that I like , and after I was thirteen I was pretty much on my own . " His real father , Frederick Steiger , is alive somewhere , but the two have never met , and Rod has resolutely stifled any curiosity he may have had . " What you do n't know about a man , you do n't miss , " he says . " My father and I would be complete strangers . " He still sees his mother when he goes east , and recently bought her a home in Shore Acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steiger recalls that as a boy he attended a Lutheran church in Newark , New Jersey , and was an enthusiastic leader in the Sunday school . One day shortly after World War II , Steiger boarded a bus in Newark and encountered the pastor of his former church . " You know , Rod , " the cleric said , " I 've often wondered why you have n't thought of becoming a minister . " " Oh , I could n't do that , " Steiger replied . " Why not ? " " Well , sir , I 'd be up there in the pulpit preaching , but I 'd be looking at some young lady in the second row and wondering what kind of a girl friend she 'd make . " The pastor smiled . " With that kind of honesty , Rod , " he said , " you 'd make the best minister in the world . " His family moved around from Newark to Roseland in New Jersey , and back to Newark . During the summers Rod worked at a carnival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job was a sort of show-business debut in that Steiger wore minstrel make-up , sat on a board and plopped into a pool of water when ball-throwing customers scored a hit . " Three balls for a dime , " he says bitterly , " and they never seemed to miss . " In 1942 , when the older boys at West Side High School in Newark were running off to war , Steiger lied about his age  --  he was sixteen  --  and enlisted in the Navy . He was assigned to the destroyer , U.S.S. Taussig , and for the next three years was on duty in the Pacific theater , including the action at Iwo Jima and Okinawa . During the lonely hours between battles Steiger amused himself inventing corny little dramas in which he played a menace called " The Shadow , " and when he was on watch he used the ship 's intercom system as a stage . One dull evening , with his private audience listening at various phone stations , Steiger spoke into the mouthpiece in a sepulchral tone and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight 's story is " At that point he was cut off by another voice somewhere on the circuit which said , " Shadow  --  this is the Phantom . Get the hell off that line and shut up ! " Steiger says now that he nearly went through the deck . The interrupting voice belonged to the skipper and , needless to say , that was the end of the Steiger repertoirc at sea . Shortly afterward Steiger contracted a serious skin disease , and the infection was so acute he could not bear the touch of cloth . He was the only man on board allowed on deck without a shirt during combat , and when the condition failed to improve he was given a medical discharge . With only one year of high school , and no training for any kind of work , Steiger got a civil service clerk 's job and was assigned to the Veterans Administration office in Newark . He tried to date some of the office girls , and discovered that most of the pretty ones were spending their evenings with the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find the girls , " Steiger said to himself , " then that 's for He spent many an evening just fooling around backstage and eventually , though he was self-conscious about it , he was persuaded to take bit parts . These little exercises in self-expression , delivered with a curious , undefinable inflection which he still has , obviously stirred up long-dormant gifts . Presently one of the coaches , whose name he ca n't recall , urged him to take a serious look at acting four years was a student in the American Theater Wing , the Dramatic Workshop and the Actors Studio . In retrospect  --  for him at least  --  those were grim days . He lived in a five-dollar-a-week basement room at 3l West 82nd Street in New York , and he got enough to cat only because his mother regularly showed up from Newark with baskets of food . There was certainly no stampede to put his name in lights . Playwright Rod Serling , who has since become one of Steiger 's most enthusiastic drum beaters , was recently thumbing through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had apparently hired Steiger ten years ago for a television play called Mr. Finehley Versus the Bomb . The unknown young actor , not even seen on camera , had one short off-stage line . At first Steiger took anything he could get . Price was no object , and he worked for rent and food money in dozens of television plays . Casting directors realized that Steiger attacked the most insignificant bit parts as though he were trying for an Academy Award , and soon he was working regularly . He made his stage debut in the road company of The Trial of Mary Dugan , and first appeared on Broadway in a revival of Clifford Odets ' Night Musk . He played a fifty-five-yearold detective so convincingly that the critics cheered , and he got more job offers than he could handle . In 1952 , solidly established as a television performer , Steiger courted and married Sally Gracie , a pretty young red-haired actress with whom he had worked in New York . It was a strange marriage from the beginning . They separated a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York from Hollywood he always stayed in Sally 's apartment . " We were always good friends , " he says , " but we just could n't make it as man and wife . " After six years of these off-and-on separations Sally went to Ciudad Juarez in Mexico and was granted a divorce . At the time , when newsmen asked Steiger if he intended to remain single , he said , " Oh , no . I 'd still like to be married . Otherwise when you wake up in the morning you feel funny with your arm around a book . " Looking back on his early years in New York , Steiger admits that he was an insecure , unruly and unhappy young man who could not solve his own personality problems . At the urging of Dr. Arthur Green , a physician and personal friend he had seen often during the latter 's intern days , Steiger underwent psychoanalysis . The treatment went on for five years  --  it cost him a total of $12,000 ? and he is convinced he learned to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 am a very vocal advocate of psychoanalysis , " he says , " because it seems common sense to me . There arc no miracles , but 1 went because I had difficulty in enjoying communication with other human beings . 1 think it also helped me to act better , because I see things in people around me that I was blind to before . " One specific flaw Steiger cleared up involved his voice . He had a magnificent baritone , and still has , but he could not control it ten years ago when he took voice lessons with a musical-comedy career in mind . He was so intense and fearful facing even a small audience that he involuntarily changed key in the middle of a song . This awkward fault disappeared after he began psychoanalysis , and when he played the role of Jud Fry in the film version of Oklahoma ! he was able to use his own singing voice , and creditably , too , instead of having the song dubbed by someone else . Director Fred Zinneman , who chose Steiger for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers him one of the five most exciting actors in Hollywood , said afterward , " Rod was simply wonderful . He transformed Jud into a neurotic and made people feel sorry for him . " Steiger no longer visits his psychiatrist , and the conclusion would seem to be that his mind needs no further exploring . " Suddenly , through the wonderful mechanism of nature , " he said , " one day you // do n't have the tremendous need . You begin to understand . " On the other hand , there are occasional outcroppings which suggest that he has not entirely subdued the subconscious . He still has an odd little habit of rubbing his hands together after touching a doorknob , or shaking hands , as though he were washing away a bothersome smudge , but he does n't talk about it . He writes almost illegibly in a cramped left-hand motion , and says only that he can recall how his mother made determined but futile efforts to make him right-handed . He is a Gargantuan cater , a symptom compatible with his emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make weight for a given role . " Take thirty pounds off Rod , " producer Jerry Wald once said , " and you 've got the greatest movie lover in twenty-five years . " On the set , as Robert Aldrich said , Steiger generates hostility , usually without malice aforethought . This mysterious kind of animosity was demonstrated on the Fox lot recently when he worked with British actress Joan Collins . " He was looking down on me , " Miss Collins said huffily . " He probably thought I was one of those Hollywood playgirls , and 1 said to him , ' Do n't be so darn patronizing . ' I told him off all right , and after that we got along tine . " More than likely Steiger was so immersed in the role he was playing that he could n't tell Miss Collins from Marilyn Monroe . In any case , he could n't have been more pained and surprised by this salvo from his leading lady . Steiger himself knows that he has not conquered all the personal shortcomings , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalyst 's couch . " The only thing I can find wrong with psychiatry , " he says philosophically , " is that the solution of one problem leads to the evolution of another problem . " The suspicion persists that Steiger finds it stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life . He is like the masked reveler who is not around when midnight comes and leaves vexed companions with an unanswered guess . This seems to be a characteristic  --  or so the experts say  --  of so-called " method " actors . A method actor is one who needs complete emotional preparation before going into the scene , and he uses various devices for getting into the mood . It can be a metamorphosis with black-magic overtones , and the potions needed for the change-over often bring on the same violent effect suffered by Doctor Jekyll when he turned himself into Mr. Hyde . If a scene calls for Steiger to arrive at a place out of breath and carrying a heavy suitcase , he will run up and down two flights of stairs , carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the picture The Harder Thev Fall , with Humphrey Bogart , Steiger ran around the stage until he was purple , drenched himself with water from a cooler , snarled to himself , did a dozen fast push ups and punched himself in the stomach before announcing that he was ready for the take . He can work himself into a frenzy of rage  --  if the scene calls for it  --  merely by recalling how the Nazis tortured and murdered his idol , Harry Baur , the distinguished French actor . He cries easily , and has been known to get blurry-eyed reading aloud some of his own moody poetry . Often the lines mirror his self-confessed loneliness , such as these : There was a time early in his career when , perhaps for want of better exploitational material , Steiger was called " The Weeper " by some of his Hollywood contemporaries . But when Aline Mosby of United Press did a portrait of him and used the phrase for her title , Steiger was furious . " 1 thought I was dealing with an intelligent person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make me look like the first beatnik or something . How would you like to see yourself called The Weeper ? " In any event . Steiger is not doing much weeping these days , thanks to a shrewd deal on the film .4/ Capone . Ironically , Steiger adamantly turned down the role after twice reading the script . He changed his mind after Allied Artists made numerous alterations he suggested , and when he was convinced that the picture would make Capone look like the deadly killer he was . Fortuitously , Steiger stipulated that he was to get 10 per cent of the net profits , and at last reports his share was touching 3500,000 . With this miniature mint as a guarantee that he 'll never again have to live in a five-dollar room , Steiger at thirty-five can read the career mortality tables with impunity . He has never signed a one-studio contract because he feels this would be a form of regimentation , and with so many directors scrambling for him he can afford to reject pictures he does n't want . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid parties and gatherings and have few intimate friends  --  he says he has found a sense of humor that makes his insular life more tolerable . He amuses himself , for instance , by answering his phone in a British or Japanese accent , and if he 's relaxed he can salt his interviews with an occasional quip . Rod Serling says . " 1 do n't think I 've ever seen Rod laugh " ? but Steiger is beginning to learn the art . There is no doubt that Steiger , whose reputation as an actor is regarded with awe in some Hollywood quarters , is nevertheless a lonely man and is constantly searching for release . There are a fortunate few who , invited for an informal soiree at the house , have seen private performances that are a challenge to belief . Thus , over a period of hours , Steiger can sing operatic arias with a , great voice and a professional skill , read aloud his own poems , short stories or movie scripts , do a dance solo that might win praise from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits , unveil half a dozen of his oil paintings that might look good in any gallery , give a lecture on philosophy , or show his latest piece of sculpture . And if any friend marvels at this incredible range of talents , he is quite likely to shrug it off and say : " Success can never equal the value of a soul . " He means it too .
