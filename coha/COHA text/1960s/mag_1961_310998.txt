The odds were heavy that Detroit 's amiable Mayor Louis Miriani , 64 , would be re-elected in a breeze . After a decade on Detroit 's governing Common Council and four years in the mayor 's office , Miriani seemed to be an institution . He had the support not only of Detroit 's daily newspapers but of civic leaders ranging from labor officials to Henry Ford II to Democratic Senator Patrick McNamara . Opposing Miriani in the nonpartisan election was an unknown named Jerome P. Cavanagh , 33 , a lawyer who had never before run for public office . At first , Cavanagh 's chief political asset seemed to be his photogenic wife and six children . But as the campaign progressed , Cavanagh developed a big issue : the economic health of Detroit . <P> Miriani maintained that Detroit was in good shape , pointed with pride to his record as mayor ; he cited a $47 million urban renewal program with seven major projects under way , economies that had saved the city some $25 million , the completion of the $70 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit is on the move to a destiny of greatness . " <P> But Cavanagh insisted that Detroit had a chronic unemployment problem ( current rate : 10% , v. the national average of 6.8% ) . He charged that industry was pulling out of the city . He claimed that the number of vacant housing units in the city jumped from 9,407 in 1950 to 38,362 in 1960 . He cited a report of the nonprofit Citizens ' Research Council that predicted that Detroit would have a municipal deficit of $15 million in 1961-62 . " Detroit has serious problems and the mayor wo n't admit it , " said Cavanagh . " What about the neighborhoods where people are worrying about how they are going to keep their homes ? How about the thousands of small businesses that have closed ? Yet our mayor claims everything is just rosy and getting better . " <P> Last week the citizens of Detroit made their own decision about the big issue-and the candidates . Drawing particularly strong support from the city 's Negroes , Jerry Cavanagh was elected mayor by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's biggest upsets .
