For more than a year , Venezuela 's Castroite F.A.L.N. has committed almost every misdeed in the book to embarrass President Romulo Betancourt . It has cold-bloodedly murdered some 50 policemen , staged an endless series of robberies , hijackings , kidnapings and bombings . Through it all , Betancourt kept a tight rein on his temper ; he regarded the F.A.L.N. as a civil police matter , an annoyance to be handled by ordinary criminal procedure . But last week , the F.A.L.N. outdid itself : it took on the army , and Betancourt swiftly declared all-out war against Venezuela 's Communists . <P> Death in the Tunnel . The outrage that touched off the government reprisal was a vicious F.A.L.N. raid on an excursion train carrying picnickers to a park 25 miles from Caracas . Hearing rumors that the F.A.L.N. might dynamite the tracks , the army put eight soldiers from its elite National Guard aboard the train . But there was no dynamite ; simple killing was the F.A.L.N. 's object . With the December elections so near , it is going to any lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached a tunnel , some 30 young terrorists aboard drew guns and went about their bloody business . <P> Within ten minutes , five guardsmen were fatally wounded . " We had no chance of fighting back , " said one of the survivors . " They shot at us at point-blank range , without mercy . " The raiders tossed their five victims off the moving train , stopped it long enough to daub F.A.L.N. slogans on the coaches , then backtracked a single coach to a rendezvous point . From there , they escaped in waiting cars . <P> Rumbles in the Barracks . In Venezuela , shooting up the Caracas police force is one thing , but killing soldiers is quite another . For almost five years , Venezuela 's powerful armed forces have gone along with Betancourt 's democratic leadership . But in recent months , there have been angry mutterings over Betancourt 's apparent inability to end the F.A.L.N. 's campaign of terror . Now , with the army under direct attack and with military coups exploding around the Caribbean , Betancourt decided to crack down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutional immunity of 23 Communist and Castroite Congressmen suspected of being the brains behind the F.A.L.N. , ordered their arrest and the roundup of other Red leaders in Venezuela . Convoys of battle-ready infantrymen and paratroopers poured into Caracas to reinforce the police . At week 's end six of the 23 Congressmen had been arrested and turned over to the military for trial ; another 200 far leftist leaders were rounded up .
