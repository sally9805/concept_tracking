ONE can not hope to understand an author if one can not even pronounce his name , " Vladimir Nabokov has observed . The point , originally made about Nikolai Gogol ( pronounced Gaw-gol ) , applies to Nabokov himself . Over the years he has repeatedly complained about the damage inflicted on the Nabokov name in its passage through foreign ports of articulation . Nabokov , Nabokov , Nah-bo-kov , are frequent errors . Rare mutations , he reports , include Nahba-cocoa and Na-bob-kopf . The correct sound , says the man who made the name famous , is Nahboakoff . Slipping on the mask of a straight face for an instant , he continues : " Vladeemir , as in ' redeemer . ' " <P> This last is just the sort of phonetic parallel Nabokov relishes . Similarly , he is fond of insisting that , with minor adjustments for Julian and Gregorian dating systems , he shares an April 23 birth date with William Shakespeare . But then , he adds , " So does Shirley Temple . " <P> This little charade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ever be sure with Nabokov ? Perhaps he has something more in mind . Devout Nabokov watchers might find clues in those references to Julius Caesar and Pope Gregory . They might see implications of the fall of Rome , the rise of Byzantium , and a consequent gap between East and West that makes comparisons impossible between Anglo-Saxon writers ( Shakespeare ) and Slavic writers ( Nabokov ) . <P> Slightly pedantic word play , cultural booby traps , brisk leaps from the Bard of Avon to the Good Ship Lollipop , elegant divertissements for all occasions - such things can be expected of Nabokov . But that is far from all . Russian by birth , a U.S. citizen who now lives in Switzerland , he has become , at 70 , the greatest living American novelist , and the most original writer and stylist since Joyce . He is also an exile , a man who has triumphantly survived this century of the refugee , a man who has lost everything , yet transformed his losses through art and levity into a habitation of the mind . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally maddening amusement park in part devoted to literary instruction . It has many sideshows but only one magician . The general public , which chose to read Lolita as a prurient tale of pedophilia , enters through the main gate , hoping to meet the creator of that doomed and delectable child . A more sophisticated clientele moves beyond the midway to seek out and applaud Dr. Nabokov , the butterfly chaser , dealer in anagrammatical gimcracks , triple-tongued punster , animator of Doppelgnger , shuffler of similes . Prolonged exposure to Nabokov reveals much more . What he calls his " ever-ever " land of artifice opens on intriguing distances . There words transform the world into metaphor and time is held exquisitely at bay by memory . <P> Ada , or Ardor : A Family Chronicle , Nabokov 's latest novel , is already a bestseller . Nabokov 's peculiar fascination - and enduring power-escapes conventional measurement , but by any standard , the range and volume of his work in two languages is prodigious . It includes 15 novels ( nine Russian , six English ) and translations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most novels in much the same way that a poem differs from a political treatise . One is an end in itself . The other , however intricate and elegant , is a means to an end . In a classic sneer at
