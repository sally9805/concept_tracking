April has been a big month in the life of Alice May Brock , 28 . She met her husband in April ( 1961 ) and left him in April ( 1968 ) . She opened a small Stockbridge , Mass. , restaurant in April ( 1966 ) and closed it in April ( 1967 ) . She was hired for the movies in April ( 1968 ) , as the nominal leading lady ( a professional actress played her role ) in the Arlo Guthrie hit , Alice 's Restaurant . She can look forward to still another big April ( 1970 ) - when she pays her income tax . <P> Now that Alice Brock and her shortlived hash house have been immortalized in song and screenplay , she is making the most of it . She is franchising a coast-to-coast chain of Alice 's Restaurants ; the first four ( in Boston , New York , Nashville and Los Angeles ) are scheduled to open this year . Money is already pouring in from her Alice 's Restaurant Cookbook ( Random House ; $5.95 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short on recipes ( fewer than 100 in all ) , long on pictures ( Alice in low-cut dress , shot from above ; Alice in tight-fitting pants suit , shot from below ) , the cookbook is hardly aimed at self-styled Escoffiers or even Julia Children . " Recipes are n't as important as the philosophy behind them , " says the author . " Good food is food you eat with your friends , when everybody is having a good time . So making sure that everyone is having a good time is the key to a successful meal . " <P> Pot and Potted . Alice , who got her start as a sous-chef in the kitchen of a girls ' reformatory in Hawthorne , N.Y . ( " I was a rotten kid " ) , dismisses international cuisine in four sentences . " Do n't be intimidated by foreign cookery , " she writes . " Tomatoes and oregano make it Italian ; wine and tarragon make it French . Sour cream makes it Russian ; lemon and cinnamon make it Greek . Soy sauce makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is similarly cavalier about the tools of her trade . " Other books say , ' Do not , do not ! Do not try to make a souffle unless you have a souffle dish . ' They make cooking sound like a fantastic science , and that makes a lot of people afraid to cook . " Never fear , is Alice 's message ; to party givers who run short of plates , she suggests improvising with tinfoil-lined automobile hubcaps . <P> For all her iconoclasm , Alice hews to a couple of basic rules for her cookery . For one : " You have to have one really big pot , something you can boil macaroni and rice in , cook corn-on-cob in , wash your hair in , wash your dog in . Get one that 's big enough so that a mop will fit . " For another : " Wine and liquor are great for cooking , and also for the cook . In fact , more important for the cook than for the cooking . " Thus armed , pot and potted , Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you tell people that what you 're cooking is absolutely fantastic-if you squeeze their arm and whisper in their ear that this meal is the greatest yet-they 're going to love it . They 'll never suspect that that strange taste in the potatoes is just that you 've burned them . "
