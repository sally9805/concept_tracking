THE PRESIDENCY <P> It was going-home time for the President last week . Six months after their seven-bedroom retreat was built on Rattlesnake Mountain near Middleburg , Va. , the First Family was off to spend their first weekend there . <P> The Virginia home had been rented for $1,000 a month during the summer - first to Washington Stockbroker Dana Hodgdon , then to San Diego Oilman Ogden Armour . But now the Blue Ridge Mountains were flaming in fall color . Besides , the foxhunt season had opened and Jacqueline Kennedy seemed anxious to ride to hounds again . <P> Early in the week , after a round of speechmaking in New England , the President had sandwiched in a visit to his father 's Cape Cod home , where he cruised near Hyannis Harbor with Joe and Cousin Ann Gargan aboard Joe 's 52-ft. yacht Marlin . Later old Joe , who rails at the handicaps of the partial paralysis and loss of speech he still suffers as a result of his stroke nearly two years ago , was off to Chicago . There he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and took a nostalgic tour of the Merchandise Mart , his favorite possession . <P> Back in Washington , the President greeted visiting Bolivian President Victor Paz Estenssoro on the White House south lawn ( see THE HEMISPHERE ) . In a speech before the National Academy of Sciences he promised that henceforward the Government would explain in advance its major scientific experiments in order to " assure expert review before potentially risky experiments are undertaken . " <P> <P> At week 's end Kennedy flew to Amherst College , where he accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and paid his homage to artists in America in a speech at ground-breaking ceremonies for the school 's Robert Frost Library . " Where power corrupts , poetry cleanses , " said Kennedy . " I see little of more importance to our country and our civilization than recognition of the place of the artist . We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda , it is a form of truth . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
