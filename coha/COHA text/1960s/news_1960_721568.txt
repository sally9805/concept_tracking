txt Designers engaged to plan the World 's Fair of 1964 have resigned because they were not permitted to design it as they wished . An announcement issued a month ago by Robert Moses , president of the New York World 's Fair 1964-1965 Corporation , . said that the design board ' had retired because its work was completed . Members of the board said yesterday they had bowed out because their plans had been rejected , and there was nothing worth staying on for . Their terminology varied from " resigned , " to " quit , " to " asked to be excused . " Their attitudes ranged from bitterness to mild regret . None expressed animosity toward Mr. Moses . " I like him as a man , but good // grief , that does n't build a. fair , " declared Gordon Bunshaft , who resigned two months ahead of the rest of the board . " I quit because I did n't want to participate in something I did not believe in , " Mr. Bunshaft said . " We were trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our times . Mr. Moses and the board wanted a repeat of the old World 's Fair plan of 1939 . Why should architects hang around four years beating an old cat ? " he asked . Other members of the board were equally disappointed at the decision to base the design for the 1964 fair on the 1939 fair . But they remained for several weeks after the rejection of their proposals to develop a plan in accordance with the wishes of officials of the fair . Wallace K. Harrison , chairman of the design board , said he and three others had stayed on " because we did n't want to make a mess out of the fair we 've got to have a fair . " He also has agreed to serve on the ) fair 's executive committee . Mr. Harrison said the design board had submitted six or - eight plans , one of which it thought was the best . " But , ' ' added , " for various reasons , economics included , they would not let us do it our way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had their reasons and prevailed , as clients often do against architects , " Mr. Harrison said . He was correlating designer for the United Nations , Rockefeller Center and New York International Airport . Board members expected when they were appointed to carry out their plan and would have remained to do so if it had been accepted , Mr. Harrison said . Members of Board Other members of the design board  --  were Edward Durell Stone , the architect who designed , the United States Embassy at New Delhi ; Henry Dreyfuss , industrial designer , and Emil H. Praeger , engineer . Mr. Bunshaft is chief designer of Skidmore Owings &; Merrill , architects for Lever House and other modern office buildings in Manhattan , Thomas J. Deegan Jr. , chairman of the executive committee of the fair , said that it had to select a plan " acceptable to the general public in order to assure that we could make a financial success of the fair . " " We had to be governed by , the economics of the situation , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge building to house the exhibits . " I thought we gave them something very exceptional in the way of a design , " Mr. Dreyfuss said yesterday . " At first Mr. Moses approved it . Overnight he had his mind changed . He has lots of advisers . They had their own ideas , " I do n't believe in hanging clients . The idea they settled ? on was not our idea and we asked to be relieved . Except for Bunshaft ; . we stayed on to ' develop it because we felt it was the civic thing to do and felt we should help if we could . But it certainly is not our way to do it . " " This was an opportunity to do a very great thing , " he continued , " it 's too bad we could n't . But we did not want to spend the next four years okaying other people 's drawings unless - the concept was ours . " Objections Listed The concept of a single , unified building was rejected for several , reasons . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalks and underground wiring , water and sewage pipes already in place at the site , - which was the site of the 1939 fair . Also , fair officials wanted a plan that would permit conversion afterward to a permanent . park . Furthermore , it was decided that construction of the building would be too expensive . " They wanted to just do the grounds and let the lessees pay for everything but roads and underground utilities , " Mr. Harrison explained , " They felt they had to be able to give absolute freedom for the exhibitors who were to build their own buildings . " Architectural Forum , the building publication of Time , . Inc , , denounced the plan adopted by the fair in an editorial in the December issue . ' It said the plan would result in chaos and reflect unfavorably on the maturity and cultural development of the whole nation in the eyes of foreign visitors . " The great stage for the World 's Fair is proceeding with no art either in the grand plan or in the correlation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' from architects . It is the first fair to depend entirely on what it can get cheaply out of a shabby old ground plan that was already obsolete in 1939 . " The editorial declared that since the resignation of the design board " the fair layout has been done virtually by lawyers who have told lessors what could be built and where , by interpreting mechanical rules concerning building lines and , ) tree space between structures . " Mr. Moses refused to comment last night . Mr. Deegan left by plane for Moscow last night to discuss with Soviet officials what they will put in the fair . In Mr. Deegan 's group was John P. Simmons , chief of protocal of the fair . Mr. Deegan said he would also visit Poland to discuss that country 's role in the fair .
