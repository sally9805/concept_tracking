txt CAIRO  --  There is something Sophoclean in the tragic death of King Paul of the Hellenes amid the worst of all the Cyprus crises . For , in a way , it was he who first started the drama toward its furious denouement . In July 1948 , shortly after he ascended the throne , . Paul laid claim to the island , then a British colony . In exchange , he offered Britain base facilities in Crete or anywhere in Geeece . The immediate result of this suggestion was a personal message , from King George VI , conveyed by British Ambassador Sir Clifford Norton , saying , as Paul would amusedly recollect : " He did n't want me breaking up his empire . " While Paul thought Cyprus with its ' 80 per cent Greek-speaking population should come under Athens 's sovereignty , he nevertheless opposed the ' use of force to attain his goal . Twice Field Marshal Papagos , his Premier , asked the King 's permission , to send the then Colonel Grivas , a Cyprus-born officer on the Greek General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul refused . However , when the King was traveling outside Greece , Papagos sent Grivas secretly to Cyprus and he started the EOKA movement that fought the British . From that moment the King began to lose influence over the accumulating tragedy . In 1955 Papagos lay dying , but his Ministers kept assuring Paul the illness was not serious . He visited the ailing Field Marshal and concluded : " I do n't know what kind of a game my Ministers are trying to play with me , but I fear Papagos will leave us very soon . " Paul was fed up with his bickering political leaders . Prior to Papa , gos he had already had to accept as Premier General Plastiras , with whom he had once sworn never to shake hands . So he bypassed obvious claimants to the Premiership and , somewhat high-handedly , asked Caramanlis , the obscure Minister of Roads , to succeed Papagos . Caramanlis governed efficiently but autocratically until he broke with the King himself last summer and resigned . Paul replaced him with a career diplomat , Pipinellis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact a gentleman . " But the politicians forced Pipinellis out . After last autumn 's election the present Premier , Papandreou , took over and his mandate was subsequently reinforced . The Profession of Ruler Paul believed he must rule as well as reign although he had democratic personal feelings and , indeed , once worked under an assumed name in an English aircraft factory . He thought what he called " kingmanship " was an active profession and that , unlike the Scandinavian monarchies where kings did n't play an important role , a real sovereign was " necessary in Greece because otherwise there would be chaos . " He felt a strong man was required " at the head of any democracy , and kings in the future will have to take more positive decisions as tiv ? need for decision-making increases . The method of ruling is now more democratic , but the role of a king is just as essential as in earlier days . " People need a responsible and permanent symbol and a king can serve as a repository of knowledge as he gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with any kind of Government ? except the Communists . " And for Paul , kings constituted a special club , bound by loyalty to each other even if driven from their thrones . " Once a king always a king , " he used to say . Paul 's death hands on to King Constantine , a youth of pleasant demeanor , sporting ambitions and hitherto average abilities , one of those racking crises that so often grip volatile Greece 's destiny . The Cyprus storm , so reasonably started by Paul sixteen years ago , blows northward toward the mainland . Anti-Western hatred is being fanned by clever agitators and , from their carefully nourished cells among Greek Cypriotes , the Communists are creeping back to their Continen -- tal bastions , evacuated after the recent civil war . Political currents shift rapidly in Greece and if the Left continues to excite emotions engendered in Cyprus , the Greeks face possible disaster . One consequence could ultimately and again be the forced exile of the Royal Family . When he dropped his Cypriote pebble . into the Aegean in 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have imagined the ripple . then created might some day rise ' to a. tidal wave and threaten to engulf his son .
