Each day begins at 5:30 in the morning , ends around 9 at night . And it has been that way since last July for James Roosevelt Jr. , 18 . That 's when he entered the Mont La Salle Novitiate of the Brothers of the Christian Schools near Napa , Calif . The newly named Brother Matthew David got parental permission from both his divorced Episcopal father , James Sr. , and Catholic mother before accepting his religious vocation . At 25 , the grandson of F.D.R. hopes to leave the layman 's life for good , take final vows of poverty , chastity , obedience , stability , and teaching the poor . <P> <P> Horse shows can be dull if you 're not really old enough to appreciate the fine points . Charles Race , 21 months , is not really old enough . So he quickly lost interest in England 's annual Badminton Horse Trials and began wandering . Pretty soon he spotted the mud-covered straw that was spread around because of the rain and got a great idea . He tossed a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . The kind-looking lady turned out to be Queen Mother Elizabeth . She was surprised and laughed politely , but she did n't move away . So he threw a couple more handfuls . Then someone stopped him , and Charles Race had to think of something else to do . <P> <P> Angelo Rizzoli , 74 , does not speak the English , but as Italy 's richest publisher ( Oggi , L'Europeo ) , he does n't need to . Still , it can be a handicap at a Manhattan party . He was in town from Hollywood where 8 , one of the 150 movies he has produced on the side , won two Academy Awards , and his New York branch threw a do . Mostly no capisc Americans made the scene until Christina Austin , 34 , Italy 's current reigning beauty ( Manhattan division ) appeared , and he greeted her with a heartfelt hand buss . Since she 's still linked with Henry Ford II , they probably did n't discuss a film career , but they both have ties in Milan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> The tide of most men 's lives begins to turn after 75 years . And though their vital energies are not yet sapped , three men who reached that mark last week could be pardoned if they paused for a moment to consider their own three quarters of a century : <P> Fresh from a fishing vacation in Ireland , Charlie Chaplin reported that he is getting ready to produce , direct , write and score a film starring his son Sydney . " If it was n't for the cinema , " he confessed , " I 'd probably be digging ditches-or a traveling musician . But I would n't be first-rate , and I think that is what I have been . " <P> In Kansas City , Mo. , Thomas Hart Benton was as crusty as ever . His paintings have never sold better , for which he gave a true realist 's explanation : " Everybody figures they ought to go out and get a Benton now because the old codger is going to be out of production before long . " But a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally produced an infinitesimal crack in the crust . Said the painter : " This is the kind of thing that comes to you when you 've outlived your critics . "
