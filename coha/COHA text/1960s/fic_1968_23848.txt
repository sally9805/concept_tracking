27 The following pages from the notebook manuscript Giacomo Joyce  --  amounting to about a third of the whole  --  are published consecutively here for the first time , though James Joyce wrote the work in Trieste over a half-century ago . ( Some fragments were quoted by Richard Ellmann in his biography of Joyce in 1959 . ) The entire work will be brought out by The Viking Press in a book , with Introduction and Notes by Richard Ellmann , on January 1 , 1968 , Here are some essentials of the background , quoted from Mr. Ellmann 's long essay : " James Joyce wrote it at that stage of his life when he was completing A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and was beginning Ulysses . The manuscript was left by Joyce in Trieste and was saved from loss by his brother Stanislaus . Joyce wrote in his best calligraphic hand , without changes , on both sides of eight large sheets , which are loosely held within the nondescript gray-paper covers of a school notebook .

This Italian form of his name was never used by Joyce , and its acceptance here , to ornament a study of love , must have expressed his sense of depaysement as a Triestine Dubliner pining for requital in two languages . ? Giacomo Joyce displays its hero 's erotic commotion over a girl pupil to whom he was teaching English . In the course of these shifting perspectives , Joyce unfolds the paradigm of unsatisfied love as it takes hold of the no longer young , " To readers accustomed by Joyce to large formal structures , the size and informality of this most delicate of novels may be especially ingratiating . When , not long before his death . Joyce said he would write something very simple and very short , he was thinking perhaps of how he had solidified the small , fragile , transitory perfection of his Triestine pupil into the small , fragile , enduring perfection of Giacomo Joyce .
