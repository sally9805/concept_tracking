In Canton , a crowd of 300,000 turned out to give a rousing send-off to 60,000 middle-school graduates , all of them teen-agers bound for China 's remoter regions . In Wuhan , a similar rally was staged to bid farewell to 10,000 Red Guards from 150 local schools . In Kweiyang , more than 20,000 students have set out for the mountains and paddylands . Since September , the Peking government has shipped more than 2,000,000 university and high school students , including thousands of young guardsmen , to the boondocks . Hundreds of thousands more of the nation 's intellectual elite are scheduled to follow . <P> It has been standard practice in both China and the Soviet Union to assign graduates to rural work , in part to help them overcome their traditional aversion to dirty hands . But the current mass deportation of intellectuals from urban centers has more far-reaching goals and implications . Chinese broadcasts emphasize that the mass upheaval is part of Chairman Mao Tse-tung 's plan for a revolution in the country 's educational policies ; he is said to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . It is also something of a " rectification " campaign , however , designed to punish the young Red Guards who ran wild after Mao proclaimed his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966 . <P> Stinking Thinking .

They believe that the army , which was one of the principal targets of the radical Red Guards , is wreaking its vengeance by shipping the young hooligans off to semi permanent exile , and in the name of their revered Mao , no less . In some provinces , most of the guardsmen find them selves shipped directly to army-run communes , which are especially tough . <P> Once down on the farm , most of the exiles face the undignified task of learning to live and work as ordinary peas ants do . They must learn to plant and harvest , dig and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant mentors . <P> The Chinese press tells the tale of a woman teacher , educated in the Soviet Union , who had never been to the rural areas and who feared to cross a particular wooden bridge . She has now learned to lug 60-lb. loads on a car rying pole across that bridge , thanks to the peasants . " What I learned in the So viet Union was nothing but stinking bourgeois thinking , " she is quoted as saying . " I was unable to carry things on a pole . To go on in this way would lead to the quagmire of revisionism . " <P> Planting the Seeds . The long march back to the farms , of course , may well create more problems than it solves . <P> Thousands of skilled factory workers , for example , have been ordered to take over administration of schools demoralized by the deportations , thus cutting into industrial production . So far , these workers have not had much success in reorganizing schools along Maoist lines , largely because the new order has so far not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves grappling with Red Guard remnants who are reluctant to join the move to the countryside .
