TRADITIONALISTS may still think of Broadway and 42nd Street as the busiest corner in Manhattan . Not if they spend a warm summer afternoon walking between 50th and 51st Streets along the Avenue of the Americas . There , the crowds that congregate for a visit to the Time &; Life Building 's street-level Exhibition Center , and pause to relax near the fountains in the plaza , are likely to rival any on Broadway . <P> During the past seven years , the Exhibition Center has offered shows that have ranged through history and art , from medicine and mathematics to modern sculpture in papier-mch . Previous visitors probably remember the reproduction of Michelangelo 's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel shown at Easter time , or the animated diorama of the First Continental Congress . This week we are opening " A Science Tune-In : New Horizons in Light and Sound , " created with the assistance of Bell Telephone Laboratories . <P> An audiovisual guide to the achievement and promise of contemporary technology , the " Tune-In " includes 20 demonstrations , and takes as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real and legitimate goal of the sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions and riches . " Visitors will be able to : <P> Prove for themselves that sound can not travel in a vacuum . <P> Study a simplified model of the complex switching systems that make almost instantaneous coast-to-coast phone calls possible . <P> Tune in on communication among fish as well as on transmissions from distant galaxies , and hear , on immediate playback , the sound of their own voices as they would have been recorded on equipment available in 1900 , 1920 and today . <P> See figures on a chessboard stand out in remarkable three-dimensional clarity on a two-dimensional " hologram . " <P> Test their hearing acuity by trying to match the pitch of electronically generated tones . <P> Speak with remotely situated friends at the exhibit over a Picturephone that transmits both sound and visual images . <P> Control a laser beam with a system of gas-filled tubes and mirrors . <P> Check the ability of an electronic computer to guess their ages after they have answered " yes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen questions . <P> The exhibit will run into September . And , just as if visitors need a reminder of the hot and noisy New York summer outside , they will be able to watch , on closed-circuit TV , the bustling Avenue of the Americas where it runs between the Radio City Music Hall and the Time &; Life Building .
