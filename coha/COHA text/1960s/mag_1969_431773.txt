 | The Secret of Having Fun STUDYING for his doctor 's degree in psychology some years ago , my husband decided that he needed relaxation , and tried to teach himself to play the recorder . He struggled grimly for several evenings with scales and " Three Blind Mice . " Then he gave up . " Too much like work , " he said , and went back to his books . Our four-year-old daughter discovered the instrument one morning on his study bookshelf . Holding it up expectantly , she put it to her lips and blew a high , quavering toot . Delighted , she skipped out into the sunshine , improvising a melody as she went along . My husband said to me later , " The ma ment she made that ridiculous sound , I knew she was playing the recorder as I had longed to ? just playing it and having fun ! " All too often we adults work so hard at our " fun " that we really do n't enjoy ourselves at all . In fact , could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension and anxiety be as simple as this ? we 've forgotten how play ? As a psychologist and consultant on family-living problems , time and again I 've heard the unhappy questions : Where did the magic go ? What happened to the joy in life ? How can I recapture the thrill of being alive ? And after years studying and observing young children ? children at play ? I 'm convinced that they have the answers . What 's the secret ? Part of it is that a child does n't ask if what he 's doing is worthwhile . He plays for the sake of play , as an end in itself . Take a four-year-old to a playground , and with a leap and a bound he is hanging by his knees from the highest bar on the junglegym , absolutely enthralled with the way the world looks upside down . No thoughts of muscle development or losing weight ? just sheer pleasure in the playground 's riches and in life itself . When we adults want to enjoy ourselves , we almost always seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater , at a baseball game . Or we fall back on things that provide us with a kind of programmed play : cards , dominoes , bowling balls , golf clubs . We let places and objects tell us what to do , how we should react . When a child plays , he is the manipulator ; he makes do with whatever is at hand . His imagination transforms the commonplace into the priceless . A wooden clothespin , rescued from under the kitchen table and wrapped in a dishcloth , becomes a baby ; a penny thrust under a cushion becomes a buried treasure . As we grow older and " wiser , " we lose this talent . I think of this sometimes in New York City as I walk across Central Park at 72nd Street . Here , when I was a little girl , we played Tarzan . To us as children , it was an exotic place , full of thrills and adventures , home of lions and gorillas ? a piece of Africa . Today , 1  | as I pass the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few low rock formations . What can we do to regain this lost capacity for play , for make-believe ? Here are some of the things that children teach us : Be alive to the moment . Study the absorption on a child 's face as he sails a feather through the air , or rolls a potato across the floor into a dustpan . For him the moment is everything . Without conscious thought or plan , he brings to whatever he is doing spontaneous ? and infectious ? joy . There is in children 's play a fresh and quite lovely quality of freedom , of " letting themselves go . " And we adults will find that something wonderful happens to us when we " let go " of our grown-up self-consciousness . A father of four told me recently how one night , after a frustrating day at work , he found himself becoming increasingly annoyed by the playful antics of his children 's dog , who would n't let him alone . He tried to relax , but it was hopeless . Finally he took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and suddenly something snapped ! Before I realized what I was doing , I was playing with that dog like some kind of a nut . We chased each other around the lawn ; I 'd throw sticks and then we 'd race to see who could pick them up first . Afterward it took me 20 minutes to catch my breath ? but it was the first night in months that I did n't feel half-dead when I went to bed . " Children know instinctively that when you are being spontaneous you have the most fun . When friends of ours bought a house not long ago , they planned to have it redecorated before they moved in . The day the papers were signed , they sent out invitations to a " Paint-In , " telling the guests to wear old clothes . When we arrived , the husband announced that we could draw , write or paint anything we wanted on the interior walls . What a wonderful , relaxing evening that was ! Some wrote jokes and limericks , some painted enormous murals , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thought for the demands of the future . It was the moment that was important , and our direct participation in it . Be flexible . Do n't be rigid about what seems sensible . A child feels no compulsion to continue an activity beyond the moment when it ceases to give him pleasure . He 's ready for any new adventure , anytime . We , however , grow ashamed of being spontaneous . If we are at home doing the family wash or at the office writing the monthly sales report , and suddenly a warm breeze through the window makes us dizzy with the thought of spring , what do we do ? We tell ourselves that the schedule must be kept . Grimly we go on with our work ? then wonder later why we have a headache or a backache . If only we had taken ten minutes off for a walk , to listen to a bird sing or watch a squirrel , to sit on a bench in the sun ! Giving in to one 's impulses for a few minutes does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can lead to greater efficiency and productivity , for it refills the reservoir of self and nurtures an inner core of being that needs to be lovingly refreshed . Even dedicated scholars , in their wisdom , know when to yield to an impulse . Philosopher George Santayana was lecturing a class at Harvard one early-spring day when suddenly he broke off , saying : " Gentlemen , I 'm afraid that sentence will never be completed . I have an appointment with April . " With that , he left the classroom . Whenever our daughter is feeling especially exasperated with us , she reminds herself of one of the happiestevenings of our lives . About midnight of a school night my husband and I ended a discouraging discussion about money . It had had its usual effect ? we were ravenous , 1 not for anything ordinary , but for I chicken supreme at Sardi 's . We awakened Wendy , age 12 , from a sound sleep , something we 'd never done on impulse before . She was n't a bit surprised . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Twenty minutes later , the three of us piled into a cab , drove to the resturant and blew our last $20 . Renew your ties with nature . Caught as many of us are in concrete boxes on concrete streets , we lose contact with our roots in nature . We need to find and invent ways to keep in touch with sky and sun and sea . Children understand the sacredness of these things . They are absolutely sure that the world is full of remarkable and exciting things to see and do , to taste , touch and feel . They respond with their senses to the miracles of the natural world . When they tug you outside by the sleeve , give in . Follow them . I know one father who insists that walking in puddles in a summer rain is one of the better things he 's learned from his sons . Take them to a farm , a zoo , a botanical garden . Join them for a walk in the woods ; lie down with them in an open field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass . For a moment , see the world through their eyes . A friend told me how one gray and cheerless day , when she was feeling depressed after a severe attack of flu , she got into her car and drove alone to a beach . " I wrapped myself up in an old blanket and sat on the sand and listened to the surf . I became fascinated watching sandpipers running in and out of the waves . When I finally looked at my watch , I realized that I had been sitting there for three hours ! I felt fully refreshed when I got home ? it was like having been on a vacation . " She had given to herself of the deeper rhythms of life around us . Reach back for the child within you . It is not by accident that stories of young lovers describe them going on picnics , running barefoot down a beach , visiting a zoo or eating icecream cones on a carrousel . When we begin to fall in love , we know instinctively that somehow we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maurice Sendak , who writes children 's stories , was asked how he was able to communicate so sensitively . " First , " he said , " I have to reach and keep hold of the child in me . " This is true not only for the creative artist but also for the rest of us , if we are to get close to what is unique in ourselves ? our own personal identity . About a year ago I happened to notice a toy horn in a music store , each note hole marked in a different color . With it came a booklet of tunes in which all the notes were written in the corresponding colors . My husband 's favorite Christmas carol was in the book . Eureka ! I thought . Here is an instrument that he can play without work . It was the best present I ever gave him . Now , in the hallowed halls of a great university , one can sometimes hear the high , squeaky sounds of " Good King Wenceslas " as a psychology professor , resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only music he can make ? on a toy horn , with colored notes . He is one of the rare and fortunate grownups who have watched a child play and learned a precious lesson about living . @#
