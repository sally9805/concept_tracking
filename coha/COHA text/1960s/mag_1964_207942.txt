Like the young bride always threatening to go home to Mother , Cambodia 's neutralist Prince Norodom ( " Snookie " ) Sihanouk more or less survives on the international scene by constantly threatening to break off with somebody . Last week , as Red Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi dropped by for Cambodian independence-day ceremonies , Sihanouk affirmed what no one doubted-that he was perfectly capable of renouncing " our monarchic and nationalist regime to adopt the Communist regime . " Next thing , Snookie warned Russia and Red China that unless his economic problems are solved , Cambodia might abandon these nations and " align itself with the very rich United States so that they can meet the annual deficit of our national budget " -a suggestion that might no longer be very welcome in Washington . <P> Finally , Sihanouk made his gravest move of all , and this time he did n't just threaten . Drawing himself up to his full 5 ft. 4 in. , Snookie solemnly severed Cambodia 's relations with that well-known instrument of imperialism-the Boy Scouts World Bureau .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
