" Leave ? " Daddy says . " You mean I give you seventy-five cents for three words ? A quarter a word ? And I 'm leaving ? No , Lord . " " Rollo ? " Madame Toussaint says . I see Madame Toussaint 's big old black dog get up out of the corner and come where she is . Madame Toussaint pats the dog on the head with her hand . " Two dollars and twenty-five cents more and you get all the advice you need , " Madame Toussaint says . " Ca n't I get you a load of wood and fix your house for you or something ? " Daddy says . " I do n't want my house fixed and I do n't need no more wood , " Madame Toussaint says . " I got three loads of wood just three days ago from a man who did n't have money .

I ride on Daddy 's back and I look at the stubbles where the people done cut the cane . Them rows some long . Plenty cane 's layingon the ground . I can see cane all over the field . Me and Daddy go over where the people cutting cane . " How come you ai n't working this evening ? " a man asks Daddy . The man 's shucking a big armful of cane with his cane knife .

" That 's if you do n't mind , Frank . " " What ? " Mr. Frank says . " Who told you I talked with Madame Toussaint ? " " Nobody , " Daddy says . " But I heard you and Julie had a fight , and I thought maybe you went back to her for advice . " " For what ? " Mr. Frank says . " So you and Julie could make up , " Daddy says . " Well , I 'll be damned , " Mr. Frank says . " I done heard everything . Excuse me , Sonny . But your daddy 's enough to make anybody cuss . " I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire again .

He looks at Daddy , and then he just bust out laughing . Daddy laughs little bit , too . " What y'all talked about , Frank ? " Daddy asks . " Maybe if I try the same thing , maybe I 'll be able to get her back , too . " Mr. Frank laughs at Daddy , then he stops and just looks at Daddy . " No , " he says .

" " Petting her ? " Daddy says . " You think he knows what we talking ' bout ? " Mr. Frank asks Daddy . " I 'll get him piece of cane , " Daddy says . They got a big pile of cane right behind Daddy 's back , and he crosses the row and gets me a stalk of two-ninety . He breaks off three joints and hands it to me . He throws the rest of the stalk back . " So I start petting her , " Mr. Frank says . " What you mean petting her ' ? " Daddy says . " I do n't even know what you mean now .

I do n't see nothing but cane all over the ground . " Stroke her a little back here , " Mr. Frank says . I hear him hitting on his pants . " Works every time . Get along now like two peas in one pod . Every night when we get in the bed  --  " I hear him hitting again . "  --  couple little strokes . Now everything'sall right .

" " I do n't have a dime , " Mr. Frank says . " Since we made up , Julie keeps most of the money . " " You think she 'd lend me three dollars till Saturday ? " Daddy asks . " I do n't know if she got that much on her , " Mr. Frank says . " I 'll go over and ask her . " I watch Mr. Frank going ' cross the rows where Mrs. Julie 's cutting cane .

" " I 'll ask him , " Daddy says . " Get on , Sonny . " Me and Daddy go back ' cross the field . I can hear Mr. Johnny Green singing , and Daddy turns that way and we go down where Mr. Johnny is .

" " I know what you mean , Brother , " Mr. Johnny says . " I had to visit Madame  --  you wo n't carry this no farther , huh ? " " No , " Daddy says . " Couple months ago I had to take a little trip back there to see her , " Mr. Johnny says . " What was wrong ? " Daddy asks . " Little misunderstanding between me and Sister Laura , " Mr. Johnny says . " She helped ? " Daddy asks . " Told me to stop spending so much time in church and little more time at home , " Mr. Johnny says . " I could n't see that . You know , far back as I can go in my family my people been good church members . " " I know that , " Daddy says .

But I thought it over . I went for a long walk back in the field . I got down on my knees and looked up at the sky . I asked God to show me the way  --  to tell me what to do . And He did , He surely did . He told me to do just like Madame Toussaint said . Slack up going to church . Go twice a week , but spend the rest of the time with her . Just like that He told me . And I 'm doing exactly what He said . Twice a week . And , Brother Howard , do n't spread this round , but the way Sister Laura been acting here lately , there might be a little Johnny next summer sometime . " " No ? " Daddy says .

Nothing more important in this world than family love . Yes , indeed . " Mr. Johnny unbuttons his top overalls pocket and takes out a dollar . " Only thing I got is five , Brother Howard , " he says . " You would n't happen to have some change , would you ? " " I do n't have a red copper , " Daddy says . " But I 'll be more than happy if you can let me have that five . I need some grocery in the house , too . " " Sure , Brother , " Mr. Johnny says . He hands Daddy the dollar .

" Soon ' s I get paid , " Daddy says . " Hop on , Sonny , and hold tight . We going back . " Daddy walks up on Madame Toussaint 's gallery and knocks on the door . " Who that ? " Madame Toussaint asks . " Me . Eddie Howard , " Daddy says . He squats down so I can slide off his back . I slide down and let Daddy hold my hand . " What you want , Eddie Howard ? " Madame Toussaint asks . " I got three dollars , " Daddy says . " I still want that ad-vice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I hear Madame Toussaint coming to the door . She peeps through the keyhole at me and Daddy . She opens the door and let me and Daddy come in . We go to the fireplace and warm . Madame Toussaint comes to the fireplace and sits down in her big old rocking chair . She looks up at Daddy . I look for big old Rollo , but I do n't see him . He must be under the bed or hiding somewhere in the corner . " You got three dollars ? " Madame Toussaint asks Daddy . " Yes , " Daddy says . He takes out the dollar and shows it to Madame Toussaint . Madame Toussaint holds her hand up for it . " This is five , " Daddy says . " I want two back . " " You go'n get your two , " Madame Toussaint says.  | " Come to think of it , " Daddy says , " I ought to just owe you two and a quarter , since I done already gived you seventyfivecents .

" But I done already  --  " Daddy says . " Get out my house , nigger , " Madame Toussaint says . " And do n't come back till you learn how to act . " " All right , " Daddy says , " I 'll give you three more dol-lars . " He hands Madame Toussaint the dollar . Madame Toussaint gets her pocketbook out her pocket . Then she leans close to the fire so she can look down in it . She sticks her hand in the pocketbook and gets two dollars . She looks at the two dollars a long time . She stands up and gets her eyeglasses off the mantelpiece and puts them on her eyes . She looks at the two dollars a long time , then she hands them to Daddy . She sticks the dollar bill Daddy gived her in the pocketbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the mantelpiece . Madame Toussaint sits in her big old rocking chair and starts poking in the fire with the three sticks again . Her face gets red from the fire , her eyes get big and white . I turn my head and hide behind Daddy 's leg . " Go set fire to your car , " Madame Toussaint says . " What ? " Daddy says . " Go set fire to your car , " Madame Toussaint says . " You talking to me ? " Daddy says . " Go set fire to your car , " Madame Toussaint says . " Now , just a minute , " Daddy says . " I did n't give you my hard-earned three dollars for that kind of foolishness . I dis/miss that seventy-five cents you took from me , but not my three dollars that easy . " " You want your wife back ? " Madame Toussaint asks Daddy . " That 's what I 'm paying you for , " Daddy says . " Then go set fire to your car , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You must be fooling , " Daddy says . " I do n't fool , " Madame Toussaint says . " You paid for advice and I 'm giving you advice . " " You mean that ? " Daddy says . " You mean I got to go burn up my car for Amy to come back home ? " " If you want her back there , " Madame Toussaint says . " Do you ? " " I would n't be standing here if I did n't , " Daddy says . " Then go and burn it up , " Madame Toussaint says . " A gallon of coal oil and a penny box of match ought to do the trick . You got any gas in it ? " " A little bit  --  if nobody ai n't drained it , " Daddy says . " Then you can use that , " Madame Toussaint says . " But if you want her back there you got to burn it up . That 's my advice to you . And if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never tell .

That 's what they need . You men do n't know this , but you better learn it before it 's too late . " " What 's that other man 's name ? " Daddy asks . " Can it be Freddie Jackson ? " " It can , " Madame Toussaint says . " But it do n't have to be . Any man that 'd give her love and kindness . " " I love her , " Daddy says . " I give her kindness . I 'm always giving her love and kindness . "  | " When you home , you mean , " Madame Toussaint says . " How about when you running up and down the road in your car ? How do you think she feels then ? " Daddy do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame Toussaint says . " Now , if you want her , go and burn it . If you do n't want her , go and get drunk off them two dollars and sleep in a cold bed to-night . " " You mean she 'll come back tonight ? " Daddy asks . " She 's ready to come back right now , " Madame Toussaint says . " Poor little thing . " I look round Daddy 's leg at Madame Toussaint . Madame Toussaint 's looking in the fire . Her face ai n't red no more ; her eyes ai n't big and white , either . " She 's not happy where she is , " Madame Toussaint says . " She 's with her mama , " Daddy says . " You do n't have to tell me my business , " Madame Toussaintsays . " I know where she is . And I still say she 's not happy . She much rather be back in her own house . Women like to be in their own house . That 's their world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad that they feel lost and out of place in it . Her house is her world . Only there she can do what she want . She ca n't do that in anybody else house  --  mama or nobody else . But you men do n't know any of this . Y'all never know how a woman feels , because you never ask how she feels . Long ' s she there when you get there you satisfied . Long ' s you give her two or three dollars every weekend you think she ought to be satisfied . But keep on . One day all of you 'll find out . " " Could n't I sell the car or something ? " Daddy asks . " You got to burn it , " Madame Toussaint says . " How come your head so hard ? " " But I paid good money for that car , " Daddy says . " It would n't look right if I just jumped up and put fire to it . " " You , get out my house , " Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go do what you want with your car . It 's yours .

" Big old jet-black Rollo comes up and puts his head in Madame Toussaint 's lap . Madame Toussaint pats him on the head . " That 's what I got to do , hanh ? " Daddy says . Madame Toussaint do n't answer Daddy . She starts singing a song to Rollo : Mama 's little baby , Mama 's little baby . " He bad ? " Daddy asks . Mama 's little baby , Mama 's little baby . " Do he bite ? " Daddy asks . Madame Toussaint keeps on singing : Mama 's little baby , Mama 's little baby . " Come on , " Daddy says . " I reckon we better be going .

All Frank Armstrong had to do was pop Julie on the butt little bit every night ' fore she went to sleep . All Johnny had to do was stop going to church so much .

" What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We ca n't burn it out here , " Daddy says . " He say he go'n burn it , " somebody at the fire says . " I 'm go'n burn it , " Daddy says . " It 's mine , ai n't it ? " " Easy , Eddie , " Mr. George Williams says . Daddy is mad but he do n't say any more . Mr. George Williams looks at Daddy , then he goes over to his car and gets the rope . " Ought to be strong enough , " Mr. George Williams says . He hands Daddy the rope , then he goes and turns his car around . Everybody at the fire looks at Mr. George Williams backing up his car . " Good , " Daddy says . Daddy gets between the cars and ties them together . Some of the people come over and watch him . " Y'all got a side road anywhere round here ? " he asks . " Right over there , " the man says . " Leads off back in thefield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , is you ? " " Who field this is ? " Daddy asks . " Mr. Roger Medlow , " the man says . " Any colored people got fields round here anywhere ? " Daddy asks . " Old man Ned Johnson ' bout two miles farther down the road , " another man says . " Why do n't we just take it on back to the plantation ? " Mr. George Williams says . " I doubt if Mr. Claude 'll mind if we burnt it there . " " All right , " Daddy says . " Might as well . " Me and Daddy get in his car . Some of the people from thep69fire run up to Mr. George Williams 's car . Mr. George Williamstells them something , and I see three of them jumping in . Mr. George Williams taps on the horn , then we get going . I sit ' way back in the seat and look at Daddy . Daddy 's quiet . He 's sorry because he got to burn up his car . We go ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the quarter . Soon ' s we get down there , I hear two of the men in Mr. George Williams 's car calling to the people . I sit up in the seat and look out at them . They standing on the fenders , calling to the people . " Come on , " they saying . " Come on to the car-burning party . Free . Everybody welcome . Free . " We go farther down the quarter , and the two men keep on calling . " Come on , everybody , " one of them says . " We having a car-burning party tonight , " the other one says . " No charges . " The people start coming out on the galleries to see what all the racket is . I look back and I see some out in the yard , and some already out in the road . Mr. George Williams stops in front of Gran'mon 's house . " You go'n tell Amy ? " he calls to Daddy . " Maybe she like to go , since you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama come on , " Daddy says . I jump out the car and run in the yard . " Come on , everybody , " one of the men says . " We having a car-burning party tonight , " the other one says . " Everybody invited . No charges . " I pull Gran'mon 's door open and go in . Mama and Uncle Al and Gran'mon 's sitting at the fireplace . " Mama , Daddy say come on if you want see the burning , " I say . " See what burning ? " Gran'mon asks . " Now do n't tell me that crazy nigger going through with that . " " Come on , Mama , " I say.  |p70Mama  and Uncle Al get up from the fireplace and go to the door . " He sure got it out there , " Uncle Al says . " Come on , Mama , " I say . " Come on , Uncle Al . " " Wait till I get my coat , " Mama says . " Mama , you going ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gran'mon says . " I still think he 's bluffing . " Gran'mon gets her coat and Uncle Al gets his coat ; then we go on outside . Plenty people standing round Daddy 's car now . I can see more people opening doors and coming out on the galleries . " Get in , " Daddy says . " Sorry I ca n't take but two . Mama , you want ride ? " " No , thanks , " Gran'mon says . " You might just get it in your head to run off in that canal with me in there . Let your wife and child ride . I 'll walk with the rest of the people . " " Get in , honey , " Daddy says . " It 's getting cold out there . " Mama takes my arm and helps me in ; then she gets in and shuts the door . " How far down you going ? " Uncle Al asks . " Near the sugar house , " Daddy says . He taps on the horn and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one of the men says . " We having a car-burning party tonight , " the other one says . " Everybody invited . " Mr. George Williams drives his car over the railroad tracks . I look back and I see plenty people following Daddy 's car . I ca n't see Uncle Al and Gran'mon , but I know they back there , too . We keep going . We get almost to the sugar house , then we turn down another road . The other road is bumpy and I have to bounce on the seat . " Well , I reckon this 's it , " Daddy says . Mama do n't say nothing to Daddy.  | " You know it ai n't too late to change your mind , " Daddy says . " All I got to do is stop George and untie the car . " " You brought matches ? " Mama asks . " All right , " Daddy says . " All right . Do n't start fussing . " We go a little farther and Daddy taps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy gets out his car and go and talk with Mr. George Williams . Little bit later I see Daddy coming back . " Y'all better get out here , " he says . " We go'n take it down the field a piece . " Me and Mama get out . I look down the headland and I see Uncle Al and Gran'mon and all the other people coming . Some of them even got flashlights because it 's getting dark now . They come where me and Mama 's standing . I look down the field and I see the cars going down the row . It 's dark , but Mr. George Williams got bright lights on his car . The cars stop and Daddy get out his car and go and untie the rope . Mr. George Williams goes and turns around and come back to the headland where all the people standing . Then he turns his lights on Daddy 's car so everybody can see the burning . I see Daddy getting some gas out the tank . " Give me a hand down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like Daddy 's voice . Plenty people run down the field to help Daddy . They get round the car and start shaking it . I see the car leaning ; then it tips over . " Well , " Gran'mon says . " I never would 've thought it . " I see Daddy going all round the car with the can , then I see him splashing some inside the car . All the other people back back to give him room . I see Daddy scratching a match and throwing it in the car . He scratches another one and throw that one in the car , too . I see little bit fire , then I see plenty . " I just do declare , " Gran'mon says . " I must be dreaming . He 's a man after all . "  |p72Gran'mon  the only person talking ; everybody else is quiet . We stay there a long time and look at the fire . The fire burns down and Daddy and them go and look at the car again . Daddy picks up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire gets big . We look at the fire some more . " Never thought that was in Eddie , " somebody says real low . " You not the only one , " somebody else says . " He loved that car more than he loved anything . " " No , he must love her more , " another person says . The fire burns down again . Daddy and them go and look at the car . They stay there a good while , then they come out to the headland where we standing . " What 's that , George ? " Mama asks . " The pump , " Mr. George Williams says . " Eddie gived it to me for driving him to get his car . " " Hand it here , " Mama says . Mr. George Williams looks at Daddy , but he hands the pump to Mama . Mama goes on down the field with the pump and throws it in the fire . I watch Mama coming back . " When Eddie gets paid Saturday he 'll pay you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , Eddie ? " Daddy nods his head . " Sonny , " Mama says . I go where Mama is and Mama takes my hand . Daddy raises his head and looks at the people standing round looking at us . " Thank y'all , " he says . Me and Mama go in Gran'mon 's house and pull the big bundle out on the gallery . Daddy picks the bundle up and puts it on his head , then we go up the quarter to us house . Mama opens the gate and me and Daddy go in . We go inside and Mama lights the lamp.  | " You hungry ? " Mama asks Daddy . " How can you ask that ? " Daddy says . " I 'm starving . " " You want eat now or after you whip me ? " Mama says . " Whip you ? " Daddy asks . " What I 'm go'n be whippingyou for ? " Mama goes back in the kitchen . She do n't find what she 's looking for , and I hear her going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't ask me , " Daddy says . " I do n't know no more than you . " Daddy gets some kindling out of the corner and puts it in the fireplace . Then he pours some coal oil on the kindling and lights a match to it . Me and Daddy squat down on the fireplace and watch the fire burning . I hear the back door shut , then I see Mama coming in the front room . Mama 's got a great big old switch . " Here , " she says . " What 's that for ? " Daddy says . " Here . Take it , " Mama says . " I ai n't got nothing to beat you for , Amy , " Daddy says . " You whip me , " Mama says , " or I turn right round and walk on out that door . " Daddy stands up and looks at Mama . " You must be crazy , " Daddy says . " Stop all that foolishness , Amy , and go cook me some food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama says . " Shucks , " I say . " Now where we going ? I 'm getting tired walking in all that cold . ' Fore you know it I 'm go'n have whooping cough . " " Get your pot and stop answering me back , boy , " Mama says . I go to my bed and pick up the pot again . " Shucks , " I say.  | " You ai n't leaving here , " Daddy says . " You better stop me , " Mama says , going to the bundle . " All right , " Daddy says . " I 'll beat you if that 's what you want . " Daddy gets the switch off the floor and I start crying . " Lord , have mercy , " Daddy says . " Now what ? " " Whip me , " Mama says . " Amy , whip you for what ? " Daddy says . " Amy , please , just go back there and cook me something to eat . " " Come on , Sonny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house . " " All right , " Daddy says . Daddy hits Mama two times on the legs . " That 's enough , " he says . " Beat me , " Mama says . I cry some more . " Do n't beat my mama , " I say . " I do n't want you to beat my mama . " " Sonny , please , " Daddy says . " What y'all trying to do tome  --  run me crazy ? I burnt up the car  --  ai n't that enough ? " " I 'm just go'n tell you one more time , " Mama says . " All right , " Daddy says . " I 'm go'n beat you if that 's whatyou want . " Daddy starts beating Mama , and I cry some more ; but Daddy do n't stop beating her . " Beat me harder , " Mama says . " I mean it . I mean it .

" Leave my mama alone , you old yellow dog , " I say . " You leave my mama alone . " I throw the pot at him but I miss him , and the pot go bouncing ' cross the floor . Daddy throws the switch away and runs to Mama and picks her up . He takes Mama to the bed and begs her to stop crying . I get on my own bed and cry in the cover.  |p75I  feel somebody shaking me , and I must 've been sleeping . " Wake up , " I hear Daddy saying . I 'm tired and I do n't feel like getting up . I feel like sleepingsome more . " You want some supper ? " Daddy asks . " Uh-huh . " " Get up then , " Daddy says . I get up . I got all my clothes on and my shoes on . " It 's morning ? " I ask . " No , " Daddy says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat supper . " I follow Daddy in the kitchen and me and him sit down at the table . Mama brings the food to the table and she sits down , too . " Bless this food , Father , which we 're about to receive , the nurse of our bodies , for Christ sake , amen , " Mama says . I raise my head and look at Mama . I can see where she 's been crying . Her face is all swole . I look at Daddy and he 's eating . Mama and Daddy do n't talk , and I do n't say nothing , either . I eat my food . We eating sweet potatoes and bread . I 'm having a glass of clabber , too . " What a day , " Daddy says . Mama do n't say nothing . She 's just picking over her food . " Mad ? " Daddy says . " No , " Mama says . " Honey ? " Daddy says . Mama looks at him . " I did n't beat you because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Daddy says . " No , " Mama says . " Well , why then ? " Daddy says . " Because I do n't want you to be the laughingstock of the plantation , " Mama says . " Who go'n laugh at me ? " Daddy says.  | " Everybody , " Mama says . " Mama and all . Now they do n't have nothing to laugh about . " " Honey , I do n't mind if they laugh at me , " Daddy says . " I do mind , " Mama says . " Did I hurt you ? " " I 'm all right , " she says . " You ai n't mad no more ? " Daddy says . " No , " Mama says . " I 'm not mad . " Mama picks up a little bit of food and puts it in her mouth . " Finish eating your supper , Sonny , " she says . " I got enough , " I say . " Drink your clabber , " Mama says . I drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go get your book , " Mama says . " It 's on the dresser . " I go in the front room to get my book . " One of us got to go to school with him tomorrow , " I hear Mama saying . I see her handing Daddy the note . Daddy waves it back . " Here , " she says . " Honey , you know I do n't know how to act in no place like that , " Daddy says . " Time to learn , " Mama says . She gives Daddy the note . " What page your lesson on , Sonny ? " I turn to the page , and I lean on Mama 's leg and let her carry me over my lesson . Mama holds the book in her hand . She carries me over my lesson two times , then she makes me point to some words and spell some words . " He knows it , " Daddy says . " I 'll take you over it again tomorrow morning , " Mama says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-uh . " " Your daddy 'll carry you over it tomorrow night , " Mama says . " One night me , one night you .

" When you learn how to act with one , " Mama says . " I ai n't got nothing against cars . " " I guess you right , honey , " Daddy says . " I was going little too far . " " It 's time for bed , Sonny , " Mama says . " Go in the front room and say your prayers to your daddy . " Me and Daddy leave Mama back there in the kitchen . I put my book on the dresser and I go to the fireplace where Daddy is . Daddy puts another piece of wood on the fire and plenty sparks shoot up in the chimley . Daddy helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lean against his leg . " Start off , " Daddy says . " I 'll catch you if you miss some-thing . " " Lay me down to sleep , " I say . " I pray the Lord my soul to keep . If I should die before I wake , I pray the Lord my soul to take . God bless Mama and Daddy . God bless Gran ' - mon and Uncle Al . God bless the church . God bless Miss Hebert . God bless Bill and Juanita . " I hear Daddy gaping . " God bless everybody else . Amen . " I jump up off my knees . Them bricks on the fireplace make my knees hurt . " Did you tell God to bless Johnny Green and Madame Toussaint ? " Daddy says . " No , " I say . " Get down there and tell Him to bless them , too , " Daddy says . " Old Rollo , too ? " " That 's up to you and Him for that , " Daddy says . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . I do n't get on the bricks because they make my knees hurt . I get on the floor and lean against the chair . " And God bless Mr. Johnny Green and Madame Toussaint , " I say.  | " All right , " Daddy says . " Warm up good . " Daddy goes over to my bed and pulls the cover back . " Come on , " he says . " Jump in . " I run and jump in the bed . Daddy pulls the cover up to my neck . " Good night , Daddy . " " Good night , " Daddy says . " Good night , Mama . " " Good night , Sonny , " Mama says . I turn on my side and look at Daddy at the fireplace . Mama comes out of the kitchen and goes to the fireplace . Mama warms up good and goes to the bundle . " Leave it alone , " Daddy says . " We 'll get up early tomorrow and get it . " " I 'm going to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Uh-hunnnnn , " Daddy says . Mama comes to my bed and tucks the cover under me good . She leans over and kisses me and tucks the cover some more . She goes over to the bundle and gets her nightgown , then she goes in the kitchen and puts it on . She comes back and puts her clothes she took off on a chair ' side the wall . Mama kneels down and says her prayers , then she gets in the bed and covers up . Daddy stands up and takes off his clothes . I see Daddy in his big old long white BVD 's . Daddy blows out the lamp , and I hear the spring when Daddy gets in the bed . Daddy never says his prayers . " Sleepy ? " Daddy says . " Uh-uhnnn , " Mama says . I hear the spring . I hear Mama and Daddy talking low , but I do n't know what they saying . I go to sleep some , but I open my eyes again . It 's some dark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like Mama and Daddy . I like Uncle Al , but I do n't like old Gran'mon too much . Gran'mon 's always talking bad about Daddy . I do n't like old Mr. Freddiep79Jackson , either . Mama say she did n't do her and Daddy 's thing with Mr. Freddie Jackson . I like Mr. George Williams . We went riding ' way up the road with Mr. George Williams . We got Daddy 's car and brought it all the way back here . Daddy and them turned the car over and Daddy poured some gas on it and set it on fire . Daddy ai n't got no more car now . ... I know my lesson . I ai n't go'n wee-wee on myself no more . Daddy 's going to school with me tomorrow . I 'm go'n show him I can beat Billy Joe Martin shooting marbles . I can shoot all over Billy Joe Martin . And I can beat him running , too . He thinks he can run fast . I 'm go'n show Daddy I can beat him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to say , " God bless Madame Toussaint . " I do n't like her . And I do n't like old Rollo , either . Rollo can bark some loud . He made my head hurt with all that loud barking . Madame Toussaint 's old house do n't smell good . Us house smell good . I hear the spring on Mama and Daddy 's bed . I get ' way under the cover . I go to sleep little bit , but I wake up . I go to sleep some more . I hear the spring on Mama and Daddy 's bed . I hear it plenty now . It 's some dark under here . It 's warm . I feel good ' way under here.  |p83Go'n  be coming in a few minutes . Coming round that bend down there full speed . And I 'm go'n get out my handkerchief and wave it down , and we go'n get on it and go . I keep on looking for it , but Mama do n't look that way no more . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a long old road , and far ' s you can see you do n't see nothing but gravel . You got dry weeds on both sides , and you got trees on both sides , and fences on both sides , too . And you got cows in the pastures and they standing close together . And when we was coming out here to catch the bus I seen the smoke coming out of the cows 's noses . I look at my mama and I know what she 's thinking . I been with Mama so much , just me and her , I know what she 's thinking all the time . Right now it 's home  --  Auntie and them . She 's thinking if they got enough wood  --  if she left enough there to keep them warm till we get back . She 's thinking if it go'n rain and if any of them go'n have to go out in the rain . She 's thinking ' bout the hog  --  if he go'n get out , and if Ty and Val be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that when she leaves the house . She do n't worry too much if she leave me there with the smaller ones , ' causep84she know I 'm go'n look after them and look after Auntie and everything else . I 'm the oldest and she say I 'm the man . I look at my mama and I love my mama . She 's wearing that black coat and that black hat and she 's looking sad . I love my mama and I want put my arm round her and tell her . But I 'm not supposed to do that . She say that 's weakness and that 's crybaby stuff , and she do n't want no crybaby round her . She do n't want you to be scared , either . ' Cause Ty 's scared of ghosts and she 's always whipping him . I 'm scared of the dark , too , but I make ' tend I ai n't . I make ' tend I ai n't ' cause I 'm the oldest , and I got to set a good sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ca n't ever cry . And that 's why I never said nothing ' bout my teeth . It 's been hurting me and hurting me close to a month now , but I never said it . I did n't say it ' cause I did n't want act like a crybaby , and ' cause I know we did n't have enough money to go have it pulled . But , Lord , it been hurting me . And look like it would n't start till at night when you was trying to get yourselflittle sleep . Then soon ' s you shut your eyes  --  ummmummm , Lord , look like it go right down to your heartstring . " Hurting , hanh ? " Ty 'd say . I 'd shake my head , but I would n't open my mouth for nothing . You open your mouth and let that wind in , and it almost kill you . I 'd just lay there and listen to them snore . Ty there , right ' side me , and Auntie and Val over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he sleeps with Auntie . Mama sleeps round the other side with Louis and Walker . I 'd just lay there and listen to them , and listen to that wind out there , and listen to that fire in the fireplace . Sometimesit 'd stop long enough to let me get little rest . Sometimesit just hurt , hurt , hurt . Lord , have mercy.  |p85Auntie  knowed it was hurting me . I did n't tell nobody 2 but Ty , ' cause we buddies and he ai n't go'n tell nobody . But some kind of way Auntie found out . When she asked me , I told her no , nothing was wrong . But she knowed it all the time . She told me to mash up a piece of aspirin and wrap it in some cotton and jugg it down in that hole . I did it , but it did n't do no good . It stopped for a little while , and started right back again . Auntie wanted to tell Mama , but I told her , " Uh-uh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it just was go'n make her mad again . So Auntie told Monsieur Bayonne , and Monsieur Bayonne came over to the house and told me to kneel down ' side him on the fireplace . He put his finger in his mouth and made the Sign of the Cross on my jaw . The tip of Monsieur Bayonne 's finger is some hard , ' cause he 's always playing on that guitar . If we sit outside at night we can always hear Monsieur Bayonne playingon his guitar . Sometimes we leave him out there playing on the guitar . Monsieur Bayonne made the Sign of the Cross over and over on my jaw , but that did n't do no good . Even when he prayed and told me to pray some , too , that tooth still hurt me . " How you feeling ? " he say . " Same , " I say . He kept on praying and making the Sign of the Cross and I kept on praying , too . " Still hurting ? " he say . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my jaw . He mashed so hard he almost pushed me over on Ty . But then he stopped . " What kind of prayers you praying , boy ? " he say . " Baptist , " I say.  | " Well , I 'll be  --  no wonder that tooth still killing him . I 'm going one way and he pulling the other . Boy , do n't you know any Catholic prayers ? " " I know Hail Mary , ' " I say . " Then you better start saying it . " " Yes , sir . " He started mashing on my jaw again , and I could hear him praying at the same time . And , sure enough , after while it stopped hurting me . Me and Ty went outside where Monsieur Bayonne 's two hounds was and we started playing with them . " Let 's go hunting , " Ty say . " All right , " I say ; and we went on back in the pasture . Soon the hounds got on a trail , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then back in the woods , too . And then they cornered this little old rabbit and killed him , and me and Ty made them get back , and we picked up the rabbit and started on back home . But my tooth had started hurting me again . It was hurting me plenty now , but I would n't tell Monsieur Bayonne . That night I did n't sleep a bit , and first thing in the morning Auntie told me to go back and let Monsieur Bayonne pray over me some more . Monsieur Bayonne was in his kitchen making coffee when I got there . Soon ' s he seen me he knowed what was wrong . " All right , kneel down there ' side that stove , " he say . " And this time make sure you pray Catholic . I do n't know nothing ' bout that Baptist , and I do n't want know nothing ' bout him . " 3 Last night Mama say , " Tomorrow we going to town . " : " It ai n't hurting me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat anything on it . " " Tomorrow we going to town , " she say . And after she finished eating , she got up and went to bed.  |p87She  always go to bed early now . ' Fore Daddy went in the Army , she used to stay up late . All of us sitting out on the gallery or round the fire . But now , look like soon ' s she finish eating she go to bed . This morning when I woke up , her and Auntie was standing'fore the fireplace . She say : " Enough to get there and get back . Dollar and a half to have it pulled . Twenty-five for me to go , twenty-five for him . Twenty-five for me to come back , twenty-five for him . Fifty cents left . Guess I get little piece of salt meat with that . " " Sure can use it , " Auntie say . " White beans and no salt meat ai n't white beans . " " I do the best I can , " Mama say . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was still asleep . " James , hit the floor , " Auntie say . I still made ' tend I was asleep . I did n't want them to know I was listening . " All right , " Auntie say , shaking me by the shoulder . " Come on . Today 's the day . " I pushed the cover down to get out , and Ty grabbed it and pulled it back . " You , too , Ty , " Auntie say . " I ai n't getting no teef pulled , " Ty say . " Do n't mean it ai n't time to get up , " Auntie say . " Hit it , TyTy got up grumbling . " James , you hurry up and get in your clothes and eat your food , " Auntie say . " What time y'all coming back ? " she say to Mama . " That ' leven o'clock bus , " Mama say . " Got to get back in that field this evening . " " Get a move on you , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and washed my face , then I ate myp88breakfast . I was having bread and syrup . The bread was warm and hard and tasted good . And I tried to make it last a long time . Ty came back there grumbling and mad at me . " Got to get up , " he say . " I ai n't having no teefes pulled . What I got to be getting up for ? " Ty poured some syrup in his pan and got a piece of bread . He did n't wash his hands , neither his face , and I could see that white stuff in his eyes . " You the one getting your teef pulled , " he say . " What I got to get up for . I bet if I was getting a teef pulled , you would n't be getting up . Shucks ; syrup again . I 'm getting tired of this old syrup . Syrup , syrup , syrup . I 'm go'n take with the sugar diabetes . I want me some bacon sometime . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bacon , " Auntie say . She stood in the middle door looking at Ty . " You better be glad you got syrup . Some people ai n't got that  --  hard ' s time is . " " Shucks , " Ty say . " How can I be strong . " " I do n't know too much ' bout your strength , " Auntie say ; " but I know where you go'n be hot at , you keep that grumblingup . James , get a move on you ; your mama waiting . " I ate my last piece of bread and went in the front room . Mama was standing ' fore the fireplace warming her hands . I put on my coat and my cap , and we left the house. 4 I look down there again , but it still ai n't coming . I al- : most say , " It ai n't coming yet , " but I keep my mouth shut . ' Cause that 's something else she do n't like . She do n't like for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ai n't coming , I can see it ai n't coming , so why say it ai n't coming . I do n't say it , I turn and look at the river that 's back of us . It 's so cold the smoke 's just raising up from the water . Ip89see a bunch of pool-doos not too far out  --  just on the other side the lilies . I 'm wondering if you can eat pool-doos . I ai n't too sure , ' cause I ai n't never ate none . But I done ate owls and blackbirds , and I done ate redbirds , too . I did n't want kill the redbirds , but she made me kill them . They had two of them back there . One in my trap , one in Ty 's trap . Me and Ty was go'n play with them and let them go , but she made me kill them ' cause we needed the food . " I ca n't , " I say . " I ca n't . " " Here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , " I say . " I ca n't . I ca n't kill him , Mama , please . " " Here , " she say . " Take this fork , James . " " Please , Mama , I ca n't kill him , " I say . I could tell she was go'n hit me . I jerked back , but I did n't jerk back soon enough . " Take it , " she say . I took it and reached in for him , but he kept on hopping to the back . " I ca n't , Mama , " I say . The water just kept on running down my face . " I ca n't , " I say . " Get him out of there , " she say . I reached in for him and he kept on hopping to the back . Then I reached in farther , and he pecked me on the hand . " I ca n't , Mama , " I say . She slapped me again . I reached in again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hopped to one side and I reached there . The fork got him on the leg and I heard his leg pop . I pulled my hand out ' cause I had hurt him . " Give it here , " she say , and jerked the fork out my hand . She reached in and got the little bird right in the neck . I heard the fork go in his neck , and I heard it go in the ground . She brought him out and helt him right in front of me . " That 's one , " she say . She shook him off and gived me the fork . " Get the other one . "  | " I ca n't , Mama , " I say . " I 'll do anything , but do n't make me do that . " She went to the corner of the fence and broke the biggest switch over there she could find . I knelt ' side the trap , crying . " Get him out of there , " she say . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cross the back . I went down on the ground , crying . " Get him , " she say . " Octavia ? " Auntie say . ' Cause she had come out of the house and she was standing by the tree looking at us . " Get him out of there , " Mama say . " Octavia , " Auntie say , " explain to him . Explain to him . Just do n't beat him . Explain to him . " But she hit me and hit me and hit me . I 'm still young  --  I ai n't no more than eight ; but I know now ; I know why I had to do it . ( They was so little , though . They was so little . I ' member how I picked the feathers off them and cleaned them and helt them over the fire . Then we all ate them . Ai n't had but a little bitty piece each , but we all had a little bitty piece , and everybody just looked at me ' cause they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ? That 's why I had to do it . Suppose she had to go away like Daddy went away ? Then who was go'n look after us ? They had to be somebody left to carry on . I did n't know it then , but I know it now . Auntie and Monsieur Bayonne talked to me and made me see . Time I see it I get out my handkerchief and start wav- : ing . It 's still ' way down there , but I keep waving anyhow . Then it come up and stop and me and Mama get on . Mama tell me go sit in the back while she pay . I do like shep91say , and the people look at me . When I pass the little sign that say " White " and " Colored , " I start looking for a seat . I just see one of them back there , but I do n't take it , ' cause I want my mama to sit down herself . She comes in the back and sit down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front , but I know I ca n't sit there , ' cause I have to sit back of the sign . Anyhow , I do n't want sit there if my mama go'n sit back here . They got a lady sitting ' side my mama and she looks at me and smiles little bit . I smile back , but I do n't open my mouth , ' cause the wind 'll get in and make that tooth ache . The lady take out a pack of gum and reach me a slice , but I shake my head . The lady just ca n't understand why a little boy 'll turn down gum , and she reach me a slice again . This time I point to my jaw . The lady understands and smiles little bit , and I smile little bit , but I do n't open my mouth , though . They got a girl sitting ' cross from me . She got on a red overcoat and her hair 's plaited in one big plait . First , I make ' tend I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start looking at her little bit . She make ' tend she do n't see me , either , but I catch her looking that way . She got a cold , and every now and then she h'ist that little handkerchief to her nose . She ought to blow it , but she do n't . Must think she 's too much a lady or something . Every time she h'ist that little handkerchief , the lady ' side her say something in her ear . She shakes her head and lays her hands in her lap again . Then I catch her kind of looking where I 'm at . I smile at her little bit . But think she 'll smile back ? Uh-uh . She just turn up her little old nose and turn her head . Well , I show her both of us can turn us head . I turn mine too and look out at the river . The river is gray . The sky is gray . They have pool-doos on the water . The water is wavy , and the pool-doos go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you got plenty trees hiding the river . Then the bus go round another turn , and I can see the river again . I look toward the front where all the white people sitting . Then I look at that little old gal again . I do n't look right at her , ' cause I do n't want all them people to know I love her . I just look at her little bit , like I 'm looking out that window over there . But she knows I 'm looking that way , and she kind of look at me , too . The lady sitting ' side her catch her this time , and she leans over and says something in her ear . " I do n't love him nothing , " that little old gal says out loud . Everybody back there hear her mouth , and all of them look at us and laugh . " I do n't love you , either , " I say . " So you do n't have to turn up your nose , Miss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was n't looking at you , " I say . " I was looking out that window , there . " " Out that window , my foot , " she say . " I seen you . EverytimeI turned round you was looking at me . " " You must of been looking yourself if you seen me all them times , " I say . " Shucks , " she say , " I got me all kind of boyfriends . " " I got girlfriends , too , " I say . " Well , I just do n't want you getting your hopes up , " she say . I do n't say no more to that little old gal ' cause I do n't want have to bust her in the mouth . I lean on the seat where Mama sitting , and I do n't even look that way no more . When we get to Bayonne , she jugg her little old tongue out at me . I make ' tend I 'm go'n hit her , and she duck down ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us again.  | Me and Mama get off and start walking in town . Bay onne is a little bitty town . Baton Rouge is a hundred times bigger than Bayonne . I went to Baton Rouge once  --  me , Ty , Mama , and Daddy . But that was ' way back yonder , ' fore Daddy went in the Army . I wonder when we go'n see him again . I wonder when . Look like he ai n't ever coming back home . . . . Even the pavement all cracked in Bayonne . Got grass shooting right out the sidewalk . Got weeds in the ditch , too ; just like they got at home . It 's some cold in Bayonne . Look like it 's colder than it is home . The wind blows in my face , and I feel that stuff running down my nose . I sniff . Mama says use that handkerchief . I blow my nose and put it back . We pass a school and I see them white children playing in the yard . Big old red school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pass a cafe , and I see a bunch of people in there eating . I wish I was in there ' cause I 'm cold . Mama tells me keep my eyes in front where they belong . We pass stores that 's got dummies , and we pass another cafe , and then we pass a shoe shop , and that bald-head man in there fixing on a shoe . I look at him and I butt into that white lady , and Mama jerks me in front and tells me stay there . We come up to the courthouse , and I see the flag waving there . This flag ai n't like the one we got at school . This one here ai n't got but a handful of stars . One at school got a big pile of stars  --  one for every state . We pass it and we turn and there it is  --  the dentist office . Me and Mama go in , and they got people sitting everywhere you look . They even got a little boy in there younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a white lady come in there and ask me what my name is . Mama tells her and the white lady goes on back . Then I hear somebody hollering in there . Soon ' s that little boy hear him hollering , he startsp94hollering , too . His mama pats him and pats him , trying to make him hush up , but he ai n't thinking ' bout his mama . The man that was hollering in there comes out holding his jaw . He is a big old man and he 's wearing overalls and a jumper . " Got it , hanh ? " another man asks him . The man shakes his head  --  do n't want open his mouth . " Man , I thought they was killing you in there , " the other man says . " Hollering like a pig under a gate . " The man do n't say nothing . He just heads for the door , and the other man follows him . " John Lee , " the white lady says . " John Lee Williams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama 's lap and holler more now . His mama tells him go with the nurse , but he ai n't thinking ' bout his mama . His mama tells him again , but he do n't even hear her . His mama picks him up and takes him in there , and even when the white lady shuts the door I can still hear little old John Lee . " I often wonder why the Lord let a child like that suffer , " a lady says to my mama . The lady 's sitting right in front of us on another bench . She 's got on a white dress and a black sweater . She must be a nurse or something herself , I reckon . " Not us to question , " a man says . " Sometimes I do n't know if we should n't , " the lady says . " I know definitely we should n't , " the man says . The man looks like a preacher . He 's big and fat and he 's got on a black suit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the lady says . " Why anything ? " the preacher says . " Yes , " the lady says . " Why anything ? " " Not us to question , " the preacher says . The lady looks at the preacher a little while and looks at Mama again.  | " And look like it 's the poor who suffers the most , " she says . " I do n't understand it . " " Best not to even try , " the preacher says . " He works in mysterious ways  --  wonders to perform . " Right then little John Lee bust out hollering , and everybodyturn they head to listen . " He 's not a good dentist , " the lady says . " Dr. Robillard is much better . But more expensive . That 's why most of the colored people come here . The white people go to Dr. Robillard . Y'all from Bayonne ? " " Down the river , " my mama says . And that 's all she go'n say , ' cause she do n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so she says , " Near Morgan . " " I see , " the lady says . " That 's the trouble with the black people in this countrytoday , " somebody else says . This one here 's sitting on the same side me and Mama 's sitting , and he is kind of sitting in front of that preacher . He looks like a teacher or somebody that goes to college . He 's got on a suit , and he 's got a book that he 's been reading . " We do n't question is exactly our problem , " he says . " We should question and question and question  --  question everything . " The preacher just looks at him a long time . He done put a toothpick or something in his mouth , and he just keeps on turning it and turning it . You can see he do n't like that boy with that book . " Maybe you can explain what you mean , " he says . " I said what I meant , " the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , every word spoken . Every-thing . " " It ' pears to me that this young lady and I was talking ' bout God , young man , " the preacher says.  | " Question Him , too , " the boy says . " Wait , " the preacher says . " Wait now . " " You heard me right , " the boy says . " His existence as well as everything else . Everything . " The preacher just looks across the room at the boy . You can see he 's getting madder and madder . But mad or no mad , the boy ai n't thinking ' bout him . He looks at that preacher just ' s hard ' s the preacher looks at him . " Is this what they coming to ? " the preacher says . " Is this what we educating them for ? " " You 're not educating me , " the boy says . " I wash dishes at night so that I can go to school in the day . So even the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him and shakes his head . " When I come in this room and seen you there with your book , I said to myself , There 's an intelligent man . ' How wrong a person can be . " " Show me one reason to believe in the existence of a God , " the boys says . " My heart tells me , " the preacher says . " My heart tells me , ' " the boys says . " My heart tells me . ' Sure , ' My heart tells me . ' And as long as you listen to what your heart tells you , you will have only what the white man gives you and nothing more . Me , I do n't listen to my heart . The purpose of the heart is to pump blood throughout the body , and nothing else . " " Who 's your paw , boy ? " the preacher says . " Why ? " " Who is he ? " " He 's dead . " " And your mon ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , working for nothing . " " And ' cause he 's dead and she 's sick , you mad at the world ? "  | " I 'm not mad at the world . I 'm questioning the world . I 'm questioning it with cold logic , sir . What do words like Freedom , Liberty , God , White , Colored mean ? I want to know . That 's why you are sending us to school , to read and to ask questions . And because we ask these questions , you call us mad . No sir , it is not us who are mad . " " You keep saying us ' ? " " ' Us . ' Yes  --  us . I 'm not alone . " The preacher just shakes his head . Then he looks at everybody in the room  --  everybody . Some of the people look down at the floor , keep from looking at him . I kind of look ' way myself , but soon ' s I know he done turn his head , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " he says to the boy . " Why ? " the boy says . " Why not be sorry for yourself ? Why are you so much better off than I am ? Why are n't you sorry for these other people in here ? Why not be sorry for the lady who had to drag her child into the dentist office ? Why not be sorry for the lady sitting on that bench over there ? Be sorry for them . Not for me . Some way or the other I 'm going to make it . " " No , I 'm sorry for you , " the preacher says . " Of course , of course , " the boy says , nodding his head . " You 're sorry for me because I rock that pillar you 're leaning on . " " You ca n't ever rock the pillar I 'm leaning on , young man . It 's stronger than anything man can ever do . " " You believe in God because a man told you to believe in God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to believe in God . And why ? To keep you ignorant so he can keep his feet on your neck . " " So now we the ignorant ? " the preacher says . " Yes , " the boy says . " Yes . " And he opens his book again . The preacher just looks at him sitting there . The boyp98done forgot all about him . Everybody else make ' tend they done forgot the squabble , too . Then I see that preacher getting up real slow . Preacher 's a great big old man and he got to brace himself to get up . He comes over where the boy is sitting . He just stands there a little while looking down at him , but the boy do n't raise his head . " Get up , boy , " preacher says . The boy looks up at him , then he shuts his book real slow and stands up . Preacher just hauls back and hit him in the face . The boy falls back ' gainst the wall , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You forgot the other cheek , " he says . The preacher hauls back and hit him again on the other side . But this time the boy braces himself and do n't fall . " That has n't changed a thing , " he says . The preacher just looks at the boy . The preacher 's breathing real hard like he just run up a big hill . The boy sits down and opens his book again . " I feel sorry for you , " the preacher says . " I never felt so sorry for a man before . " The boy makes ' tend he do n't even hear that preacher . He keeps on reading his book . The preacher goes back and gets his hat off the chair . " Excuse me , " he says to us . " I 'll come back some other time . Y'all , please excuse me . " And he looks at the boy and goes out the room . The boy h'ist his hand up to his mouth one time to wipe ' way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps on reading . And nobody else in there say a word . Little John Lee and his mama come out the dentist : office , and the nurse calls somebody else in . Then little bit later they come out , and the nurse calls another name.  |p99But  fast ' s she calls somebody in there , somebody else comes in the place where we sitting , and the room stays full . The people coming in now , all of them wearing big coats . One of them says something ' bout sleeting , another one says he hope not . Another one says he think it ai n't nothing but rain . ' Cause , he says , rain can get awful cold this time of year . All round the room they talking . Some of them talking to people right by them , some of them talking to people clear ' cross the room , some of them talking to anybody 'll listen . It 's a little bitty room , no bigger than us kitchen , and I can see everybody in there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got two old men smoking pipes over by that side door . I think I feel my tooth thumping me some , and I hold my breath and wait . I wait and wait , but it do n't thump me no more . Thank God for that . I feel like going to sleep , and I lean back ' gainst the wall . But I 'm scared to go to sleep . Scared ' cause the nurse might call my name and I wo n't hear her . And Mama might go to sleep , too , and she 'll be mad if neither one of us heard the nurse . I look up at Mama . I love my mama . I love my mama . And when cotton come I 'm go'n get her a new coat . And I ai n't go'n get a black one , either . I think I 'm go'n get her a red one . " They got some books over there , " I say . " Want read one of them ? " Mama looks at the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got yourself a little man there , " the lady says . Mama do n't say nothing to the lady , but she must'vesmiled , ' cause I seen the lady smiling back . The lady looks atme a little while , like she 's feeling sorry for me . " You sure got that preacher out here in a hurry , " she says to that boy . The boy looks up at her and looks in his book again.  |p100When  I grow up I want be just like him . I want clothes like that and I want keep a book with me , too . " You really do n't believe in God ? " the lady says . " No , " he says . " But why ? " the lady says . " Because the wind is pink , " he says . " What ? " the lady says . The boy do n't answer her no more . He just reads in his book . " Talking ' bout the wind is pink , " that old lady says . She 's sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to look in his face . The boy makes ' tend the old lady ai n't even there . He just keeps on reading . " Wind is pink , " she says again . " Eh , Lord , what children go'n be saying next ? " The lady ' cross from us bust out laughing . " That 's a good one , " she says . " The wind is pink . Yes sir , that 's a good one . " " Do n't you believe the wind is pink ? " the boys says . He keeps his head down in the book . " Course I believe it , honey , " the lady says . " Course I do . " She looks at us and winks her eye . " And what color is grass , honey ? " " Grass ? Grass is black . " She bust out laughing again . The boy looks at her . " Do n't you believe grass is black ? " he says . The lady quits her laughing and looks at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , quiet . " Grass is green , honey , " the lady says . " It was green yesterday , it 's green today , and it 's go'n be green tomorrow . " " How do you know it 's green ? " " I know because I know . " " You do n't know it 's green , " the boy says . " You believe it 's green because someone told you it was green . If someone had told you it was black you 'd believe it was black . "  | " It 's green , " the lady says . " I know green when I see green . " " Prove it 's green , " the boy says . " Sure , now , " the lady says . " Do n't tell me it 's coming to that . " " It 's coming to just that , " the boy says . " Words mean nothing . One means no more than the other . " " That 's what it all coming to ? " that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she got on two sweaters . She got a green sweater under a black sweater . I can see the green sweater ' cause some of the buttons on the other sweater 's missing . " Yes ma'am , " the boy says . " Words mean nothing . Action is the only thing . Doing . That 's the only thing . " " Other words , you want the Lord to come down here and show Hisself to you ? " she says . " Exactly , ma'am , " he says . " You do n't mean that , I 'm sure ? " she says . " I do , ma'am , " he says . " Done , Jesus , " the old lady says , shaking her head . " I did n't go ' long with that preacher at first , " the other lady says ; " but now  --  I do n't know . When a person say the grass is black , he 's either a lunatic or something 's wrong . " " Prove to me that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green because the people say it 's green . " " Those same people say we 're citizens of these United States , " the boy says . " I think I 'm a citizen , " the lady says . " Citizens have certain rights , " the boy says . " Name me one right that you have . One right , granted by the Constitution , that you can exercise in Bayonne . " The lady do n't answer him . She just looks at him like she do n't know what he 's talking ' bout . I know I do n't . " Things changing , " she says .   " Things are changing because some black men have begun to think with their brains and not their hearts , " the boy says . " You trying to say these people do n't believe in God ? " " I 'm sure some of them do . Maybe most of them do . But they do n't believe that God is going to touch these white people 's hearts and change things tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody sit quiet and look at the boy . Nobody says a thing . Then the lady ' cross the room from me and Mama just shakes her head . " Let 's hope that not all your generation feel the same way you do , " she says . " Think what you please , it does n't matter , " the boy says . " But it will be men who listen to their heads and not their hearts who will see that your children have a better chance than you had . " " Let 's hope they ai n't all like you , though , " the old lady says . " Done forgot the heart absolutely . " " Yes ma'am , I hope they are n't all like me , " the boy says . " Unfortunately , I was born too late to believe in your God . Let 's hope that the ones who come after will have your faith  --  if not in your God , then in something else , something definitelythat they can lean on .

When we come to the other street we just stand there . " You do n't have to make water , do you ? " Mama says . " No , ma'am , " I say . We go on up the street . Walking real slow .

We pass a cafe where the white people in there eating.  |p104Mama  tells me keep my eyes in front where they belong , but I ca n't help from seeing them people eat . My stomach starts to growling ' cause I 'm hungry . When I see people eating , I get hungry ; when I see a coat , I get cold . A man whistles at my mama when we go by a filling station .

If I knowed where we was going I would n't be so cold , but I do n't know where we going . We go , we go , we go . We walk clean out of Bayonne . Then we cross the street and we come back .

I do n't know why , but I 'm glad . It 's warm in there . It 's so warm in there you do n't ever want to leave . I look for the heater , and I see it over by them barrels . Three white men standing round the heater talking in Creole . One of them comes over to see what my mama want . " Got any axe handles ? " she says . Me , Mama and the white man start to the back , butp105Mama stops me when we come up to the heater . She and the white man go on . I hold my hands over the heater and look at them . They go all the way to the back , and I see the white man pointing to the axe handles ' gainst the wall . Mama takes one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much it weighs . Then she rubs her hand over it from one end to the other end . She turns it over and looks at the other side , then she shakes it again , and shakes her head and puts it back . She gets another one and she does it just like she did the first one , then she shakes her head . Then she gets a brown one and do it that , too . But she do n't like this one , either . Then she gets another one , but ' fore she shakes it or anything , she looks at me . Look like she 's trying to say something to me , but I do n't know what it is . All I know is I done got warm now and I 'm feeling right smart better . Mama shakes this axe handle just like she did the others , and shakes her head and says something to the white man .

When we come up to the courthouse , I look at the : clock . It 's got quarter to twelve . Mean we got another hour and a quarter to be out here in the cold . We go and stand ' side a building .

I look at her , but I do n't move and I do n't say nothing . I done seen her like this before and I 'm scared of her . " You hungry ? " she says . She says it like she 's mad at me , like I 'm the cause of everything . " No , ma'am , " I say . " You want eat and walk back , or you rather do n't eat and ride ? " " I ai n't hungry , " I say . I ai n't just hungry , but I 'm cold , too . I 'm so hungry and cold I want to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My feet done got numb . I try to work my toes , but I do n't even feel them . Look like I 'm go'n die . Look like I 'm go'n stand right here and freeze to death . I think ' bout home . I think ' bout Val and Auntie and Ty and Louis and Walker . It 's ' bout twelve o'clock and I know they eating dinner now . I can hear Ty making jokes . He done forgot ' bout getting up early this morning and right now he 's probably making jokes . Always trying to make somebody laugh . I wish I was right there listening to him . Give anything in the world if I was home round the fire . " Come on , " Mama says . We start walking again . My feet so numb I ca n't hardly feel them . We turn the corner and go on back up the street . The clock on the courthouse starts hitting for twelve . The sleet 's coming down plenty now . They hit the pave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , I pray . Do n't let me die , do n't let me die , do n't let me die , Lord.  |p107Now  I know where we going . We going back of town I : where the colored people eat . I do n't care if I do n't eat . I been hungry before . I can stand it . But I ca n't stand the cold . I can see we go'n have a long walk . It 's ' bout a mile down there . But I do n't mind . I know when I get there I 'm go'n warm myself . I think I can hold out . My hands numb in my pockets and my feet numb , too , but if I keep moving I can hold out . Just do n't stop no more , that 's all . The sky 's gray . The sleet keeps on falling . Falling like rain now  --  plenty , plenty . You can hear it hitting the pave . You can see it bouncing . Sometimes it bounces two times ' fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say nothing . We just keep on going , keep on going . I wonder what Mama 's thinking . I hope she ai n't mad at me . When summer come I 'm go'n pick plenty cotton and get her a coat . I 'm go'n get her a red one . I hope they 'd make it summer all the time . I 'd be glad if it was summer all the time  --  but it ai n't . We got to have winter , too . Lord , I hate the winter . I guess everybody hate the winter . I do n't sniff this time . I get out my handkerchief and wipe my nose . My hands 's so cold I can hardly hold the handkerchief . I think we getting close , but we ai n't there yet . I wonder where everybody is . Ca n't see a soul but us . Look like we the only two people moving round today . Must be too cold for the rest of the people to move round in . I can hear my teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make that bad one hurt . Lord , that 's all I need , for that bad one to start off . I hear a church bell somewhere . But today ai n't Sunday . They must be ringing for a funeral or something.  |p108I  wonder what they doing at home . They must be eating . Monsieur Bayonne might be there with his guitar . One day Ty played with Monsieur Bayonne 's guitar and broke one of the strings . Monsieur Bayonne was some mad with Ty . He say Ty was n't go'n ever ' mount to nothing . Ty can go just like Monsieur Bayonne when he ai n't there . Ty can make everybody laugh when he starts to mocking Monsieur Bayonne . I used to like to be with Mama and Daddy . We used to be happy . But they took him in the Army . Now , nobody happy no more .... I be glad when Daddy comes home . Monsieur Bayonne say it was n't fair for them to take Daddy and give Mama nothing and give us nothing . Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hear you talk like that . " Monsieur Bayonne say , " It 's God truth . What they giving his children ? They have to walk three and a half miles to school hot or cold . That 's anything to give for a paw ? She 's got to work in the field rain or shine just to make ends meet . That 's anything to give for a husband ? " Auntie say , " Shhh , Etienne , shhh . " " Yes , you right , " Monsieur Bayonne say . " Best do n't say it in front of them now . But one day they go'n find out . One day . " " Yes , I suppose so , " Auntie say . " Then what , Rose Mary ? " Monsieur Bayonne say . " I do n't know , Etienne , " Auntie say . " All we can do is us job , and leave everything else in His hand . . . " We getting closer , now . We getting closer . I can even see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the cafe . Just to get in there , I say . Just to get in there . Already I 'm starting to feel little better.  |p109We  go in . Ahh , it 's good . I look for the heater ; there12 : ' gainst the wall . One of them little brown ones . I juststand there and hold my hands over it . I ca n't open my hands too wide ' cause they almost froze . Mama 's standing right ' side me . She done unbuttoned her coat . Smoke rises out of the coat , and the coat smells like a wet dog . I move to the side so Mama can have more room . She opens out her hands and rubs them together . I rub mine together , too , ' cause this keep them from hurting . If you let them warm too fast , they hurt you sure . But if you let them warm just little bit at a time , and you keep rubbing them , they be all right every time . They got just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the counter , and a man on this side the counter . They been watching us ever since we come in . Mama gets out the handkerchief and count up the money . Both of us know how much money she 's got there . Three dollars . No , she ai n't got three dollars , ' cause she had to pay us way up here . She ai n't got but two dollars and a half left . Dollar and a half to get my tooth pulled , and fifty cents for us to go back on , and fifty cents worth of salt meat . She stirs the money round with her finger . Most of the money is change ' cause I can hear it rubbing together . She stirs it and stirs it . Then she looks at the door . It 's still sleeting . I can hear it hitting ' gainst the wall like rice . " I ai n't hungry , Mama , " I say . " Got to pay them something for they heat , " she says . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again . She looks over her shoulder at the people , but she still do n't move . I hope she do n't spend the money . I do n't want her spending it on me . I 'm hungry , I'mp110almost starving I 'm so hungry , but I do n't want her spending the money on me . She flips the quarter over like she 's thinking . She 's must be thinking ' bout us walking back home . Lord , I sure do n't want walk home . If I thought it 'd do any good to say something , I 'd say it . But Mama makes up her own mind ' bout things . She turns ' way from the heater right fast , like she better hurry up and spend the quarter ' fore she change her mind . I watch her go toward the counter . The man and the lady look at her , too . She tells the lady something and the lady walks away . The man keeps on looking at her . Her back 's turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there . The lady puts some cakes and a glass of milk on the counter . Then she pours up a cup of coffee and sets it ' side the other stuff . Mama pays her for the things and comes on back where I 'm standing . She tells me sit down at the table ' gainst the wall . The milk and the cakes 's for me ; the coffee 's for Mama . I eat slow and I look at her . She 's looking outside at the sleet . She 's looking real sad . I say to myself , I 'm go'n make all this up one day . You see , one day , I 'm go'n make all this up . I want say it now ; I want tell her how I feel right now ; but Mama do n't like for us to talk like that . " I ca n't eat all this , " I say . They ai n't got but just three little old cakes there . I 'm so hungry right now , the Lord knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my mama to have one . Mama do n't even look my way . She knows I 'm hungry , she knows I want it . I let it stay there a little while , then I get it and eat it . I eat just on my front teeth , though , ' cause if cake touch that back tooth I know what 'll happen . Thank God it ai n't hurt me at all today . After I finish eating I see the man go to the juke box . Hep111drops a nickel in it , then he just stand there a little while looking at the record . Mama tells me keep my eyes in front where they belong . I turn my head like she say , but then I hear the man coming toward us . " Dance , pretty ? " he says . Mama gets up to dance with him . But ' fore you know it , she done grabbed the little man in the collar and done heaved him ' side the wall . He hit the wall so hard he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the lady back of the counter says . " Some pimp . " The little man jumps up off the floor and starts toward my mama . ' Fore you know it , Mama done sprung open her knife and she 's waiting for him . " Come on , " she says . " Come on . I 'll gut you from your neighbo to your throat . Come on . " I go up to the little man to hit him , but Mama makes me come and stand ' side her . The little man looks at me and Mama and goes on back to the counter . " Some pimp , " the lady back of the counter says . " Some pimp . " She starts laughing and pointing at the little man . " Yes sir , you a pimp , all right . Yes sir-ree . " " Fasten that coat , let 's go , " Mama says . " You do n't have to leave , " the lady says . Mama do n't answer the lady , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now  --  my hands , my ears , my feet  --  but I know this ai n't go'n last too long . It done sleet so much now you got ice everywhere you look . We cross the railroad tracks , and soon 's we do , I get cold . That wind goes through this little old coat like it ai n't even there . I got on a shirt and a sweater under the coat , but that wind do n't pay them no mind . I look up and I can see we gotp112a long way to go . I wonder if we go'n make it ' fore I get too cold . We cross over to walk on the sidewalk . They got just one sidewalk back here , and it 's over there . After we go just a little piece , I smell bread cooking . I look , then I see a baker shop . When we get closer , I can smell it more better . I shut my eyes and make ' tend I 'm eating . But I keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone post . Mama grabs me and see if I 'm hurt . I ai n't bleeding or nothing and she turns me loose . I can feel I 'm getting colder and colder , and I look up to see how far we still got to go . Uptown is ' way up yonder . A half mile more , I reckon . I try to think of something . They say think and you wo n't get cold . I think of that poem , " Annabel Lee . " I ai n't been to school in so long  --  this bad weather  --  I reckon they done passed " Annabel Lee " by now . But passed it or not , I 'm sure Miss Walker go'n make me recite it when I get there . That woman do n't never forget nothing . I ai n't never seen nobody like that in my life . I 'm still getting cold . " Annabel Lee " or no " Annabel Lee , " I 'm still getting cold . But I can see we getting closer . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , I see a little old white lady up in front of us . She 's the only lady on the street . She 's all in black and she 's got a long black rag over her head . " Stop , " she says . Me and Mama stop and look at her . She must be crazy to be out in all this bad weather . Ai n't got but a few other people out there , and all of them 's men . " Y'all done ate ? " she says . " Just finish , " Mama says . " Y'all must be cold then ? " she says . " We headed for the dentist , " Mama says . " We 'll warm up when we get there . " " What dentist ? " the old lady says . " Mr. Bassett ? "  | " Yes , ma'am , " Mama says . " Come on in , " the old lady says . " I 'll telephone him and tell him y'all coming . " Me and Mama follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitty store , and it do n't have much in there . The old lady takes off her head rag and folds it up . " Helena ? " somebody calls from the back . " Yes , Alnest ? " the old lady says . " Did you see them ? " " They 're here . Standing beside me . " " Good . Now you can stay inside . " The old lady looks at Mama . Mama 's waiting to hear what she brought us in here for . I 'm waiting for that , too . " I saw y'all each time you went by , " she says . " I came out to catch you , but you were gone . " " We went back of town , " Mama says . " Did you eat ? " " Yes , ma'am . " The old lady looks at Mama a long time , like she 's thinkingMama might be just saying that . Mama looks right back at her . The old lady looks at me to see what I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going ' gainst my mama . " There 's food in the kitchen , " she says to Mama . " I 've been keeping it warm . " Mama turns right around and starts for the door . " Just a minute , " the old lady says . Mama stops . " The boy 'll have to work for it . It is n't free . " " We do n't take no handout , " Mama says . " I 'm not handing out anything , " the old lady says . " I need my garbage moved to the front . Ernest has a bad cold and ca n't go out there . " " James 'll move it for you , " Mama says . " Not unless you eat , " the old lady says . " I 'm old , but I have my pride , too , you know . "  |p114Mama  can see she ai n't go'n beat this old lady down , so she just shakes her head . " All right , " the old lady says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with that rag in her hand . The kitchen is a little bitty little old thing , too . The table and the stove just ' bout fill it up . They got a little room to the side . Somebodyin there laying ' cross the bed  --  ' cause I can see one of his feet . Must be the person she was talking to : Ernest or Alnest  --  something like that . " Sit down , " the old lady says to Mama . " Not you , " she says to me . " You have to move the cans . " " Helena ? " the man says in the other room . " Yes , Alnest ? " the old lady says . " Are you going out there again ? " " I must show the boy where the garbage is , Alnest , " the old lady says . " Keep that shawl over your head , " the old man says . " You do n't have to remind me , Alnest . Come , boy , " the old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old back yard ai n't no bigger than the store or the kitchen . But it can sleet here just like it can sleet in any big back yard . And ' fore you know it , I 'm trembling . " There , " the old lady says , pointing to the cans . I pick up one of the cans and set it right back down . The can 's so light , I 'm go'n see what 's inside of it . " Here , " the old lady says . " Leave that can alone . " I look back at her standing there in the door . She 's got that black rag wrapped round her shoulders , and she 's pointingone of her little old fingers at me . " Pick it up and carry it to the front , " she says . I go by her with the can , and she 's looking at me all the time . I 'm sure the can 's empty . I 'm sure she could 've carried it herself  --  maybe both of them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the door and come back for the other one , " she says.  |p115I  go and come back , and Mama looks at me when I pass her . I get the other can and take it to the front . It do n't feel a bit heavier than that first one . I tell myself I ai n't go'n be nobody 's fool , and I 'm go'n look inside this can to see just what I been hauling . First , I look up the street , then down the street . Nobody coming . Then I look over my shoulder toward the door . That little old lady done slipped up there quiet ' s mouse , watching me again . Look like she knowed what I was go'n do . " Ehh , Lord , " she says . " Children , children . Come in here , boy , and go wash your hands . " I follow her in the kitchen . She points toward the bathroom , and I go in there and wash up . Little bitty old bathroom , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her towels ; I wipe my hands on my pants legs . When I come back in the kitchen , the old lady done dished up the food . Rice , gravy , meat  --  and she even got some lettuce and tomato in a saucer . She even got a glass of milk and a piece of cake there , too . It looks so good , I almost start eating ' fore I say my blessing . " Helena ? " the old man says . " Yes , Alnest ? " " Are they eating ? " " Yes , " she says . " Good , " he says . " Now you 'll stay inside . " The old lady goes in there where he is and I can hear them talking . I look at Mama . She 's eating slow like she 's thinking . I wonder what 's the matter now . I reckon she 's thinking ' bout home . The old lady comes back in the kitchen . " I talked to Dr. Bassett 's nurse , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get there . " " Thank you , ma'am , " Mama says . " Perfectly all right , " the old lady says . " Which one is it ? "  |p116Mama  nods toward me . The old lady looks at me real sad . I look sad , too . " You 're not afraid , are you ? " she says . " No , ma'am , " I say . " That 's a good boy , " the old lady says . " Nothing to be afraid of . Dr. Bassett will not hurt you . " When me and Mama get through eating , we thank the old lady again . " Helena , are they leaving ? " the old man says . " Yes , Alnest . " " Tell them I say good-bye . " " They can hear you , Alnest . " " Good-bye both mother and son , " the old man says . " And may God be with you . " Me and Mama tell the old man good-bye , and we follow the old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out , but she stops and comes back in the store . " You sell salt meat ? " she says . " Yes . " " Give me two bits worth . " " That is n't very much salt meat , " the old lady says . " That 's all I have , " Mama says . The old lady goes back of the counter and cuts a big piece off the chunk . Then she wraps it up and puts it in a paper bag . " Two bits , " she says . " That looks like awful lot of meat for a quarter , " Mama says . " Two bits , " the old lady says . " I 've been selling salt meat behind this counter twenty-five years . I think I know what I 'm doing . " " You got a scale there , " Mama says . " What ? " the old lady says . " Weigh it , " Mama says.  | " What ? " the old lady says . " Are you telling me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the food , " Mama says . " Just a minute , " the old lady says . " James , " Mama says to me . I move toward the door . " Just one minute , I said , " the old lady says . Me and Mama stop again and look at her . The old lady takes the meat out of the bag and unwraps it and cuts ' bout half of it off . Then she wraps it up again and juggs it back in the bag and gives the bag to Mama . Mama lays the quarter on the counter . " Your kindness will never be forgotten , " she says . " James , " she says to me . We go out , and the old lady comes to the door to look at us . After we go a little piece I look back , and she 's still there watching us . The sleet 's coming down heavy , heavy now , and I turn up my coat collar to keep my neck warm . My mama tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bum , " she says . " You a man . "  |p121Two  of them was sitting in the office when I came in there . One was sitting in a chair behind the desk , the other one was sitting on the end of the desk . They looked at me , but when they saw I was just a nigger they went back to talking like I was n't even there . They talked like that two or three more minutes before the one behind the desk looked at me again . That was T. J. I did n't know who the other one was . " Yeah , what you want ? " T. J. said . They sat inside a little railed-in office . I went closer to the gate . It was one of them little gates that swung in and out . " I come to turn myself in , " I said . " Turn yourself in for what ? " " I had a fight with somebody . I think I hurt him . " T. J. and the other policeman looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of a nigger doing that before . " You Procter Lewis ? " T. J. said . " Yes , sir . " " Come in here . " I pushed the little gate open and went in . I made sure it did n't swing back too hard and make noise . I stopped a littlep122way from the desk . T. J. and the other policeman was watching me all the time . " Give me some papers , " T. J. said . He was looking up at me like he was still trying to figure out if I was crazy . If I was n't crazy , then I was a smart aleck . I got my wallet out my pocket . I could feel T. J. and the other policeman looking at me all the time . I was n't supposed to get any papers out , myself , I was supposed to give him the wallet and let him take what he wanted . I held the wallet out to him and he jerked it out of my hand . Then he started going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After he looked at everything , he handed them to the other policeman . The other one looked at them , too ; then he laid them on the desk . T. J. picked up the phone and started talking to somebody . All the time he was talking to the other person , he was looking up at me . He had a hard time making the other person believe I had turned myself in . When he hung up the phone , he told the policeman on the desk to get my records . He called the other policeman " Paul . " Paul slid away from the desk and went to the file cabinet against the wall . T. J. still looked at me . His eyes was the color of ashes . I looked down at the floor , but I could still feel him looking at me . Paul came back with the records and handed them to him . I looked up again and saw them looking over the records together . Paul was standing behind T. J. , looking over his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " T. J. asked , looking up at me again . I did n't say anything to him . He was a mean , evil sonofabitch . He was big and red and he did n't waste time kicking your ass if you gived him the wrong answers . You had to weigh every word he said to you . Sometimes you answered , other times you kept your mouth shut . This time I passed my tongue over my lips and kept quiet.  |p123It  was about four o'clock in the morning , but it must 've been seventy-five in there . T. J. and the other policeman had on short-sleeve khaki shirts . I had on a white shirt , but it was all dirty and torn . My sleeves was rolled up to the elbows , and both of my elbows was skinned and bruised . " Did n't I bring you in here one time , myself ? " Paul said . " Yes , sir , once , I think , " I said . I had been there two or three times , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in couple other jails two or three times , too , but I was n't go'n say anything about them either . If they had n't put it on my record that was they hard luck . " A fist fight , " Paul said . " Pretty good with your fists , ai n't you ? " " I protect myself , " I said . It was quiet in there for a second or two . I knowed why ; I had n't answered the right way . " You protect yourself , what ? " T. J. said . " I protect myself , sir , " I said . They still looked at me . But I could tell Paul was n't anything like T. J. He was n't mean at all , he just had to play mean because T. J. was there . Couple Sundays ago I had played baseball with a boy who looked just like Paul . But he had brown eyes ; Paul had blue eyes . " You 'll be sorry you did n't use your fists this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets . " I did what he said . " Where 's your knife ? " he asked . " I never car ' a knife , " I said . " You never car ' a knife , what , boy ? " T. J. said . " I never car ' a knife , sir , " I said . He looked at me hard again . He did n't think I was crazy for turning myself in , he thought I was a smart aleck . I could tell from his big , fat , red face he wanted to hit me with his fist.  |p124He  nodded to Paul and Paul came toward me . I moved back some . " I 'm not going to hurt you , " Paul said . I stopped , but I could still feel myself shaking . Paul started patting me down . He found a pack of cigarettes in my shirt pocket . I could see in his face he did n't want take them out , but he took them out , anyhow . " Thought I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know  --  " " Paul , if you ca n't make that boy shut up , I can , " T. J. said . " He 'll be quiet , " Paul said , looking at me . He was telling me with his eyes to be quiet or I was go'n get myself in a lot of trouble . " You got one more time to butt in , " T. J. said . " One more time now . " I was getting a swimming in the head , and I looked down at the floor . I hoped they would hurry up and lock me up so I could have a little peace . " Why 'd you turn yourself in ? " T. J. asked . I kept my head down . I did n't answer him . " Paul , ca n't you make that boy talk ? " T. J. said . " Or do I have to get up and do it ? " " He 'll talk , " Paul said . " I figured y'all was go'n catch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the reason you turned yourself in , " T. J. said . I kept my head down . " Look up when I talk to you , " T. J. said . I raised my head . I felt weak and shaky . My clothes was wet and sticking to my body , but my mouth felt dry as dust . My eyes wanted to look down again , but I forced myself to look at T. J. 's big red face . " You figured if you turned yourself in , Roger Medlow was go'n get you out , now , did n't you ? "  |p125I  did n't say anything  --  but that 's exactly what I was figuringon . " Sure , " he said . He looked at me a long time . He knowed how I was feeling ; he knowed I was weak and almost ready to fall . That 's why he was making me stand there like that . " What you think we ought to do with niggers like you ? " he said . " Come on now  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't answer him . " Well ? " he said . " I do n't know , " I said . " Sir . " " I 'll tell you , " he said . " See , if I was gov'nor , I 'd run every damned one of you off in that river out there . Man , woman and child . You know that ? " I was quiet , looking at him . But I made sure I did n't show in my face what I was thinking . I could 've been killed for what I was thinking then . " Well , what you think of that ? " he said . " That 's up to the gov'nor , sir , " I said . " Yeah , " he said . " That 's right . That 's right . I think I 'll write him a little telegram and tell him ' bout my idea . Can save this state a hell of a lot trouble . " Now he just sat there looking at me again . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not just hit me , he wanted to beat me . But he had to have a good excuse . And what excuse could he have when I had already turned myself in . " Put him in there with Munford , " he said to Paul . We went out . We had to walk down a hall to the cell block . The niggers ' cell block was on the second floor . We had to go up some concrete steps to get there . Paul turned on the lights and a woman hollered at him to turn them off . " What 's this supposed to be  --  Christmas ? " she said . " A person ca n't sleep in this joint . " The women was locked up on one end of the block and the men was at the other end . If you hadp126a mirror or a piece of shiny tin , you could stick it out the cell and fix it so you could see the other end of the block . The guard opened the cell door and let me in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the bars . " When will y'all ever learn ? " he said , shaking his head . He said it like he meant it , like he was sorry for me . He kept reminding me of that boy I had played baseball with . They called that other boy Lloyd , and he used to show up just about every Sunday to play baseball with us . He used to play the outfield so he could do a lot of running . He used to buy Cokes for everybody after the game . He was the only white boy out there . " Here 's a pack of cigarettes and some matches , " Paul said . " Might not be your brand , but I doubt if you 'll mind it too much in there . " I took the cigarettes from him . " You can say Thanks , ' " he said . " Thanks , " I said . " And you can say sir ' sometimes , " he said . " Sir , " I said . He looked at me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everybody . He did n't look like a policeman at all . " Let inc give you a word of warning , " he said . " Do n't push T. J. Do n't push him , now . " " I wo n't . " " It does n't take much to get him started  --  do n't push him . " I nodded . " Y'all go'n turn out them goddamn lights ? " the woman hollered from the other end of the block . " Take it easy , " Paul said to me and left . After the lights went out , I stood at the cell door till my eyes got used to the dark . Then I climbed up on my bunk . Two other people was in the cell . Somebody on the bunkp127under mine , somebody on the lower bunk ' cross from me . The upper bunk ' cross from me was empty . " Cigarette ? " the person below me said . He said it very low , but I could tell he was talking to me and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette out the pack and dropped it on the bunk . I could hear the man scratching the match to light the cigarette . He cupped his hands close to his face , because I did n't see too much light . I could tell from the way he let that smoke out he had wanted a cigarette very bad . " What you in for ? " he said , real quiet . " A fight , " I said . " First time ? " " No , I been in before . " He did n't say any more and I did n't , either . I did n't feel like talking , anyhow . I looked up at the window on my left , and I could see a few stars . I felt lonely and I felt like crying . But I could n't cry . Once you started that in here you was done for . Everybody and his brother would run over you . The man on the other bunk got up to take a leak . The toilet was up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his pants , he just stood there looking at me . I tightened my fist to swing at him if he tried any funny stuff . " Well , hello there , " he said . " Get your ass back over there , Hattie , " the man below me said . He spoke in that quiet voice again . " Hattie is a woman , " he said to me . " Do n't see how come they did n't put him with the rest of them whores . " " Do n't let it worry your mind , " Hattie said . " Caught him playing with this man dick , " the man below me said . " At this old flea-bitten show back of town there . Up front  --  front row  --  there he is playing with this man dick . Bitch . "  | " Is that any worse than choking somebody half to death ? " Hattie said . The man below me was quiet . Hattie went back to his bunk . " Oh , these old crampy , stuffy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattress level with the palm of his hand . " How do they expect you to sleep . " He laid down . " What are you in for , honey ? " he asked me . " You look awful young . " " Fighting , " I said . " You poor , poor thing , " Hattie said . " If I can help you in any way , do n't hesitate to ask . " " Shit , " the man below me said . I heard him turning over so he could go to sleep . " The world has given up on the likes of you , " Hattie said . " You jungle beast . " " Bitch , why do n't you just shut up , " the man said . " Why do n't both of y'all shut up , " somebody said from another cell . It was quiet after that . I looked up at the window and I could see the stars going out in the sky . My eyes felt tired and my head started spinning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seven Spots . And she was there in red , and she had two big dimples in her jaws . Then she got up and danced with him , and every time she turned my way she looked over his shoulder at me and smiled . And when she turned her back to me , she rolled her big ass real slow and easy  --  just for me , just for me . Grinning Boy was sitting at the table with me , saying : " Poison , poison  --  nothing but poison . Look at that ; just look at that . " I was looking , but I was n't thinking about what he was saying . When she went back to that table to sit down , I went there and asked her to dance . That nigger sitting there just looked at me , rolling his big white eyes like I was supposed to break out of the joint . I did n't pay him no mind , I wasp129looking at that woman . And I was looking down at them two big pretty brown things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warm and waiting , I wanted to touch them right there in front of that ugly nigger . She shook her head , because he was sitting there , but little bit later when she went back in the kitchen , I went back there , too . Grinning Boy tried to stop me , saying , " Poison , poison , poison , " but I did n't pay him no mind . When I came back in the kitchen , she was standing at the counter ordering a chicken sandwich . The lady back of the counter had to fry the chicken , so she had to wait a while . When she saw me , she started smiling . Them two big dimples came in her jaws . I smiled back at her . " She go'n take a while , " I said . " Let 's step out in the cool till she get done . " She looked over her shoulder and did n't see the nigger peeping , and we went outside . There was people talking out there , but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's your name ? " I said . " Clara . " " Let 's go somewhere , Clara . " " I ca n't . I 'm with somebody , " she said . " That nigger ? " I said . " You call him somebody ? " She just looked at me with that little smile on her face them two big dimples in her jaws . I looked little farther down , and I could see how them two warm , brown things was waiting for somebody to tear that dress open so they could get free . " You must be the prettiest woman in the world , " I said . " You like me ? " " Lord , yes . " " I want you to like me , " she said . " Then what 's keeping us from going ? " I said . " Hell away with that nigger. "  | " My name is Clara Johnson , " she said . " It 's in the book . Call me tomorrow after four . " She turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger bust out the door . He passed by her like she was n't even there . " No , Bayou , " she said . " No . " But he was n't listening to a thing . Before I knowed it , he had cracked me on the chin and I was down on my back . He raised his foot to kick me in the stomach , and I rolled and rolled till I was out of the way . Then I jumped back up . " I do n't want fight you , Bayou , " I said . " I do n't want fight you , now . " " You fight or you fly , nigger , " somebody else said . " If you run , we go'n catch you . " Bayou did n't say nothing . He just came in swinging . I backed away from him . " I was n't doing nothing but talking to her , " I said . He rushed in and knocked me on a bunch of people . They picked me clear off the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , this time a glancing blow on the shoulder . I moved back from him , holding the shoulder with the other hand . " I do n't want fight you , " I told him . " I was just talking to her . " But trying to talk to Bayou was like trying to talk to a mule . He came in swinging wild and high , and I went under his arm and rammed my fist in his stomach . But it felt like ramming your fist into a hundred-pound sack of flour . He stopped about a half a second , then he was right back on me again . I hit him in the face this time , and I saw the blood splash out of his mouth . I was still backing away from him , hoping he would quit , but the nigger kept coming on me . He had to , because all his friends and that woman was there . But he did n't know how to fight , and every time he moved in IP131hit him in the face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch it , now , Bayou , " I said . " I do n't have a knife . Let 's keep this fair . " But he did n't hear a thing I was saying ; he was listening to the others who was sicking him on . He kept moving in on me . He had both of his arms ' way out  --  that blade in his right hand . From the way he was holding it , he did n't have nothing but killing on his mind . I kept moving back , moving back . Then my foot touched a bottle and I stooped down and picked it up . I broke it against the corner of the building , but I never took my eyes off Bayou . He started circling me with the knife , and I moved round him with the bottle . He made a slash at me , and I jumped back . He was all opened and I could 've gotten him then , but I was still hoping for him to change his mind . " Let 's stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's stop it , now . " But he kept on circling me with the knife , and I kept on going round him with the bottle . I did n't look at his face any more , I kept my eyes on that knife . It was a Texas jack with a pearl handle , and that blade must 've been five inches long . " Stop it , Bayou , " I said . " Stop it , stop it . " He slashed at me , and I jumped back . He slashed at me again , and I jumped back again . Then he acted like a fool and ran on me , and all I did was stick the bottle out . I felt it go in his clothes and in his stomach and I felt the hot , sticky blood on my hand and I saw his face all twisted and sweaty . I felt his hands brush against mine when he throwed both of his hands up to his stomach . I started running . I was running toward the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there before me and jumped in on the driving side , but I pushed him out the way and got under that ste'r'n ' wheel . I could hear that gang coming after me , and I shot that Ford out of there a hundred miles an hour . Some of them ran upp132the road to cut me off , but when they saw I was n't stopping they jumped out of the way . Now , it was nobody but me , that Ford and that gravel road . Grinning Boy was sitting over there crying , but I was n't paying him no mind . I wanted to get much road between me and Seven Spots as I could . After I had gone a good piece , I slammed on the brakes and told Grinning Boy to get out . He would n't get out . I opened the door and pushed on him , but he held the ste'r'n ' wheel . He was crying and holding the wheel with both hands . I hit him and pushed on him and hit him and pushed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they was go'n kill me , I did n't want them to kill him , too , but he could n't see that . I shot away from there with the door still opened , and after we had gone a little piece , Grinning Boy reached out and got it and slammed it again . I came out on the pave road and drove three or four miles ' long the river . Then I turned down a dirt road and parked the car under a big pecan tree . It was one of these old plantationquarter and the place was quiet as a graveyard . It was pretty bright , though , because the moon and the stars was out . The dust in that long , old road was white as snow . I lit a cigarette and tried to think . Grinning Boy was sitting over there crying . He was crying real quiet with his head hanging down on his chest . Every now and then I could hear him sniffing . " I 'm turning myself in , " I said . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else to do . I knowed Bayou was dead or hurt pretty bad , and I knowed either that gang or the law was go'n get me , anyhow . I backed the car out on the pave road and drove to Bayonne . I told Grinning Boy to let my uncle know I was in trouble . My uncle would go to Roger Medlow  --  and I was hoping Roger Medlow would get me off like he had done once before . He owned the plantation where I lived .   " Hey , " somebody was calling and shaking me . " Hey , there , now ; wake up . " I opened my eyes and looked at this old man standing by the head of my bunk . I 'm sure if I had woke up anywhere else and found him that close to me I would 've jumped back screaming . He must 've been sixty ; he had reddish-brown eyes , and a stubby gray beard . ' Cross his right jaw , from his cheekbone to his mouth , was a big shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wearing a derby hat , and he had it cocked a little to the back of his head . " They coming , " he said . " Who ? " " Breakfast . " " I 'm not hungry . " " You better eat . Never can tell when you go'n eat again in this joint . " His breath did n't smell too good either , and he was standingso close to me , I could smell his breath every time he breathed in and out . I figured he was the one they called Munford . Just before they brought me down here last night , I heard T. J. tell Paul to put me in there with Munford . Since he had called the other one Hattie , I figured he was Munford . " Been having yourself a nice little nightmare , " he said . " Twisting and turning there like you wanted to fall off . You can have this bunk of mine tonight if you want . " I looked at the freak laying on the other bunk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . " I 'll stay here , " I said . The freak stopped smiling , but he still looked sad  --  like a sad woman . He knowed why I did n't want get down there . I did n't want no part of him . Out on the cell block , the nigger trustee was singing . He went from one cell to the other one singing , " Come and getp134it , it 's hot . What a lovely , lovely day , is n't it ? Yes , indeed , " he answered himself . " Yes , indeed . . . Come and get it , my children , come and get it . Unc ' Toby wo n't feel right if y'all do n't eat his lovely food . " He stopped before the cell with his little shiny pushcart . A white guard was with him . The guard opened the cell door and Unc ' Toby gived each one of us a cup of coffee and two baloney sandwiches . Then the guard shut the cell again and him and Unc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toby was singing again . " Toby used to have a little stand , " Munford said to me . " He think he still got it . He kinda loose up here , " he said , tapping his head with the hand that held the sandwiches . " They ought to send him to Jackson if he 's crazy . " " They like keeping him here , " Munford said . " Part of the scheme of things . " " You want this ? " I asked . " No , eat it , " he said . I got back on my bunk . I ate one of the sandwiches and drank some of the coffee . The coffee was nothing but brown water . It did n't have any kind of taste  --  not even bitter taste . I drank about half and poured the rest in the toilet . The freak , Hattie , sat on his bunk , nibbling at his food . He wrapped one slice of bread round the slice of baloney and ate that , then he did the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread , he dipped down in his coffee and ate it like that . All the time he was eating , he was looking at me like a sad woman looks at you . Munford stood between the two rows of bunks , eating and drinking his coffee . He pressed both of the sandwiches together and ate them like they was just one . Nobody said anything all the time we was eating . Even when I poured out the coffee , nobody said anything . The freak just looked at me like a sad woman . But Munford did n't look at me at all  --  hep135was looking up at the window all the time . When he got through eating , he wiped his mouth and throwed his cup on his bunk . " Another one of them smokes , " he said to me . The way he said it , it sounded like he would 've took it if I did n't give it to him . I got out the pack of cigarettes and gived him one . He lit it and took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking up at the window ; but I could tell that Munford was looking at me . " Killed somebody , huh ? " Munford said , in his quiet , calm voice . " I cut him pretty bad , " I said , still looking up at the window . " He 's dead , " Munford said . I would n't take my eyes off the window . My throat got tight , and my heart started beating so loud , I 'm sure both Munford and that freak could hear it . " That 's bad , " Munford said . " And so young , " Hattie said . I did n't have to look at the freak to know he was crying . " And so much of his life still before him  --  my Lord . " " You got people ? " Munford asked . " Uncle , " I said . " You notified him ? " " I think he knows . " " You got a lawyer ? " " No . " " No money ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Maybe his uncle can do something , " Hattie said . " Poor thing . " Then I heard him blowing his nose . I looked at the bars in the window . I wanted them to leave me alone so I could think.  | " So young , too , " Hattie said . " My Lord , my Lord . " " Oh shut up , " Munford said . " I do n't know why they did n't lock you up with the rest of them whores . " " Is it too much to have some feeling of sympathy ? " Hattie said , and blowed his nose again . " Morris David is a good lawyer , " Munford said . " Get him if you can . Best for colored round here . " I nodded , but I did n't look at Munford . I felt bad and I wanted them to leave me alone . " Was he a local boy ? " Munford asked . " I do n't know , " I said . " Where was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk ' bout it , " Munford said . " Keeping it in just make it worse . " " Seven Spots , " I said . " That 's a rough joint , " Munford said . " They 're all rough joints , " Hattie said . " That 's all you have  --  rough joints . No decent places for someone like him . " " Who 's your uncle ? " Munford asked . " Martin Baptiste . Medlow plantation . " " Martin Baptiste ? " Munford said . I could tell from the way he said it , he knowed my uncle . I looked at him now . He was looking back at me with his left eye half shut . I could tell from his face he did n't like my uncle . " You same as out already , " he said . He did n't like my uncle at all , and now he was studying me to see how much I was like him . " Medlow can get you out of here just by snapping his fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little towns like these . " " I killed somebody , " I said . " You killed another old nigger , " Munford said . " A nigger ai n't nobody . "  |p137He  drawed on the cigarette , and I looked at the big scar on the side of his face . He took the cigarette from his mouth and patted the scar with the tip of one of his fingers . " Bunch of them jumped on me one night , " he said . " One caught me with a straight razor . Had the flesh hanging so much , I coulda ripped it off with my hands if I wanted to . Ah , but before I went down you shoulda seen what I did the bunch of ' em . " He stopped and thought a while . He even laughed a little to himself . " I been in this joint so much . everybody from the judge on down know me . How 's it going , Munford ? " Well , you back with us again , huh , Munt ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , just like he said he 'd be . ' They all know me . All know me . I 'll get out little later on . What time is it getting to be  --  ' leven ? I 'll give ' em till twelve and tell ' em I want get out . They 'll let me out . Got in Saturday night . They always keep me from Saturday till Monday . If it rain , they keep me till Tuesday  --  do n't want me get out and catch cold , you know . Next Saturday , I 'm right back . Ca n't stay out of here to save my soul . " " Places like these are built for people like you , " Hattie said . " Not for decent people . " " Been going in and out of these jails here , I do n't know how long , " Munford said . " Forty , fifty years . Started out just like you  --  kilt a boy just like you did last night . Kilt him and got off  --  got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who got me off . At first I did n't know why he had done it  --  I did n't think ; all I knowed was I was free , and free is how I wanted to be . Then I got in trouble again , and again they got me off . I kept on getting in trouble , and they kept on getting me off . Did n't wake up till I got to be nearly old as I 'm is now . Then I realized they kept getting me off because they needed a Munford Bazille . They need me to prove they human  --  just like they need that thing over there . They need us . Because without us , they do n't know what they is  --  they do n't know what they is out there . With us around , they can.  |p138see  us and they know what they ai n't . They ai n't us . Do you see ? Do you see how they think ? " I did n't know what he was talking about . It was hot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet , except for that big scar . It was just laying there smooth and shiny . " But I got news for them . They us . I never tell them that , but inside I know it . They us , just like we is ourselves . Cut any of them open and you see if you do n't find Munford Bazille or Hattie Brown there . You know what I mean ? " " I guess so . " " No , you do n't know what I mean , " he said . " What I mean is not one of them out there is a man . Not one . They think they men . They think they men ' cause they got me and him in here who ai n't men . But I got news for them  --  cut them open ; go ' head and cut one open  --  you see if you do n't find Munford Bazille or Hattie Brown . Not a man one of them . ' Cause face do n't make a man  --  black or white . Face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fighting do n't make him  --  neither killing . None of this prove you a man . ' Cause animals can fuck , can kill , can fight  --  you know that ? " I looked at him , but I did n't answer him . I did n't feel like answering . " Well ? " he said . " Yeah . " " Then answer me when I ask you a question . I do n't like talking to myself . " He stopped and looked at me a while . " You know what I 'm getting at ? " " No , " I said . " To hell if you do n't , " he said . " Do n't let Medlow get you out of here so you can kill again . " " You got out , " I said . " Yeah , " he said , " and I 'm still coming back here and I'mp139still getting out . Next Saturday I 'm go'n hit another nigger in the head , and Saturday night they go'n bring me here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that I 'm go'n hit me another nigger in the head  --  ' cause I 'll hit a nigger in the head quick as I 'll look at one . " " You 're just an animal out the black jungle , " Hattie said . " Because you have to hit somebody in the head every Saturdaynight do n't mean he has to do the same . " " He 'll do it , " Munford said , looking at me , not at Hattie . " He 'll do it ' cause he know Medlow 'll get him out . Wo n't you ? " I did n't answer him . Munford nodded his head . " Yeah , he 'll do it . They 'll see to that . " He looked at me like he was mad at me , then he looked up at the bars in the window . He frowned and rubbed his , hand over his chin , and I could hear the gritty sound his beard made . He studied the bars a long time , like he was thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face changed : his eyes twinkled and he grinned to himself . He turned to look at Hattie laying on the bunk . " Look here , " he said . " I got a few coppers and a few minutes  --  what you say me and you giving it a little whirl ? " " My God , man , " Hattie said . He said it the way a young girl would 've said it if you had asked her to pull down her drawers . He even opened his eyes wide the same way a young girl would 've done it . " Do you think I could possibly ever sink so low ? " he said . " Well , that 's what you do on the outside , " Munford said . " What I do on the outside is absolutely no concern of yours , let me assure you , " the freak said . " And furthermore , I have friends that I associate with . " " And them ' sociating friends you got there  --  what they got Munford do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , " Hattie said . " Of all the nerve . "  |p140Munford  grinned at him and looked at me . " You know what make ' em like that ? " he asked . " No . " He nodded his head . " Then I 'll tell you . It start in the cradle when they send that preacher there to christen you . At the same time he 's doing that mumbo-jumbo stuff , he 's low'ing his mouth to your little nipper to suck out your manhood . I know , he tried it on me . Here , I 'm laying in his arms in my little white blanket and he suppose to be christeningme . My mammy there , my pappy there ; uncle , aunt , grandmammy , grandpappy ; my nan-nane , my pa-ran  --  all of them standing there with they head bowed . This preacher going , ' Mumbo-jumbo , mumbo-jumbo , ' but all the time he 's low'ing his mouth toward my little private . Nobody else do n't see him , but I catch him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye . I ai n't no more than three months old but I give him a good one . Get your goddamn mouth away from my little pecker , you no-teef , rotten , eggsuckingsonofabitch . Get away from here , you sister-jumper , God-calling , pulpit-spitting , mother-huncher . Get away from here , you chicken-eating , catfish-eating , gin-drinking sonofabitch . Get away , goddamn it , get away ... ' " I thought Munford was just being funny , but he was serious as he could ever get . He had worked himself up so much , he had to stop and catch his breath . " That 's what I told him , " he said . " That 's what I told him . . . . But they do n't stop there , they stay after you . If they miss you in the cradle , they catch you some other time . And when they catch you , they draw it out of you or they make you a beast  --  make you use it in a brutish way . You use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on children , you use it on other men , you use it on yourself . Then when you get so disgusted with everything round you , you kill . And if your back is strong , like your back is strong , they get you outp141so you can kill again . " He stopped and looked at me and nodded his head . " Yeah , that 's what they do with you  --  exactly . . . . But not everybody end up like that . Some of them make it . Not many  --  but some of them do make it . " " Going to the pen ? " I said . " Yeah  --  the pen is one way , " he said . " But you do n't go to the pen for the nigger you killed . Not for him  --  he ai n't worth it . They told you that from the cradle  --  a nigger ai n't worth a good gray mule . Do n't mention a white mule : fifty niggers ai n't worth a good white mule . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger , you go for yourself . You go to sweat out all the crud you got in your system . You go , saying , Go fuck yourself , Roger Medlow , I want to be a man , and by God I will be a man . For once in my life I will be a man . ' " " And a month after you been in the pen , Medlow tell them to kill you for being a smart aleck . How much of a man you is then ? " " At least you been a man a month  --  where if you let him get you out you wo n't be a man a second . He wo n't ' low it . " " I 'll take that chance , " I said . He looked at me a long time now . His reddish-brown eyes was sad and mean . He felt sorry for me , and at the same time he wanted to hit me with his fist . " You do n't look like that whitemouth uncle of yours , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did at your age . But I guess every man must live his own life . I just wish I had mine to live all over again . " He looked up at the window like he had given up on me . After a while , he looked back at Hattie on the bunk . " You not thinking ' bout what I asked you ? " he said . Hattie looked up at him just like a woman looks at a manshe ca n't stand.  | " Munford , if you dropped dead this second , I doubt if I would shed a tear . " " Put all that together , I take it you mean no , " Munford said . Hattie rolled his eyes at Munford the way a woman rolls her eyes at a man she ca n't stand . " Well , I better get out of here , " Munford said . He passed his hand over his chin . It sounded like passing your hand over sandpaper . " Go home and take me a shave and might go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot to pick cotton . " He looked at me again . " I guess I 'll be back next week or the week after  --  but I suppose you 'll be gone to Medlow by then . " " If he come for me  --  yes . " " He 'll come for you , " Munford said . " How old you is  --  twenty ? " " Nineteen . " " Yeah , he 'll come and take you back . And next year you 'll kill another old nigger . ' Cause they grow niggers just to be killed , and they grow people like you to kill ' em . That 's all part of the  --  the culture . And every man got to play his part in the culture , or the culture do n't go on . But I 'll tell you this ; if you was kin to anybody else except that Martin Baptiste , I 'd stay in here long enough to make you go to Angola . ' Cause I 'd break your back ' fore I let you walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptiste blood in you , you 'll never be worth a goddamn no matter what I did . With that , I bid you adieu . " He tipped his derby to me , then he went to the door and called for the guard . The guard came and let him out . The people on the block told him good-bye and said they would see him when they got out . Munford waved at them and followed the guard toward the door . " That Munford , " Hattie said . " Thank God we 're not allp143like that . " He looked up at me . " I hope you did n't listen to half of that nonsense . " I did n't answer the freak  --  I did n't want have nothing to do with him . I looked up at the window . The sky was darkish blue and I could tell it was hot out there . I had always hated the hot sun , but I wished I was out there now . I would n't even mind picking cotton , much as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : nothing but two slices of light bread and a thin slice of baloney sausage . If I was n't hungry , I would n't ' a ' ate it at all . I tried to think about what everybody was doing at home . But hard as I tried , all I could think about was here . Maybe it was best if I did n't think about outside . That could run you crazy . I had heard about people going crazy in jail . I tried to remember how it was when I was in jail before . It was n't like this if I could remember . Before , it was just a brawl  --  a fight . I had never stayed in more than a couple weeks . I had been in about a half dozen times , but never more than a week or two . This time it was different , though . Munford said Roger Medlow was go'n get me out , but suppose Munford was wrong . Suppose I had to go up ? Suppose I had to go to the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was singing it in a high-pitched voice like a woman . I wanted to tell him to shut up , but I did n't want have nothing to do with that freak . I could feel him looking at me ; a second later he had quit singing . " That Munford , " he said . " I hope you did n't believe everything he said about me . " I was quiet . I did n't want to talk to Hattie . He saw it and kept his mouth shut . If Medlow was go'n get me out of here , why had n't he done so ? If all he had to do was snap his fingers , what was keeping him from snapping them ? Maybe he was n't go'np144do anything for me . I was n't one of them Uncle Tom-ing niggers like my uncle , and maybe he was go'n let me go up this time . I could n't make it in the pen . Locked up  --  caged . Walking round all day with shackles on my legs . No woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd die in a year . Not five years  --  one year . If Roger Medlow came , I was leaving . That 's how old people is : they always want you to do something they never did when they was young . If he had his life to live all over  --  how come he did n't do it then ? Do n't tell me do it when he did n't do it . If that 's part of the culture , then I 'm part of the culture , because I sure ai n't for the pen . That black sonofabitch  --  that coward . I hope he did n't have religion . I hope his ass burn in hell till eternity . Look how life can change on you  --  just look . Yesterday this time I was poon-tanging like a dog . Today  --  that black sonofabitch  --  behind these bars maybe for the rest of my life . And look at me , look at me . Strong . A man . A damn good man . A hard dick  --  a pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a caged animal . Maybe that 's what Munford was talking about . You spend much time in here like he done spent , you ca n't be nothing but a ' animal . I wish somebody could do something for me . I can make a phone call , ca n't I ? But call who ? That ass-hole uncle of mine ? I 'm sure Grinning Boy already told him where I 'm at . I wonder if Grinning Boy got in touch with Marie . I suppose this finish it . Hell , why should she stick her neck out for me . I was treating her like a dog , anyhow . I 'm sorry , baby ; I 'm sorry . No , I 'm not sorry ; I 'd do the same thing tomorrow if I was out of here . Maybe I 'm a ' animal already . I do n't care who she is , I 'd do it with her and do n't give a damn . Hell , let me stop whining ; I ai n't no goddamn animal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think like a man.  |p145I  got to think , I got to think . My daddy is somewhere up North  --  but where ? I got more people scattered around , but no use going to them . I 'm the black sheep of this family  --  and they do n't care if I live or die . They 'd be glad if I died so they 'd be rid of me for good . That black sonofabitch  --  I swear to God . Big as he was , he had to go for a knife . I hope he rot in hell . I hope he burn  --  goddamn it  --  till eternity come and go . Let me see , let me see , who can I call ? I do n't know a soul with a dime . Them white people out there got it , but what do they care ' bout me , a nigger . Now , if I was a ' Uncle Tom-ing nigger  --  oh , yes , they 'd come then . They 'd come running . But like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , five years  --  that 's what they give you . Five years for killing a nigger like that . Five years out of my life . Five years for a rotten , no good sonofabitch who did n't have no business being born in the first place . Five years .. . Maybe I ought to call Medlow myself . . . . But suppose he come , then what ? Me and Medlow never got along . I could n't never bow and say , " Yes sir , " and scratch my head . But I 'd have to do it now . He 'd have me by the nuts and he 'd know it ; and I 'd have to kiss his ass if he told me to . Oh Lord , have mercy . . . . They get you , do n't they . They let you run and run , then they get you . They stick a no-good , trashy nigger up there , and they get you . And they twist your nuts and twist them till you do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to stop it . My head 'll go to hurting after while and I wo n't be able to think anything out . " Oh , you 're so beautiful when you 're meditating , " Hattie said . " And what were you meditating about ? " I did n't answer him  --  I did n't want have nothing to do with that freak . " How long you 're going to be in here , is that it ? " he said . " Sometimes they let you sit for days and days . In your casep146they might let you sit here a week before they say anything to you . What do they care  --  they 're inhuman . " I got a cigarette out of the pack and lit it . " I smoke , too , " Hattie said . I did n't answer that freak . He came over and got the pack out of my shirt pocket . His fingers went down in my pocket just like a woman 's fingers go in your pocket . " May I ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit his cigarette and laid the pack on my chest just like a woman 'd do it . " Really , I 'm not all that awful , " he said . " Munford has poisoned your mind with all sorts of notions . Let go  --  relax . You need friends at a time like this . " I stuffed the pack of cigarettes in my pocket and looked up at the window . " These are very good , " the freak said . " Very , very good . Well , maybe you 'll feel like talking a little later on . It 's alwaysgood to let go . I 'm understanding ; I 'll be here . " He went back to his bunk and laid down . Toward three o'clock , they let the women out of the cells to walk around . Some of the women came down the block and talked to the men through the bars . Some of them even laughed and joked . Three-thirty , the guard locked them up and let the men out . From the way the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . I did n't want to go anywhere , either , because I did n't want people asking me a pile of questions . Hattie went out to stretch , but few minutes later he came and laid back down . He was grumbling about some man on the block trying to get fresh with him . " Some of them think you 'll stoop to anything , " he said . I looked out of the window at the sky . I could n't see too much , but I liked what I could see . I liked the sun , too . I had n't ever liked the sun before , but I liked it now . I felt my throat getting tight , and I turned my head . Toward four o'clock , Unc ' Toby came on the block withp147dinner . For dinner , we had stew , mashed potatoes , lettuce and tomatoes . The stew was too soupy ; the mashed potatoes was too soupy ; the lettuce and tomatoes was too soggy . Dessertwas three or four dried-up prunes with black water poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard locked up the cell . By the time we finished eating , they was back there again to pick up the trays . I laid on my bunk , looking up at the window . Flow long I had been there ? No more than about twelve hours . Twelve hours  --  but it felt like three days , already . They knowed how to get a man down . Because they had me now . No matter which way I went  --  plantation or pen  --  they had me . That 's why Medlow was n't in any hurry to get me out . You do n't have to be in any hurry when you already know you got a man by the nuts . Look at the way they did Jack . Jack was a man , a good man . Look what they did him . Let a fifteen-cents Cajun bond him out of jail  --  a no-teeth , dirty , overall-wearing Cajun get him out . Then they broke him . Broke him down to nothing  --  to a grinning , bowing fool . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Work , play ball , run women  --  anything . They knowed we loved him , that 's why they did him that . Broke him  --  broke him the way you break a wild horse . . . . Now everybody laughs at him . Gamble with him and cheat him . He know you cheating him , but he do n't care  --  just do n't care any more .. . Where is my father ? Why my mama had to die ? Why they brought me here and left me to struggle like this ? I used to love my mama so much . Her skin was light brown ; her hair was silky . I used to watch her powdering her face in the glass . I used to always cry when she went out  --  and be glad when she came back because she always brought me candy . But you gone for good now , Mama ; and I got nothing in this world but me . A man in the other cell started singing . I listened to himp148and looked up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lighter blue now  --  gray-blue almost . The sun went down , a star came out . For a while it was the only star ; then some more came to join it . I watched all of them . Then I watched just a few , then just one . I shut my eyes and opened them and tried to find the star again . I could n't find it . I was n't too sure which one it was . I could 've pretended and choosed either one , but I did n't want lie to myself . I do n't believe in lying to myself . I do n't believe in lying to nobody else , either . I believe in being straight with a man . And I want a man to be straight with me . I would n't ' a ' picked up that bottle for nothing if that nigger had n't pulled his knife . Not for nothing . Because I do n't believe in that kind of stuff . I believe in straight stuff . But a man got to protect himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat . If I did n't know where the one was I was looking at at first , I was n't go'n say I did . I picked out another one , one that was n't too much in a cluster . I measured it off from the bars in the window , then I shut my eyes . When I opened them , I found the star right away . And I did n't have to cheat , either . The lights went out on the block . I got up and took a leak and got back on my bunk . I got in the same place I was before and looked for the star . I found it right away . It was easier to find now because the lights was out . I got tired looking at it after a while and looked at another one . The other one was much more smaller and much more in a cluster . But I got tired of it after a while , too . I thought about Munford . He said if they did n't get you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't suck all the manhood out of you in the cradle , they made you use it on people you did n't love . I never messed with a woman I did n't love . I always loved all these women I ever messed with . . . . No , I did n't love them . Because I did n't love her last night  --  I just wanted to fuck her . And I do n't think I ever loved Marie , either . Marie just had the best pussy in the world . Shep149had the best  --  still got the best . And that 's why I went to her , the only reason I went . Because God knows she do n't have any kind a face to make you come at her .. . Maybe I ai n't never loved nobody . Maybe I ai n't never loved nobody since my mama died . Because I loved her , I know I loved her . But the rest  --  no , I never loved the rest . They do n't let you love them . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to stop thinking . That 's how you go crazy  --  thinking . But what else can you do in a place like this  --  what ? I wish I knowed somebody . I wish I knowed a good person . I would be good if I knowed a good person . I swear to God I would be good . All of a sudden the lights came on , and I heard them bringing in somebody who was crying . They was coming toward the cell where I was ; the person was crying all the way . Then the cell door opened and they throwed him in there and they locked the door again . I did n't look up  --  I would n't raise my head for nothing . I could tell nobody else was looking up , either . Then the footsteps faded away and the lights went out again . I raised my head and looked at the person they had throwed in there . He was nothing but a little boy  --  fourteen or fifteen . He had on a white shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up off the floor and laid him on the bunk under me . Then he sat on the bunk ' side the boy . The boy was still crying . " Shhh now , shhh now , " Hattie was saying . It was just like a woman saying it . It made me sick a ' the stomach . " Shhh now , shhh now , " he kept on saying . I swung to the floor and looked at the boy . Hattie was sitting on the bunk , passing his hand over the boy 's face . " What happened ? " I asked him . He was crying too much to answer me . " They beat you ? " I asked him . P150He could n't answer . " A cigarette ? " I said . " No  --  no -- sir , " he said . I lit one , anyhow , and stuck it in his mouth . He tried to smoke it and started coughing . I took it out . " Shhh now , " Hattie said , patting his face . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one of them is a man . A bunch of pigs  --  dogs  --  philistines . " " You hurt ? " I asked the boy . " Sure , he 's hurt , " Hattie said . " Just look at his clothes , how they beat him . The bunch of dogs . " I went to the door to call the guard . But I stopped ; I told myself to keep out of this . He ai n't the first one they ever beat and he wo n't be the last one , and getting in it will just bring you a dose of the same medicine . I turned around and looked at the boy . Hattie was holding the boy in his arms and whispering to him . I hated what Hattie was doing much as I hated what the law had done . " Leave him alone , " I said to Hattie . " The child needs somebody , " he said . " You 're going to look after him ? " " What happened ? " I asked the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They did n't beat you for nothing , boy . " He was quiet now . Hattie was patting the side of his face and his hair . " What they beat you for ? " I asked him . " I took something . " " What you took ? " " I took some cakes . I was hungry . " " You got no business stealing , " I said . " Some people got no business killing , but it do n't keep them from killing , " Hattie said.  |p151He  started rocking the boy in his arms the way a woman rocks a child . " Why do n't you leave him alone ? " I said . He would n't answer me . He kept on . " You hear me , whore ? " " I might be a whore , but I 'm not a merciless killer , " he said . I started to crack him side the head , but I changed my mind . I had already raised my fist to hit him , but I changed my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walking . I walked , I walked , I walked . Then I stood at the head of the bunk and look up at the window at the stars . Where was the one I was looking at a while back ? I smoked on the cigarette and looked for it  --  but where was it ? I threw the cigarette in the toilet and lit another one . I smoked and walked some more . The rest of the place was quiet . Nobody had said a word since the guards throwed that little boy in the cell . Like a bunch of roaches , like a bunch of mites , they had crawled in they holes and pulled the cover over they head . All of a sudden I wanted to scream . I wanted to scream to the top of my voice . I wanted to get them bars in my hands and I wanted to shake , I wanted to shake that door down . I wanted to let all these people out . But would they follow me  --  would they ? Y'all go'n follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ran to my bunk and bit down in the cover . I bit harder , harder , harder . I could taste the dry sweat , the dry piss , the dry vomit . I bit harder , harder , harder . . . I got on the bunk . I looked out at the stars . A million little white , cool stars was out there . I felt my throat hurting . I felt the water running down my face . But I gripped my mouth tight so I would n't make a sound . I did n't make a sound , but I cried . I cried and cried and cried.  |p152I  knowed I was going to the pen now . I knowed I was going , I knowed I was going . Even if Medlow came to get me , I was n't leaving with him . I was go'n do like Munford said . I was going there and I was go'n sweat it and I was go'n take it . I did n't want have to pull cover over my head every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to stand . Because they never let you stand if they got you out . They did n't let Jack stand  --  and I had never heard of them letting anybody else stand , either . I felt good . I laid there feeling good . I felt so good I wanted to sing . I sat up on the bunk and lit a cigarette . I had never smoked a cigarette like I smoked that one . I drawed deep , deep , till my chest got big . It felt good . It felt good deep down in me . I jumped to the floor feeling good . " You want a cigarette ? " I asked the boy . I spoke to him like I had been talking to him just a few minutes ago , but it was over an hour . He was laying in Hattie'sarms quiet like he was half asleep . " No , sir , " he said . I had already shook the cigarette out of the pack . " Here , " I said . " No , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to your own bunk , " I said to Hattie . " And who do you think you are to be giving orders ? " I grabbed two handsful of his shirt and jerked him up and slammed him ' cross the cell . He hit against that bunk and started crying  --  just laying there , holding his side and crying like a woman . After a while he picked himself up and got on that bunk . " Philistine , " he said . " Dog  --  brute . " When I saw he was n't go'n act a fool and try to hit me , I turned my back on him . " Here , " I said to the boy.  | " I do n't smoke  --  please , sir . " " You big enough to steal ? " I said . " You 'll smoke it or you 'll eat it . " I lit it and pushed it in his mouth . " Smoke it . He smoked and puffed it out . I sat down on the bunk ' side him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us , holding his side and crying . " Hold that smoke in , " I said to the boy . He held it in and started coughing . When he stopped coughing I told him to draw again . He drawed and held it , then he let it out . I knowed he was n't doing it right , but this was his first time , and I let him slide . " If Medlow come to get me , I 'm not going , " I said to the boy . " That means T. J. and his boys coming , too . They go'n beat me because they think I 'm a smart aleck trying to show them up . Now you listen to me , and listen good . Every time they come for me I want you to start praying . I want you to pray till they bring me back in this cell . And I do n't want you praying like a woman , I want you to pray like a man . You do n't even have to get on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pray quiet and to yourself . You hear me ? " He did n't know what I was talking about , but he said , " Yes , sir , " anyhow . " I do n't believe in God , " I said . " But I want you to believe . I want you to believe He can hear you . That 's the only way I 'll be able to take those beatings  --  with you praying . You understand what I 'm saying ? " " Yes , sir . " " You sure , now ? " " Yes , sir . " I drawed on the cigarette and looked at him . Deep in me I felt some kind of love for this little boy . " You got a daddy ? " I asked him.  | " Yes , sir . " " A mama ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then how come you stealing ? " " ' Cause I was hungry . " " Do n't they look after you ? " " No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " " You like it in here ? " " No , sir . I was hungry . " " Let 's wash your back , " I said . We got up and went to the facebowl . I helped him off with his shirt . His back was cut from where they had beat him . " You know Munford Bazille ? " I asked him . " Yes , sir . He do n't live too far from us . He kin to you ? " " No , he 's not kin to me . You like him ? " " No , sir , I do n't like him . He stay in fights all the time , and they always got him in jail . " " That 's how you go'n end up . " " No , sir , not me . ' Cause I ai n't coming back here no more . " " I better not ever catch you in here again , " I said . " Hold onto that bunk  --  this might hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them bruises . " " Do n't mash too hard . " " Shut up , " I told him , " and hold on . " I wet my handkerchief and dabbed at the bruises . Every time I touched his back , he flinched . But I did n't let that stop me . I washed his back good and clean . When I got through , I told him to go back to his bunk and lay down . Then I rinched out his shirt and spread it out on the foot of myp155bunk . I took off my own shirt and rinched it out because it was filthy . I lit a cigarette and looked up at the window . I had talked big , but what was I going to do when Medlow came ? Was I going to change my mind and go with him ? And if I did n't go with Medlow , I surely had to go with T. J. and his boys . Was I going to be able to take the beatings night after night ? I had seen what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it on this kid and I had seen it on other people . Was I going to be able to take it ? I do n't know , I thought to myself . I 'll just have to wait and see .   " No , " she said . " No more than I expected from him , " I thought to myself . ' Malia turned around and looked back toward the gate . " That little incline getting steeper and steeper , " she said . " It get little steeper every day now , ' Malia , " I said . " Yes , Lord , " she said . It was n't much of a incline . To them children who came to the yard to pick figs and pecans , it was n't a incline at all . They could run it just like running on flat ground . But when you got old as she was  --  she was seventy-two , I was seventy  --  everything looked like a incline . Even walking downhill looked like a incline . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking toward the house now . But she still did n't move , just standing there looking at the house behind the trees . You could n't see much of the house for the moss hanging on the trees . " How is he in there ? " I asked her . " Same , " she said . " He did n't come out yesterday . " " He was n't feeling too strong , " she said . " You think this the last go round , ' Malia ? " " I hope not , " she said . She spoke like she was very , very tired . " If it is , God pity every last one of us . " " She 'll really let them Cajuns take over , wo n't she ? " " Wo n't she , " ' Malia said . " If Copper was white , then this plantation would go to him , not to her , " I was thinking to myself . " But he 's the wrong color to go round claiming plantations . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked ' Malia . " No , " she said . " You told him Mr. Frank wanted to see him ? " " I told him , " she said , looking up at me . I could see she was worried and scared . " Not that back door , ' he said . Notp159I figured it was about time she was coming to work , so I went to the door to look out for her . There she was , pushing the gate open and coming in the yard . She had on her long gray dress and the blue gingham apron . The apron was almost long as the dress and almost the same color  --  she had washed it so many times . She had on her big yellow straw hat , and I could see piece of the white rag on her head sticking out from under the hat . I stood in the shop door with a file and a plowshare and watched ' Malia come up the walk . She walked slow and tired , like any moment she might stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that big pecan tree , she raised her head and looked toward the tool shop . She knowed I 'd be standing there . " Making it on up , huh ? " I said . " Trying to , " she said , and stopped to catch her breath . Every morning when she came up to the yard like this , she stopped and we had a few words . Sometimes I went out in the yard where she was , sometimes I talked with her from the door . This morning I went out there because I wanted to ask her about that boy . I still had the file and the plowshare in my hand . " I see Copper did n't come with you , " I said.  |p161that  back door ? ' I said . I been going through that back door nigh on fifty years , Copper . ' That 's not for me , ' he said . What would my soldiers say if they caught me going through a back door ? ' " ' Malia looked at me a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worried and scared . " Soldiers , ' Malia ? " I said . " His soldiers ? " " Something disturbing Copper , Felix , " she said . " When he talk he do n't look right . He looking at you , but he ai n't seeing you . This morning we was talking at the table , but he was n't hearing me . He was just sitting there , looking out that door , looking far ' way . " " This part about the soldiers , " I said ; " you sure he said soldiers ? " " He said soldiers , " she said . Then she started crying . I held the file and the plowshare in one hand , and I put my other arm round her shoulders . " Here , " I said . " Here , now . " " I do n't know what 's the matter , " she said . " God knows , I did all I could . " " Why 'd he come back here , ' Malia ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with the palm of her hand and shook her head . " He did n't tell you ? " " No , " she said . " He just talk . " " About what , ' Malia ? " " The earth for everybody . Just like the sun for everybody . Just like the stars for everybody . " " You think he got anything in mind ? " " Do n't talk like that , Felix . " " They doing that everywhere else , ' Malia . Everywhere else but here . " " That 's not it , " she said . " That ca n't be it . God knows , Ip162do n't hope to see that day . " She looked toward the house again . " I better get on up there , " she said . " Feel like I just want drop . I just want lay down and rest . " " Why do n't you go back home , ' Malia ? I 'll take word you do n't feel good . " " No , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be too much longer . " I watched her go toward the house . She was walking slow , with her head down . After she went in the little yard , I could n't see her again till she went up the back stairs . It took her so long to go up the stairs , I thought she had sat down to rest . Then I saw her pulling open the screen door and going in . I went back to the shop and filed on my plowshare . Nobodytold me to do things like that , but since I lived on the man 's place and did n't have to pay rent , and since I did n't have nothing else to do but lay round the house if I stayed home , I came up there every day and worked to keep myself busy . While I was in the shop , I thought about that boy in the quarters . I thought about his mon and his paw , Walter Laurent . That was one , that Walter . A black woman , no matterwho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted her . He did n't care if it was in the field , in the quarters , the store or that house ; when he got his dick up , he hopped on any of them . But them days are gone now , just like he 's gone . That black stallion saw to that . After I finished my plowshare , I hung it against the wall with all the other things . I had a little bit of everythingthere  --  cane knives , axes , shovels , hoes , scy ' blades , yo-yo blades , clod-chopper discs  --  anything you cared to name , I had it . Every time I found something kind of rusty and needed working over , I brought it to the shop and cleaned it up . Once , there , this was my special job . From Monday morningP163till Saturday night , my job was to keep everything in good shape to work in the field . Ah , but that was long , long ago . Now all the old ones are dying , and the young ones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more every year . So I came up to the yard now just to keep the old hands busy . Because once the hands had stopped , the man was n't no more . I had n't been in the shop more than half an hour when I heard that yellow gal , Dee-Dee , calling me out there in the yard . I went to the door to see what she wanted . " He want you in there , " she said , pointing toward the house . " Who want me where ? " I said . " Mr. Frank , " she said , pointing . I went back in the shop to put up the hammer I had been working with , then I came back out there where she was . She was standing in a clump of bull grass waiting for me . That little white dress she wore was n't just short , it was so thin you could see drawers and everything else under it . " What 's he want in there ? " I asked her . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out here and find you . " " Ai n't Stateman in there ? " " He in there begging with his clean-head self , " she said . " You ought to give Stateman what he want , " I said . " Make yourself a nice little piece of change . " " Huh , " she said . " Bet he die ' fore I let him crawl on top of me . " We went through the little gate and up the back stairs . Dee-Dee stopped in the kitchen and told me to go on to the dining room . Frank Laurent was sitting at the table eating breakfast when I came in there . He was dressed in his purple silk robe . He looked awful sick and weak that morning . Frank was in his late sixties . He had suffered a heart at/tack about five years ago , and the doctor told him he had to hire a ' overseer or give this place over to his niece to operate . He hired the overseer like the doctor said , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage the place by himself again and suffered another attack . The doctor told him the next one could kill him . So he hired another overseer , and this one was still there . The trouble was , though , the overseer had little to do with running the place outside of keeping a ' eye on the Cajuns to make sure they did n't cheat Frank out of everything . He did n't have any say-so over the colored people in the quarters ( since they was n't sharecropping ) , and the only time he ever came up to the house was when Frank sent for him , and Frank sent for him least as he could . Frank was the last of the old Laurents . When he died , the place was going to fall to his niece there in Bayonne . Besides the overseer and the doctor , his niece was the only other white person to come to the house . Every time she came there she told Frank he ought to go to the hospital where the doctorscould give him the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowed that all she wanted was to get him out of that house so she could take over . After she did that , that was going to be the end of us . We was going to have to pay rent or we was going to have to leave . I doubt if half of the people on the place could do either one . " You sent for me , Mr. Frank ? " I said . He did n't even look at me . He went on eating like I was n't even there . ' Malia came in with a cup of coffee . She had taken off her straw hat , but she still had the white rag on her head . She put the cup of coffee in front of Frank , then she stood behind the chair looking at me and shaking her head . I could tell they had had some kind of squabble before I came in . " Go get that boy , " Frank said , pushing his plate back and pulling the cup in.  | " Sir ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He raised the cup to his mouth . I did n't move . " Are you deaf , Felix ? " he said . " Mr. Frank , I done already said Copper ai n't coming through that back door , " ' Malia said . " You shut up back there , " Frank said . " Well ? " he said to me . " ' Malia 's right , " I said . " What ? " Frank said . " Copper 's not coming through that back door , Mr. Frank , " I said . He looked straight in my eyes a long time , then he said : " You getting tired of this place , Felix ? Tired beating on that one piece of iron day in and day out ; year in and year out ? " " No sir , " I said . " You must be , " Frank said . " I 'd say you must be awful tired , Felix . " " Not a bit , " I said . " I just want you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , but he knowed I knowed all that hardness had gone . The plantation had taken all that hardnessout of him when the others died and left it there for him to manage . It was too heavy for him . When something 's too heavy , it makes most people wild animals or it breaks them . The land had broken Frank . It had aged him too fast . It had given him two heart attacks  --  and the next one was going to kill him . He knowed I knowed all of this . He knowed I knowed he was n't hard , he was helpless . But he was still the authority there , and when he spoke I was supposed to move . " You better get down the quarters , " he said . " Can I ask why , Mr. Frank ? " " Why ? " he said . " Why ? He 's on my place , that 's why . Any nigger on this place moves when I say move . He 's no different from any of the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frank did n't say anything . He raised the cup , and looked at me over the rim of the cup . " I 'll tell him you sent for him , " I said . " Who I 'm suppose to say ? " " You forgot my name , Felix ? " " No sir . I just thought you might want me to say his uncle , though . " " You pushing your luck , Felix , you know that , do n't you ? " I nodded . " I reckon so . " I looked at ' Malia standing behind the chair , and I could see she wanted to cry again . I went out in the hall ; there was Stateman with his head shining and his eyes rolling . He wanted to know what was happening in the dining room . When I told him to go in there and ask Frank himself , he looked at me real hard and turned away . He was Frank 's butler , he had been there ever since Frank suffered his first heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost long as Frank had been there , and he told us more than he ever told anybody else . And that 's why he never scared me . I obeyed his orders because I respected him ; not because I was scared of him . ' Malia 's house was the first one in the quarters , a little 3 o gray house that had n't been painted in ages . She had two little chinaball trees and a mulberry tree in the front yard . In the morning , the trees had shade on the gallery . In the evening , the sun was behind the house , so ' Malia still had shade on the gallery . Hot as it was now , you needed shade or you could n't sit outside at all . Before I got to the house , I could see that boy standing on the gallery looking at me . When I got closer I saw he was dressed all in khakis . He even had on brown Army shoes  --  thep167shoes shining like new tin . I unhooked the gate and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . I did n't even make a ' tempt to go up the steps . That boy 's face stopped me : his eyes stopped me . His eyes looked hard as marble . I 'm sure he knowed why I was there even before I opened my mouth . " Mr. Frank want you to come visit him , " I said from the ground . He did n't say anything  --  just standing there in that Army uniform , looking down at me . He looked more like Walter Laurent than Walter ever looked like himself . Tall , slim , with a long face just like Walter . Only difference was , he was brown with curly black hair ; his paw was white with straight brown hair . " Go back and tell my uncle Generals do n't go through back doors , " he said . " Tell him what ? " He did n't say any more , he just looked at me . He looked at me the same way any the other Laurents would ' a ' looked at me . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' looked at me if he had told me to do something and I had asked him what . You did n't ask a Laurent what ; you did what the Laurent said . " You 're his adjutant , are n't you ? " he said . " His what ? " He gived me that Laurent look again . For a few seconds he might ' a ' been thinking about something else : I was so little in his sight . " His runner ? " he said . " He told me to come find you , and that 's all I know . " " No one comes for the General , " he said . Then soon as he said it he was n't looking at me any more , he was looking past me , his eyes hard as marble . I did n't know what to do after that . I did n't know if I ought to speakp168to him again or turn around and go back to the house . I lowered my head a second , and when I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil out of his Army shirt pocket . ( The uniform was starched and pressed with all the creases . I 'm sure this was the first time he had put it on since he got it out the cleaners . ) He started writing with his left hand fast , just like Walter . He wrote about a minute . When he got through , he folded the piece of paper and held it out toward me . He did n't reach it out  --  I mean he did n't bend over and handed it to me ; he just held it out . I went up the steps to get it , and my hand was shaking . After I had gone out of the yard and had hooked the gate back , I looked up at him again . He was n't looking at me now , he was looking down the quarters . But from the way his face was set , I doubt if he was seeing a thing . When I got back to the house , I pulled the kitchen door open real quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to feel up that yellow gal . He jumped back when he saw me and made ' tend he was n't doing anything . " You want me to give Mr. Frank a message or something ? " he asked . " No , that 's all right , " I said . " Just go on and try to get what you was trying to get before I came in . Mr. Frank and ' Malia still in the dining room ? " I asked Dee-Dee . " And what I was trying to get ? " Stateman said . " They in the library , " Dee-Dee said . " Do n't get things mixed up round here , now , " Stateman said . " If I was trying to get something you say I was trying to get , I would n't need a thing like you to tell me I was trying to get it . " I left him there and went up the hall to the library.  |p169'Malia  was sitting in one corner sewing a dress ; Frank was in another corner reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp . The big window between them was opened , but a tree outside the window always kept the room dark and cool . Frank looked up from his book and squinted his eyes when he did n't see Copper standing there with me . " He sent you this , " I said , carrying him the note . Frank looked straight in my face all the time I was walkingtoward him . Even after he took the note , he still looked at me a long time before he lowered his eyes to read it . His face did n't change once all the time he was reading . He must ' a ' read it two or three times before he looked up again . " You wrote this , Felix ? " he said . He must ' a ' been joking . I had n't written a letter in my life , and he knowed that . " Me ? " I said . " I see , " he said . " You got him to do it . " But he did n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of anything else to say . He said it because Copper had sent him a note instead of coming here himself . " All I did was tell him what you said , " I said . " He did the rest . " " Sure , " he said . He knowed that 's what had happened , but he did n't know Copper , and so he had to put it on me . He looked down at the note . " My Dear Uncle , ' " he said . He kept his eyes on the note another second , then he looked up at me . " He calls me Dear Uncle . ' " I shifted my feet a little , but I did n't say anything . Frank squinted up at me , with his mouth twisted a little to the side . He did this probably half a minute , then he looked down at the note again.  | " ' My Dear Uncle , ' " he said . He passed the tips of his finger and his thumb over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . " My Dear Uncle , ' " he said again . " Let us speak General to General , gentleman to gentleman , Laurent to Laurent . I am sure you did not understand my position as a General , as a leader of men , when you invited me to your house through the back door . I believe you had in mind one of your slaves in the quarters , or one of your Cajun sharecroppers on the river ; but not me . If I thought you meant that invitation , I would tell you , without hesitation , where to put that back door . But I am sure you did not mean it , therefore I have forgotten about it . If you wish to send me any other messages  --  an apology , or an invitation to speak to me as a General , as a Laurent , you can send the message to me in the quarters . I shall be there reconnoitering the area . Your respectful kin , General Christian Laurent . ' " Frank kept his head down another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Then he squinted up at me and twisted his mouth slightly to the left . " Is this boy crazy , or do you all think it was time you took over ? " " Took over ? " I said . " I do n't know what you talking about , Mr. Frank . " " Who sent for Copper ? " " Sent for him ? Nobody sent for Copper , " I said . " Nobody knowed where that boy was since his mon died there . " He knowed I was telling him the truth , but he wanted me to believe he thought different . " This General  --  what does he mean by General ? And Laurent  --  does n't he know better than to say things like that round here ? " " I just brought the note , " I said . " And you 're innocent as a baby , huh , Felix ? You want me to believe that ? " " Believe what you want , Mr. Frank , " I said . " I didn'tp171have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting smart with me , Felix ? " " No sir , " I said , and I lowered my eyes . " And you ? " I heard him asking ' Malia . Now he had to bring her in it , too . " How innocent are you ? " " Mr. Frank , till Copper showed up here yesterday , I had n't seen him or heard from him in ten years . Since his mon died . " " So everybody is innocent , is that it ? " he said . " That nigger comes here calling himself a Laurent , calling himself a General , walking over my place like he owns it  --  and everybody is innocent ? I 'm supposed to believe that ? " It was quiet in the room while Frank looked at me and ' Malia . " Felix , go over to that store and get me two of the biggest niggers you can find , " he said . " Saturday , there ought to be a dozen of them over there . " There was n't a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them there . Frank , Alcie and TomTomwas playing cards on the end of the gallery . Pool-Doo , Crowley and Simon was drinking soda water under that big pecan tree in front of Mr. Pichot house . Joby and Little Boy was sitting on the steps talking . Mr. Pichot , the old Cajun who ran the store , sat by the door in his chair . He had the chair cocked back against the wall , and his feet was n't touching the floor . " Little Boy , you and Joby , Mr. Frank want y'all , " I said , after I had spoke to everybody . " Who  --  us  --  for what ? " Little Boy said . " What we done ? " " Come on , " I said . " Lord , have mercy , " Little Boy said . " Now , what ? People ca n't even rest round here on Saturday . " They followed me round the store back to the house.  |p172Little  Boy was grumbling all the way ; Joby was keeping quiet . When we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . I supposed he had been trying to feel up that yellow gal again . " What 's this ? " she said , when she saw Little Boy and Joby . " How I 'm supposed to know , " Little Boy said . " They do n't tell nobody nothing . " Dee-Dee started laughing , and we left her back there laughing . I knocked on the library door , and when ' Malia told us to come in , I nodded for Little Boy and Joby to go in first . Little Boy and Joby , both of them with their hats in their hands , stood before Frank Laurent like two little children . ' Malia , in her corner , went on sewing like nothing was happening . Poor ' Malia was so tired , and she had seen so much foolishness , things like this did n't bother her much any more . " You two niggers stay on my place ? " Frank asked . " Course we do , Mr. Frank , " Little Boy said . " You know us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The only thing I know is that somebody'srunning round this place telling me where I can put that back door , and I  --  " " No sir , no sir , " Little Boy said . " I did n't say that  --  I did n't . But Joby , he could ' a ' . ' Cause just like you see him standing there , Joby got a big mouth . I done told Joby , I done told Joby  --  I said , Joby , mind your mouth ; mind your mouth , boy , or one of these good days it go'n get you in a lot of trouble . ' I told him that no later than , I think , last Sunday . " He turned to Joby . " Did n't I tell you that ? " " I do n't ' member you telling me nothing , " Joby said . " I did tell you that , Joby . " " You did n't , " Joby said . " ' Cause I did n't see you Sunday . I seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Little Boy said . " I knowed it was one of them days . "  | " Where you told me that at ? " Joby said . " Where ? At the fair ? At the road ? In Bayonne ? Where ? The store ? " " In one of them places , " Little Boy said . " I ca n't ' membereverything . " " You ai n't told me nothing , " Joby said . He turned toward Frank , and I could see he wanted to cry . " Mr. Frank , I swear by my mama Little Boy ai n't told me nothing . " Frank had been squinting up at them all the time they stood there squabbling . Even after they quit , he still looked at them a long time before he said anything . " You two mind if I go on now ? " he said . Little Boy looked at Frank , but Joby lowered his head . He was waiting to hear the punishment Frank was going to give him . " Either of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nephew ? " Little Boy said , pointing toward ' Malia in the corner . " Yes sir , I know him . He 's down the quarters right now . " " Go down there and bring him back up here , " Frank said . " I do n't want any scars on him , I do n't want any broken bones , but I want him up here . " " Yes sir , " Little Boy said . Then he turned to ' Malia . " Hope that 's all right with you , Miss Amalia ? " " What did you ask her ? " Frank said . " I was just telling Miss Amalia over there I hope it 's all right with her if  --  " Little Boy stopped . " You 're asking her if it 's all right when I told you to do something ? " Frank asked him . " I would n't want do nothing she might not  --  " Little Boy stopped again before he finished . " Do like Mr. Frank say , " ' Malia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , " Frank said . " Who the hell 's running this place , me or Amalia ? " " I guess you , Mr. Frank , " Little Boy said.  | " You guess , nigger ? " Frank said . " You guess ? " Little Boy lowered his head , but Frank kept on looking at him . Then all of a sudden his face changed . Like only now he re'lized , maybe he was n't running the place . Maybe somebodyelse was running it after all . Or , maybe nobody was running it . Maybe it was just running down . " Get out of here , " he said . " Yes sir , " Little Boy said . " Joby , come on . " They went out . I started to follow them , but Frank stopped me . I turned toward him with my cap in my hand . " This whole place gone mad ? " he said . I did n't answer him . " You hear me talking to you , Felix , goddamn it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank , " I said . " It ai n't no more like it used to be , that 's all . " " What you 're trying to say is that I 'm not running this place any more ? You and Amalia are ? " " Nobody 's running the place , Mr. Frank , " I said . " TheCajuns sharecropping it , and the overseer seeing that  --  " " I 'm running it , damn you , " he said . " I 'm running it . " I nodded . " Yes sir . " Then that look came on his face again . " I 'm not running nothing , " it said . " They know I 'm not running nothing ; I know I 'm not running nothing . " " Why did they have to leave me here ? " he said out loud . " Why did I have to be the one to stay ? " " Now , stop that , " ' Malia said . " Why ? " he said again . " Why ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dump it on my lap ? " " You have relatives there , " ' Malia said . " She 'd be glad to take it off your hands . " " Is that what you all want , for her to take it over ? " he asked ' Malia . He looked at ' Malia a while , but she went onp175sewing . " Is that what you want ? " he said . " And do you know what 'll happen then ? She would kick you off the place before I was cold in my grave . She would let the Cajuns plow up the ground where your houses are now . And that cemetery back there , what do you think 'll happen to it ? Do you think she would hesitate a moment before she plowed that under too ? Do you have another plot of land picked out for the bones , Amalia ? Now , do you know why I go on ? " " Vexing yourself like that wo n't let you go on much longer , " ' Malia said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Frank said . " Until your nephew got here , Amalia . " " Us nephew , " ' Malia said softly , with her head down . " What did you say ? " Frank asked her . " What did you say , Amalia ? " She kept her head down ; she did n't answer him . " I heard you , " Frank said . " You joining Felix and that nigger , too , huh ? " ' Malia raised her head and looked at him . " Ai n't that 's why you want Copper here , Mr. Frank ? " she said . " That nigger is on my place , " Frank said . " Any nigger on my place comes to my house when I say come . " " Look like Mr. Walter got plenty more round here nobodyai n't been sending for , " ' Malia said . Frank got whiter . ' Malia had never talked to him like that before . If she was n't so tired , and if Copper had n't had her so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' talked like that now . Frank raised his hand real slowly , then he pushed it inside the robe quickly and rubbed his chest . He was breathing fast and hard , like he was trying to catch his breath . ' Malia jumped up from the chair and ran to him . " You all right ? " she asked him . " You all right ? You want your pills ? You want the doctor ? Mr. Frank ? Mr. Frank , you hear me ? "  |p176He  did n't answer her . His head was bowed . He rubbed his chest hard as he could . " Mr. Frank ? " ' Malia said . She turned to me . " Felix ? " " Sit down , " Frank said , out of breath . He never raised his head . " Sit down . " ' Malia moved back to her chair , but she did n't sit down . I just stood there watching . I did n't know what to do . After a while , Frank raised his head and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked her . " What 's the matter , Amalia ? Did you hear the tractors knocking over the house ? " ' Malia sat back down , but she kept on watching him . Frank rubbed his chest inside the robe . The room was absolutelyquiet all this time . " What does that nigger look like ? " Frank asked me . " Who , Copper ? " I said . Because I was still thinking about what had just happened . And I could hear the tractors knockingover the houses and plowing up the graves . " Who do you think I 'm talking about , Felix ? " " He 's a tall , slim boy , " I said . " He 's a tall , slim boy , ' " Frank said , mocking me . " He 's a tall , slim boy . ' Does he have hands ? Is he green ? Does he speak Russian ? " " He 's brown , " I said . " Gray eyes . A long face . He writes with his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand , he ca n't come through that back door ? " I did n't answer him . " Well ? " he said . " That 's why he wo n't come through that back door , Mr. Frank , " I said . " He 'll come through that back door , and he 'll be glad to come through that back door , " Frank said . " You can go back to your hammering now . " " Thank you , " I said , and turned to leave.  | " That one piece of iron ought to be thin as a razor blade by now , " Frank said . I faced him again . " It 's not the same piece , " I said . " I got all that old stuff there . " " You 've never told me why you stay in there so much , " he said , squinting up at me . " Maybe some day somebody 'll use it again , " I said . " And who may that somebody be ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Frank , " I said . " Maybe it will beCopper . " " Yes , maybe it will be Copper , Felix , " Frank said . " But I 'll be in my grave before that day comes . " I went to the store to get me a pack of tobacco , then I : went back to the shop . I had done no more than picked up my file when I heard that yellow gal calling me out there again . When I got to the door , I saw her standing out there with a basket of clothes in her arms . She was on her way from the clothesline . " Now , what ? " I said . " Samson been calling you , " she said . " Samson ? " I said . " What  --  " " Yonder , " she said , pointing with the basket . " Look like he got Joby and Little Boy tied together . " Joby and Little Boy faced the gate like a pair of mules or a pair of oxen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding something behind them , but I did n't know what it was till I got closer . Then I saw it was the end of a trace chain , with the other end wrapped around both Joby and Little Boy . The first thing to come to my mind was a bad dog or a bull . " Yes , a bull , " I thought ; " a bull . Ben 's bull . He got out the pasture and took after them . When they saw him coming , they tried to get under Samson 's wire fence , but thep178fence was too low . But , wait , " I thought . " Wait , now . I can see a bull running you under a wire fence and making you rip half your clothes off , but where would that bull get a chain from ? " Then Samson told me : Copper . " Sure , sure , " I thought . " Copper . " Only it had n't darted my mind that one human being would do that to two more of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gived me the end of the trace chain he was holding . Copper had tied their hands behind their back with their own belts . " Maybe this 'll convince him he do n't want come up here , " I said to Samson . " I do n't know ' bout him , but I 'm sure you could n't pay these here to go mess with him again , " Samson said . " I done seen some fighting in my days , but I ai n't never seen none like that young man can put up . Biff , boll ; 000f , offf . You got to be possessed to fight like that . " " Let 's go , " I said to Joby and Little Boy . " Thanks , Sam-son . " " My pleasure , " Samson said . " He paid me a quarter to bring them up here . Yes , you got to be possessed to fight like that . Boff , biff . Doggonest thing I ever seen in my life . " We started toward the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that basket of clothes . When we came closer to her , she started laughing . She laughed so hard , she dumped half of the clothes out of the basket on the grass . Stateman met us at the door ; he said he did n't know if he could allow us to come in there , seeing the way we was looking . I pushed him to the side and nodded for Joby and Little Boy to go on up the hall . I knocked on the door , and when ' Malia told us to come in , I let them go in first . ' Malia made a loud groan and throwed her hand up to her mouth when she saw Little Boy and Joby . But Frank'sp179expression did n't change . You would ' a ' thought Stateman had just brought him a cold glass of water and that was all . After he had looked at Joby and Little Boy , he looked at the trace chain that tied them together . He looked at it the way you look at something , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at something , but at the same time you thinking about something else . Then he looked at ' Malia . ' Malia a while , then Joby and Little Boy again , then me . I 'm sure he thought we was doing all this to either run him crazy or kill him . Then he probably thought maybe he ought to let us kill him . If we killed him , then he would n't have to go through the torment of keeping up this place day in and day out . He would be free of this place , free of us ( who , he said , he never wanted ) , and he would be free of all his pains . He covered his mouth to cough . Then he said pardon . " Sir ? " Little Boy asked , raising his head . " Pardon , ' " Frank said . " Yes sir , " Little Boy said , lowering his head again and jingling the chains . Now , it got quiet again . All this time , Frank was waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to explainsince we came in there . But I was waiting for him to ask me what had happened . He knowed what had happened , but he thought it was my place to start off first . Well , I was n't going to say a word till he opened his mouth . Then he could n't hold back any more . He looked at me like I was the cause for all of this . He knowed I was n't . He knowed it was Copper and just Copper . But since he could n't reach Copper , he had to accuse me . Like a man who beat his mule because his wife beat him ; or the man who go home and beat his child because the overseer cussed him out in the field . " Well , Felix ? " he said . " All right , Little Boy , " I said.  |p180Little  Boy started off , but Frank was n't looking at Little Boy , he was still looking at me  --  still accusing me . Sure , he knowed I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't touch Copper , he had to touch somebody else . It would ' a ' been ' Malia if I was n't there , but since I was , and since it was me who had brought the note from Copper , and since it was me who had brought Little Boy and Joby in there , then I had to be the one to blame. ... down there with that little brown tablet and that pencil , looking at Mr. Rufus old house , " Little Boy was saying . I looked at Little Boy again . His blue denim shirt looked like a line of ribbons . I 'm sure if Samson had n't told me what had happened , I would ' a ' thought somebody had put Little Boy in a pit with a bobcat . Only , the person had tied Little Boy 's hands behind his back and had told that bobcat to go to work on him . .. I went there and told him you wanted to see him , " Little Boy was saying , " but he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the house , he jumped the ditch and sighted ' long the fence , then he jumped back and writ some more on that little tablet . He looked down at the ditch a little while and even writ something ' bout it , too . " " After he had pulled up piece of that jimpson weed and chewed it , " Joby told Little Boy . Joby lowered his head again . Little Boy nodded . The chain jingled when either one of them moved . " Yeah , " Little Boy said . " After he had pulled up piece of that jimpson weed and tasted it , he writ something ' bout it in that little tablet . Bitter or sweet , I do n't know . Then after he got through there , he went down to Compaa house ... " Frank was looking at Little Boy , but you could see he was thinking about something else . Maybe he was thinking he was dreaming . Maybe he was thinking he was in a crazy house , or maybe he was dead and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him , but he just went right on writing , " Little Boy said . " Acting more like he was white  --  like he was Mr. Walter  --  " He stopped again . That was something he was n't ever supposed to say . Anybody in the world who had ever seen Walter Laurent and saw Copper could see that Walter Laurent was Copper 's paw . But you was n't supposed to ever say it . When Frank heard his brother 's name , his eyes shifted a little . He had been looking at Little Boy all this time , but he had n't been listening to him . But hearing Walter 's name woke him up . He started looking at Joby and Little Boy like it was just that moment he re'lized they was in the room . " Where did you meet the bears ? " he said . " B'ars , sir ? " Little Boy said . Frank nodded . " B'ars . " " Me and Joby ai n't met no b'ars nowhere , sir , " Little Boy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Boy and Joby looked at each other like two small children . They did n't know if to agree with Frank or not . To say yes , they met bears would ' a ' been a lie , and they could be punished . To say no , they did n't meet any bears would ' a ' been calling Frank a lie , and they could be punished for that , too . So they looked at each other , not saying a thing . For my part , all I wanted to do was laugh . " I sent you and Joby down the quarters to find Copper , " Frank said . " But Copper told both of you to go to hell . You did n't go to hell  --  no , you came back up here to tell me what Copper had said , and that 's when you met the two bears . One grabbed you and threw you down , the other one grabbed Joby and did him the same . They took off your belts , wore out your butts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't all . One of the bears happened to have a chain ' cross his shoulder . Where he got the chain from , we wo n't ques/tion . But he tied you and Joby together and sent you on your way . " Little Boy started shaking his head and giggling . " Mr. Frank , you too much , " he said . Frank looked at ' Malia sitting in the other chair . He was probably wondering if he ought to accuse her of helping me and Copper . ' Malia just sat there with her head bowed . Poor woman . " Me and Joby followed him down to Aunt Johnson after he got through writing up Compaa house , and I told him what you said again , " Little Boy said . " He did n't pay me no mind , he just went right on writing . Aunt Johnson sitting out there on that gallery , looking at him , not saying a word . Just sitting there shelling beans in that lard bucket and smoking that corb pipe . " Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing Little Boy , but he was thinking about something else . Probablywho Aunt Johnson was and what a corb pipe was . Then I could see , by the way his eyes shifted , he remembered Aunt Johnson was so and so  --  probably the old lady who used to come out to the store and argue with Mr. Pichot all the time . A corb pipe was probably a corn cob pipe . " When he got through with her house , he went on down to Samson , " Little Boy said . " It was there , in front of Samson , Joby , there , thought ' bout th'owing him down and toting him back up here . " Joby jerked up his head . " Me ? " he said . " Me ? How come it 's always me ? You the one say let 's th'ow him down and car ' him back up there . You the one . You . Not me . You . " " All right , I said it , " Little Boy said . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amalia . " ' Malia looked in his face and looked at his clothes . His blue denim shirt was a line of ribbons , little ribbons and big ones . A big chunk of cloth was ripped from his left pant leg , and you could see a big cut just under his knee . After ' Maliap183had looked at him a moment , she nodded her head to show him she understood , and she lowered her eyes again . " I tripped him over , " Little Boy went on . " He jumped back up quicker than any human being you ever seen and slammed into Joby . Two quick chops ' cross Joby shoulder blade with the side of his hand , and down went Joby . I tried to grab him again , but the first thing I knowed I was tangled in Samson wire fence . Joby got up to help me , and the next thing I knowed Joby was tangled there , too . " He made us untangle each other , then he made us take off us belts and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring him a chain or a rope . Samson leaned the broom ' gainst the wall and went out in the back yard and brought a chain like he said . He tied us together with the chain and gived Samson a quarter to bring us up here . The last thing I seen , he was sharpening that pencil again . " " How much did Copper pay you niggers to come back up here with that tale ? " Frank asked . " Pay us ? " Joby said , jerking up his head and jingling the chains . " Pay us ? He did n't pay nobody but Samson . " " How much is Felix paying you ? " Frank asked . Both of them looked at me like two scared children . Two men , both of them close to two hundred pounds , looking at me like two scared children . They did n't know what to say , what to think ; they turned to Frank again . " Do you know what Mr. Walter would have done with you two trifling niggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? " he said . " No sir , " Little Boy said . " He would have hanged one of you . Right out there in the yard . The other one would have gone back down there and brought Copper up here gently as a baby . " He looked at them a long time to let his words soak in . " Get out of here , " he said.  |p184They  turned to leave . I gived Little Boy the end of the chain I had been holding . They went out with the chain jingling . Frank looked at me again . " Go back to that store and get me six more , " he said . " Hot as it is  --  Saturday , too  --  you probably have the whole plantation over there drinking soda water . " " Why do n't you leave Copper ' lone , Mr. Frank , " ' Malia said . " If he do n't want come see you , I would n't force him . Leave him ' lone . " " Leave him alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place will I leave him alone . Get moving , you traitor . " " Mr. Frank , please , " ' Malia said . " Well ? " he said to me . " You the authority , " I said , and went out . " Is that any way to talk to Felix ? " I heard ' Malia saying through the door . " Is that any way to talk to Felix ? Who you got beside me and Felix , Mr. Frank ? Who ? " " Nobody , " I heard him saying . More of them had gathered round the store when I came over there . If they was n't laying on the gallery , they was standing under that big pecan tree to the side . All of them was talking about what had happened down the quarters . J. W. Hudson , that big-mouth boy of Aunt Jude Hudson , was leading the talk . He was showing everybody else what Little Boy and Joby had done wrong . They had gone on Copper wrong , he said . They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a ' just got him by surprise and brought him on back up the quarters . I sat on the end of the gallery , smoking a cigarette and listening to J. W. By the time I had finished my cigarette , I figured Mr. J. W. had convinced everybody out there hep185knowed the best way to capture Copper . I went over to the tree and told him Frank wanted him at the house . " Me ? For what ? " he said . " What I done ? " I did n't answer him . I counted out five more and told them to follow me . When we came back to the house , that yellow gal was standing by the kitchen table wrapping a bandage over Little Boy 's shoulder . She had bathed the scratches in Epsom-salt water , she had put salve on them , and now she was wrapping the shoulder with a piece of bar cloth . She had already fixed up Joby and he was standing to the side holding the trace chain . " I guess he trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Be still , " Dee-Dee said . " Letting one man beat two . Bet he could n't beat you eating . " I knocked on the library door , and when ' Malia answered , I nodded for J. W. and his gang to go in . When the last one had stepped inside , I moved in and shut the door . " You know why you 're here ? " Frank asked them . " Copper , sir ? " J. W. said . " Yes . Copper . You know he 's tough , do n't you ? " " No one man can beat no six , Mr. Frank ; I do n't care how tough he is , " J. W. said . " I hope you 're trying to convince me and not yourself , " Frank said . " I want him brought up here . I do n't care if you have to drag him from one end of the quarters to the other . If he get hooked in the fence , drag him through it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down the steps . But bring him back up here . Then stand him on his feet at the foot of those stairs . He will walk through that back door . " " He will , Mr. Frank , " J. W. said . " You do n't have to worry ' bout that . "  | " I 'm not worrying , " Frank said . " You worry if you do n't get him up here . " " He 'll be up here , sir . You can rest your mind on that . " Frank looked at J. W. a long time , like he wanted to be sure to remember him . J. W. could n't take Frank 's glaring at him , and he lowered his head . " What 's your name ? " Frank asked . J. W. raised his head . " I 'm J. W. , Mr. Frank , " he said , grinning . " Renton Hudson boy . " " How is Renton ? " " Papa dead , Mr. Frank . Been dead couple years now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded and grunted . " You can leave , " he said . " Yes sir , " J. W. said , and turned to the others . " Come on , fellows ; let 's go find that tush-hog . " They went out . I started to follow them , but Frank stopped me . " Go back there and tell that gal to fix you up some food , " he said . " Should be round your dinner time , should n't it ? " " Do n't b'lieve I 'm hungry , " I said . He wanted to make up for the way he had talked to me just before I went to get J. W. , and I wanted him to know it was n't going to be that easy . " Well , you might as well sit down over there , " he said . " I was thinking I ought to get back in the shop , " I said . " Since I ai n't done too much today , yet . " " Ca n't you stay a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beg you , too ? " " Sit down , Felix , " ' Malia said quietly . I went to the chair in the other corner , and I brushed off my pants before I sat down . It was the first time I had ever sat in the library , but I had sat in the living room two or three times when they had wakes there.  |p187It  was quiet in the room now . ' Malia went on stitching the dress . Frank went to the window to look out in the yard . Once there , I caught him rubbing at his chest . He was always doing that now . Like he had to do that to keep his heart beating . " I did n't write the rules , " he said , looking out the window . He was n't talking to us , he was just talking out loud . " And I wo n't try to change them . He must come through that back door . " I looked at ' Malia in her corner , but she kept her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . " And you do n't think he will ? " " No sir , " I said . " Not him . " " You 're pretty sure of that , are n't you , Felix ? Are n't you ? " " Yes sir , " I said . " Because you never would ' a ' gone through a back door , Mr. Frank ; neither Mr. Walter , neither y'all daddy . " " Keep talking , Felix . " " That 's about all , " I said . " You did n't finish , " Frank said . " You forgot to mention his mon , Felix . She was black . " " She born him , Mr. Frank , that 's all , " I said . " Copper is a Laurent . No Laurent 's walking through any back door  --  ' specially one he half figures belong to him , anyway . " " So you did send for him ? " Frank said . " No sir , " I said . " No more than you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good look at him when I went down to that house . And I looked at him yesterday when he got here . Not that one , Mr. Frank . " " We 'll see , " Frank said . " Can I leave now ? " " You 'll leave when I tell you to leave . " " You the authority , " I said.  |p188Then  it got quiet again  --  too quiet . I looked at ' Malia stitching on the dress , but I could tell Frank was still looking at me from the window . I could tell he was mad , I could tell he was getting madder . " What am I supposed to do ? " he said , when he could n't hold back any more . " Change the rules ? Do you know how old these rules are ? They 're older than me , than you , than this entire place . I did n't make them , I came and found them here . And I  --  an invalid  --  am I supposed to change them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given you a place to sleep ? If you 're sick I give you medicine whether you have money or not . I do n't charge you a penny rent , I do n't charge a cent for the food you raise in your gardens . What more am I supposed to do  --  give you the house and move into the quarters ? Do you think you 'll live better then ? Well ? " " You better watch your heart , " ' Malia said , very softly , and never raising her head . " To hell with my heart , " Frank said . " To hell with you , the place , Felix  --  everything . " " That ai n't being too smart , " ' Malia said , still very softly , and still not looking at him . " So today is my day to be criticized , eh ? " he said . " Is that what it 's coming to ? " " Nobody 's trying to criticize you , Mr. Frank , " ' Malia said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 's trying to criticize me , " Frank said . " What the hell 's Felix been doing ever since he got up this morning ? " " Can I leave now ? " I said . " You start toward that door , Felix , so help me God I 'll get that gun out of that desk drawer and shoot your goddamn head off . " " You the authority , " I said . " You must have the last damn word every time , must n't you ? " Frank said.  |p189I  got quiet . I could see he was mad . " Ai n't it ' bout time you had your dinner ? " ' Malia said , to break the silence . " I eat when I damned well please , " Frank said , turning on ' Malia now . " I hope I still have that privilege in my own house . " When ' Malia did n't say anything , he said : " Well , are n't you going to say , You the authority , ' just to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Mr. Frank , " ' Malia said . " I 'm an invalid , " he said . " I 'm an invalid who everyone laughs at soon as my back is turned . " " I never laughed at you in my life , Mr. Frank , " ' Malia said . " And I 'm sure Felix never done either . " It got quiet again . I rubbed my hand over my old black cap I had hanging on my knee . Then I just looked at my hands a while . I guess I never would ' a ' done that if I was out in the shop or at my own house . But in here , with all these books and furnitures and fine things , I just , all of a sudden , looked at both of my hands . How rough they looked . Knotted , old , hard , and wrinkled . " How come you did n't protest ? " Frank asked ' Malia . " Protest what , Mr. Frank ? " " Their dragging him back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go'n drag Copper nowhere , " she said . " And why not ? " " I 'm sure I do n't need to even answer that , Mr. Frank , " ' Malia said , with her head down . " You better answer that , damn you , " he said . " And I wish you would look up when I 'm talking to you , Amalia . " ' Malia stuck the needle in the dress and raised her head . " Copper both of us nephew , Mr. Frank , " she said . " And they know that . And they know ai n't nowhere in the world for them to go if they hurt him . " " You and Felix seem to be throwing that nephew stuff pretty heavily round here today , " Frank said . " You betterp190mind your tongue does n't slip at the wrong time . " " I know my place , " ' Malia said . " Do you ? " Frank said . " I thought you had forgotten it . For a moment there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No sir , I 'm not white , " she said . " You sure now ? " " I 'm sure , Mr. Frank . You the only white person in here . " " Thank you , " he said , nodding his head . Somebody knocked on the door , and ' Malia told him to come in . Stateman pushed the door open and told Frank his dinner was ready . Frank left the window . A tall , slim man with thin , gray hair . A very weak man ; a very sick man . " Tell that gal to fix up something for Felix in the kitchen , " he said to Stateman . " Yes sir , " Stateman said , standing to the side to let Frank go out first . Frank stopped at the door and looked back at me . " When you get through eating , you go to that living room and sit down , " he said . " Do n't you dare leave this house until I see that boy . " " You the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering that , too , " he said , and went out . Stateman followed him . " One ai n't no better than the other one , " ' Malia said . " They the same , that same blood in ' em . Did n't I used to sing at Copper and sing at Copper ' fore he left here . Him fighting them white children on the river like he fight them black ones in the quarter . Did n't I used to sing and sing and sing at him . My singing did n't do no good then ; now he 's back here doing worse . " " What I ca n't understand , what Mr. Frank want see him so bad for . If nobody wanted to see me , I sure would n't gop191through that much trouble to get him in my house . " " He know he 's going to die soon , " ' Malia said . " He want leave something for Copper in his will . In my name . " " Not this place , I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Something small . Maybe no more than a few dollars . " " To pay for what Walter did to his mon ? " " I reckon so . " " But Copper got to come through the back to get it ? " " Yes , " ' Malia said . " He wo n't see that day , " I said . " Copper scares me , Felix , " ' Malia said . " How do you mean ? " " Look what he did Little Boy and Joby . Look how he beat them and put them in chains . He would do that to anybody who got in his way . I think he would even do that to me . " " Not to you  --  no , " I said . " Yes , " she said . " To me . Something 's in Copper . Somethinghappened to Copper . Things he talk about . Rights . Wrongs . Soldiers . Generals . Who the earth for . Who the sun belongs to . That kind of talk scares me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go back , " I said . " I hope so , " she said . Then she lowered her head and started crying . " My own blood  --  I want my own blood to leave my house . " I went to her and put my hand on her shoulder . I started to tell her it was n't her blood making Copper act like that , but I did n't know if that was the thing to say then . " Let 's go eat something , " I told her . " You ought to be hungry , too . " She stood up , and we went back in the kitchen.  |p192When  I finished eating , I went to the living room and sat down . It was a big room with big , old , dark furnitures . They had all the curtains drawn back , but still there was n't enough light in there . The trees in the yard kept sun from ever getting into that house . I sat in a big , old , highbackchair , facing the fireplace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw pictures of the family . Pictures of soldierseverywhere  --  probably from all the wars . There was a picture of Greta Jean standing in front of the house with two young men on both sides of her . She looked happy as she could be , because she knowed she was going to get this place after Frank died . On the mantelpiece was a picture of Walter on that stallion , Black Terror . And how I remember them two . I remembered how he used to race that horse through the quarters and how the people had to fall out his way when they heard him coming . I remembered how he used to pick fights with the colored boys in the field for no reason at all  --  just for the sake of fighting them . And the women , married or single  --  what did he care ? They was on his place and they belong to him . And nobody , white or black , would dare tell him he was wrong . It took that horse he loved to stop him . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the field . Something scared the horse  --  probably a clap of thunder  --  and the horse threw him from the saddle . But he never got his foot out of the stirrup , and the horse dragged him all the way to the front . I still remembered how I heard that horse 's hoofs pounding that hard ground , coming back to the yard . Will Henderson saw him first and started hollering : " Head him . Head him . He dragging Mr. Walter . Head him . " We stopped the horse , all right , but by the time we got Walter loose from the stirrup , he was already dead . His back and his skull , both broke . For a long time , I could n't take my eyes off that picture.  |p193But  I was n't thinking about Walter and that horse ; I was thinking about that other one running round in the quarters , calling himself a General and a Laurent . " They the same two , " I told myself . " It 's Walter back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour when Frank came in . Then I saw what had kept him so long : he had changed clothes . He had put on a pair of gray pants , a white shirt , and a little polka-dotted bow tie . To get dressed up like that had taken all the little strength he had . He looked so weak and white now , I thought he was going to fall before he got to that chair . ' Malia came in a few minutes later with her sewing and sat by a lamp in the corner . She still had the white rag on her head . Long time ago , all the house servants had to wear a rag on their heads all the time . But now the people in the big houses did n't make them do it unless they wanted to . ' Malia still did it , just like she had done it thirty , forty years back . Nobody said anything to anybody . ' Malia was sewing and humming a song to herself . I could n't hear all of the song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung my old leather cap on my knee , and I passed my hand over the cap every time I caught Frank looking over there at me . Frank took out his watch and glanced at the time . " Maybe they had to tree him , " he said . Then it got quiet again . I did n't feel right at all in there . I wanted to get back to my shop and sharpen up something . A man used to the outside do n't feel right cooped up in a house when he know the sun is shining . " Well ? " Frank said . I looked at him , but I did n't answer him . I did n't know what he was talking about . " Do you think they had to tree him ? " " Not if he treed them , " I said.  | " Do n't underestimate J. W. , " Frank said . " Not the way he went out of here with blood in his eyes . " I nodded my head . " I see you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you think he 's tough ? " " Yes sir , " I said . " He 's real tough . " " Sure , he 's tough , " Frank said . " I 'll bet you you could n't find a man anywhere tougher than J. W. " I passed my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing . All the time , ' Malia was over there sewing and humming her church song to herself . " Five to one , J. W. brings him in , " Frank said . " Sure , " I thought . " Sure . But that 's not the reason you put on that white shirt and them gray pants . " Then we heard it  --  that yellow gal saying , " Lord , do n't tell me I got to start all over again . " Then it was quiet for about a second before somebody knocked on the door loud and quick . The kind of loudness and quickness that said , " If you do n't hurry up and tell me come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in , " ' Malia said . But J. W. was already in . In , walking fast , breathing hard . His white shirt was soaking wet . From the collar of the shirt to the cuff of his pants , his clothes was covered with stickers , cuckleburrs , beggar-lice , tar vine leaves , corn silk , and any other grass seed in the field you cared to name . He had to go by me to get to Frank , and I saw how his face was all cut up . The cuts was too thin to come from a knife or a razor , so I figured they had been made by corn leaves and cane leaves . " He 's crazy , " J. W. said , even while he was still walking . J. W. was n't walking the way you walk in a room ; he took the long strides you took in the road  --  like you was trying to makep195it home before the rain caught you . " There 's no doubt  --  I 'm fully convinced he 's crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pure-de crazy . " He stopped in front of the chair where Frank was sitting . " Yes sir , Mr. Frank , he 's crazy . " He turned to ' Malia who was sitting by the lamp looking at him . ' Malia was n't looking at him like she was mad at him for going after Copper , and then coming back calling Copper crazy ; she looked at him like she felt pity for him . Pity because she could see that no matter what had happened in the quarters or back in the fields , J. W. had got the worse of it . " Do n't mean to say nothing ' gainst your kin at all , Miss Amalia , " he said . " Done knowed you all my life , done respectedyou all my life . But "  --  he turned to Frank  --  " that boy crazy . No concern for human beings at all . They do n't mean no more to him than a dog or a snake . Not even a good dog , not even a good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward ' Malia again . " I 'm sorry , Miss Amalia . " Then he jerked his head back toward Frank . " But he crazy , Mr. Frank . " J. W. stopped talking long enough to draw breath and swallow , and all that time Frank was looking at him like he was n't surprised at all . Looking at him like he had figured that this might happen  --  like he had already told himself what he had to do if it did happen . That 's why he had put on the starched white shirt and the gray pants . " Crazy ' s he can be , " J. W. started right where he had left off . " No concern for human beings at all . " Now , guess what he done done ? " Frank squinted up at J. W. and shook his head a little , to show him he did n't have the least idea what had happened . " Nearly ' bout killed half of them boys you sunt me with , " J. W. said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinting up at him and passing his fingers lightly over his chest.  | " Sir ? No sir . Only ' cause I was standing a little to the side , " J. W. said . " But you ought to see what he did Pool-Doo and Crowley . " " Pool-Doo and Crowley ? " Frank said . " What did he do Pool-Doo and Crowley , made them tickle each other half to death ? " " Sir ? No sir . It was n't no tickling  --  no sir . He just cracked both of them side the head with that little scy ' blade handle . I mean hard as he could , Mr. Frank . Hard as he possibly could . " " Where did he got a scythe blade handle from ? " Frank asked . " I do n't know , Mr. Frank , but he had it . A brand new one  --  like it had n't left the store , yet . Could still see the label . " " You saw the label , but you did n't get close enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir ? No sir . I was standing to the side . And guess what he did poor Simon ? I 'm sure you have no idea what he did that poor boy . " While Frank was trying to guess what Copper did Simon , J. W. wiped the sweat from his face and caught two or three quick breaths of air . " What did he do Simon ? " Frank asked . " Sir ? What he did ? He made that poor boy jump in a ditch  --  a ditch full of yellow jackets  --  yellow jackets , Mr. Frank . " " I suppose Simon jumped out again ? " " Yes sir . Yes sir . Poor boy . All stung up , all stung up . " Frank passed his hand lightly over his chest again . " Go on , " he said . " I do n't know what happened to Cadilac and Grease . " " Cadilac and Grease ? " Frank said . " Yes sir . Last thing I seen , they was headed toward thep197swamps running and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there or if they fell in the bayou and drowned . The way they was running , they was n't looking too close where they was going . " J. W. had been talking fast , and now he had to wipe his face and catch his breath again . While Frank was waiting for J. W. to go on , Frank passed his fingers over his chest . He did n't rub hard , just lightly  --  like even those little light touches was enough to keep his heart beating . " I honestly think that boy 's crazy , Mr. Frank , " J. W. started again . " I swear , I honestly do . ' Cause a sane person would n't dare act like that  --  not a sane one . " He looked at ' Malia sadly . He was sorry for her for having a crazy nephew on her hands . He turned to Frank again . " Back there checkingon everything . Oak trees , pecan trees , berry bushes . Even caught him counting the joints in a stalk of cane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank said . " Sir ? Yes sir . That too . " " Corn ? " " Sir ? Corn too . Everything . Everything you can name , he looked at it . Checking them and writing them down in that little tablet . Last thing I seen , he was shelling a yer of corn in his hand and tasting the grains . " Frank sat back in the chair and squinted up at J. W. a long time . J. W. wiped the sweat from his face again . He was still breathing pretty hard ; I could see the back of his shouldersgoing up and down . " How did you get that shirt so wet  --  you stopped for a swim before you got back here ? " Frank asked . " Sir ? No sir . Just running full speed , " J. W. said . " ' Cross cane rows , corn rows , cotton rows  --  jumping ditches  --  to tell you what happened . " " All right , you told me ; you can leave . " " Yes sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped andp198looked at Frank again . " Yes sir , he told me to tell you , When a General ai n't got no more army , ai n't but one thing for him to do . ' " Frank nodded . " Did he say where he would be ? " " No sir . He just said , When a General ai n't got no more army , ai n't but one thing for him to do . ' " " Go on , " Frank said . " Wait . Go back in the field and round up the rest of those worthless niggers ; bring them up here so that gal can look after them . " " Yes sir , " J. W. said . " Thank you , sir . I 'm sure they 'll ' preciate that . " J. W. went out , wiping his face and walking fast . Not the way you walk out of a room  --  the way you walk down the road when you was trying to get home before the rain caught you . " Felix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , getting up from the chair . " Go back in the quarters and get me everything that can walk or crawl . " " That 's about it , " I said . " Unless you mean Aunt Jude , Aunt Johnson , and the rest of them . But being in their seventiesand eighties and ca n't back-paddle fast as J. W. , I would n't want send them on Copper . Not the way he 's swingingthat little scy ' blade handle . " " How about dogs ? " Frank said . " Few of them down there , but putting them all together , I doubt if they 'd ' mount to one good one , " I said . " And the way Copper 's swinging that little scy ' blade handle , you 'll need at least six or seven . Now , the Cajuns there got some good ones . I 'm sure they would n't mind lending them to you . We ai n't had a good lynching in a long time ; they probably would n't mind going themself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes sir . "  | " How long do you think they 'll let him live if I let him force his way through that front door ? Have you thought about that ? " " Ca n't you let him slip in tonight sometime ? " " Slip in ? " Frank said . " Do n't you know slipping in to him is the same as coming in through the back ? " I nodded . " I reckon so . " " Even if they did n't lynch him , I would n't let him come in through that front door , " Frank said . " Neither him , nor you , nor her over there . And to me she is only the second woman I 've had the good fortune of knowing whom I can call a lady . But she happens to be black , Felix , and because she 's black she 'll never enter this house through that door . Not while I 'm alive . Because , you see , Felix , I did n't write the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die and leave them . They will be changed , of course ; they will be changed , and soon , I hope . But I will not be the one to change them . " He turned to look at ' Malia . " You crying over there , Amalia ? " he asked her . She shook her head , but she would n't look up . " Yes , " Frank said . " If he wo n't come here , then I must go there . I need some fresh air . I 've been in here too long . " " Mr. Frank , " ' Malia said , getting up and coming to him . " Do n't go down there fooling with Copper . If anybody must go , let me go again . " " No , you stay here , " Frank said . " It 's me he wants . Ca n't you see it 's me ? " " Do n't go down there , Mr. Frank , " ' Malia said . " Please , do n't go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frank said . " I ca n't let Copper in here . " " And your heart ? " she said . She was crying ; the water had run down her face to her chin.  |p200Frank  stood there looking down at her . " Poor Amalia , " he said . " We all hurt you , do n't we , Amalia ? Do n't worry , I 'll be careful . He wo n't kill me that easily . " He turned to me . " I 'll have to get my cane and my coat . You must be properly dressed when meeting a General . Meet me in the back ; we 'll go in the car . You 'll have to drive , Felix . " He went out . I put my arm round ' Malia 's shoulders and led her back to the chair . She sat there crying . I tried to talk to her , but she was crying too much to answer me . I left the room , thinking , " Poor woman , poor woman . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the other . Walter did it when he messed up with her niece ; the gal did it when she took the boy North ; and here was the boy back , hurting her just like his mon and his paw had done before . By the time I had backed the car from under the house , Frank had come down the back stairs . He looked even sicker and weaker . I 'm sure if he was n't using that walking cane he would n't ' a ' been able to stay on his feet . I held the door open to let him get in the car . Then after he had set himself good , I shut the door and went and got in on the driver 's side . We had to drive under the trees to reach the gate . Frank looked out of the window at the trees . It had been a long time since he had been out of that house . " Felix , why did n't they bring Copper in ? " he asked , turning to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , Mr. Frank . " " Why ? Because he 's a Laurent ? " " No sir , that 's not it . They could n't ' a ' brought back anybody who did n't want to come . " " Why ? " he asked . " Because it 's not like it used to be , Mr. Frank . They notp201scared of you like they was scared of Mr. Walter . They knowed you was n't going to do them anything . They knowed Mr. Walter would ' a ' half killed them , and they would ' a ' done anything in the world before they came back there empty-handed . " " So it 's fear that makes them move ? " " No sir , not exactly . Fear make them move when that 's all they ever knowed . But when you lose the power of the rod , of the gun , they ai n't got nothing to fear no more . " " I see ; they fear the other man who picks up the rod or the gun . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you think the time might come when they would join up with Copper against me ? " " That I do n't know , Mr. Frank . " " Would you , Felix ? " " Well , for one thing , I 'm old , Mr. Frank . I do n't have too much time left to be joining up with anybody . Another thing , I do n't believe in joining up with anybody from fear ; I do what I do from respect . " " Do you respect what Copper 's doing ? " " Well , I look at it this way : I do n't like to see him hurtinghis aunt like he 's doing . But I do n't know if I would n't slap a few of them up side the head , too , if they came for me like they went for him . " " Then you do n't think it 's wrong what he 's doing ? " " Like I said , Mr. Frank , I do n't like to see what he 's doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 's doing to me ? " " I do n't know if he 's doing anything , Mr. Frank , Mr. Walter would n't ' a ' done . " " Walter would have done it , " Frank said . " But not Copper'smon . And there is the difference , Felix . And that 's why it 's wrong . "  |p202We  was already in the quarters . Far as you could see was nothing but this long road of white dust . It hurt your eyes to look at so much dust , so much whiteness , so much heat rising up from it . It was the hottest part of the day  --  between one thirty and two  --  and there was n't another person anywhere in sight . The tall blood weeds on both sides of the road made the place look even hotter . We was coming up to ' Malia 's house . I could see two chairs on the gallery . They was n't there when I came down the quarters the first time . " He 's waiting for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He made it from the field that quick ? " " He 's there , " Frank said . " Stop . " I stopped and we looked at the house . Copper did n't show up . Just the two chairs on the gallery facing the road . I mashed on the horn , but he still did n't show up . " Want me to go and knock ? " I asked Frank . " He 's there , " Frank said . I mashed on the horn again , and we waited . About a minute later , Copper came to the door . He had taken off his shirt , and he had a white towel hanging over his shoulder . Me and Frank both looked at him a long time . " He does n't look much like a General from here , " Frank said . " But I suppose no General looks like a General with his shirt off . " He twisted his mouth a little to the side , then he nodded his head and grunted . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come here , Copper , " I called . He came a little farther out on the gallery , then he stopped again . He just wanted to make sure who was out there . " You do n't think he 's coming down those steps , do you ? " Frank said . " Copper ? Come here , " I said . " Save your breath , " Frank said.  |p203He  mashed on the door handle and got out before I could get out and help him . I jumped out on my side and opened the gate . The tall , sick , white man went in the yard with his head high . Copper stood there wide-legged , with his chest out , with his hands on his hips , and watched Frank come up the steps . Frank stood before Copper , leaning on the cane and breathing hard . A few drops of sweat had already settled on his forehead . It had taken everything out of him to come up those steps . " Uncle , " Copper said . They stood face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank was a little taller . " I do n't see my aunt , " Copper said . " I made her stay at the house , " Frank said . " You made her stay there , huh ? " Then they just stood there looking at each other . You could see Frank wanted to raise that cane and bring it down on Copper 's head or his shoulder . But he did n't have the strength to do it . And even if he had , he probably would n't ' a ' done it then . What he wanted more than anything else , now , was to find out what Copper was doing here . Copper had said " Uncle " to Frank just like he would ' a ' said " Aunt " to ' Malia . It was like he had been calling him that all his life . He was no more scared of Frank than Frank was scared of him . They was both Laurents . A Laurent was n't supposed to be scared of any man . " Please sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move for a while . You did n't ask a Laurent to sit down , just like you did n't ask him to stand up or shut his mouth . The Laurents moved when they wanted to move . But once he had gone to that chair , I could see how glad he was to sit down . To get dressed , to come down the stairs at the big house , to come up the steps here had taken everything out of him . " I 'm sorry you found me like this , " Copper said , " but Ip204had just come in from the field . Would you like a glass of ice water while I change clothes ? I also have some lemonade there . " " Water is fine , " Frank said . " Get some water , " Copper said to me . He did n't talk to me like he was talking to a ' old man , he spoke to me like he was speaking to a slave . I went back in the kitchen to get the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . I had to step out his way to keep him from walking over me . I 'm sure he did n't see me at all . He was looking at something far away , or like he was listening to something far away . If you 've seen people walking in their sleep , that 's the way he looked . I went out on the gallery and handed Frank the glass of water . " I used to come here when I was a young man , " he said , after he had drunk . " I used to sit on those steps . That mulberrytree there is old as I am . " " I remember it from ' way back , " I said . " I never thought I 'd ever sit here again , " Frank said . He looked at all the things round him , then he finished drinking the water and handed me the glass . Copper came back on the gallery a few minutes later . He had put on more khakis . Not the cheap khakis people wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army . He had on another pair of shoes . They shined better than the other pair did this morning . He stood in the door a second before he came over to the bannister and sat down . He sat a little to the right of Frank 's chair . I stood near the steps and leaned back against the post . " You have two chairs there , " Frank said . " Are n't you going to sit down ? " " The bannister is perfectly all right , " Copper said . " The other chair was for my aunt . "  | " Well , she 's at the house , " Frank said . " Yes , you made her stay there , " Copper said . " Can Felix sit in the chair ? " " Would you have let Felix sit on the gallery at your house ? " " He was sitting in my living room just before we came here , " Frank said . " I 'm sure he was , " Copper said . " Was he sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ? " " No , " Frank said . They looked at each other like two rams locking horns . But Frank was n't mad with Copper now ; he was just playing round with words . He had caught his breath and had even gotten a little color in his face . Frank raised the walking cane and tapped the bannister two or three inches away from where Copper was sitting . Copper looked straight at Frank all the time . I said he was looking at Frank , I did n't say he was seeing Frank ; because even when he was looking at you , even when he was talking to you , it looked like he was listening to something ' way off . " What do you want , boy ? " Frank asked Copper . " My birthright , " Copper said . Now , Frank sat ' way back in the chair . He rested one of his arms , his left arm , on the arm of the chair . Then he squinted up at Copper . He had heard Copper quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . " Your what ? " he said . " My birthright , " Copper said , looking straight at him . " That nigger of mine told me he thought you were crazy , " Frank said . Copper did n't say anything , but he never took his eyes off Frank . " Well ? " Frank said.  | " What do you think ? " Copper said . " I think he 's a good judge of character , " Frank said . Copper raised his hand to his left temple . But I noticed just before he touched his face , his mind drifted away a moment . He did n't rub his temple , he touched it lightly  --  the way Frank touched at his chest every so often . " You know anything about the history of this country , boy ? " Frank asked him . " I know a little history , " Copper said . " Then you know because your mon was black you ca n't claim a damn thing . Not only birthright , you ca n't even claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my birthright today , " Copper said . " But I 'll claim it tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ? " Frank said . Copper nodded . " Tomorrow . " " How do you expect to perform that miracle ? " " No miracle , Uncle , " Copper said . " My men and I 'll just do it . " " Your men ? " " My men . " " And who are these men , Copper ? " " The name is Christian , Uncle , " Copper said . " Laurent . Christian Laurent . General Christian Laurent . " " Who are these men , General ? " Frank said . " All those who 've been treated as I 've been treated , " Copper said . ( When Copper was talking to you , he was n't seeing you , he was seeing something ' way off . ) He touched at his temple again . Frank watched his hand go up and come back down . " There are many just like me . So many just like me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face down to his clothes . His khakis was starched and ironed ; his shoes shined like new tin . " Copper , " Frank said , leaning closer toward him , " you'rep207insane , are n't you , boy ? There are n't any men , are there ? " " The name is Christian , Uncle . " " There are n't any men , are there , Christian ? " " Yes and no , " Copper said . " Spiritually , yes , and they 're waiting for me . Physically , in the sense of an organized Army , no . " " How do you know that your imaginary Army will ever materialize , Christian ? " " Just smell the air , Uncle . " Frank looked at Copper a while , like he was letting all this soak in . Then he raised his head and took a deep breath . " No , I do n't smell a thing , " he said . He turned to me . " You , Felix ? " I did n't answer him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They always turned against you in the end . " It 's there , Uncle , " Copper said . " Only a fool , and a damn one at that , ca n't smell what 's in the air . " I looked at Frank and I saw a little color shoot out of his face . He probably would ' a ' had another heart attack if anybody else had called him a damn fool ; but Copper had said so much already , to hear Copper call him a damn fool did n't shock him too much . " Any more water in that glass , Felix ? " he asked me . " No sir ; I 'll get some . " I hurried inside and got the water and hurried back . Frank drank a little and handed me the glass . I moved back against the post . Frank tapped the bannister with the walking cane and looked up at Copper . " And you 're the General ? " he said . " I am the General , " Copper said . " Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily as snapping my fingers , then what ? " " You wo n't kill this General , or you would have done itp208before now , Uncle , " Copper said . " And that 's a grave mistake , not killing him . But even if you did kill this General , another General would only spring up . " " Not on my place , claiming birthright , " Frank said . " If not on your place claiming birthright , then on somebody else 's place claiming birthright , " Copper said . " It was not only on your place he was denied his birthright . That 's been denied him all over this country . " " I see you have the answers , General , " Frank said . " That 's why I am a General , Uncle , " Copper said . Frank squinted up at Copper a second , then he sat back in the chair and sniffed at the air again . Copper raised his left hand and rubbed his finger lightly over his temple . For a second there , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' been listening to something far off . " You know , you almost killed half of my men on this place , " Frank said . Copper had been looking at Frank , but he had been thinking about something else . Frank woke him out of a dream . " Men ? " he said . Frank nodded . " Men . " " Since when have you started calling them men , Uncle ? " Copper asked . Frank did n't answer him then ; he squinted up at Copper a while . " So that 's why you did it ? " he said . " When they act like men , I 'll treat them like men , " Coppersaid . " When they let you make them act like animals , then I 'll treat them like animals . " " I see , " Frank said . " You 're going to change it all . You , one , are going to change what 's been drilled into their brains the past three hundred years ? You , one ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Using chains and sticks ? " Frank asked him . Copper did n't answer him then ; he let Frank think about what he had said . Then I saw this slow grin coming on Copper'sface . " Did you say chains and sticks  --  Uncle ? " he said . " Yes . " " I thought you said chains and sticks , " Copper said . " I thought I heard you right . " He did n't go on for a while ; he wanted Frank to think some more . " Those are your creations , Uncle  --  the chains and sticks . You created them four hundred years ago , and you 're still using them up to this day . You created them . But they were only a fraction of your barbarity  --  Uncle . You used the rope and the tree to hang him . You used the knife to castrate him while he struggled with the rope to catch his breath . You used fire to make him squirm even more , because the hangingand the castration still was n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another creation of yours  --  that thing you called law . It was written by you for you and your kind , and any man who was not of your kind had to break it sooner or later . . . . I only used a fraction of your creations . You have imbedded the stick and the chain in their minds for so long , they ca n't hear anything else . I needed it to get their attention . I think I have it now  --  and I wo n't have to use it any more . From now on I 'll use the simplest words . Simple words , Uncle ; a thing you thought they would never understand . " All the time Copper was talking , he kept his voice calm and even . But it was a strain for him , just like it was a strain for him to sit in one place . I do n't mean he was squirming round on the bannister ; but you had the feeling he might ' a ' jumped up from there any moment . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , before it came back again . Frank put the palm of his hand on the end of the walking cane and pressed it against the floor . If this was out in the yard , the point of the cane would ' a ' made a slight hole in the ground . He squinted up at Copper . He was like a lawyer in the courtroom . Maybe the other lawyer had said something that was the truth , and maybe he felt like telling the lawyer he had said some true things , but that was n't going to change his feelings at all . " That nigger of mine told me you had a notebook , " he said . " What were you doing , mapping out plans for battle ? " " Just making a few notes on the place , " Copper said . He could see Frank was trying to play with him , but he did n't mind this at all . Because everything he said , himself , he meant it . " The condition of the houses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And what do you think of the place ? " Frank said , looking at the little mulberry tree , not at Copper . But when he did that he forgot Copper was a Laurent . He thought Copper was going to answer him like I would ' a ' answeredhim , or like one of his sharecroppers had to answer him . Copper just sat there , looking down at him in that extra calm way he possessed . Frank kept on looking at the tree , waiting . But when the answer did n't come , I could see his eyes shifting down the tree near the ground . He was n't seeing the tree now , he was waiting for something , a sound or something , to make him face Copper again . Since he had turned his head from Copper , he needed something to make him turn back . That was supposed to be my job , I reckoned , but I was n't getting in it . Let him get out of it the best way he could . After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land has been wasted and is still being wasted , but it 's not beyond saving , " Copper said . If he took what Frankp211had done as a ' insult , he was n't showing it . " As for the houses , they 'll have to be torn down and built from the ground up , " he said . " Corn ? " Frank said . " That nigger told me you ate a few grains of my corn back there . " " I did , " Copper said . " Most of it is bad . Not terrible , but it could be better . " " Cotton ? " Frank said . " It can be improved . " " Cane ? " Frank said . " Same as the cotton and corn . " " Hay ? " Frank said . " Yes . " " Berries ? " he said . Copper nodded . " Did you get into the swamps ? " " I would have , " Copper said . " But I was being continuallyinterrupted . " " J. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their names ? " " Yes , " Frank said , " that was their names . " " They did n't introduce themselves , " Copper said . Frank poked the cane in the floor again . If this was out in the yard , it would ' a ' made a hole in the ground ' a ' inch deep . He squinted up at Copper . " When did this birthright notion come into your head ? " he asked . You could see in Copper 's face how his mind went and came back . He was looking at Frank one second and seeing him ; then the next second he was seeing something ' way off . " I always knew who my father was , " he said , keeping his voice level . Now his mind had drifted ' way again . He made a painful frown , and I saw the left side of his face trembling  | " But I knew I could n't say a thing about it . It would have gotten me in trouble , and probably gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field we were picking up potatoes . I had gone to the bayou to get some water out of the barrel . When I came back to the row where my mother and I were working , she was n't there . I asked where she was , and a woman  --  I forget who she was  --  started laughing at me . I walked away crying , looking for my mother . I found them in another patch of ground , Walter Laurent on top of her . They did n't see me , but that night I told her one day I was going to kill him . That 's why we moved from here . Her , her husband and me . Her husband 's name was the name I carried up until recently . " Copper raised his hand up to his face to touch both of his temples . I could see him frowning behind his hand . " Two years after we left here , my mother died , " Copper went on . He was looking at Frank , but he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was talking to Frank , but at the same time listening to another voice . " My suppose-tobefather , who had been too nutless to say I was n't his while we lived in the South , kicked me out of the house before my mother was cold in her grave . He was not going to support any white man 's child . He was tired supporting a white man 's child . I was fourteen years old then . A fourteen-year-old black child out on his own . Not a soul in the world to turn to , not one . " He stopped and looked down at Frank again . Frank was n't looking at him now ; he had folded his hands over the end of the walking cane and he had propped his chin on his hands . Even when Copper had quit talking , even when he knowed Copper was looking down at him , he kept his head bowed . " For the last ten years I 've been everywhere , " Copper said , looking at the trees over in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " I 've seen a little bit of everything in this world , but suffering more than anything else . There 're millions just like me . Maybe not my color , but without homes , without birthrights , just like me . And who is to blame ? " he said , looking down at Frank . " Men like my father . Men like Walter Laurent . " Frank raised his eyes to look at him . He did n't move his chin from his hands . He looked at Copper long and carefully , then he looked down again . " Rapists , " Copper said . " Murderers , plunderers  --  and they hide behind the law . The law they created themselves . " He got up from the bannister and went to the other end of the gallery . I saw him looking across the yard toward the big house . I saw him raising both of his hands and pressingthem hard against his face . " The suffering , the suffering , the suffering , " he said . He rubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . I watched him , but Frank did n't . He kept his head bowed , his chin resting on his hands . He did n't even look up when Copper came back to the bannister . " I 've been in all the cities , " Copper said . He was calm again  --  but he was too calm . " Yes , and I 've been in prison . How many times have I heard weeping in those cells . How many times did they make me scrub the blood off the floor . Once , just to show me what it looked like , they made me clean the chair . I found a strain of hair , a long , brown strain of hair . I kept it for a while , then I lost it . It did n't matter . I did n't need a strain of hair to remind me of the horror I had seen . " He stopped and looked down at his uncle . " But why ? " he said . " Why ? What have we done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , myself , was conceived in a ditch .... And now . . . day and night . . . day and night . . . day and night . . . " He stopped . He had to wait till his mind came back again . " Why these washed-out eyes , these distorted minds , these nonfunc/tioning brains ? Why do I see the faces and hear the cries still ? Not powerful cries  --  little whimpers , like mice in a trap . In a crowd or alone , their cries are with me . " He threw his head back . " Clinging to me , wo n't let me be free , " he screamed . He stopped again ; he pressed both of his hands against the sides of his face . He was looking down at his uncle . He was seeing him , he was n't seeing him . For a second , there , he felt sorry for his uncle ; looked like he wanted to cry . He made a deep frown ; his mouth trembled , the way a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he remembered he was a General , and the same General who could n't go through that back door could n't cry either . " I used to pray once , " he said . He was calm again  --  too calm . " I used to pray and pray and pray . But the same God I was praying to was created by the same ones I was praying against . And Gods only listen to the people who create them . So I quit my praying  --  there would have to be another way . I remembered that I had a father who had property , and I remembered that I was his oldest son . I would take that property  --  my share of that property  --  and I would share it with those others who were like me . " He stopped and looked down at the floor . He looked very tired . Sweat had broke out on his face , and even his starched khaki shirt was wet round the armpit . Frank raised his head slowly and looked at Copper . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The world made me a General , " Copper said . " But you would n't know what that means , would you ? " " Hardly , " Frank said . " I 've had it easy all my life . I 've never heard anyone cry ; I 've never seen any washed-out eyes . Never seen anybody sick . " " No , not the way I have , " Copper said . " Because you 've always been in a position to give them a dime . Dimes clear all conscience . " Frank sat back in the chair  --  with his walking cane on thep215right side of the chair , with his arm resting on one of the chair arms , with his legs stretched out , with his head back  --  looking up at Copper . " J. W. is a good judge of character , " he said . " You are insane , boy . As insane as anyone has ever been . To think you can carry the burden of this world on your shoulders is not an original idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  probablyas old as man himself . Since the beginning of civilization he has tried to do exactly what you want to do , but since it was as insane then as it is now , he has failed . My brother , your father , was wrong . Not only with your mother , but with many other women  --  white and black alike . White and black men he also destroyed . Destroyed them physically , destroyed them mentally . I , myself , have suffered from his errors as much as you , as much as any other man has , but I  --  " " You have not suffered , " Copper said . " Shut up when I 'm talking , " Frank said . " I listened to you . " Copper slid away from the bannister real slowly and stood right in front of the chair . For a moment I thought he was going to jerk Frank out of there and slam him against the wall . Because , if he had done it , it would n't ' a ' surprised me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . He was n't scared of Copper ; he did n't even get a tighter grip on the cane . He challenged Copper a while , just looking at him , then he nodded . I supposed he re'lized he was n't being a gentleman . " Do n't talk to me like that ever again , " Copper said . " I 'm not one of your niggers running round in the quarters . I 'm not one your Cajun sharecroppers . Whether you like it or not , I 'm a Laurent . I 'm a Laurent , Uncle , and you better remember it . " " My apologies  --  Nephew , " Frank said . " Now , shall I go on ? "  |p216Co|p|per  did n't say any more , but he did n't sit down either . He just stood there , looking down at Frank . " I was saying I 've suffered as much as you 've suffered , " Frank said . " He 's destroyed your mind , he 's destroyed my body . I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe a month , maybe only another day . But as long as I 'm here I 'm going to do all I can to make up for what he did to these here in the quarters . I 'm going to give them shelter and food , medicine when they 're sick , a place to worship God . When they die , I 'm going to give them a little plot of ground in which to be buried . " He sat up a little in the chair and squinted up at Copper . " General Christian Laurent , I 'm going to defend this place with all my strength .

Now , those are my last words to you . You can stay here as long as you think it 's possible to stay without causing trouble . If you ca n't live by those rules , then you better get the hell away from here now . " Copper stood there a long time after Frank had finished talking . He even narrowed his eyes and looked down at Frank the way all the Laurents did . " Are you finished , Uncle ? " he said . Frank did n't answer him . He was looking down the quartersnow . " I 'll leave , Uncle , " Copper said . " Not because you **25;8766;TOOLONG washed for a while . She brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she knew I had overheard everything , and I leafed through the new Time and glanced at photographs , until my nausea rose suddenly at a picture of a mutilated Communist riot victim ( the caption read , " After the ( lance , the piper to be paid " ) so that I leaned back trembling against my pillow . Nada was looking out the window , distracted . Have I ever mentioned Nada 's total lack of interest in politics , in events , in reality ? She never read the newspaper , never listened to the radio . Never . She might have believed that only vulgar people kept track of history , I do n't know . " For me , history is what is in this room , nothing more , " she had declared pompously to someone , sometime , within my hearing . She might have believed her brain too finely developed to be overloadedwith the trivia of daily reality , daily suffering . Her brain was instead stuffed with books . What was " only real " could n't be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way myself . I have caught her solipsism from her , the way I used to catch colds and flu from her . A contagious woman ! It was a quiet day . I read , she read . But this quiet meant nothing because it was not a peaceful quiet . It was a heart-throbbing , pulse-quivering quiet , more terrible than screams and crashes . I wanted to crawl out of bed and press my aching eyes against Nada 's ankles , kiss her feet , her shoes , her stockings , and beg her not to leave . Oh , do n't leave ! Not again ! When she ran away from us the first time Father had told me sadly that my mother had died ; I was n't quite old enough to understand this . The second time she ran away I overheard his conver-P101sation ( via an upstairs extension ) with the private detectivewho was on her trail ; but this time  --  no , I did n't think I could survive another time . I was too old now . I knew too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual , friendly , erotic glance between strangers in a library browsing lounge , and my heart leaped at mysterious phrases spoken in German over the phone , with that sinister voice from New York . I had journeyed too far , I was Nada 's son , I could n't let her leave me . I would rather see her die than lose her . I would rather see her dead , wax-white , her smiles and sneers vanished , drained of blood and energy and appetite .. . In the days of Nero ( forgive my mentioning that beast 's name , but he is appropriate ) there was an odd fellow who had found out an exquisite way to make glass as hammerproof as gold : shall I say that the like experiment he made upon glass I tried to make upon myself ? A metamorphosis ? Shall I bother to add that I failed ? My friends , I never shattered in any obvious way . I never exploded into pieces . And , seeing my bulk as it is today , you would smile to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only eighteen . . . But yes , I am glass , transparent and breakable as glass , but  --  and this is the tragedy  --  we who are made of glass may crack into millions of jigsaw-puzzle pieces but we do not fall apart . We never fall apart . Instead we keep lumbering around and talking . We want nothingp102more than to fall apart , to disintegrate , to be released into a shower of slivers and have done with it all , but the moment is hard to come by , as you can see . Since my forlorn days as a child , so minutely investigatedhere , I 've done some reading in an attempt to acquire the language needed for me to write this memoir . You ordinary people who read and do not write , who " like to read " and know nothing of the sufferings of writers , how fortunate you are ! You are truly blessed ! My very brain ached with the agony of taking on Western Culture , and I fear very little of it got to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be to that other unfortunate traveler from whom I have stolen so much . It 's no noble gesture for the dead to be honest . I acknowledgemy master . But I discovered something else , a depressing fact . Literature , art , like civilization itself , are only accidents . They are not planned . You gentle readers who opted to take Humanities courses now and then in college , who set upon a course in Shakespeare with a hearty stoicism and a big notebook , little did you or your professor understandthat the whole thing is an accident , the art product an accident , like the products of violent seizures of nausea that overtake many of us after an arduous dinner . The work could have come out in any form , but it happened to come out in one form , and that formp103has crystallized and seems now , hundreds of years later , somehow planned . But no , my friends , and no again , because once I thought as you do , once I assumed a majestic order and symmetry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry must exist somewhere . They must . But you do n't find them in " art , " because of all human endeavors " art " is the most pulsating , rippling , seething , improbable , and unpredictable of all the creations of man , like those babies born after expectant mothers ' exposure to certain drugs and diseases  --  if you 'll excuse that only halfwayaccurate metaphor . ( I am very conscious of metaphors . ) No , I 'm afraid that you start out writing a memoir that seems simple enough , wanting only to get the truth down and forget about it , or , if you 're lazier , you try to write a novel , something capricious , but somewhere in the process everything breaks down , wo n't work , is just an illusion . I sought a language for my memoir and turned desperately to the works of our " culture " but found there the same kind of seething , tortured products as the one I am turning out . There is a surface order and beauty , yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tennyson remarked wisely , " We poets are vessels to produce poetry and other excrement . " I do n't know what area of study I would have pursued had I not disintegrated ; like Gustave , I might have " gone into " math or something similarly solipsistic and unhurried . But thinking it my duty to stretch the flayed skin of my childhood on some sort of skeleton of convention ( I am anticipating alert readers for these metaphors ! ) , I began to burrow and mutter through volumes of such works as are famous in our " culture . " ThereforeP104the technical devices I , as a writer , use , I readily admit them . I want to admit them , and everything . Maybe there are a few of you who want to write also , who have a lesser tale to tell  --  lesser , I should hastily qualify , in terms of moral cess-matter . Maybe there are some of you who have , in your homes , dog-eared copies of The Writer with earnest articles that will see you through crises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , I should call your attention to these short , cheerfully blocked-out , and fast-moving chapters . Or are n't they fast-moving ? No matter . I have based some of them on an article concerned with " building suspense " and  --  you see how honest I am  --  even dull stretches can be used to build suspense if there is the promise of some violence to come . I do indeed promise violence , yes . VIOLENCE . . . VIOLENCE ( this is for people standing at Browse &; Leaf shelves in clean surburban libraries ) . Ioffer to them also ECSTASY . . . MORAL ROT . . . ANGST . . . KIERKEGAARD . . . and other frauds that bring asardonic smile to your lips and mine , my **25;8793;TOOLONG , but that will snare lesser folk . FLAGELLATIONinterests some , those who know what it means , those who suspect what it means , and the great nation of those who want to look it up in order to use it three times and make it " theirs . " ( All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Reader Interest ? " ) Now you are wondering , what good did it do me to read a great deal ? Ancient , Medieval , Renaissance , NeoClassic , Romantic , Victorian , Modern , Avant-Gardeeverything , what good did it do ? Not much . My feverishmind , sievelike and pulsating constantly , loses most of what it takes in just as my stomach once lost most ofp105its intake . I am a mess and messes do n't take well to culture ; they somehow distort it to look like themselves . But I learned enough to take the following steps for my memoir : 1 . I know my characters . ( Christ , I should know them ! ) 2 . I know " where my story is going . " ( How could I not know ? ) 3 . I am addressing a certain audience that shares with me a disdain for or outright rejection of murder , committed by a child or by just anyone at all . ( If murder becomes acceptable again my memoir will be tossed upstairs in attics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U.S.A. , and other forgotten works. ) 4 . I provide some possibility  --  do n't I ? for " reader identification . " ( My theory is that we have all been children , each of us . I hope this common experience is enough. ) g . I provide a moral stance . ( Indeed I do , and this stance I am taking with poor , blistered , sweating , swollen feet flat on the earth is that crime does not pay . It is not very original , I know. ) 6 . I write in a clear story line , with specific illustrationsand description limited to " what 's really necessary . " ( See January 1967 , Amateur Penman , " Just ' What Is Really Necessary in Your Writing ? " ) 7 . I am wringing for all it 's worth the " device of emotional preparation , " that is , letting the readerscome to know the characters . Will they give a damn about some poor bastard who is killedP106on page one ? They will not . They are hardheartedand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 300 , build a story around him , and they will care if you 've done your job and they have any tears left to be wrung out of their skulls , those selfish bastards. 8 . I hide my hostility toward you , my readers , though I know beforehand that you are glancing through this book as you sit in the bathroom attuned to other activities , or as you wait in someone'sdownstairs den for that someone to announcehe 's ready , or as you wiggle and waggle around the library Browsing &; Drowsing shelf , thinking Expensive People must be a social guidebookto Philadelphia highlife. 9 . I observe just as much parallelism of paragraphingand sentence structure as I dare . ( Note that each of these remarks begins with " I. " Or did you already notice it , you clever son-of-a-bitch ? ) 1o . I hide my hostility toward my readers . Desiring change , counterpoint , contrast , or whatever it is called , I sometimes vary paragraphs , sentences , and even chapters , that is , one chapter carries forward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " background " and human interest , if there are any humans to interest . Other devices  --  for instance , my elaborate scheme of symbolism  --  I will leave unexplored , for my friends in the academic world to sniff out . But one influence I will admit is Melville , since I want to invest my story with as much significance as possible , taking two steps back for each single step forward , and therefore . . . P107Therefore you will allow me certain rhetorical flourishesand tricks , and the pathetic Melvillian device of enormous build-ups for flabby walk-ons  --  opening paragraphsand even entire chapters that pave the way concretelyenough while frisking about on a kind of ethereal abstract level in order to relate my confession to things sublime and infinite . I would n't mind a hesitant essay called " Rousseau and Everett : Liars or Saints ? " , or " Stendhal and Everett : Incest and Inscape , " for instance . Since I plan on committing suicide immediately after this memoir is finished I wo n't be around to throw a damp blanket into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories . You can trust me ! ( Did I mention the suicide plan yet ? I do n't think so . More of that soon . ) And my style too , bogged down with adjectives and adverbs and a wistful reluctance for verbs and nouns  --  this is my " grand style . " I have another , " colloquial style " or " just-a-good-kid style . " This is self-explanatory . The grand style , though , may well get on your nerves ( my stomach quivers when I embark on one of my Ciceroniantightropes ) , but it 's necessary , and I 'll explain why . I should have liked to write this memoir in epic form , in melodic and oratorical verse , preceded by the strumming of a lute , but unfortunately the time is past for such epics just as they all say the time is past for tragedy , and " Just How Dead Is the Novel ? " * So the best I can do to summon up the beauties of a past age is to juggle my syntax as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times closing my eyes and giving my fingers license to probe out what they will on the typewriter ,  |p108s|plattering  out loose spines of sentences with as much frantic desperation as one steers a soap-box cart down a sharply inclined plane , hoping for the best but not expectingit , with a pale bravado of a grimace , a grin , for the spectators standing uneasily on the sidewalk : yet conscious of the many times the splatter falls short , dribbles , vomited out with the sort of asthmatic gasp that emits rusty water from antique faucets or rusty blood from panting fat-encrusted hearts . This chapter must at one time or another throw up its hands in defeat ( " throw up " is a deliberate pun , part of a pattern of puns , my dear squeamish readers ! ) , and as good now as later ; indeed , it can have no natural endingbecause it has no beginning , being just an off-the-keys aside to aspiring writers who have never " taken the plunge . " I ca n't think of any final sentence for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I do n't  --  I would omit this chapter altogether . Yes , I think I would omit it , but I do n't want to mess up my page numbering . Ideally , I would go on at once from that pleasant little paragraph of a chapter , Chapter XX , to the following : So Nada stayed around the house and nursed me . She was the kind of woman who looks at you only when something has gone wrong  --  eye blackened , a length of stark white bone piercing your skin . But maybe I 'm being too hard on her . She was like any mother , I think , if this hypothetical mother had a prodigious intelligence ,  |p109a  romantic restlessness , and confused memories of a childhood that was , so I gathered , soured with tales of Russia , a dark planet all to itself . And if this mother was beautiful too , that 's important . Do n't crab about beautifulwomen and their immoral lives if you 're too ugly to have had the opportunity for immorality ; psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she was intelligent and imaginative and beautiful , and let 's blame a few hyperfunctioning glands and nodes as well . I think she was what most American women would like to be . Do n't sneer , do n't hiss . I am an amateur at life , and would it surprise you to know that I am only eighteen years old ? Eighteen , yes , but precocious . And I think that most American women would like to be Nada , just as Nada thought she would like to be Nada  --  that is , the image , the dream self that was Nada , not the real , unhappy , selfish , miserable , and rather banal person . You women , would n't you like to be Nada as she appeared to outsiders ? I hope you noted the coats , the clothes , the yellow cars , the house , furniture , parties , country club , etc . And she was also a writer ! " Why , I think that 's just wonderful ! " " How do you find time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nada of your own . If your income is above a certain level you 'd need her to show it off , would n't you ? That pleasant , sandy-faced woman you married would fade into a living room 's beige walls if Nada walked into the room , not just because she was beautiful but because she had . . . whatever it was certain women have , I do n't pretend to know . Your wife supposes herself chic , and salesladies flatterp110her , but Nada did n't need anyone 's flattery . You 'd rather have Nada , bitch that she was , and notice other men 's envious stares . The reality would be hell , but then reality is always hell . Nada , Nada , Nada .. . If this sounds delirious it is because I was a little delirious . There was something so vicious and final about their argument the night before that I knew she was leaving . I think I knew it before she did . All that day she wandered in and out of my room , she sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote hand on my feverish brow , glancing at me with the dim , mild surprise of a person noticing life in a store dummy or in a corpse . I never meant anything to her , never ! I was perhaps some outlandish protoplasmic joke Father had wished upon her one night late after a cocktail party . I was flesh and bone and blood and brain tagged Richard , and " Richard " must have evoked in her mind mechanical thoughts of guilt and responsibility and love . She loved me when she was happy . She loved me when she happened to notice me . She loved me if I was good , if Father was good , if she 'd been invited out both nights of a weekend , if the world was going well , if the humidity was low and the barometer agreeable : whereas I loved her always , when she was a bitch or when she was saintly , lovely or ugly , with short shining hair or long greasy hair . . . I loved her and what good did it do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person 's life , " Nada began , trying to smooth out the wrinkles in my sheet with her hand , " when one simply has to shake himself free . You remember how your little puppy Spark used to shake water off himself ? Was n't that cute ? Well , " she said , her eyes vague with the impropriety of thisP111metaphor , " well , everyone must free himself of impossiblepresures , of restraints and burdens that suffocatehim . " " If you leave this time , do n't bother coming back , " I said . " There is nothing personal , never anything personal in freedom , " Nada went on , maybe not hearing me or not caring , " freedom is just a condition one has to achieve . It is n't a new place or a new way of living . It 's just a condition like the air that surrounds the earth . VYc ca n't breathe without it but  --  " " I know all about the air ! " I shouted . " So forget it ! Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Forget everything ! Shut up and get out of here ! " And she stood , quiet and serious , looking at me the way she looked at Father or women with their hair in rollers out on the street or the messes neighborly dogs made on our lawn . Her face was magnificent and pale , her eyes dark , a little demented , as if tiny curving pieces of glass had been fitted over them for some weird theatricalpurpose . Oh , I do n't know ! I do n't know what she looked like ! I watched and watched her for years . I stared at her and loved her . I have photographs of her in my desk drawer that I finger and caress and still I do n't know what she looked like ; she passed over from being another person into being part of myself . It was as if Nada , my mother , had become a kind of embryonic creature stuck in my body , not in a womb maybe but a part of my brain . How can you describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all impossible , a mess . . . P112For instance , let me revert to an earlier memory . I am eight years old and asthmatic . Nada nurses me , fusses over me , dresses me in Junior Collegiate Togs : resentful of my sickness for eleven solid sulky days , on the twelfth day she suddenly blossoms with love . Yes , good . All this is familiar enough . Nada  --  " Call me Nadia , Nadia , " she pouts prettily  --  Nada blooms and swells with love for me , her son . It 's a mystery what is behind it  --  who knows ? An argument with Father ? An overheard remarkat someone 's party questioning Mrs. Everett 's motherliness ? An accidental glance at my red-and-white blotched , mealy face ? An article in a doctor 's waiting room titled " Do You Harbor Unconscious Hostilities toward Your Child ? " ? Most things remain mysteries . Nada bundles me up and piles me in the car , not today will she leave me , not for a moment , absolutely not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will " stick together " and " tell each other everything . " When I was eight I had little idea of the vast world beyond our village , and so I could not yet imagine the fabulous attraction every other part of the world might have for Nada . I was ignorant then and safe . She takes me to the Village Gourmet Shop on that day , to buy specialties of Chinese and Malayan and Viennese cooking , wrapped up in trim white packages and never showing a bit of that streaky , watery blood that shows through packages bought at theP113plebeian supermarkets Nada detested . No blood , nothing . Cleanliness . She takes me along to the library ( another library , an innocent library , with a gaudy bulletin board in honor of Halloween , perhaps , announcing on orange posters the " Village Literary Society Will Meet Nov. 5  --  Discussion : How to Relate to Beatnik Poetry " ) . A lovely library  --  how I love libraries , any and all libraries , those sanctuaries for the maimed and undanceable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myopic , asthmatic . . . Few are the flirtations in a library , I insist , though Nada never had to search far for an adventure . Few are the assaults , physical or verbal . Libraries exist for people like me . And beautiful , heartbreaking , are the chance encountersin a library  --  that reverent hushed tone , that respectful , resigned seriousness even the most flighty of ladies can not help  --  all these are beautiful . For , in front of that very bulletin board a lady in a powder-velvet lavender hat stopped to chat with my Nada , a handsome , ageless woman of forty or so , gloved , nicely shod , friendly . " We would be so very , very honored if you would come to our little meetings sometime , " the lady whispered . She indicated the orange poster . " Of course we 're just amateurs but we absolutely love to read . We 're just wild about literature . Especially the very latest things . And the oldest things too , I mean the classical things that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come talk to us about your own creative writing ? Please think it over , we 'd be so grateful ! Next month is my turn to present a talk . I 'm in charge of the Italian Renaissance and it 's such a responsibility . I get so frightened standing in front of a group , but the minute I begin I forget all my nervousness ... "  |p114And  Nada takes me merrily along with her to the florist 's , where she orders some expensive flowers for a party or something soon due at our house , and the foppish young man behind the counter stares at her with that awed reserve , that grudging admiration , that the effeminate male must acknowledge in the presence of a beautiful woman . I see all this , and more . Such memories come back to me in my sick states , snares of the past . what sorry past I have . And she whisks me off to the next stop , the El Dorado Beauty Salon , where few childrenare brought and those who are brought spend their sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , not Richard , good asthmatic Richard , content to sit in a harmless unpadded chair , staring . How lovely the El Dorado Beauty Salon is ! ( I wonder if it still stands . ) Imagine a panoramic confusion of plush pink and fragile gold , of slick plastic evergreens perched high atop plastic pillars . Imagine the sweet , lisping strains of music that seem to be engendered out of the very air itself . Imagine the many ladies moving about , smoking cigarettes , their hair bunched up in dozens of pink rollers , like bobbins . Imagine the forbidden archways , done in gold , with baroque signs above them : Tinting Room . Pedicure Room . Wig Room . Electrolysis Room . A glimpse of more beauty inside , ornate mirrors , black porcelain sinks , stools , couches , big gold ashtrays . Ah , this is the other side of suburbia 's public heaven I  --  the wings , the backstage , the private dressing rooms of the beautiful . Richard sits still , alone and hard of breath . A harmlesschild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what violencelies leaden in that tube of a body , that wheezing reed . Eight years old and looking more like six , behind his thick glasses he sits dutifully and awaits his mother.  |p115Back  and forth before him stroll ladies of monstrous appearance  --  some of them dressed in very sheer , flimsy outfits of blue with El Dorado stitched on the collars , the outfits worn for special rinses , tintings , bleachings , and who knows what other rare chemical changes . Atop their heads are masses of plastic cones and cylinders , some of them enormous as tin cans , others small as my little finger , which is fairly small . They stroll about , smoking , chatting , quite content . Other ladies , grounded , sit beneath great blowing hairdryersand smoke and leaf through fashion magazines . A Negro woman of feline suppleness sits before one of the ladies , doing her nails . A cart on two big wheels , like a flower cart , and indeed it is an imitation flower cart , is set before the lady and on it are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely surgical in appearance . The Negro woman chatters happily as she does her customer 's nails . Pink seems to be the only acceptable color ; red is out . Pink nails . Pink toenails . Pink lips . Some ladies wear , wrapped over their profusionof bobbins , a netlike thing of pink , which is tied loosely in back and which gives them the dreamy , exotic look of having been pulled up from the sea , a perfumy sea that is their true element . My Nadia is for the moment behind a screen of slick plastic ferns , in the hands of a Negro woman who washes hair . Three Negro women wash hair behind the ferns . Forever and ever , day after day , they wash hair behind those ferns . Nada is made to sit back , her chair is partiallycollapsed and her hair drawn down into a black porcelain sink ; so strangely passive is she , so wondrously obedient , that it is possible for me to think she is not so unusual a woman : she could be any woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? Could any other woman have made me what I am ? Now the washing is over , Nada 's chair is brought back up and she is sitting , making a face , and the good handy Negro woman wraps a white towel around her head . End of the first step . I pick up a copy of Vogue with a ripped cover so that Nada will not see me watching her . She stands , she leaves the vale of ferns and crosses to a larger area , all mirrors and gold and waxy fake flowers in big black vases . Women everywhere ! Nada passes through them , to a certain chair , a certain man . Ile is Mr. Stanevicus , a very popular hair stylist , very expensive . Mr. Stanevicus eyes Nada with cool indifference . I have to inch my chair out a little so that I can see everything , though it might break my heart . With Vogue on my meager lap I look up to watch Nada , jealous of Mr. Stanevicus and resentfulof his indifference , his flippant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits , he drapes a white cloth around her , he stands with all his weight on one foot while he questions her about something , then his razor begins , his hands move deftly about her wet humble head , and the danger she is in suddenly terrifies me . Is it possible that Nada might die ? Some day die ? That her lovely blood might be spilled ? I open Vogue hastily and find myself staring down upon a photograph of Mrs. Stanislav Proctor , a beautiful woman with hair snipped shorter than mine , slicked back , smoothed to the skull , her eyes fixed up elaborately with thin rims of rhinestones on the eyelids , and eyelashesthick as fern or ivy in a sumptuous garden  --  heavy , heavy eyelashes , sooty tangles . She stares at me from under these lashes . Decked out in a pilot 's outfit of gold and silver , she wears boots that dazzle the eye so that oneP117cannot tell if they are gold or silver or another precious substance ; her gloves are nets of silver through which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her left arm she carries her pilot 's helmet , a large helmet decorated with sequins . Careless also is the unzipped front of her cockpit suit , which shows an alarming dip down into the pale privacy of her bosom . My eight-year-old 's eyes sting , lured down into such depths . A caption tells me that she and her cousin , the famous diplomat Hendrick Hundt , have been flying private planes since their childhood and that they hold world records . I turn the page and here is another beautiful woman , with shoulder-length wild hair and large sunglasses over her eyes . She is the Duchessa of Vilesia , wife of Silas Hobbit the movie-maker , and she is modeling her custommadeermine hunting outfit in preparation for an expeditionto the Arctic . The lovely Duchessa of Vilesia ! Even her knee-length boots are of soft ermine , and her pale , pale skin has the downy look of some magic texture , hardly ordinary skin . Careless in the crook of her arm is a rifle with a powerful scope . Behind her on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moose 's head , stuffed , upon whose nose someone has jauntily stuck a pair of sunglasses that are the exact copy of the Duchessa'showtruly conquered is that beast ! I look up . A few yards away appears a handsome lady of about fifty . She takes off her fur-trimmed coat and gives it to an attendant , she approaches one of the chairs and is welcomed into it by another male stylist , much like Mr. Stanevicus ; a solid lady with thick , shining blond hair and platinum fingernails . But , alas , at once the wig comes off in the young man 's hands : out comep118pins , fixtures , and the wig is rigorously brushed while the lady herself sits pallid and suddenly ugly in her chair , with her own flat , skimpy brown hair reflected back to her in the mirror . She is given the wig and brushes it herself , fondly and vigorously , while her stylist begins to brush her hair , her own hair , and the two of them performexactly the same motions , their arms moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other brushing a head . I turn the pages of my magazine . It is all I have , all I 've been given . Time passes . An hour passes . Another hour passes , very slowly . My eyes are puffed up from the hairspray in the air , or the smoke , or the perfume , or the swampy female heat that is everywhere about me . At last Nada appears , a new Nada , with her dark hair cut short and shaved on her neck but teased up to a peculiar height and looped down upon her pale forehead in snaky ringlets . My Medusa ! I am leaden but her appearance wakes me ; I manage to get out of the chair by myself , but I look so feeble that Nada stoops and says , " Are you having an attack ? " The finest moments of my life have been those when I was able to tell my mother truthfully that I was not having an attack . When we get to the car Nada notices with alarm the packages of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with watery , sticky streaks of blood . In disgustshe throws them out . She throws all three packages in a barrel marked FILL ME UP . ... And so she did exist outside me , I can see her or half-see her , she did exist , she was a quite independent being . Two Nadas existed  --  the one who was free and who abandoned me often , and the other who has becomefixed irreparably in my brain , an embryonic creaturep119of my own making , my extravagant and deranged imagination  --  andI loved them both , I swear that it was both of them I craved . And so when Nada said to me on that day , " There is nothing personal , never anything personal in freedom , " I understood that the free , restless Nada was asserting herself , and that I could not hold her back . If you leave this time , do n't bother to come back .. . Father had flown to South America again on a Wednesday , and when he returned on Saturday Nada was gone . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus ( a station wagon without markings ) and ran boyishly up our front walk , to show a possibly watching Nada that I was healthy again , and when I opened the front door the foyer smelled of her luggage , a smell I did n't know I knew so well , and there came Ginger shuffling apologetically toward me , rubbing her nose with a wretched , distracted , embarrassed air that told me everything I needed to know . I took from her the letter Nada had left me and went with dignity up to my room . I did not cry . I lay on my bed and looked up at the ceiling of this strange house , wondering how I had come here , who I was , to whom I belonged  --  which harnessed set of adults  --  but knowingthere was a hard , sharp kernel of fire in my stomach that had to be kept from bursting out into flame . And did it burst out ? Did it ? Everywhere else in my body , flooding into my brainp120and my poor aching eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inert , dry-mouthed sleep of the kind drowned men sleep , tossing and turning gently on the ocean floor . So I slept and I did not dream . Ginger scratched and snuffled outside the door and finally knocked , but I told her in Nada 's precise stagey voice that I was " all right , thank you , " and finally she left , and the day turned into night and I slept , I slept peacefully , and the next day dawned without my noticing , and I woke to hear Father yelling into my face unintelligible nightmare words about some bitch who had run out on us for the third time . Thereupon followed a strange idyllic interlude lastingten days . If Father received any communication from Nada he did not tell me about it . We journeyed about together , he and I , two feckless , energetic bachelors , taking in movies , having dinner out at sunny , friendly restaurants in which children like myself were welcome , going to a " live " wrestling match all the way downtown where the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar smoke and everything fake and honest in its fakery , dreamily honest ! And we took in late late movies on the television set in Father 's room ( he and Nada , sad to tell , had not shared a room for several years ) and ate potato chips and pickles and other slop together until two in the morning , sleepy , slow , oddly pleased with each other , the way men on a slow , sinking ship must be pleased with the companions fate has doledp121out to them  --  who are they to complain , after all ? And we went for odd meaningless drives in and around FernwoodHeights , Father with a cigar stuck in his teeth and his sad , pouched eyes roaming about the late-winter hillsides . One evening , coming out of the Fernwood movie house , we encountered Tia Bell and a middle-aged woman who looked like an aunt , and Tia strode over to us and seized Father 's hand . " Elwood , is it true ? " she said . Father withdrew his hand with dignity  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no idea what she was talking about . But had n't Natashya . . . had n't she . . . ? Father explained that his wife had gone east to visit relatives , that was all . He stared into Tia 's widened , sympathetic eyes and lied with no skill , so abrupt and reckless that Tia must have admired him for it . No doubt she went home and called all of his and Nada 's " friends " to praise Father for his stoicism . Father took me down to work with him . He had his own office , and there was a hallway of smaller offices that were " under him . " He had his own pert , cute little clipped-haired secretary , so much more pleasant than Nada that it was painful to see . He was a vice-president of some kind , I have yet to explain . I do n't know what he did though he explained it to me several times that day . He showed me his company 's product , a strand of very thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window behind him . ( This company was GKS , I think . Before this he worked for OOP , and afterward for BWK . ) Oh , he was a fine giant of a man still , with his hair grown a little thin on one side of his head but thick on the other , and one shoulder maybe sinking a little more than ever toward the earth , and his suit wasp122rumpled and twitching with good humor , and the tip of the white handkerchief in his breast pocket was drooping , and one of his socks was royal blue and the other navy blue ; and his teeth looked stained , for when Nada left us ordinary sanitation measures were suspended , and as he held the wire up for me to see , his big thick fingers were trembling . ' We were grim and happy together , like two bachelors . Sometimes I caught him glancing at me as if thinking , Who is this scrawny little bastard I 'm stuck with ? But then he would smile like a large Boy Scout and offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around all the time , to give to office girls and all the other simple , eager-to-please souls of the sort that swarmed in the part of the world he controlled . Here he had a handsome , broad desk cluttered with things that looked important , and a buzzer system , a few telephones , many loose plastic pens , a letter opener of brass , a paperweight of heavy purplish stone , anythingone might want in an office . At home he had nothing . Here the other men and the office girls smiled at him and knew who he was ; at home there was no one to smile , and anyway he was nothing . But he was a brave comrade for me in those days , allowing me to skip school , as if Nada 's escape were a kind of holiday , and I want to record how good he was to me up until the time he too cracked . This happened one evening after we came home from a bowling alley . We were both lousy bowlers , and I think that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who can not bear to be outdone at anything . I had heard about him from boys at Johns Behemoth whose fathers knew him , or who had friends who knew him , and the rumor was that Elwood Everettp123admired men like himself , young men , who did everythinghe had done at that age except for the one final fatal step that suggested they were perhaps equal to him  --  then the game was over . This was a joke among people who knew , but Father never knew , thinking himselfbroad-minded and fair as any American . The fiststriking , back-slapping , ale-drinking bowlers at the Oak Woods bowling lanes we went to got on his nerves , not because of their lower-class happiness , but because of the way their pins crashed and flew and fell , rolling helplessly at the back of the alleys , like creatures fallen with side-splitting laughter . Ah , we both hated those men ! And he kept ducking back into the sleazy bar off the alleys while I bravely plodded around in my too large and ludicrously stiff bowling shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , so that on the way home his driving was extravagant and caused people to honk their horns at him . All this got him into the mood , but it was n't until he had downed a glass of some special Irish whisky that he began to blubber . Have you ever seen a large man blubber ? Well , perhapsblubbering always indicates large men ; small men whimper , I suppose . I 'm large now myself , and I blubber every night and sometimes while I write this memoir , when a word or two releases in me whole floods of salty tears . Father did indeed blubber , wiping his nose on the edge of his forefinger , but he did more than that  --  goddamhim , excuse him , forgive him  --  he began to talk . " Now , Dickie , your mother is unstable . We know that . ' We are rational about that , we understand , " he began . He was looking at me man to man ; nothing terrifies a boy more . " But we are human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings ca n't always control themselves . Look , I 'm not ashamed of crying . Do n't be embarrassed , son . I 'm not ashamed and do n't you be ashamed . I 'm an honest man . I have nothing to hide . " He poured himself more whisky and seemed about to offer me some , then remembered who I was . " We want to understand her sickness and forgive her and make her well , Dickie , my poor kid , but it 's awful hard when she 's such a . . . she 's such a bitch , why hide it ? Everybodyknows it , why hide it ? " Ile laughed . His laughter at such times was bearlike and wheezing . " Women in this country , Dickie , this good old America , are all trying to be like Natashya , and Natashya has succeeded , oh yes , she has succeeded , she has everything she wants and then does n't want it , she does n't know what she wants , she never does any work  --  good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was living in a room with a hotplate and cockroaches when I found her , but you wo n't hear about that ! Bebe and Mimi and Fifi and Tia and all the girls wo n't hear about that , and you can bet your ass that Dean what's-his-name , that fairy with the English accent , you can bet he wo n't hear about it , that phony son-of-a-bitch with his phony vocabulary ! Aggrandizement , he said the other night  --  what the hell kind of talk is that ? He pulled it out of the air ! And talking about some poem to Lesbia  --  what the hell kind of talk is that with women present ? Those intellectual bastards always get onto things like that . Their minds are filthy , and it comes out disguised as a joke . Where I come from , buster , you do n't joke about serious things like that , anyway not with women around , and I 'll warm your skinny little ass if I ever hear youp125talking smart . You understand ? One of us is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bitch of a mother , that 's for goddam sure " Now , look . Look . Sit still . I want to tell you how things are , I want to make it all clear and aboveboard , " he said , sobbing again so his nose began to run , and I sat in a agony of terror at what he might say . " One of us is going to tell the truth ! Oh , not her  --  not her ! Fancy little Natashya with one hand in my pocket and the other inside my trousers  --  not her , she wo n't tell it , but I will ! I do n't lie ! All your life you can look back on this talk and think how your daddy told you the awful truth , no matter how it hurt him , and how your mother would n't give you the time of day if you were drowning in the bathtub , and you remember that " What 's wrong , where are you going ? Sit down . Sit still . It all began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that baby was you , " he said , slowing a moment to get his bearings and bending over me with one arm out behind me along the back of the sofa and the other extended , his big fingers closed about the glass . " Yes , that baby was you ! Jimmy  --  I mean Dickie  --  what the hell am I saying ? Jimmy 's my kid brother , he 's forty now , how 's that for a scream ? My kid brother is forty ! No , you 're Dickie  --  Dickie  --  that baby was you . Now you know where babies come from , do n't you ? They teach it in school now or somewhere , so you know ... Stop crying for Chrissake , I 'm not going to hit you , you think I 'm like your mother ? Shut up that crying ! It started with her pregnant , and maybe she wanted to flit around a little more and blush over the complimentsshe got for her ass , or her stories , or both  --  you know her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely young girl of twenty and already cracking up , selfish like an oyster you ca n't pry open and the only way you can get it to recognize you is to smash it against the wall ! Well , she was pregnant and stayed out late , sitting around brooding in the park and maybe picking up stray niggers that would n't object to a round back in the bushes , even with a nut that would n't wear stockingsto her own wedding until I said to her , What the hell are you pulling ? What the hell ? Just what the hell ? So she knuckled under and wore them no matter how hot it was that day , and that was that , but then when she got pregnant she went nuts again and said how she wanted to have an abortion and stayed away in some goddam hotel and had the doctor all lined up " What ? No , sit still , the bathroom can wait . You can go to the bathroom all night long when I get through ! She had the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of money , and she called me up and started screaming over the phone and calling me every filthy name she knew that the niggers or somebody taught her , maybe those fake Russians that were crawling all over New York and trying to write poetry  --  they think they 're so much better than the Reds but I say shit , at least the Reds stayed over on their side of the ocean and that 's more than all those goddam other immigrants are doing , and I do n't exclude those spies and crud coming up and landing in New York , and it 's the same way in England , do n't worry ! Same goddam mess ! And then she called me up next morning and said no , she did n't want the abortion , and she talked about it the way you talk about buying a new car , you think you should wait until fall to economize , then she changed her mind again and said she did want it , she could n't live with me and couldn'tp127have any kid of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew kid , I suppose , I would n't doubt that , she 's balled more Jews , Dickie-boy , than I have blackballedin my clubs , and I kid you not . But listen , " he said , his voice breaking , " listen . She 's run out again and it 's just us and we got ta stick together , what if she does n't come back ? What if she does n't come back ? We got ta forgive her , she ca n't help it if she 's a bitch and her father or somebody was nuts . We got ta forgive her and understand and ... " And he waddled his big buttocks over across the cushion to me and lowered his face onto my shoulder , weeping . He snuffled and bellowed and the whisky glass tilted so that whisky ran onto my leg and down inside my shoe , and I did n't care , I just sat there waiting for it to be over so that I could sleep . Even the nausea in my stomach was pressed down by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God I 'm going to die . Thank God I wo n't be alive after this . I stayed in that languorous trance for a few days . Then , on my birthday , I had enough foresight to ask Farley Weatherun if I could visit with him overnight , since Father would take me out to a restaurant and for dessert a simpering waitress would bring a cake adorned with a giant sparkler to our table , and I was n't up to it , not quite up to it . So Farley said sure , why not , though it was a little strange because we were n't especially goodP128friends , and we were fooling around with a few other kids in the dormitory when a gay , floating sensation rose in me and buoyed up my heart and I told them excuse me , I 'd be back in a minute , and ran down the corridor and outside without bothering with my coat . Intoxicated , serene , and mindlessly happy , I floated across the campus , and no stares or glares caught my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to nuts . We were brilliant , we johns Behemoth brats , but we were nuts , and why hide it ? But there are nuts and nuts , just as there are mothers and mothers , and far better to be a serene nut than one who overturns tables . Oh , what did I have in mind when I ran out ? Not a little was I buoyed along the walks by a pleasant thought having to do with how I could get her back , or how I could discover why she had left  --  what was lacking in me  --  how I could amend it , humbly and with slicked-down hair , a good kid , just a good kid trying to survive , prelobotomized and prepubescent ! Now I beseech the fates to visit me once more with that eerie happiness , that dazzle of nutty chaste innocencethat flooded my body on that day , seven-thirty on a March Wednesday , my eleventh birthday and first deathday ! I beseech the fates , the saints , Christ , and God Himself in his gold foil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glow of that fire ! I swear to you , my readers , that I was at last coming alive , and I had been in a trance for many days . Do you know what it is to be sleeping and yet awake , awake and yet sleeping ? How you ca n't shake it off , ca n't quite open your eyes ? My God , nothing is more terrifying ! I had sunk into that kind of stupor listening to them argue , throughp129the laundry chute , and rose temporarily out of it only to ebb back again when Nada tried to smooth out my sheet with her hand and told me everything I expected , and then I had sunk heavily into it when Father wept on my shoulder and told me ... what he had told me  --  I wo n't go into that again ( words on lavatory walls are poetry compared to Father 's man-to-man combat ) , and now I was coming out of it again because  --  do you see ?  --  it seemed to me I was going to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of the Main Building but everything was dark . Did I let that stop me ? No more than temporarily ! I vaulted over the side of the little brick wall and ran around the corner , on the path that saidDELIVERYMEN USE THIS ENTRANCE and that was offlimitsfor us scholars . The backdoor was locked and darkened too , but without hesitating , in my warming , dazed excitement , I tapped at the windowpane with my gnawed knuckle and it broke like magic , shattering down upon me . I brushed everything aside , splinters , slivers , tears ( was I crying ? ) , and crawled through the window , severing a small vein in my leg but never mind , never mind . Once inside , I ran along the dark corridor and even sped past my destination , braking suddenly and skidding into a porcelain drinking fountain , but whirling about , and there it was  --  the Records Room , the sanctuarywhere so many secrets lay entombed about us Johns Behemoth boys and we powerless to know them . I got inside this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rusty and cranky , and the blood that came from somewhere was slippery as hell , and once down inside the room I threw on with a triumphant flick of my wrist a whole galaxy of flickering , shiveringp130fluorescent lights , and there it was ! A wall of filing cabinets ! This was heaven itself ! My heart was poundingwith excitement as if I were about to witness a vision . I ran , slipping and sliding , to the drawers and groped around looking for " E , " unable to find it for an agonizing few seconds , until I remembered sharply that " E " was near the beginning of what was called the alphabet . I yanked out the big drawer and pawed through the manila folders , panting , gasping , and when I found " Everett " a cloud seemed to pass over my mind and I was quite mad with happiness , but only for an instant . Then I yanked it out . I slashed through the papers  --  papers of graphs and numbers that looked like the exam I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled out by an indifferent quack who charged Nada sixty dollars , and my five letters of recommendation from former teachers , gibbering with enthusiasm no doubt , but I had n't any time for them , and finally I found what I wanted . It was the IQ score . There were two papers and one said 153 and the other , dated more recently , said 161 . I stared from one paper to the other until it dawned upon me what those numbers meant . Then the hot kernel of fire burst in my stomach and I began to sob . I sobbed with rage . What did she want from me then ? What more could she want ? I could n't do any better . I had even pushed myself beyond what I could do , and still it was n't enough for her  --  I was n't enough for her  --  and what else could I do ? I tore the papers in pieces . I picked the rest of the folder up from the floor and tore it , and I yanked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later a great black-andorangebruise was to appear , big as a grapefruit , on my thigh ) , and suddenly there were folders everywhere ,  |p131flying  in the air , being torn , struck , ground underfoot , and I picked up a stool and sent it crashing into the flickering fluorescent tubing overhead with a strength I did n't know I had , and I swear to you  --  yes , I formally swear  --  that never in my life until that moment had I truly been alive ! Never ! Now every cell and tube was throbbing with a joy that had no humor , was beyond humor , and my bones creaked , so much was demanded of them , and the little muscle in the center of me , my delicate , wheezing heart , swelled like any fine organ to take on this challenge and sent blood pumping to all nooks and corners of my body ! It was wonderful ! Wonderful ! I yanked more drawers out , I skidded on the papers , I crashed sideways into someone 's desk and turned my rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizing a jar of ink that crashed against the wall not a half-second later , and the splattered droplets mingled with my hot , happy tears , and by the time they came for me I had thought of something further , the best and happiest trick of all : I was vomiting over everything , summoning up from my depths the most vile streams of fluid that had ever graced any Record Room in history . That was the end of Johns Behemoth for me , and it got back to me from Gustave , via his mother , via the Spoons , from the very mouth of Dean Nash himself , that he had always had reservations about the Everetts ,  |p136And  life without Nada was a surprise , because it was so much like life with Nada . We discovered that she had n't been around the house that much . It was good to discover that ! " What do we care , huh ? What the hell , " Father would say in a brave , gruff voice to me as we raided the refrigerator at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted his stomach , saying to what few people stopped in around five for drinks , mostly businessmen on their way through the city , " Really puttingit on , are n't I ? " And he 'd pat himself as if patting a dog . With Nada went our old maid Ginger , for reasons I did not understand , and now we had a nice white , middle-aged lady with a kindly brow , and she lived in the maid 's room above the kitchen , whereas Ginger had always been a nuisance : someone always had to drive her down to the bus stop , where she boarded a bus for a ninemileride down into the city , and out of Fernwood , BornwellPass , Pleasure Dells , and Oak Woods . The first time I saw Florence a strange thing occurred . In pulling off her black , lint-specked gloves she made the same gesture that Father had made when he showed me his product , that strand of wire . Father had held the wire stretched between his hands , as if presenting somethingsacred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugging at the tips of the fingers , and as she said something to me  --  " Real cold for April , eh ? "  --  she paused and the glove remained where it was , half on and half off , the middle finger stretched out grotesquely . I was out of school for two weeks . It took about two weeks to arrange for a transfer to Fernwood Junior High ( where , incidentally , I never ended up ) , and anywayFather thought it was a good idea for me to " rest . "  |p137So  I lay around the big house , staring outside . The lawn was greening up . When Florence came in the room I left , not wanting to be pitied . Florence was always vacuuming and polishing and running water furiously . There was a soapy , steelwoolish , pitying odor about her , just as there had been an odor of something confused and fragrant and dark about Nada . But I really did n't think about Nada , I want you to know . I did n't think much about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess , a failure at eleven , but instead I just lay around and listened to my heart beat , wondering if it might stop someday soon and not caring much . I rested . I lost weight . There was one room in the house we did n't " bother with , " and that was Nada 's . Florence did not go into it with her vacuuming apparatus and rags and polish , nor did she allude to it once Father told her not to " bother with " it . She nodded and understood , as if all houses had one special nasty room . I remembered N ada 's room from the day Mr. Hansom had taken us through . That had been the best room on the second floor , with a lovely bay window looking out onto the sunny side yard with its fringe of evergreens so that it seemed as if you were balanced atop a magic forest  --  that magic , sinister room where Nada made noises on her typewriter and spent her secret hours away from us . Sometimes when Father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that room , that Room , that room , thinking : What would happen if I went in-side ? And one day I did . It was still a nice room but very messy , as you might expect . You knew something was odd about the person who 'd lived here just by the way books were strewnp128around , lying flat on the rumpled bed , opened and helplesson their backs in the dust on the floor . Not very many books , just scattered messily . Her desk had been pulled over to the bay window , by Nada herself evidently , for the green carpet had four sharp streaks in it made by the desk 's legs . The desk had been cleared off . The typewriter was gone . Everything was gone . A cheap aluminum desk lamp had fallen onto the floor and lay there exposing its bulb to me . I picked it up and put it back on the desk . Nada 's work had always been forbidden . I would as soon have hidden in her shower and surprised her there as read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me not to do the one than she had told me not to do the other . I knew ! I was sensitive and intelligent , that sort of kid . But now all that was over , and I rummagedthrough her drawers  --  pencils were always darting out toward me , rolling noisily  --  and decided that I would see what the secret was . There were drawers of scrap paper and some yellowing manuscripts , but when I began to read them I felt dizzy and a little nauseated , so I put them back for another day . I had to go slowly . Sweating , absurd , I opened a notebook at random and stared at the lazily scrawled entries : 1 . Look up antique shop B mentioned. 2 . Inside of car cleaned  --  tell them about chocolateR spilled . Was " R " me ? Was I just " R " to her ? Or was that a sign of affection ? I read on : NB NB NB Must read Hegel sometime .  |p139I  too must read Hegel sometime ; yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty blue lines faint like veins running down the page , and one wider , prettier red one at the top , like an artery : Idea for a story : honeymoon couple pick up hitchhiker ; ordinary talk , to the horrible , back to the ordinary again ; they let him off ; they drive away . That did n't sound like much of a story to me . Revise " Death and the Maiden " and change title . I wonder , did she do that ? Did she revise it and did she change the title ? Her simple loops and i 's and slashcrossedis and the agreeable slant of her writing pleased me . I could imagine her sitting up here , flooded with winter light , her hair shining and smoky and her face intent , absorbed in her writing , which took her so far beyond Father and me : There must be a thread of story somewhere but where ? the climax will be the death of X , but one must get past . The trouble is getting there ... and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of freedom . Certain central events  --  what the hell can they be ?  --  leading up to the death. " comic nihilism " senseless manic behavior in some natural setting . . . woods , flower bed . mysterious meetings , parallels . . . .  |p140Nada  was coming back to me slowly . I began to feel her in the room . I could smell her cigarette smoke and hear her restlessness . My heart pounded as I read : Idea for a short novel : the young man ( like J ? ) leads two lives , one public and the other secret . buys a gun . frightens people , does n't hurt them . I can stretch this out to three episodesbut no more , fine . . . then the fourth , when you 've been conditioned to the others , results in the murder : planned all along though maybe he did n't know it . ( Too corny ? Should he know it , or not ? ) The sniper . " The Sniper . " I 'll think of a theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her desk , surreptitious and impatient in her sacred room . My heart began to pound as if it knew something already that I myself did not know . Had I been a musician , I could have devised some moody thunder-haunted background for my tale , even though it would have turned out funny , there would have been a spiteful dignity to it . Had I been a painter , my patient friends , I would have devised a mural vast as my imagination , called " The Abortion that Failed , " and we would see a deep , dark pool that is sleep or night or death , and Nada 's long smoky hair drifting back into the darkness or drifting out from it ( you may take yourp141choice ) , and her face pale as it never was in life , her lips dreamy and parted upon a hesitant smile , her eyes vague , dark , lovely . Off to each side there would be the troops of well-wishers that attend every birth . Bebe , Minnie , Mimi , whatever their ludicrous names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father and Dean Nash and Mr. Spoon , men who are never naked but even in the presence of a Birth have their ties knotted up tight against their throats . And , everywhere the lushness and tranquillity of Fernwood , approached by great expanses of highways , expressways , winding , soaring , veering roads that seem impatient with the earth , mountains of junked cars , beer cans , and broken glass . In the mist a halfformed , embryonic child 's face , just the barest suggestion of a face , of a soul .. . The next day the door of Nada 's room was fixed with an expensive brass lock , and Father spoke to me in a modification of his man-to-man talk . This talk was cornradelybut shifty-eyed ; I preferred it to the other talk . " We 've got to stick together , the two of us , " he declared . For some reason we had n't had dinner yet and it was getting late , past seven-thirty . He said , patting my back , " Two bachelors rambling around together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . No secrets , see ? We made a deal that that certain somebody was n't going to have any power in this house any more . Right ? "  |p142He  was gentle enough with me , but I felt that his restless fingers might get out of control . " Do you want her to die ? " I said . " What , Dickie ? What ? " " Do you want her to die ? " He stared at me . " Now what the hell kind of talk is that , buster ? Look , now . Forget it . Absolutely forget it . You never said it and I never heard it . Any kind of morbid unnatural thoughts like that . " He began shaking his large head . " Look , absolutely forget it . I mean , put it out of your mind . Neither of us heard that . " " I only meant  --  " " No . Forget it . " He was shaking his head with his eyes closed . " It 's that morbid , unnatural atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get in with some real normal kids , and you can play football or something . Right ? I think , yes , I think maybe that everything that happened happened for the good . I think maybe it did , when you look at it from a longrangeview . Right , buster ? " He had to fly to New York for a few days , so I spent my free time  --  free time !  --  down at the library , trying to look up Nada 's writing . I know now that none of us ever has any free time , it 's all being dearly paid for . But then I did n't know it ; I was exhilarated by being " free , " not just from Father but from Nada , because when I was engrossed in reading her stories I was freed from her as a person . My mother . I could sit in the comfortable , sleep-inducing leather chairs ranged around the empty fireplace at the library and read the stories of this strange , delicate woman and not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninvited . Around me clip-clopped Fernwood ladies in their expensive highp143heels , and a dreamy halo of perfume rose from each of them . They were people in a dream no matter how thunderous the sound of their shoes ! Occasionally two stopped to chat , rather loudly , and I could almost see their halos of perfume move together and overlap . They were all handsome , handsome women . I wonder what tiny lives and deaths have taken place in their bodies . Most of them were slim women , you know that . In other areas you might see fat flabby women , with upper arms that jiggle , but in Fernwood everyone is healthy , tanned from Jamaica and Bermuda , and restrained and slim , and if their upper arms do jiggle , you can be sure that their sleeves are always decorously long . Bebe Hofstadter came in , handsomer than the others , in an expensive light green suit and alligator purse and shoes . Her hair was newly tinted ; she looked as if she herself had just been set upon the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She selected from the Browse &; Leaf shelf a brightly jacketed book entitled The Care and Feeding of the Middle-Aged American Male . Then she turned , and before I could raise my book she saw me . " Richard Everett , " she whispered . She had identified me . She clip-clopped to me like a nurse , smiling . The halo of her perfume moved along with her , though jerkily , and folded me in it . She talked . Never once did she speak of Nada , as if Nada were dead , and her words flowed along with brightness and concern , mentioning the names of people I should have known , mentioning a sensationalnews event elaborated upon daily in the papers  --  " Is n't it just a shame ? A shame "  --  and something about football . This kind , lovely woman , as nice as she could be to one so miserable , but of course her kindnessp144meant nothing . By now you see that : all of Fernwood is kind , nice , generous , lovely , and it means nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that her husband was back from Japan , and he was going to take Gustave and a lovely girl cousin of Gustave 's to a concert the next night , and would I like to join them ? Her face was flushed with charity . I told her politely that , yes , yes , I would be very happy to join them . No one had been so good to me for a while , and there was an awful , shaky moment when I almost cried , but it passed . She began to talk again . Behind her , passing from the Browse &; Leaf shelf to the more demanding Fireplace Reading shelf , was a woman in a silvery , shiny coat . Her back , alas , was rather broad for Fernwood , and the tug of her shoulders on the material made its shiny weave catch the overhead light . I was put suddenly in mind of the silver balloon in the sky on that day when Nada and I were headed for the zoo . " Richard , are you all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . " " Are those your teeth chattering like that ? " " No . Yes , I 've got a cold , " I said wildly . My teeth bit at each other and settled in rigidly . They were not going to get loose and chatter again . I walked all the way home from the library . It was chilly for April , and I thought peacefully that I would catch a real cold , catch flu , catch pneumonia . The inertia of my body was already a kind of sickness , but a pleasant one . You do n't think sickness is pleasant ? Try it ! Lovely to lie there in sunny-smelling white sheets , legs and arms resting as if the blood in them has at last come to a stop  --  you do n't need anyone then . Only you healthyp145people need friends . You 're always running around , makingtelephone calls ; you have so much energy . But we sick people have no energy at all . We are freed from it . We do n't need anyone , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about dying and how pleasantthat might very well be , getting rid not only of everyoneonce and for all but getting rid of the desire to get rid of them and the desire for any kind of desire at all . As I walked home I felt how pleasant it was to be " free , " to be completely alone and to know it . Father was in New York and Nada was . . . Nada was also in New York , but of course it could n't be the same New York . Nada and Father would never meet , not even by accident . Seeing the two of them together , you knew that they could never have met , by accident or any other way , they could never have exchanged two words , never have married . Anyone could see that ! It was a lovely long walk . These spring days in Fernwood ! Everything , everything , is lovely in Fernwood ! To tell you all of the sloping lawns , evergreen screens ( planted at full growth ) , greening gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luxurious pleasures of their box-shaped houses , their fishponds , the glimpses of their colored maids at windows , washing windows that are already clean  --  ah , to tell you of these things would be to write another Paradiso , and we writers are better equipped to write of the Inferno and Purgatory , as you know . Before the rare beauties of the wealth of America a writer can do nothing  --  his " criticisms " are just envy and everyone knows it . But what can he do ? Little orchards , little cars , gray-white statues back in courtyards , half glimpsed , and gray-tweeded businessmen hoppingout the side doors , faces flushed with happiness andp146close antiseptic electric shaves , lawn crews wheeling expensivemowers from their trucks down planks to the streets , and painters rubbing their noses happily as they examine that three-story box that will cost the owner $3000 to have painted  --  what can I say ? What can I do besides present these things to you ? Why , you would n't venture into a Fernwood home without knowing beforehand that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feet on is a three-by-five $600 Aubusson , matching the living-room rug , and you would n't venture in without already knowing the rare fine smell of good wood and good wood polish that will greet you , and an odor of expensive roasted cashews set out in antique silver trays  --  just for you ! And you would n't peek into the " music room " without knowing beforehand that the great grand piano does not mean anyone in the house " plays " ; it is there because it is there , solid and polished . It is a world of property lines , surveyor 's papers , title deeds , abstracts , histories , and pedigrees , and in these mansions people do  --  do what ? Do they live ? Live ? What does that mean , to live ? If God remakes Paradise it will be in the image of Fernwood , for Fernwood is Paradise constructed to answer all desires before they are even felt . Heaven and earth converge like two friendly halos of perfume , overlapping , sinuous , and the crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to please your eye , and there is never any contrast between what is said and what is done , what is done and what is intended , what is intended and what is desired  --  everythingruns together . And these people are not even rich , do n't misunderstand me . They would blush to be called " rich " and stammer defenses . This is a story of the middle-class : you see , the men worked . And if it occurs to you , my clever reader , that there is irony intended here  --  that Richard Everett , miserable slob as he is , is being cute and praising Fernwood while ( beneath it all ) he despises Fernwood  --  you are wrong . Wrong . Fernwood is an angel 's breath from heaven . It is as real as any dream , more real than a nightmare , terribly real , heavily real , as real as our neighbor 's lovely Borzoi dog leaping onto your chest or Nada 's grand piano sliding onto your toe . Fernwood is Paradise and it is real ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has done no better than Fernwood , that God Himself has done no better , that no other society , no other world , is quite equal to it . And if it turns out that there is someoneleaning over my shoulder as I write this , some muse , some evil genius who is perhaps my mother  --  just perhaps  --  thenyou are not to assume that this evil genius is " using " me as an ingenu-narrator , no , you are not . No irony . And what has all this to do with my pleasant feelings about sickness , and my " freedom " ? You must remember that everything runs together in an autobiography . It is only in fiction that there are clear transitions between events . When I turned up our walk , panting up our hill , a man sitting in a creme-de-menthe-colored car at the curb jumped out . " Richard Everett ? " he said . He hurried up to me . Six feet two , briefcase-carrying , a rapid , competent smile , keen eyes ; he shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook . " I would appreciate it very much if you 'd answer a few questions for me . Nothing extraordinary , " he said . " The subject underp148question today is Charles Spoon , who is applying for maximum security clearance . Mr. Everett , how well do you know Mr. Spoon ? " " Mr. Spoon ? I guess not at all . " He chuckled as if this reply had no meaning . " Would you say , Mr , Everett , that Mr. Spoon strikes you as a man of integrity ? Or not ? " " I do n't know him , I guess . " " From your necessarily limited point of view , what would you say ? " " I do n't know  --  " " You are uncertain ? " " I guess so . " He frowned , about to write . " Is that your final consideration ? You are uncertain about him ? " " I guess so . " He wrote this down . His face cleared and he smiled again . " Has Mr. Spoon ever betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boasting , telling of family or business secrets , implying political connections in high places ? Boasting of physical powers , of mental agility ? Have you any reason to suspect that he is being blackmailed ? Has he ever  --  think carefully  --  has he ever made any proposals to you of a certain type ? " " No . " " Are you sure ? " " I only saw him a few times from the doorway  --  " " What doorway ? " " In our house . " " What was he doing in the doorway ? " " No , I was in the doorway . " " What were you doing there ? "  | " Spying . " His cheeks reddened . He said lightly , " You have a sense of humor , Mr. Everett , well developed for one so young . According to my notes , you have been expelled from Johns Behemoth , your mother has left this house and is living in New York City with someone named Sheer  --  and we know all about him too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bison and BWK . So there is no point in hiding the truth , Mr. Everett . " " Who ? What 's Sheer ? " I said . " Who is Sheer ? Who 's that ? " " Our subject is Spoon , " he said . " Would you say , Mr. Everett , that Mr. Charles Spoon is the type of man who could be trusted with secrets pertaining to our national security ? Your life , my life ? Would you want to trust this man with the life and death of our civilization ? " " I would n't trust anybody  --  " " Eh ? " " No , I would n't ! ' Who 's this Sheer ? " " You would n't trust him ? " " Who is Sheer ? Where are they ? " " So you would n't trust Spoon  --  that 's significant . You are the thirteenth person to suggest that you would n't trust Spoon with the life and death of our civilization . Mr. Everett , never mind about Sheer . I mentioned his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is no point in lying to me . " " I was n't lying , " I said miserably . " When there is no longer any point in lying , no one will lie , " he said gently . His eyelids were half closed ; he looked for a moment as if he were in the presence ofp150something sacred . Then he drew himself up to his full height and said in a brisk , snappy voice , " You look a little cold , kid . Why do n't you go inside ? Of course , you understand , do n't tell anyone about this . You under-stand ? " I undersood . This was my " freedom . " Expensive People could be subtitled " Children of Freedom . " I am too tired to go back and work in this secondary theme , about " freedom , " and the many children involved in my story , and anyway this is n't fiction , it 's life . " When there is no longer any point in lying , no one will lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel . But in life there are no epigrams , no reason for emphasizing one remark over another , and so I refuse to emphasize that , right ? The hell with that . The hell with the government man . But it seems to me I saw him just the other day , that man or one exactly like him , bred out of the same race , standing outside the shabby " family-run " grocery store where I buy my mountains of food , and looking at me in a certain way . Does that mean they are after me at last ? After so many years of freedom , of legal innocence , they 've decided to believe my confession ? What does it mean ? What will happen ? Will anything happen ? Gregory Hofstadter was in oil and rarely seen . He flew everywhere , dined with princes and premiers ; there is a photograph of him in Gustave 's room , riding in ap151jeep across ice-cream-smooth slopes of sand in the company of fierce white-clothed Arabs ! What a father ! He traveled third-class and slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem , he had an audience ( in a group of six ) with the Pope , he snapped a picture of Khrushchev when Khrushchev was in Berlin , and Khrushchev seems to be waving at him ! He went surfing out in California , in early May , and the Premier of Bongata ferried him about in a gigantic yacht one August ; he was a regular guest at Saari 's villa on the Italian Riviera , and I heard him talk animatedly with Father about just what electronic music was striving for : he had been in a special audience , including Queen Elizabeth , treated to the premiere of " Symphony for Silence " by Baxterhouse . He took Gustave and Gustave 's cousin and me all the way downtown to a concert , which was held in an expensive , modern , concrete-block auditorium at the very center of the city . Though the city was being rebuilt , no one went down there any more ; just a few people who had to work there , and misguided tourists . But no women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! All you will find in the city is streets littered with papers , wrappers , dirt , grit , spit , bloody phlegm coughed up by bums , and on the blowy park benches the bums themselves looking humble and maliciousin their shabby clothes . ( " And each one of them a pervert , " Gregory Hofstadter said in a cheerful , angry voice to us children . ) No " Ladies Day " at the local theaters can lure our lovely mothers down to this squalor ! Do they care if they can get in for fifty cents , or if a ripple-haired movie star will be on stage in person ? They do n't give a damn and they are absolutely right . Gregoryp152Hofstadter swore at the congested traffic and blew his nose , waiting for a light to change , as if he had to get rid of his nervous energy somehow . " I hope this trio or whatever it is is good , " he said to Gustave . " We 're going to a lot of trouble to get down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Maureen and I sat in back . Maureen had pale , sharp-boned cheeks , a very pretty pink spring coat ; she was Gustave 's age , two years older than I. She played the piano and the harp , Gustave said . She attended Miss Chote 's School for Girls , a most exclusive and expensive school in FernwoodHeights , whose students were the sisters and cousins of the Johns Behemoth boys . Mr. Iofstadter was having trouble because if he got in the right lane , cars ahead of him would slow to make right turns . If he lurched over into the left lane , swearingunder his breath , the car ahead of him always paused to make a very slow , creaky left turn . " Oh , those . . oh , those bastards ! " he muttered , not for us to hear . We children were talking quietly , and when Mr. Hofstadterspoke Gustave simply raised his voice to drown him out . " Did you see that ? God ! " Mr. Hofstader said , wiping his forehead . " That nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was some difficulty at the entrance to the parking lot , since two lines of ears were preparing to squeeze into a one-lane space . We waited . Gustave said cheerfully , " We 'll be inside and settled in a few minutes . " His father buzzed down his window and leaned out to yell at a parking attendant . " Hey , you ! Yes , you ! Come over here  --  you ! "  |p153The  boy limped over to us , and as he emerged out of the dark and into Mr. Hofstadter 's headlights he turned into an old man with a sullen look . Mr. Hofstadter gave him a mysterious bill , and he and we children hopped out and the old man crawled in . " How d' ya work this ? Okay , I got it , " the old man said sullenly . We walked away , free . M r . Hofstadter was a rotund , cheerful man who was always beaming down on us . When he smiled , he smiled just like his wife Bebe , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloriousness of his good humor drained away at once , while the smile took longer to fade . It was like looking at two people at the same time . " Dick , I hear your father is up to some monkey business . " he teased . I did n't know what he was talking about . I was afraid it had to do with Nada , though of course I should have known no Fernwood gentleman would allude to anything that serious . So I smiled shyly and said nothing . " Yessir 1 " Mr. Hofstadter said . " And did Gustave tell you about me ? I 'm leaving BOX and going in with Precept Oil . Did Gustave mention my new position ? " " I think so , " I said . This pleased him , and he rumpled Gustave 's hair . I felt my own hair being rumpled . The chamber-music group did unsurprising but fine pieces . Mr. Hofstadter began to cross and uncross his legs during the Andante movement , but the Allegro kept him interested . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like eating , and both of them were like sleep : something to do that drew you into it , had n't anything to do with you as a person . You could inhabit the vacuum of your freedom like a fly buzzingp154aimlessly in a locked car , and not worry about getting out or about what you should be doing since you could n't do anything anyway until you did get out . At intermission , while Mr. Hofstadter went out to the foyer to smoke , Gustave said nervously , " I should apologize for Father  --  " " No , no ! The concert is wonderful , " Maureen said . " It 's wonderful of him to bring us down , " I said . Gustave fussed with his program notes . " I 'm afraid Father does n't know much about music . But he has an instinctive appreciation of some pieces . " " It 's better that way , " said Maureen at once . " I wish I had his natural instinct , " I said . " It 's so .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation , " said Maureen . " I 'm ruined for anything spontaneous . I 've been studyingmusic for ten years . " " Well , Father likes things that he likes . If they appeal to him , " Gustave said . He showed the slow , cautious pride one shows in hearing one 's children being praised . After all this , Mr. Hofstadter must have disappointed his son by insisting that we leave before the final work . " Want to get out of that parking lot before the crowd , " he muttered . Gustave tried to argue , but his father got to his feet and started out , and we had to follow him . ' We stumbled over feet on our way out , but in the aisle we were joined by a dozen , two dozen people slipping on their coats , looking shrewd and relieved on their way to the parking lot . The trio had just begun its final piece . " Too much congestion , " Mr. Hofstadter said . In the small crowd of those desiring to avoid congestionwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , as Father did . Fernwood menp155always walked fast . Seen from the back , they looked angry ; that must have been why Maureen said to Gustave , " I hope your father is n't angry about anything . " Gustave said , " Why should he be angry ? " but his reply was dubious . We had all learned long ago that when adults did favors for you , their jolly good natures could change suddenly and inexplicably . " They 're all trying to kill us , it 's nothing personal , " I said . " What was that ? " said Gustave , cupping his ear . But Mr. Hofstadter was waving on the three of us  --  obviously children who had never been childish or even especially young . Need I mention that Mr. Hofstadter was an excellent driver ? Had you seen how he swung his big Lincoln around some mediocre automobile and roared up to the exit , squeezing in ahead of several other cars , you would certainly have marveled at his skill . Fernwood men drive well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Mr. Hofstadter got into his car he looked enthusiastic and pleased . I noticed that . Gustave climbed in beside him , with a quick , unconvincingsmile that was meant to bring us all together , adult and children , but which had no effect at all . I think that Mr. Hofstadter had already forgotten about Maureen and me in the back seat , and that he gradually forgot about Gustave , as the intricate skills of driving captured his imagination . He was a born driver . The " driver " is a man who settles himself into his " driving " the way others of us settle into a good book or a good sleep . You can tell when the " driving " sets in by the change of expression . But no , it is n't really a change , it 's a solidification , an intensification . Let mep156explain . The first five minutes on the expressway were taken up with Mr. Hofstadter 's genial chatter . I think he was chattering about a new painting he had bought , or his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gustave would have to leave Johns Behemothit was his fifth , or sixth , school in the last three yearsor maybe he was talking about the next trip he would be taking , to Australia . Then , as the " driving " set upon him , his sentences faltered off into nothing , his shoulders straightened bulkily , I could see his neck grow thicker and stronger as if preparing for battle . In the rearview mirror I could see his eyebrows furrowed down close to his narrowed eyes . His lips were pursed together hard and a tiny film of perspiration glowed on his forehead . Gustave talked on bravely , but Maureen and I only mumbled our replies . Mr. Hofstadter changed lanes , swerved in front of slower , moronic drivers who could n't keep up , tapped his horn , leaned on his horn , swore out through his flawlessly clean windshield at the anonymous faces of fellow drivers who just could n't keep up . " Accidentscaused by slow drivers , " he said panting . " Look at them ! That nut over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast that we had not time to look , nor did we trust ourselves to look at the other vehicles speeding along with us . The expressway had been an excellent route a few years ago , but now it was out of date . Even on a Tuesday evening there were too many cars . Mr. Hofstadtershowed his dissatisfaction by drifting up close to the rear of a car , breathing heavily , tapping on his horn , jerking his head back and forth in a tight series of disapproving , outraged shakes , and his hands grippedp157the wheel the way they might have gripped any weapon , with confidence and pride and barely restrained vengeance . We sped along the expressway and out toward the suburbs , passing beneath sleazy viaducts and overpasses where Negro children dawdled , some of them kicking pebbles off onto the passing cars , and while the perspirationgleamed on Mr. Hofstadter 's handsome foreheadand his shoulders in their expensive tweed began to hunch up with cunning , we children tried to keep up our miserable conversation . I think it was Maureen who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happy without qualification , " or else I said it ; and Gustave replied , his sentence peaking in the middle with the suddenswerve of his Father 's excellent automobile , " Music bypasses the mind altogether . . . " We drifted on to talk of chess , but our desperate conversation inside the hurtling vehicle of steel and glass could not compete with the lusty dramas taking place on all sides of us . Poor children ! " There , so much for him , " Mr. Hofstadter would mutter ; or , " Like this  --  this is the way it 's done ! " He was not talking to us , of course . He was talking to the other drivers . A man in a car as fine as Mr. Hofstadter 's gave him some trouble . They sped along side by side for a while , not glancing at each other , and when Mr. Hofstadterbegan to drift toward that car the car did not budge , no , not an inch , nor did anyone sound his horn , and Mr. Hofstadter laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . " ' Te 'll see , we 'll see , " he whispered . He finally did get ahead of the other car , but only after an interlude ofp158sharp squealing brakes . " I was engaged in this threedimensionalchess game , " Gustave said nervously . " My opponent is a member of London Teen-Mensa . . . " After a few confused moments we flashed under an overpass , and just at that moment some kids dropped something over  --  a length of pipe , maybe  --  and it hit the windshield of a car alongside us . The car immediately swerved and fell back . Mr. Hofstadter accelerated . Maureenand I looked out and saw the car bounce up on the shoulder of the expressway , veer along at a tremendous speed , and crumple against a series of posts . " Oh , look ! Look at that ! " I cried . " Filming , " said Mr. Hofstadter . The accident was already some distance behind us . " What ? " " It 's a rehearsal . Television show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told me once that his father had been born on a yacht on the Detroit River , one sunny Sunday many years ago . The birth had been the result of a grand slam dealt to his mother by a kindly hostess , and so Mr. Hofstadter had come into the world a few weeks early , lusty and bawling and ready to go . He has n't stopped yet . He 's still going strong , I know , since a recent Time showed him in a photograph with several fierce sheiks , aging but still handsome . And Gustave , if you 're interested , is already a senior at Harvard , excelling in mathematics , and Maureen is studying in Bristol , and they 're ell growing up , going along their ways , " getting along , " but I , I sit here at the end of my life . Now I have my meals sent up from a roachy delicatessen because it 's easier that way and I can avoid the unfriendly stares of people in this neighborhood . It 's strange how peoplep159end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time in their lives they 've been together in a hurtling automobile just a few feet or a few seconds from death . Everyone imagines with horror the opinions of others , but few people are unfortunate enough really to know what these opinions are . We are all paranoid , all selfloathingand vaguely doomed , but only writers and other exhibitionists are told the terrible truth about themselves . Ordinary people never know anything . They suspect but do not know . Years pass . Nobody gives a damn , nobody is watching . They die . They are forgotten . I , Richard Everett , will die and be forgotten and never know the truth about myself , if there is " truth , " and so .. . And so I have made up some truths . Last night I made them up . I should keep them for an Appendix to this book , but I am greedy and impatient and masochistic , and so here they are . The posthumous future does n't seem quite real to me , but I suppose it will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book in 1969 , or later ? This moment seems so real to me , so gluey and sluggish , that only a great effort of will can get me past it . I wo n't be alive to see the actual reviews of my exhaustivework , and no doubt that 's just as well . But I imagine they will take these forms : New York Times Book Review : It is sheer cant ( though speculative ) that the product of a mad , feverish mind must be in it/self mad and feverish , as if the mind , like Kant 's kneecap , could bend only one way . This dogma seems possible only when the " voice " of the madman is so hysterical that it engulfs  --  one might say drowns out  --  the legitimate feverishvoice of the writer . Verbal felicity or verbal awkwardness aside , the essential rhetoricalpose of Expensive People is perhaps more mad than simply feverish , more sentimentally eclectic ( in the kitsch sense ) than tragically enlightened ... . Time Magazine : Confused and confusing tale of a child with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , set in that well-coveredterrain , Suburbia . Everett sets out to prove that he can outsmartre Sartre but does n't quite make it . It is all great fun though . As there should be , there are Problems with Mother . But these are probably resolved as the novel progresses . Hijinks galore , but , like a damp firecracker , most of them smolder rather than explode . There is a hint of patronagein all this ( we are asked to believe the author is only eleven ! ) , as there is in the best of documentaries about Eskimo or New Zealandcustoms . Of course it has all been done before , and with superior skill , by John O'Hara and Louis Auchincloss , and if and when Everett learns the lyric cry of rapture and horror which these authors call forth he will perhaps be worthy of our attention.  |p161Ex|pensive  People has as its verbal mode the reduction of a generation 's anguish to the insufferablelyricism of one child ; as the talismanof at least one plane of its purported operations , it exhibits vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , about which its child-narrator turns dizzily , dreaming not simply the manic dream of the middle-class ( which never wakes in this novel ) , but also the manic dream of the would-be novelist who would reduce complex sociological material to a thalamic crisis . For the **34;8820;TOOLONG is what Everett desires , though he fails utterly in his inability to get very far beyond common psychosexual boundariesinto realms of metaphysical and **32;8856;TOOLONG . The whole point of the doomed child is his legendary quality : exemplaryof the American confusion between orders of being , of our perpetual conversion of sexuality into one kind of art and the consequentdepletion of the sexual by being turned into emblem and shady metaphor . This entire problem was taken up only two months ago by the " Faintest Idea " troupe , who are running an amateur living theater in San Francisco , and their insistence upon definite ritualistic analoguesand socio-emblematic drama have , in my opinion at least , cleared up this issue once and for all . Their shattering play , Genghis Proust , which takes place on a pitch-black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic , and I need say no more about it except to underscore my feeling that only at such points of moral infinity can this new energy find its proper mode in the creation of revolutionary substance . Expensive People , traditional as Charles Dickens , is therefore an irrelevant exercise . .. Hanley Stuart Hingham , a famous critic , writingin any one of the literary quarterlies : And now we turn from Nabokov 's scintillating anal fantasies to the crude oral fantasies of one Richard Everett , in a first novel called Expensive People . Worthless as sociological material ( Everett shows a most naive admiration for the Businessman , suggesting he 's never met one ) , ludicrous as drama ( any alert reader , thumbing through the book , will be able to predict the sorry outcome ) , embarrassingas prose ( I 'm the only reviewer content with the assertion that the author is an eighteen-year-oldmadman , I 'm sure ) , Expensive People is nevertheless valuable as a fabulous excursion into the realm of the orally obsessed . Food abounds in this memoir . Sex is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it can be taken legally and morally through the mouth . But , as if to deny this surreptitious gratification , the novel is also filled with vomit . Those of us who have read Freud ( I have read every book , essay , and scrap of paper written by Freud ) will recognize easily the familiar domestic tri/angle here , of a son 's homosexual and incestuouslove for his father disguised by a humdrum Oedipal attachment to his mother . Author Everett , obviously an amateur , failed to make the best use of his oral theme by his crudity of material . He should have had the crazy young hero gobble down hotdogs , ice-cream cones , ladyfingers , all-day suckers . Instead , Everett does n't bother specifying the food imagery . It is this lack of skill that sets him apart from Nabokov , whose every sentence is calculated , whose every image calls up at once from the deepest reservoirs of our souls Freudian responsesof the sort that make Great Literature . Gustave told me later that the evening of the chamber music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was tired when he flew in from Spain , and he probablyshould have rested , " Gustave said meekly . I want to describe Gustave again , since he looked so much like me . You probably do n't know what I looked like . He was a small , slender child with a patient and ageless face , serious eyes , a thin , serious mouth , and glasses with pink transparent frames ; his narrow shouldershad the look of carrying enormous invisible burdens . Children like this are given to sudden eruptions of shrill , nervous laughter , after which they lapse into the silence that seems characteristic of them . We metamorphosep164into middle age without much strain , and the silence of our childhoods turns into a certain fussiness in old age about food , drafts from windows that only seem to be closed , and changing times . Gustave told me that his father had done a peculiar thing that night : when he drove up the Hofstadter driveway he deliberately ran into the garage door , which was closed . The door was usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but something had happened to the mechanism in the automobile , and when Mr. Hofstadter turned up his driveway and pressed his button , nothing happened . In Fernwood ( I should have mentioned this earlier ) all garage doors slide meekly up when their owners ' automobiles turn in the driveway . They just do . Children do n't question this ; it is a fact of ordinary life . But the seeing-eye mechanism broke down that night and Mr. Hofstadter 's finger was impotenton the button , but keep going he did , his gaze steady and cold on the garage door , and he ran right into it going ten miles an hour and crumpled the garage door and the front of his car . But he seemed satisfied , Gustave reported , for the first time that day . He went right inside the house and upstairs and to bed , where he slept soundly . Something strange happened in my own life , with my own father . When Father arrived home the next day he asked me about the concert . We sat , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we had never used , gazing through a big plate-glass patio door onto a patio , which we had never used and were never to use , and Father asked me closely about Mozart . I noticed that Father wore a new suit , not yet rumpled . He was notp165a handsome man but there was something attractive about his face , or perhaps his expression . You could tell by looking at him that he wanted to be good , and was n't wanting almost enough ? ( In my desperate readingin preparation for this memoir I came across the heresies of one Flavius Maurus , who believed that the only Good was in desire and not in act , since purity can exist only in the mind . In his religion , would n't Father be saved ? ) I feel the itch to describe my father on all these pages , to get him down good once and for all , but do you know it 's almost impossible ? I always kept imaginingthat he was n't really my father and another man would take his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong man with his tobacco-stained fingers and his habit of twirling wine about in wine glasses with a loving , precise skill was my father , all mine , and in a way he may be your father too . Let 's all share him ! And if you are a father yourself , you 'll see yourself in Father . One can not imagine him as a child or a young man , since he has been full-grown for so long , with his past as compact behind him as his wallet , which is filled not with money but credit cards , slim and flat , stuffed in his back pocket , his past so very slim and flat itself that for all practical purposes it did not exist . And his future ? Imaginable only as an extension and inflation of his present . He said , " I always did admire Mozart but you know I have n't had the time to develop that side of myself . I 'm going to set aside two hours of each day , from now on , to catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading in Sartre ? " " I guess not . "  | " Yes , well . Sartre is well worth reading . " " We read something in French class once , just an essay . It was sort of hard . " Father brightened at hearing this . " Yes , well , kid , everything worthwhile is difficult , as Plato said . Or did Plato say everything difficult is worth while ? It 's the same thing . But I think Sartre has something to say and I 'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt . I 'm going to give him the time to say it to me . " He smiled and seemed to be awaiting my approval . I filled in great gaps of time by sleeping and eating , lying around the house . Sometimes I would be awakened by Father 's striding into the room , all set for our daily afternoon walk , or ready to drive us to a Little League baseball game some friends ' kids were in . He had a full life , Nada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail in before I got hold of it , so I did n't know if Nada was writing to him or not . She had stopped writing to me . " There was something mysterious going on . I felt strange and inert , like a sleepwalker , and even when I did want to wake up l could n't . I could n't make myself rise out of sleep . Sometimes it frightened me , because I thought I might die , and the only thing to do was to think about something , some single , crucial thing that could draw me out of this paralysis . So I contemplatedmy toothbrush , which was far away upstairs , and imagined its appearance until my heart pounded with renewed vigor and I had to run up to my bathroom to check that trivial object . So far , so good . Or I doubted the reality of Florence , our good maid , and had to run to see her . Or I tried to reconstruct the room I had spent eighteen months of my life in back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , thep167ugly tile , the apple tree outside . It took such enormous mental efforts to raise me out of my lethargy . And another mysterious thing : Father began taking me to foreign movies . Films . We sat through a threehourtechnicolor extravaganza of fantasies , enormous idealized bodies of males and females , and though I liked the splash of color well enough I did n't have any idea what was happening . And we saw a peculiar blackand-whitefilm in which a couple pursue a disappeared girl over an island and a mainland , for hours , days , weeks , but fail to find her , and so it went . Despite my boredom I remember being struck by a sense of gritty , relentless futility in that movie , precisely the same futilityI myself lived in . Afterward Father said , " Antonioni captures perfectly the malaise of the modern world , do n't you think ? " " Huh ? " " His searching people , his ruins , his sand , his . . . well , you know , all the gadgets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I guess so , I said . I was a little worried because one of the rambling , cheerful bachelors seemed to be changing . Even his healthy outrage seemed to be weakening . When Florence tsk-tsked about the current newspaper drama  --  a girl of eleven abducted by a madman who was finally shot down by police  --  Father did not respond as usual with a hearty yelp of hatred , saying that it was the worst thing this state had ever done to revoke the death penalty ; he seemed hardly to have heard . " Do n't know what the world 's coming to , " Florence muttered , making our breakfast , and Father , who was glancing through the Wall Street Journal on one side of his platep168and the Partisan Review on the other , did no more than agree vaguely as he chewed his toast . At last he explained everything . He came home early one day and shortly afterward a man in a run-down truckbrought Father a FOR SALE INQUIRE WITHIN sign for the front lawn . We were moving again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try selling it myself . We 'll see . " Father chuckled . He had Florence clean the house inch by inch , and install flowers on the foyer table , the dining-room table , and the marble-topped table in the living room . Florence wore a dainty apron and a lace cap , and I was dressed in my Johns Behemoth blazer , my hair slicked down onto my forehead so that I looked like an English publicschoolboy , or someone 's idea of one . I sat idly in the den , at the grand piano , and when would-be buyers were shown through the house I glanced at them , nodded stiffly , and turned back to my music . Father had other tricks too . He did not seem to be selling anything . He stressed the tight market , the difficulty of attaining a mortgage unless ( and here his eyes would move kindly but realistically to the visitor 's face ) the borrower was quite well-off . And the maintenance of a house like this was high , he said , and mentioned prices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course ; I think that 's sixty a month . " Or " The man with thep169little snowplow charges twenty dollars a winter to clear the walk . " And did it work ? Of course . The house was sold in the first week for $88,000 , a fine profit . He sold it to a family named Body who were moving up from Cleveland ; the man was in advertising and needed a good-lookinghouse . The wife hesitated over the circle driveway , thinking that it was " almost too much , " but in the end she gave in ; all women like things that are almost too much . Moving did not upset me . Instead it made me feel slower than ever , bogged down , helpless . I sat around and watched the movers pack lamps and dishes , stuffing in newspapers skillfully and endlessly . The movers were competent men . I thought dreamily that they might pick me up and stuff me in one of the boxes , lined with newspaper , and ship me off to the new house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good china . She had never met Nada but she tsk-ed and clucked over the beautiful china and kept saying that she " would not be responsible " for what happened . Did n't she know that no one was ever responsible for anything ? One by one things were packed up and packed off . There went Nada 's table , there went the chair Father called " his " though he never sat in it . From upstairsp170came a procession of things that should have looked familiar  --  " my " own furniture . " My " things . I watched them with interest . Everything was so friendly . We owned all these things . They did not cause us pain and they had hardly cost us any money . Up from the basementcame another procession of " our " things  --  washing machine , dryer , lawn furniture , a glass-topped table with elegant curlicues of iron , " my " old bow and arrow set , " my " badminton set , boxes and boxes of nameless things that must have belonged to us . Bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last move and had not yet been unpacked . Were we saying good-by to Nada in this sneaky way ? Florence said , " Richard , why are you crying ? " " I 'm not crying , " I said . I was watching the big orange moving van drive away . It drove slowly up Burning Bush Way and took off in the direction of " our " new home , which Father had already bought . Another home , another town . My bones creaked and got me to my feet . I had to get ready becauseFather was coming home soon and we could start off in the car for our new life . Father had been invited by a certain highly successful firm , BWK , to take over one of their divisions . He explained his new job to me , but I had n't listened carefully enough . I was having difficultyhearing , or maybe it was difficulty seeing . I could n't match the sounds of words with the funny movements made by the speaker 's lips . Even when Florence talked there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her lips seemed able to shape them . A hodgepodge of sounds and ringing noises buzzed in my brain . I felt as if I were asleep even when I was awake , and becausep171I was asleep everything was a dream and anything could happen . Oh , we are so strangely matched with our dreams ! We are so strangely suited to them , no matter how obsceneor hilarious they are , and no matter how angrily we deny them . Yes , we always deny them . Looking back on Fernwood , now , as I write this memoir , I can see that Fernwood itself was a dream , and everyone in it dreaming the dream ; all in conjunction , happy , so long as no one woke up . If one sleeper wakened , everything would have been stretched and jerked out of focus , and so . . . the end of Fernwood , the end of Western civilization ! One would as soon trust Charles Spoon ( that immensely talented designer of automobiles now applyingto design another kind of weapon ) with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like Nada and myself with dreaming the good happy dream of Fernwood . We were failures . And so . . . were we saying good-by to Nada , sneaking off ? Were Father and I packing up the stuff of our dream and taking it to another setting , where it could flourish safely away from all memories of that woman who kept waking and disturbing everyone ? Because  --  and this is the only truth I know about my mother , a most sorry truth  --  she wanted only to live but she did n't know how , that was why she made a mess . Messes are made by people who want but do n't know what they want , let alone how to get it . And all the messes she made ! Father came , there were good-bys with Florence ( three separate ones , awkward and moving ) , there was an exchange of money , the keys were dropped off at anp172attorney 's office , I was entrusted with the road map , which looked like the plan for the intestines of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father drove well , just like Mr. Hofstadter . He did not look back . I did not look back . But I could see in my mind 's eye the placid winding streets ( ways , lanes , drives ) of Fern wood leading back farther and farther into the dimness of the past I had already spent here , from January to April of an uneventful year for Fernwood but a year to end all other years in my life . I said to Father , " Are you going to write her and let her know where we 're going ? " Father chuckled and said , " Tend to the road map , . buster . You 're the navigator for this run . " Two hours later , lonely for companionship , I said , " What kind of work will you be doing now , Father ? " " Cut out that Father business , I 'm your Dad . Daddy , " he said cheerfully . " It 's a line of work you 'd be interested in yourself , son . Top-security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . . . well , I ca n't explain to you in any detail ( not that I think you 're a Red spy , kid ! ) but I can say generally that it has the appearance of our regular product , which has a certain superficial resemblance to the product of my former firm , a platinumcoveredwire , but there are immense differences ! A most intricate thing indeed . Our research team has been working for years to perfect a certain device that . . . well , has immense value in determining the security of America . Do you understand ? " My interest rose . " Is it a bomb then ? " " A bomb ? " He laughed . " Look , kid , maybe and maybe not . On the day you get cleared I 'll tell you . Okay ? " " Do you think I 'll get cleared too ? "  | " If you keep your nose clean . If your mother keeps her nose clean . " " What ? " " Kid , I almost lost my top clearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Forget it . " " What about Nada ? " " Forget it , kid , " he said . He was jolly and restrained , like a magician with birds tickling him inside his clothes . And so we drove on into the night and did not stop , for my father ( and probably yours too ) likes to drive straight through . " Drove straight through , " he 'll say modestly when he reaches his destination . " Straight through " from Fernwood to our new town , which was called Cedar Grove . " That name sounds kind of familiar , " I said . " Ha , you 're a riot , kid ! You know very well that we lived in Cedar Grove once before . " " Is that right ? " " Ha , ha ! I think you were about four or five . Yes , Cedar Grove is a fine place and we 're headed for a fine new life because , you see , Dickie-boy , I have got a rather pleasant financial reward in connection with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said . " And he would n't say any more either , because he was a little embarrassedover his success . He liked to talk about other men 's successes and bring in his own by implication ; he was modest , modest . So he chattered on about his new product , and the tie-in with the government , and the cultural advantages of Cedar Grove . There was something boyish and giddy in his talk . He frightened me . But he was not frightening  --  there was nothing frightening there , it was his cheerfulnessp174itself that terrified . I had the idea that I was trapped in this car with someone who wanted to destroy me , not by crashing the car or turning to me but just by talking , chatting , confiding , laughing , chuckling , patting my skull . He loved me . It was clear that he loved me and I loved him . Why was I so afraid of him ? I have on one hand this agreeable , well-appointed father , and on the other hand my morbid and obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by the other . They remain forever apart , and if I could get them together by telling you the tale of my dog Spark I 'd do that , but when I tell that tale I either laugh miserably or cry hilariously . I think , while Father speeds into the domestic Americandarkness , toward Cedar Grove , I will tell you the tale of my dog Spark after all . When I was very little Father and Nada gave me a nice Christmas present : a little dog named Spark . Spark was a dachshund , which word was pronounced not " dashhound , " as the maid and the lawn men pronounced it , but in a fast , angry , wheezing way , like a sneeze . Father and Nada always said it correctly , and so did their friends . Spark did not know he was a dachshund , but his great sorrowful eyes seemed to indicate some misery or humiliation . " Is n't it a lovely doggie ? " Nada cried . She hugged Spark and me together , entwining herp175arms about both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro maid smiling maternally , with what in hand ( for she must be busy ) ? Oh , a rag , a bottle of Anglo-Saxon Furniture Polish . What kind of day ? Misty , mild ; spring . Nada dressed in a beautiful new suit , new gloves and purse in hand , ready to press the button and raise the garage door and drive off , destination unknown . Yes , I can see her there . In a minute she will leave . Happy days are all one big blur of confusion , but so are unhappy days ; in my sordid life , all days were blurs of confusion . But this was a happy day and blurred as usual with my shouts of joy and Spark 's little whimpers and his fuzzy , downy stomach ( more downy than the soft blond down on Nada 's arms ) and his caramel-candycoloredcoat . He was delicious enough to eat ! I hugged Spark in my clumsy arms and helped him wave good-by to Nada , who drove out and away , and I did n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a minute later there was an aqua laundry truck . In the driveway , from out of nowhere , and a man with a cap on his head looking down , cigar in hand . Yelps , whimpers . The maid came running behind me and screamed . Then she came running back and grabbed my arm and said , " Richard , you better get inside here fast , " and I tried to get away to see where Spark had gotten to , but she took me back to the Family Room and turned on the television and that was that . I asked her for Spark and she said , " He 's restin ' , " and turned the television volume up higher . Nada came , and Father came . They looked at me from the doorway of the Family Room . Father had his arm around Nada 's shoulders . They were sayingp176something and their faces were sad , but though they were looking at me I could tell I was n't supposed to hear them so I did n't hear anything . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a nice dinner , and I said , " Where 's Spark ? " , and Father said cheerfully , " Spark had to go to the doctor . You know , like you did . Dr. Pratt . " " How come ? " " Spark needs his measles shot . " The next day when I woke up there was no Spark to be scolded at for making a mess in the kitchen , or rollingaround whimpering on the floor . Nada stayed home . She made fudge , but it was too salty so I had to eat it all myself . At noon Father 's car drove in , and I looked close and saw that Iather was in it , and he jumped out of the car with a big happy hello for us , and along with him was Spark . " Back safe and sound from the doctor  --  got his shots and he 's set for life , " Father said . Spark yelped and whimpered and ran at Father 's legs . Father had to pick him up and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but after a moment he began to lick my face . Nada hugged us both , and when I looked at her I saw that she was so strange and beautiful . " Spark says he do n't like doctors , just like me , " I told her . " He does n't like doctors , " Nada said gently . And Spark and I played in the back and nearby stood Father and Nada , watching . They were happy . Father had his arm around Nada 's shoulders . Then one day about a week later ( I am guessing at the time ) Nada and Spark and I went for a walk . Nada wore slacks and had a scarf around her head . It was a blowy , happy day . Spark and I ran along , yipping andp177dashing , Spark 's short little legs chopping as fast as they could and me falling down once in a while , and when I did I did n't bother to cry . Nada said , " Wait for me , " when we ran ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept running on with his little legs pumping . Off over the curb he went , and in the air for a second , and still running , and I was right behind him , and Nada said more sharply , " Richard , wait ! " , and I made a lunge to grab Spark 's little tail but it was too late . Out of nowhere came an aqua truck , not a laundry truck this time but a delivery truck , and its brakes squealed and its body shuddered and swerved , and there was a scream of surprise from Spark and a scream of anger from Nada , who cried , " Oh , no ! " The delivery man stood talking to Nada . Spark was somewhere on the other side of the truck , but he was quiet , and Nada would n't let me go see him . I cried . Nada was crying too , but she was angry . The delivery man was not crying and he was not angry , he was like men are : they get things done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog to the doctor , " Nada said . " To the doctor . And when he is well you will bring him back again . Do you understand ? " " Yes , ma'am , " the delivery man said . They both glanced at me to see if I heard . So Nada dragged me home . I cried for a while but then forgot why I was crying . She made fudge . We watched the Mickey Mouse Show together . That day there was no Spark , and the next day no Spark either . I asked the maid where Spark was , was he at the hospital ? She said he was getting fixed up and he 'd be back . And the next day at noon Father 's carp178turned up the driveway , and Father got out a little rushed and dropped Spark at my feet and said , " Good Christ , I should be at the airport right now , " and said good-by and backed out again . There was a bad moment when Spark seemed to be running under the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Nada 's scream seared him out , and I chased him into the evergreens and picked him up . He was a lot bigger than he was two days before . His coat was not so soft . He whimpered and lunged in my arms , trying to get away . " Spark do n't like me any more , " I said , weeping . " Does n't like you , " Nada corrected me , trying to pet Spark 's bony , nervous head . " Bring him inside and we 'll feed him . He 's been at the hospital for two days . After all ... " So we brought him into the house and he made a puddle right away on the kitchen floor , which the maid had just cleaned , and Nada said something she sometimessaid to Father . We fed Spark and spent all day petting him and trying to make him stop whining . He would n't play , and I told Nada I did n't like him any more , and Nada told me that I had better like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had Spark for several years , then when we moved to Charlotte Pointe he had a nervous breakdown and never recovered . That is the tale of my dog Spark.  |p179We  arrived somewhere late at night . I remember lights , car doors slamming , the scuff and scrape of luggage . Then bed . An unfamiliar pillow , but I slept my familiar heavy sleep . I woke to hear Father arguing with someone . He was in the motel bathroom talking in a fast , furious voice with someone unknown . " Genet is not sensational , " Father said angrily . " You argue as if you were unaware that the cas Genet has been studied by Sartre and other intellectuals . It 's all sewed up . " I dozed off again , and someone outside the motel-room door was scraping his luggage along . Two children argued bitterly . I woke up , startled , and it was dawn . I was alone in the cold motel room , and it occurred to me that perhaps it was I who had been left behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been there , of course ; Father had his own motel room . When he came in to wake me he had already shaved , showered , and combed down the thinning hair on the left side of his head . He was ready to go . " First we eat and exercise our stomach muscles , " he said happily . We ate in a glass-enclosed coffee shop attached to the motel . A waitress in a uniform too yellow brought us food . I had an enormous appetite in spite of being so tired , as if someone else had charge of my stomach . Father ate well as always . There were a few travelers in the coffee shop , crabby husbands and bright-eyed wives ,  |p180businessmen  reading newspapers . From a radio set atop a shelf by the cash register came morning music interspersed with advertisements for the cure of thinning blood and chronic backache . Itt was a cheerful , sunny place , and when we left , the waitress giggled at some witticism of Father 's and spiked our green-and-white " breakfast check " onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaled . " Things starting to look familiar yet ? " Father said as he drove us closer and closer to Cedar Grove . " Ahhah , hah  --  look at that . New bank ! Remember any of this ? " I stared out the window at the slow-passing sights , which were the sights of Fernwood . A bank with white shutters and white trim , pretty orange-red brick , evergreensframing everything ; a shopping plaza empty of cars this early in the morning ; across the way the Common , a big square area of green with library , courthouse , and post office , all of them constructed from the same mountain of buff bricks and according to the same plan . A feeling of lassitude overtook me , as if I were indeed coming home . " Just like coming home , eh ? " Father said . We drove along . My eyelids were grainy , as if a few specks of sand had somehow worked in under them . The silence between Father and me was gettting awkward , so I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply . " Have you ? " " No . " " Yes , I 've been reading Genet , " he said , a little relieved . " I was just discussing his works with Mr. Body the other day . You were in the den . Did you hear us ? " " I guess so . "  | " I do n't recommend that writer for you , buster , not right now , " he said comfortably . We turned off onto a handsome boulevard shaded by elms . Some of the elms had yellow tags on them , but Father did not notice . Father 's car sped along silently . It was strange how being awake did not make much difference . It was like being asleep . Dimensions were blurred and edges softened and even Father 's cheerfulnesswas easy to take . He meant no harm , after all , no matter how much harm he caused , and in Flavius Maurus ' heaven he would have been sainted . " Look at that house ! God , " he said admiringly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to me that I know , but already we were turning and entering a new street , and up before me arose more houses that looked different but were really familiar . I wondered if I should play the thinking game , to save myself from paralysis . I had to get awake enough for when Father finally stopped the car and pointed out our new home to me . What if I sat there all day , paralyzed ? I tried to think of my mother , but at the very center of my vision there was nothing  --  a burned-out spot as if the mere thought of her had annihilated part of my mind . " Here we are , buster . What do you think ? " We were driving up a hill . A driveway up a hill . Blacktop , but not overly black and vulgar : a worn smooth , conservative black . Sloping lawn , evergreens  --  some spiked up proudly against the house , others flattened out and creeping against the ground like sculpture . And the house  --  the house was ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of a courtyard on one side , materialthat looked like hard-baked clay held together withp182strips of dark wood ; wrought-iron gates , a tree growing placidly up near the doorway , everything lovely , lovely . It was a lovely house , and Nada would have wept to see it . Father said to me , " Buster , what 's wrong ? You 're not crying , are you ? " I astonished and dismayed the poor man at times . No , not crying , not crying ! I was all right , I told him . We bounded out of the car . He was like a magician showing me a galaxy of tricks , optical illusions  --  look at this , it all belongs to us ! We live here ! All this lawn , kid , and back here is a swimming pool , which we did n't use at the other house ; see here , see the landscaping , see the bathhouse , see the bird bath , see the little grotto where all of us can have hotdog roasts and your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in the exact shape of the big house , goddam cute ! Maybe Spark can come back , I said to Father , but this was too cruel , you do n't talk to your father like that . He stared at me and told me that Spark had died , did n't I know that ? ( Evidently he had no idea how old an eleven-year-old child was . ) I knew it , I told him , but sometimes I forgot . Father led me around to the front walk , a lovely flagstonewalk . Silvery delicate bushes , just greening up ( it was late April ) , and look at those rhododendron bushes  --  five hundred dollars ' worth , for sure ! Over there shaggy , golden forsythia , and everything lovely , lovely . My eyes throbbed with such sights . You would know , waking in such a world , that happiness is to be inhaled with the misty fragrance of the flowers , but at the back of my mind a voice began to chant at the same time that Father chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You wo n't outlive this house , buster ! This is the last one . You 've had it . So many houses , so many miles , so many maids , plumbers , lawn men , snowplow men , so many doggies , so many parties , so much eavesdroppingbehind doors , sofas , over telephones , through laundry chutes , furnace vents , air-conditioner vents , so many roasted cashews , so many silver trays , so much hatred , so much love ! You have had it . Father rang the doorbell , silly , happy Father , and , shifting his weight from one big foot to the other , he chuckled just to be out here in the warm Cedar Grove sun . We heard someone coming , another maid I supposed , and then the door opened . The door was a most complex arrangement , very heavy ; you must imagine a regular door and overlaid upon that a big greenish pane of glass and overlaid upon that a marvelously intricate pattern of wrought iron , half green ( as if with age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a limp delicate vine , and blinding in the sun a nice vulgar brass doorknob  --  andwhen this vision was pulled aside there stood Nada herself ! She hugged me , and Father towered over us , clearinghis throat , terribly moved and embarrassed and overjoyed . Nada kept saying , " Richard , I 'm so sorry . . . Richard , how are you ? How are you ? " " He 's just fine , he eats like a little pig these days . Let 's get inside where we can have some privacy , " Father cried , red-faced . Nada tried to gather me in her arms but I was too big . The three of us scuffled inside together . " Everything 's fine , just fine , absolutely first rate , " Father cried.  |p184Nada  bent down to stare into my face . " But how are you , Richard ? " My heart was pounding heavily . I wanted to get rid of it , get free of its terrible rhythm , so that I could breathe the lovely perfume of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had difficulty breathing and could not speak . " Richard ? " Nada said . " What 's wrong ? " Father thumped my back . " He 's just a little surprised , sweetheart . " " You mean you did n't tell him ? " " Well , you know  --  " " You did n't tell him about me ? " " Just a little surprise for the kid , " Father said , rubbing his hands and looking busily around . " Ah-hah , I see the painters finished in here . Very nice . Very good taste . " Nada touched my forehead . With her cool , soft hands she framed my face and looked at me . " Do you hate me ? " she said . " Do n't talk morbid , please , " Father said , turning back suddenly . " Richard is just a little surprised , as I said . I did n't mean to upset him . " I was embarrassed that they could see my heart thudding so violently in my chest . Nada said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I managed to nod . She embraced me happily as if I 'd given the right answer . " Do you love me ? Do you forgive me ? " she said . I told her yes . " Do you love me ? " she said fiercely . I said , " Yes , Nada . " " Oh , Nada , " she said , laughing , " we should get rid of that foolish name . It was the first thing you said and I wanted to hang onto it , but it 's foolish , your fatherp185is right . Richard , I will never leave you again . Never . You know that , do n't you ? " I nodded again and let my eyes close . In a day or two we had a ceremony and baptized the new house . This lovely , lovely house that Nada loved so much ! " And your father picked it out himself . Your wonderful father ! " Nada said . Oh , he was wonderful ! There were big white flowers for Nada every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began again , inward this time , and rooms filled up slowly and the garage filled up with boxes and the basement with furniture that would n't be used ( Nada wanted many new pieces of furniture ) , and when everything was settled we had our ceremony . Nada lay on the French love seat that now found its resting place in the hallway , and Father sat at one end so that her long lovely legs could lie across his lap , and I sat , like a little prince , on a stool at their feet , and she wore a green velvet dressing gown , and her hair was long and silky down to her shoulders , and she held the plastic Princess telephone in her graceful fingers and prepared to make calls . I had on my lap the two telephone books . In the background was a strain of violin music  --  Father had requested Mozart . The records were in a jumble and I put on Bartok , knowing Father would n't notice the difference . Close about us was the perfumy but civil odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Nada asked me the number of the Cedarp186Grove Employment Services and she called to request a maid , and before she hung the plastic Princess phone up again a mysterious person was being contacted and would be on her way to us . The first call had been a success ! What now ? I said the groceries , but Father overruled me by saying , " Better send over a plumber for that bathroom . " And I looked up another number for Nada and she called Cedar Grove Plumbing , and sure enough , in a few minutes someone else was on his way over . " And now what ? " said Nada . She was regal and soft as any queen . Father could n't help but stroke the tassels of her robe . " The lawn service , " I said . " The lawn service it is , " Nada said briskly . She dialed the magic numbers and in no time was connected with the Cedar Grove Green Carpet Lawn Service . " LabyrinthDrive , in the village , " Nada said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  my husband says everything . Mowing , fertilizing , shrub and tree spraying , weed and insect spraying . Yes , what ? Yes , fungus prevention , everything , edging , thinning , rolling , flattening . The usual . Every-thing . " " Now the Gas Company , " Father said wisely . And Nada called the Gas Company . " And the Insurance Company . " And she called the Badger Insurance Company . " And Vernon White , to let his secretary know I 'm here . " And she called Vernon White , her hair falling over the side of her face . " The garbage disposal is broken , " I said . " Ah , yes , the garbage disposal . " Nada sighed . Shep187thanked me by touching my hair briefly , then called the Cedar Grove Garbage Disposal Service . " And better call the sanitation department . There 's a lot of junk out front , " Father said , playing with Nada 's silky green tassel . And Nada made that call . " And all that junk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Nada called the Good Will , to get rid of our junk . " What about the swimming pool ? " I said . " Too early to clean that yet , " Father pointed out kindly . " There 's something dead in there , birds or something , " I said . " I looked under the canvas . " " They 'll keep , " Father said . " Too early for the swimmingpool . " We all thought for a moment , and Nada said , " I was thinking about school for Richard . St. Ann 's ? " " What 's that , not Catholic ? " " Well , yes . It 's a junior and senior high . " " Catholic , Nada ? " " I was just thinking of it . " " Well , honey , I 'm not so sure about a Catholic school . " Nada smiled at once . " If you are n't sure , Elwood , then I 'm not sure either . Cedar Grove Junior High , then ? " " Absolutely ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she calledthe school and made an appointment to bring me in . " Yes , he wants to attend summer school , " Nada said . When she hung up Father said , " What about thebank ? "  |p188And  Nada called the Cedar Grove Bank of the Commonwealth . " A dentist for buster here ? " And she called a Dr. Bellow and made an appointment for me . " Eyes examined too , " Father said , grinning at me as if I 'd tried to put something over on him but had n't been quick enough . " He needs the works . " So Nada called the Cedar Grove Eye Clinic and made another appointment . " What about that scabby rash on your feet ? Do you still have it , Richard ? " Nada said . I had to admit I did . She pursed her lips and looked sorry and said , " Then we 'll take you to a skin doctor too . " She called a " skin doctor " and made another appointment . " And reservations for dinner tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Absolutely , " Nada said and dialed that number . " Do n't forget the Electric Company , " Father said . " Not at all , " said Nada , " and while I think of it , the Water Company . " In no time at all she had made both these calls . " And the Telephone Company ! " Father laughed . " That 's right too , " said Nada . She dialed the proper number and smiled at us . " How many rooms in our house ? I 'm not sure , we 've just moved in . Five , six bedrooms , I think . What ? Oh , we want three or four phones . No , none in the basement . But I do n't work in the basement , of course not ! Yes . All black . Yes , black , we want to save money . Black . " She hung up . " They 're such talkers , " she said , rubbing her offended ear . " Why not buzz Armada and tell her you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't be home ! "  | " You could try . " " Later . And anyway I want to spend more time at home . With you and Richard . I do n't want to be going out to lunch all the time . " " Ah-hah , I thought of another one : window washers . The windows are absolutely filthy . " " Right , " said Nada grimly . When she had finished with that call I said , " Now the grocery store , " but Father outbid me by saying in a loud voice , " Now the drugstore . Send over some aspirin . The most expensive kind . " And she called the drug store . " And the hi-fi up in the Family Room does n't work , " Father said . Nada called a television and phonograph repair shop . " And my lawyer , what's-his-name , Voyd , Maxwell Voyd , to get a little money out of the man who sold me this place . There 's some wiring that does n't work . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late ? " " We 'll see , " said Father . So I looked up Mr. Voyd 's number for Nada . After that call Nada said , " Before I forget , an appointment for myself , to get my hair cut ! Look how long it is ! " And she called the Cedar Grove House of Beauty . " Ah , while I think of it , we need new keys for all the locks , " Father said shrewdly . I looked up the number of Cedar Grove Key Makers and Nada called them . " Now the groceries ? " I said . " That pane in the Family Room that 's broken , better call about that , " Father said . And Nada did that.  | " Someone to clean out the chimneys ? " " Absolutely . " " To fix the slate on the roof ? " " Right again . " " Someone to install the chandelier from the other house ? " " Yes , right . " When she finished with all these calls she lay back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Richard , look up the number of the Continental Market Basket and we will have some groceries ! " And she called this exquisite store . " Yes , please , we have a charge account from years and years ago . I want it reactivated . Mrs. Elwood Everett . Yes . Will you please send me over some groceries ? It 's 4500 Labyrinth Drive , yes . We would like , please , three wonderful steaks , the best you have , and a large jar of bamboo shoots , Huang Brand , and three packages of hors d'oeuvre shells . The kind that look like snails , yes . And from your bakery counter , while I think of it , a nice loaf of French bread and a lemon meringue pie . Is it on special today ? That 's fine , and  --  what , honey ?  --  my husband says to send us a case of shrimp , the big king-sized kind , and a case of boned turkey , any brand , and a case of  --  what ?  --  Cheerios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dishwasher  --  that reminds me , Elwood , the dishwasher is n't working right  --  and a plastic thing of sponges , you know , all different colors , and some steelwool things for cleaning out . Yes , pots and pans , and my husband says a case of Sylvan Ale , and a case of good cooking sherry , I 'm not familiar with the brand names , and a case of red catsup , and a case of Big-Bite Peaches . Oh , moderate-sized cans , I should think , andp191a case of tabasco sauce , any kind , a case of noodles , that 's the kind about the width of a pencil . Yes , that kind , and send us , please , a case of Midget-Treat Pickles  --  Elwood , just for you/  --  and five gallons of ice cream , different flavors . What 's on special , vanilla ? All right , all of vanilla , and three heads of lettuce and half-adozennice bananas , not too ripe , and  --  what , Richard ?  --  oh , God , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen eggs medium-sized  --  what , Elwood ?  --  oh , large size . Grade AA , yes . And please send us a case of toilet paper , some pink and some yellow , and a case of tissue , any brand , but pink and yellow , to go with the bathrooms , you know , and a case of Shine-Eeze Floor Polish , the big bottle , and some Teutonic Stewed Tomatoes . No , absolutely no frozen things . In cans if you have them and if not , not . Fine . And two packages of butter . And salt , one container . Yes . Yes . I think that 's all . No , do n't bother repeating it , just send it over . Thank you so much . " When she hung up Father said , " Nada , you 're so wonderful I " She showed us the tip of her pink tongue and laughed . " I 'm back home again and I 'm never leaving . Never again ! " In a week the phone began to ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , people dropped in for cocktails , Nada dashed out in a brilliant pinkp192dress to meet Elwood at someone 's house for cocktails , people arrived and took them to the Old Mill Country Club , the delivery boy brought flowers for Nada 's first dinner party , a box that was Nada 's new late-spring suit , another box that was a surprise for me ( not much of a surprise , just a Madras jacket ) . One evening at dinner Nada and Father had this conversation : " We 'll have to have the Vcals over , " Father said . " The Veals , honey ? " " I know how you feel , but  --  " " But Elwood , the Vcals are dead . They died in that awful plane crash , did n't they ? " " What ? Dcad ? No , Tashya . I just met them the other day at Vernon White 's , did n't I mention it ? " " Not the Veals , Elwood . You did n't meet them , they 're dead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a shame it was , do n't you remember ? " " But they 're not dead , I just met them ! I just met them . " " Are you sure it was the Veals ? " " Of course . I think it was Thelma and Artie . " " They might have relatives  --  " " But this looked like the Veals . You must remember them  --  middle-aged and sort of athletic ? Always tanned ? " " Yes , but  --  " " Well , we should invite them over . Thelma was very nice to you . " But they 're dead . " " I do n't think so . "  | " Are you positive ? " " Tashya , I think so . I 'm not positive , of course , but I think they 're alive . Maybe we should wait a while before having them over though . " " It might be better . " " Still , I think  --  " " I 'm not sure myself , but . . . " One day I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clucking at some pigeons , was a boy who looked rather like myself . Skinny , hollow-chested , in a plaid shirt and wearing pink transparent-rimmed glasses . I looked again , and it was Gustave ! We greeted each other warmly . " I did n't know you were moving here , " I said . " I did n't know you were moving at all , " said Gustave . We were so overjoyed at meeting that we went immediately to his house and began a long , ingenious game of chess . Oh , it was wonderful , wonderful ! I hoped we would never stop dreaming this time . On another day I entered the library and found what I was looking for : a copy of The Quarterly Review of Literature with one of Nada 's stories in it . I will re/produce for you here this story , which I have read and reread now some twenty , thirty times . I am six years old . There , at the end of the porch , is the old lilac tree . Everything is blurred with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and it is lifting slowly . I am sitting on the porch step playing with something  --  a doll . It has no clothes and is scuffed . It is neither a boy nor a girl ; its hair was pulled off ; its body is smooth and its eyes staring as if they saw something that frightened them . In the lilac tree some blackbirds are arguing . Not too far away is the cherry orchard ; the birds fly over from the cherry trees and in a minute will fly back again . My father has put tin foil up in the trees to scare the birds away , but it does n't work . If I lean forward I can see the brilliant tin foil gleaming high up in the trees  --  it moves with the rocking of the limbs , in the wind . My father has gone to work and does not come home until supper . The odor of supper and the harsh sound of my father 's car turning into the cinder drive go together ; everythinggoes together . I climb up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold . The birds fly away . The doll is hack there , by the steps . My grandmother gave me that doll , and the funny thing about it is this : I never remember it or think about it until I see it lying somewhere , then I pick it up and hug it . There is a little chair in the lilac tree made by three branches that come together . I like to sit here and hide . Once I fell down and cried and Mommy ran out onto the porch , but that was a long time ago when I was little . I am much bigger now . My legs dangle beneath me , scuffed like the doll 's skin . My knees are marred with old scratches that are about to flake off and one milky white scar that will never go away . My mother comes outside . The chickens run toward her evenp195though they know it is n't time to be fed ; they come anyway . My mother puts something up on the clothesline . The clothesline is always up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? " Mommy says . I thought she could n't see me but she can . " Can I go down to the crick ? " I ask her . There , in the grass , her feet are almost hidden . The grass is jagged and seems like waves of water . " Tommy is n't home , " she says , without looking around . She finishes hanging the towels up  --  she has clothespins in her pocket and they make her stomach look funny . " Why do you always want to play there ? she says . " Ca n't you play up here ? " " Tommy can go down anytime  --  " " Tommy 's bigger , Tommy does n't fall down . " She looks past me . There is something soft about her face  --  nothing bad stays in it . When I was little I kept going back into the kitchen to make sure she was there and she was always there . The big kids teased me and said she was gone , but she was always there . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path through the field to the creek . There is more than one path : a path from our house and the Sullivans ' house , and a path for fishermen who come from the road . Our path runs along flat but curves around , and there are prickly bushes that scratch you . By the creek the path dips downhill and goes to the bank . The fishermen 's path comes down from the road , alongside the bridge . Fishermen leave their cars up on the road and come down the path , slipping and sliding because it is so steep . When fishermen come we have to leave . Mommy says we have to leave . One of the big boys threw stones in the creek once , to scare the fish away , and the fisherman ran up to the Sullivans ' house and was mad . He was from the city . The creek has a smell I like . I always forget it until I come back to it ; there it is . There are big flat white rocks by the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water but white outside . This is what smells . It smells dry and strange ; there is something dead about it . There are dead things by the creek . Little fish and yellow birds and toads ; once a garter snake . The fishermenthrow little fish down on the stones and let them rot . Whenp196the fishermen are from around here we can stay and watch  --  they 're like my father , they talk like him . When they 're from the city they talk different . Everybody has their rocks . Tommy 's rock is the biggest one and nobody can sit on it but him . I have a rock too . I sit on it and my feet get in the water by mistake . That 's bad . My mother will holler . I try not to let them slip in but my rock is too little , I ca n't sit on it right . I let my feet go back in the water . I like the way the water feels . I have a dam made out of stones , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fisherman behind me . He has a strange dark face ; I saw someone like him in a movie once . He has a fishing pole and a paper bag and some things in his pockets . His hat looks dusty . " Do you live up there ? " he says . He has a nice voice . That makes me think of my mother . I do n't know how to talk to grownups . They talk too loud to you , and something is always wrong . I do n't say anything to him . There are two crabs behind the dam , little ones . Their bodies are soft to touch but they 'd bite you if they could ; their pincers are too little . Tommy and the boys use them for fishing , instead of worms . " Do you live close by here ? " The fisherman is squatting on the bank now . His hat is off and next to him . He has dark hair . I tell him yes . My face is prickly , because of him looking at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old are you ? " he says . They always ask that . I do n't answer but let a stone fall in the water to show I 'm not afraid of him . " Are you fishing ? " " No . " " What are you doing ? " He is squatting on the bank and calling over to me . A grownup would just walk out and see what I had , or he would walk away ; he would n't care . This man is squatting and watching me . The hank is bare from people always standing on it . We play here all the time . When I was little I could look down from higher up and see the boys down here , playing . Mommy would n't let me come down then . Now I can come down by myself , alone . I amp197getting big . The bank tilts down toward the creek , and there are a whole lot of stones and rocks where the creek is dried up , then the water begins but is shallow , like where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the big rocks stick up . The boys can wade out there but not me . There are holes somewhere too ; it is dangerous to walk out there . Then , across the creek , is a big tangle of bushes and trees . Somebody owns that land . On this side nobody owns it , but that side has a fence . Farther down where the bushes are gone , cows come down to the creek sometimes . The boys throw stones at them . When I throw a stone it goes up in the air and comes down right away . " What have you got there ? " " A dam . " He smiles and puts his hand to his ear . " A what ? " I do n't answer him , but pretend to be fixing something . " Can I come look ? " he says . I tell him yes . Up there , nobody cares about what I do , except if I break or spill something ; then they holler . This man is different . He is like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father says things to me but does n't talk to me , he does n't look at me for long because there are too many other things going on . He is always driving back and forth in the car . This man looks right at me . His eyes are dark , like Daddy 's . He left his hat back on the bank . His hair is funny . He must have been out in the sun because his skin is dark . He is darker than Tommy with his suntan . " A little dam , " he says . " Well , that 's real nice . " The crabs are inside yet . He does n't see them . " I got two crabs , " 1 say . The man bends down right away to look . I can smell something by him , something sweet . It makes me think of the store down the road . " Hey , look at that  --  I see them crabs . They 'd like to bite a nice little girl like you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not afraid . I am never afraid of crabs but only of fish that they catch and tear off the hook and let lay around to die . They flop around on the grass , bleeding , and their eyes look right at you . I 'm afraid of them but not of crabs.  | " Hey , do n't let him bit you ! " The man laughs . " He ca n't bite . " The crab gets away and falls back into the water . It swims backward in quick little jerks and gets under a rock . It is the rock the man has his foot on . He has big black shoes like my father 's , but caked with mud and cracked . He stands with one foot on a rock and the other in a little bit of water . He can do that if he wants to , nobody can holler at him . " Do you like to play down here ? " " Yes . " " Do you go to school ? " " I 'm going next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I look up at him my eyes have to squint . He is bending over me . " I went to school too , " he says . He smiles at me . " Hey , you got yourself dirty , " he says . I look down and there is mud on me , on my knees and legs and arms . It makes me giggle . " Will your mommy he mad ? " he says . Now , slowly , he squats down . He is leaning over me the way some of them in town do , my mother 's people . You can smell smoke or something in their breaths and it is n't nice , it makes me not like them . This man smells of something like candy . " Little girls should n't get dirty , " he says . " Do n't you want to be nice and clean and pretty ? " I splash in the water again because I know it 's all right . He wo n't holler . " Little boys like to be dirty but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He talks slow , like he was doing something dangerous  --  walkingfrom rock to rock , or trying to keep his balance on a fence . " You 've got some stuff in your hair , " he says . He touches my hair . I stop what I 'm doing and am quiet , like when Mommy takes burrs out . He rubs the top of my head and my neck . " Your hair is real nice , " he says . " It 's got snarls underneath . She has to cut them out . " " It 's real pretty hair , " he says . " Hey , you know in the city little girls have two daddies . One goes to work and the other stays home to play . Do you know that ? " Something makes me giggle . His hand is on my shoulder . He hasp199dark , staring eyes with tight lines around them . He looks like he is staring into a lamp . " Would you like another daddy ? " he says . " I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me as if he was really seeing me . He is not thinking about anybody else ; in a minute he wo n't stand up and yell out to somebody else , like my mother does . He is really with me . He puts his finger to his mouth to get it wet and then he rubs at the dirt on my arm . " I would n't never spank no little girl of mine either , " he says . He shifts forward . His legs must ache , bent so tight like that . " You think they 'd spank you at home for being dirty ? " " I can wash it off . " I put my arm in the water . When you knock over a stone in the water a little puff of mud comes and hides the crabs that jump out  --  that saves them . When you can see again they 're all hid . " Maybe you better get washed up down here . I sure would n't want you to get spanked again , " the man says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are warm and heavy but I do n't mind them . He is holding my arm ; with his thumb he is rubbing it . I look but ca n't see any dirt where he is rubbing it . " Hey , do n't touch your hair . You 'll get mud in it , " he says . He pulls my hand away . " You can wash right here in the crick . They wo n't never know you were dirty then . Okay ? We can keep it a secret . " " Tommy has some secrets . " " It can be a secret , and we 'll be friends . Okay ? Do n't you tell anybody about it . " " Okay " " I 'll get you all nice and clean and then we 'll be friends . And you wo n't tell them about it . I can come back here to visit sometimes . " He looks back at the bank for something . " I got some real nice licorice in there . You like that , huh ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have some then . I bet you like it . " He smiles when I say yes . Now I know what the smell is about him  --  licorice . It reminds me of the store down the road where thep200licorice sticks are standing up in a plastic thing and when you touch them they 're soft . They stick to your teeth . " Little girls do n't know how to wash themselves , " he says . He pats water on my arm and washes it . I sit there and do n't move . There is nothing that hurts , like there is sometimes with a washclothand hot water . He washes me slow and careful . His face is serious ; he is n't in a hurry . He looks like somebody that is listening to the radio but you ca n't hear what he hears . He washes my legs . " You 're a real pretty little girl , " he says . " They should n't spank you . Should n't nobody spank you . I 'd kill them if I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something draws his face all in , and his eyes seem to be going in , looking somewhere inside him . " But I 'll get you clean , nice and clean , " he says . " Then you can have some licorice . " " Is it from the store ? " He moves his hand on my hack , slow , like you pet a cat . The cat makes his hack go stiff and I do the same thing . I understand what it is like to he a cat . " Do you want to walk in the water a little ? " " I ca n't do that . " " Just here . By these rocks . " " They do n't let me do it . " I look at him , waiting for permission . My shoes are already soaked . But if I play out in the sun afterward then they will get dry . " Sure . They ai n't nowhere around here . I say you can do it , " he whispers . He leans back and watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's all right to wade in , the water . Nobody else ever sat and watched me so close . Nobody else ever wanted me to walk in the water and would sit there to catch me if I tripped . " Is it nice ? Does the water feel nice ? " The water comes up to my knees in the deepest place . I ca n't go out any farther than this . I was swimming somewhere , but not here ; we go to a lake . There they have sand and people lying on blankets , but here there is n't anything except stones . The stones are sharp sometimes . After a while the man stands up . His face is squinting in thep201sun . He walks alongside me , watching me ; his feet will get wet . Something makes me yawn . I feel tired . I look down and see that I am making clouds of mud underwater . " You better come out now , " he says . When I step out on the stones my shoes make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water running out . Inside my shoes my toes are cold . He takes my hand and walks with me back to the bank . His hand is very warm . " You had a real nice time out there , did n't you ? " he says . " Little girls like to play in the water and get clean . " He wets his finger and rubs something on my face . I close my eyes until it 's clean . The licorice stick is n't as good as the ones at the store . I want to take it back home but the man says no , I have to eat it down here . I keep yawning and want to go to bed . When I play in the water I get tired , the sun makes my eyes tired . The man washes my hands with creek water , his own hands wet and rubbing with mine like he was washing his own . " This is our own secret and do n't never tell anybody , " he says . He wipes our hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be just as tall as I am . He has a black comb he combs my hair with , but there are snarls underneath and he has to stop . He pulls the hairs out of the comb . " Now you have another daddy , and do n't never tell them , " he says . When I turn around to look at him from higher up on the path , he is bending to get his fishing pole . I forgot about looking at the pole and want to run back to see it , if it 's a glass pole like some of them , but now he looks like somebody I do n't know . With his back to me he is like some fisherman from the city that I do n't know and am afraid of . I am six years old . At this time we are still living in the country ; in a few years we will move to the city , in with my grandmother . But now my father is still well enough to work . My brother and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustard sandwiches wrapped in wax paper and emptied pop bottlesp202with water in them . I went out to the road and watched them ride away . Nobody cared about me ; the boys call me baby if they are nice and push me away and tease me if they 're bad . I hate my brother because he pushes me with his hand , like people do in the movies when they want to knock somebody out of the way . " Move it , kid , " he says and pushes me . If I run to Mommy it wo n't do any good . He is four years older than me and so I can never catch up to him . The day is hot . It 's August , in the morning . The high grass in the orchard is dried up ; the birds are always fighting in the trees ; the leaves churn to show their sleek black wings . Tommy has a BB gun and shoots the birds sometimes , but when they hear the noise they fly away ; birds are smart . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the feathers and stuff , right on the kitchen floor . I am playing with my doll . Inside , Mommy is still canning cherries . On Sundays Daddy sits out front under the tree and tries to sell baskets of cherries to people that drive by . You ca n't go out by him and talk because he is always mad . The kitchen is ugly and hot . There are steamed jars everywhere , and bowls of cherries . Once I liked cherries , but the last time they made me sick . I saw a little worm in a cherry , by the pit . Twenty-five years from now I will drive by cherry orchards and the nausea will rise up in me ; a tiny white worm . My mind will always be pushed back to this farm , and there is nothing I can do about it . I will never be able to get away . Today is a weekday . Later on I will learn the number of it , from hearing so much about it . But now I know nothing except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy stays home and sits out in front and waits for cars to stop . My mother comes outside to see where I am . She wears an old dress with cherry stains on it . The stains make me look at them , they remind me of something . Of blood . She has her hair pushed back . Her hair is streaked up in front , by the sun , but brown everywhere else . There is a picture of her when she had long hair ; she is n't my mother but somebody else . Around the house she is barefoot . Her legs look strong ; she could probably run fast if she wanted to but she never wants to . Everything is slow around her.  |p203The  chickens are nervous , picking in the dirt and watching her for food . They jerk their heads from side to side . If she raises her hand they will flutter their wings , waiting to be fed . My mother comes over to me where I am sitting on the branches , She brushes my hair out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back , to go down there ? " she says . " I want to play with my dam , " I tell her . I lean back so she can't. touch my hair . When she works in the kitchen her pale hands are stained from cherries . I do n't like them to touch me then . When she gives me my bath they 're like that too . I do n't always like her . I can like her if I want to , but I do n't have to . I like Daddy better , on purpose , even though Mommy is nicer to me . She never knows what I am thinking . " I can take you down in a while , myself , " she says . " Okay ? " I stare down at nothing . My face gets hard . " What the hell is so good about playing in that dirty water ' ? " she says . This makes my heart beat hard , with hating her . Her eyebrows are thin and always look surprised . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stands with her hands thrust in her pockets , and her shoulders slump . I always know before she does what she is going to say . " All right , then , go on down . But do n't get wet . " I run around back of our orchard and through the next-door neighbor 's field . Nothing is planted there . Then a path begins that goes down the big hill to the creek . In August the creek is shallow and there is filth in little patches in it , from sewers up creek . Fishermenfish anywhere along the creek , but there are some spots they like more than others . We always play by the rocks . There are also pieces of iron lying around , from when the new bridge was built . I ca n't remember any other bridge , but there was one . I have my own little rock , that Tommy lets me have . It is shaped like a funny loaf of bread and has little dents in it . It looks like birds chipped at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and run through the bushes , some yellow birds fly up in surprise . Then everything is quiet . I walk in the water right away , to get my shoes wet . I hate my mother . Yesterday she was sitting on Daddy 's lap ; she was barefoot and her feet were dirty.  |p204They  told me to come by them but I would n't . I ran outside by myself . Down at the creek I am happier by myself , but something makes me shiver . It is too quiet . If I was to fall in the water and drown nobody would know about it or care . A man drowned in this creek , a few miles away . It was out back of a tavern . I heard my father talk about it . When I look around there is a man standing on the bank . His car is parked up on the road but I did n't see it before . The man waves at me and grins . I can see his teeth way out here . " Real nice day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I narrow my eyes and watch him . Something touches the back of my neck , trying to tell me something . I start to shiver but stop . He reminds me of the man that drowned . Maybe his body was n't taken out of the creek but lost . This man is too tall . His arms hang down . He has a fishing pole in one hand that is long and gawky like he is . There is something about the way he is standing  --  with his legs apart , as if he thought somebody might run and knock him down  --  that makes my eyes get narrow . " You live around here ? " he says . He takes off his hat and tosses it down as if he was tired of it . Now I know what he is : a colored man . I know what a colored man is like . But this one is n't black like the one my grandmother pointed out when we were driving . This one has a light brown skin . When Tommy gets real brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " he says . I should run past him and up the hill and go home . I know this . Mommy told me so . But something makes me stay where I am . To make Mommy sorry , I will stay here , right where I am . I think of her watching me , standing up on top of the hill and watching and feeling sorry for me . " I 'm six , " I tell the man . With my head lowered I can still see him through my lashes . My eyes are half closed . Everything is prickly and strange . Like when you are going to be sick but do n't know it yet and are just waiting for something to happen . Something is going to happen . Or like when there is a spider on the ceiling , in just the second before you turn your head to see it . You know it 's there but do n't know why . There is somethingbetween us like a wet soft cobweb that keeps us watchingp205each other , the colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " What are you doing ? " he says . He squats down on the bank . He puts the fishing pole and the bag behind him . He looks like a dog waiting for his dish ; he knows he ca n't come until it 's ready . I could throw a stone at him , and he could reach out and catch it with a laugh . " Can I come look ? " he says . He gets up slowly . His legs are long and he walks like he is n't used to walking . He comes right out to where I am and looks at what I have : a little dam made with stones between my rock and another rock . The water is running slowly through it . Nothing can stop that water . There is scum on it , greasy spots , and I touch them with my finger even though I hate them . " I got two crabs in here , " I tell the man . I can hear him breathing when he bends down to look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know I should run away . Men smell like smoke or something . They smell like beer , or the outside , or sweat . He is different from them . " A crab would like to bite a nice little girl like you , " he says . Right in the middle of talking he makes a swallowing sound . I keep playing in the water just like I was alone . I seem to seem my mother coming out on the porch , frowning and making that sharp line like a cut between her eyebrows . She looks down and sees my doll on the steps , by itself . If she would come down to get me I would be all right . But she wo n't . She will just go back in the house and forget about me . Now the colored man squats besides me . He is still taller than I am . I am sitting with my feet in the water , and it makes me think of how the water might stop me , pulling at my feet , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airplane would fly past we could look up at it , but nothing happens . After a while the man starts to talk to me . He says I have mud on me . Yes , this is right . It is like in a dream ; maybe he puts the mud on me somehow when I was n't watching . I 'm afraid to look at him , but his voice is soft and nice . He talks about little boys and little girls . I know he is not a daddy from the way he talks . " Your hair is real nice , " he says.  |p206As  soon as he touches me I am not afraid . He takes something out of my hair and shows me  --  a dried-up leaf . We both laugh . He is bending toward me . His eyes are funny . The eyelid is sleepy and would push down to close the eyes , except the eyeball bulges too much . It ca n't see enough . We are so close together that I can see tiny litle threads of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that is funny to me , I never saw it so close . I would like to touch it but I do n't dare . The man 's mouth keeps moving . Sometimesit is a smile , then it gets bigger , then it changes back to nothing . It is as if he does n't know what it 's doing . His teeth are yellowish . The top ones are big , and when he smiles I can see his gums  --  a bright pink color , like a dog 's . When he breathes his nostrils get small and then larger . I can almost see the warm air coming out of him , mixed with the smell of licorice and the dark smell of his skin . He touches my shoulders and arms . He is saying something . He talks about my father and says he knows him , and he would like to be my father too . But he is not like any of the fathers because he talks in a whisper and nobody does that . He would not hit me or get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he must see me like you see something in a fog . His neck has a cord in it or something that moves ; my grandmother has that too . It is the only ugly thing about him . Now he is washing me . His breath is fast and warm against my skin . " They 'll spank you if you 're not clean . You got to be clean . All clean , " he says . When he pulls my shirt off over my head the collar gets stuck by my nose and hurts me , but I know it is too late to run away . The water keeps coming and making a noise . " Now this . Hold on here , " he says , with his voice muffled as if it was pushed in a pillow , and he pulls my shorts down and takes them off . I ca n't stop shivering now . He stares at me . His hand is big and dark by my arm . I say I want to go home , and my voice is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you just be nice , " he says . He moves his hand on my back so that I am pressed up by by him . I wait for something to hurt me but nothing hurts me . He would never hurt me like they would . His breath is fast andp207he could be drowning , and then he pushed me back a little . " Why do n't you walk in the water a little ? " His forehead is wrinkled , and in the wrinkles there are drops of sweat that wo n't run down . I would n't want to touch his hair . He stares at me while I wade in the water . Everywhere he touched me I feel strange , and where he looks at me I feel strange . I know how he is watching . I can feel how he likes me . He would never hurt me . Something that makes me want to laugh comes up into my throat and almost scares me . The sun is hot and makes me tired . He takes my clothes and dresses me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops my shirt and picks it up again , right away . Then with his long forefinger he rubs my arm down to the wrist , as if he does n't understand what it is . His hands are real funny inside  --  a pink color , not like the rest of him . His fingernails are light too but ridged with dirt . " Do n't leave yet , " he says . " Please . Sit and eat this with me . " When we eat the licorice he seems to forget about it , even when it 's in his mouth . He forgets to chew it . I can see something coming into his eyes that makes him forget about me ; he is listening to something . We have a secret together that I wo n't ever tell . When I come home Mommy is still in the kitchen . But everythinglooks different . It is the same but different . The air is wet . The way Mommy looks at me when I come in is different . She is smoking a cigarette . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She might be going to hit me , and I jerk back . But she just bends down and starts to unlace my shoe . " Just lucky for you these are the old ones , " she says . The top of her head is damp . I can see her white scalp in places right through her hair . " Come on , put your foot up , " she says , tugging at my shoe . When the shoes are off she straightens up , and her face shows that she feels something hurt her . " What the hell is that ? " she says . My heart starts to pound . " What ? " " On your teeth . "  |p208She  stares at me . I can see the little lines on her face that will get to be like Grandma 's . " I said what is that ? What have you been eating ? " I try to pull away from her . " Nothing . " " What have you been eating ? Licorice ? Who gave it to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and sniffs , like a cat . I think of how I hate her because she can know every secret . Who gave it to you ? " " Nobody . " " I said who gave it to you ! " She slaps me . Her hand moves so fast both of us are afraid of it . She makes me cry . " Who gave it to you ? Who was it ? Was it somebody down at the creek ? " " A man . . . a man had it  --  " " What man ? " " A man down there . " " A fisherman ? " " Yes . " Her head is moving a little , rocking back and forth as if her heart began to pound too hard . " Why did he give it to you ? Were you alone ? " " He liked me . " " Why did he give it to you ? " Her eyes are like the cat 's eyes . They are too big for her face . What I see in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do anything to you ? " she says . Her voice is getting higher . " What did he do ? What did he do ? " " Nothing . " She pulls me in from the door , like she does n't know what she is doing . " God , " she says . She does n't know 1 can hear it . " My God . My God . " I try to push against her legs . I would like to run back out the door and away from her and back down to the creek . " What did he do ? " she says . I am crying now . " Nothing . I like him . I like him better than you ! " She pulls me to the kitchen chair and knocks me against it , asp209if she was trying to make me sit on it but forgot how . The chair hurts my back . " Tell me what he did ! " she screams . She knocks me against the chair again . She is trying to hurt me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somebody else 's . She is like somebody from the city come to get me . It seems to me that the colored man is hiding behind me , afraid of her eyes and her screaming , that awful voice I never heard before . She is trying to get both of us . " What did he do ? Oh , my God , my God ! " Her words all run together . She is touching me everywhere , my arms , my legs . Her fingers want to pinch me but she wo n't let them . " He took your clothes off , did n't he ? " she says . " He took them off . He took them off  --  this is on backwards , this is ... " She begins to scream . Her arms swing around and one of the jars is knocked off the table and breaks on the floor . I try to get away from her . I kick her leg . She is going to kill me , her face is red and everything is different , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I know from the way her eyes stare at me that something terrible happened and that everything is changed . I am six years old . Down at the creek , I am trying to sit on a rock but my feet keep sliding off . Am I too big for the rock now ? Flow big am I ? Am I six years old or some other age ? My toes curl inside my shoes but I ca n't take hold of the rock . The colored man leans toward me and touches my hair . " I 'm going to be your new daddy , " he says . The colored man leans toward me and touches my shoulders . His hand is warm and heavy . The colored man leans toward me and put his big hand around the back of my neck . He touches me with his mouth , and then I can feel his teeth and his tongue all soft and wet on my shoulder . " I love you , " he says . The words come back inside my head over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : " I love you . " Then I am in the water and it touches me everywhere . I start to scream . My mouth tries to make noises but I ca n't hear them until somebody saves me . " Honey , wake up . Wake up ! "  |p210My  mother is by the bed . She pulls me awake . " What 's wrong , honey ? " she says . " What did you dream about ? " In the light from the lamp her face is lined and not pretty . I can hear myself crying . My throat is sore . When I see her face it makes me cry harder . What if they all come in behind her , all those people again , to look at me ? The doctor had something cold that touched me . I hated them all . I wanted them to die . But only my father comes in . He stumbles against the bureau . " Another one of them dreams , huh ? " he says in a voice like the doctor 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first night he was in here before my mother , to help me . My mother presses me against her . Her hands rub my back and remind me of something . . . the creek again , and the dead dry smell and the rush of terror like ice that came up in me , from way down in my stomach . Now it comes again and I ca n't stop crying . " Hey , little girl , come on now , " my father says . He bends over me with his two hands on his thighs , frowning . He stares at me and then at my mother . He is wondering who we are . " We better drive her back to the doctor tomorrow , " he says . " Leave her alone , she 's all right , " my mother says . " What the hell do you know about it ? " " She was n't hurt , it 's all in her head . It 's in her head , " my mother says sharply . She leans back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside my head . " I can take care of her . " " Look , I ca n't take this much longer . It 's been a year now --  " " It has not been a year ! " my mother says . My crying runs down . It always stops . Then they go out and I hear them walk in the kitchen . Alone in bed , I lie with my legs stiff and my arms stiff ; something bad will happen if I move . I have to stay just the way I am when they snap off my light , or something will happen to me . I have to stay like this until morning . They are out in the kitchen . At first they talk too low for me to hear , then louder . If they argue it will get louder . One night they talked about the nigger and I could hear them . Tommy could hear them too ; I know he was awake . The nigger was caught and a state trooper that Daddy knows real well kicked him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember that face now . Yes ,  |p211I  can remember it . I can remember some face . He did something terrible , and what was terrible came onto me , like black tar you ca n't wash off , and they are sitting out there talking about it . They are trying to remember what that nigger did to me . They were n't there and so they ca n't remember it . They will sit there until morningand then I will smell coffee . They are talking about what to do , what to do with me , and they keep trying to remember what that nigger did to me . My mother 's voice lifts sleepily . " Oh , you bastard ! " she says . Something made of glass touches something else of glass . The rooster out back has been crowing for hours . " Look , " says my father , and then his voice drops and I ca n't hear it . I lie still with my legs and arms stiff like they were made of ice or stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . time is it ? " says my mother . The room is starting to get light and so I know everything is safe again . The first time I read " The Molesters " I had to leave the library at once . I felt uncanny . The air seemed to be rocking about me . I hurried through the shopping area of Cedar Grove as if under a spell , and for a while I stood at the corner near the Montclair Hat Shoppe and waited in terror for something to happen . Nothing happened . The story seemed to me very confusing but " artistic . " ' Was it confusing because it was artistic , or artistic because it was confusing ? I have since then stolen that copy of The Quarterly Review of Literature from the library , and to my shame be it said that I stole other copies of the issue from other libraries , I do n't knowp212why . I have seventeen copies here in my miserable room . They are all precisely the same . The story takes time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is only one man by the creek , only one man , and he happens to be a Negro . A Negro molester . ( But rather gentle for a molester , I think . Is this Nada 's sentimentalism ? ) 2 . The title refers to more than one molester ; hence we see that all the adults are " molesters " ; they molest and are adults ; they go about their business of adulthood , which consists partly ( it would be selfish to say wholly ) of molesting. 3 . The child , who is much like myself , is telling the story to herself in various stages , unable to allow herself the full memory at first . It is too terrible . She gradually works up to it , is finally flooded by it and annihilated , so that the story ends upon an act of molestation . Clever Natashya Romanov , the author , who becomes herself one of the poking , prying molesters ! 4 . In symbolic terms : the child is myself , Richard Everett . Nada wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoning me so often. s . Nada , in three forms , as three adults , recognizes herself as my molester and acknowledges her guilt . Have I seen something forbidden ? Have I made an error ? About me on that fateful Cedar Grove day traffic moved on , traffic lights changed and changed again , people moved by , idle and ambling arid attractive . I reached out to touch the brick of a building and the brickp213was rough , yes , and the sensation sped through my fingertipsand into the depths of my body , assuring me of one thing : I was alive . Molesters are all about us . What can I do to be saved ? If the child-hero of the story can not understand what has happened to her , how are the rest of us to know ? I include you , my readers . Flow will we know what mad acts were performed upon us , what open-heart surgery , what stealthy home brain surgery ? Can we trust our well-meaning memories , our feeble good natures , which want to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly thoughts ? ... Is this an ordinary disintegration , a routine textbookcase , or is there something woeful and transcendent about it ? Imagine Hamlet stunted at eleven years of age  --  do I claim too much for myself ? Am I classic or trivial ? Am I archetypical or stereotypal ? Is all suffering too familiar ? Think of the power of words , my readers ! Everything depends upon the style , the tone , the exact gesture , the divine play of words . Those anemic written signs Nada played with , having the power to raise up in me a seizure of trembling of the sort I had n't had since the Johns Behemoth orgy in the Record Room  --  what a secret is behind them ! There are some of us , sick people and madmen , who should not be shown symbolic matter . Pictures , designs , words , are too much for us . We fall into them and never hit the bottom ; it 's like falling and falling into one of your own dreams . We make too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much to us . You think only food excites me , my readers ? You think all the food I devour ( those disgusting bonesp214over in the corner , those heaps of emptied tin cans ! ) means anything to me ? Not at all , not at all  --  bulk to induce sleep and peace , nothing more . I am going to eat my way out of this life , like Nada 's noble kinsman . Food means nothing but words mean everything ! You see how I have become my mother 's son . Without her writing she would have been just Nada in the kitchen , Nada in her bathrobe upstairs , Nada on the telephone , Nada here , there , hugging me , turning vaguely from me  --  just that dark-haired lovely woman with the slightly knobby knees and wrists who , when she was in a hurry , walked along in a girlish , bobbing way with one hand bent sharply at the wrist as if to show that awkward little wrist bone . Yes , I would have loved her the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , but when I could read what she had written , creep and crawl and snuggle inside her brain , I began to see that the Nada who lived with us was just another visitor in our house , not as real or as colorful as Mrs. Hofstadter . That Nada was pretending . Was n't she always saying to Father , " I admire you , I do n't understand you so I admire you , " and was n't she always growing vague , remote , her gaze drifting away to the ceiling , and who was this Sheer ? What could he give her that we could n't ? No , the woman I called " Nada " ( that stupid name , she was right ) was just a liar . She cheated all the time . You who 've never read the secret words of the familiar , domesticated people you love , you who 've never snuggled into their brains and looked out through their eyes , how can you understand what I felt ? It 's as if I had opened a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , but Nada as she really was , a stranger , a person Father and I did not know and had no connection with.  |p215We  are accustomed to people existing in orbit around us , and we dread thinking of their deaths because of the slight tug we will feel when their presence is gone  --  we 'll be drawn out closer to the frigidity of darkness , space , death . We are accustomed to these smaller planets always showing the same sides to us , familiar , predictable , secure , sound , sane , accommodating , but when I looked through Nada 's eyes I knew that I had been tricked , that she showed only her narrowest , most ignorant side to me , and that she had cheated me all my life . Did I still love her ? I loved her more than ever , of course . Mothers who cringe and beg for love get nothing , and they deserve nothing , but mothers like Nada who are always backing out of the driveway draw every drop of love out of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do anything with . It has no value . We who love hopelessly are like noblemen in exile , an exile with no kingdom to look back at , to remember . Our beloved exists within the perfect halo of her own consciousness , selfish and adored , protected from us by the very violence of the love we feel . Is this a boy 's love for his mother , you 're wondering ? Eh ? Oh , let it be anything  --  any kind of love ! I had enough love for any kind ' I could outlast lovers , husbands , pals  --  and let me mention my most formidable rival , a woman with handsome olive skin , eyes slightly slanted ( make-up ? Oriental blood ? ) , who wore dark wool , heavy jewelry , and had advanced degreesin European history . She had been Nada 's friend for a few months one winter . I remember them laughing softly together , that coy , sly tilting of their heads that meant secrets , intimacy , a closeness Father never knew and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den ,  |p216|pretending  to be looking for a book . Dr. Lippick , goddamyou ! But she disappeared finally , I do n't know how , drawn out into someone else 's orbit or knocked askew by someone in Nada 's orbit , for Nada was always moving on , you know , like any major constellation , driving onwardtoward whatever it was she believed she was seeking , and along with her went satellites and particles of dust , among them myself . I said I was a nobleman in exile and that 's garbage of course , it 's sentimental bombast , and it is n't true either that I had no kingdom or memory of one . My kingdom was the place we were going to enter finally , Nada and I. Together . Time was passing us , like a gentle spring breeze that has come from some innocent cove thousands of miles away , and overtakes us , and passes us by . I had to get us safely into that kingdom . Was it that day or another day , after reading " The Molesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's say it was that same afternoon . At about one o'clock I read the story , and at two o'clock I went into a small shop called Ax 's Sporting Goods . I asked the man shyly about a rifle . He chuckled the way Father did and asked me how old I was . I looked at some rifles , touched them , smelled them . A rocking , nauseated sensation rose in me but I recognized it  --  it was familiar , it did n't alarm me . It was n't a bad feeling . It was like coming out of a druginducedsleep : waking is painful but you want it badly . You want it more than anything in the world , though it 's easier to sleep ; you could sleep forever and spend no energy . Ah , if I woke I would do many things ! I would grow into manhood and be a son worthy of my mother ! If I woke . . . In the end I went down the street to a drugstore andp217there bought a magazine called " He-Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was partly a comic book ) I found the grubby little ads I craved : " Are Guns Your Hobby ? " " For Target Practice . " " Halt ! " " New AmazingBallpoint Pen Gun $3.98 ! " " German Sniper Rifle Used by Mad Fanatic SS Men  --  Limited Number ! " " Assemble at Home  --  Be a Sharpshooter ! Protect Yourselfat All Times ! " Crummy drawings of rifles , machine guns , pistols , revolvers , bazookas , cannons , anything . " Own Your Own Cannon ! Powerful Enough to Down a Tank ! " Why not own your own tank too ? But no tanks were for sale in this magazine . Read my desperation in the rapidity with which I settledupon one of these ads , distinguished in no way from the others , bought some envelopes in the drugstore and took out one of them , made out the coupon at the bottom of the ad , and actually slid into that envelope along with the coupon several handfuls of dollar bills Father had given me off and on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing gum or free tickets he 'd been handed himself , forgetfully and spasmodically , everything accumulating in his pockets . And I bought a stamp in the stamp machine , was cheated of a penny , and addressed the envelope in my boyish block letters , and mailed it down at the corner . It took no more than five minutes and I was on my way . " Do you have friends ? What do you do ? What are you always reading ? Would you like to go to camp this summer ? Your father said you might be interested in the Little League team , is that true ? " " I do n't remember saying that . " " I 'm sure you do n't . He must have imagined it , " Nada said sarcastically . She finished the piece of celery and wiped her fingers lightly on the sofa covering . " What have you been reading lately , Richard ? " I laid down my pencil reluctantly . What if I told her I spent my time reading the things she had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her stories must have used up all the sympathy she had in her ? You would think nothing would be easier to get than sympathy from Natashya Romanov , but here was Natashya Romanov herself , in yellow silk slacks and a yellow and green blouse , staring at me as if I had just crawled out of a crack in the wall . " Science-fiction stories , " I said . She looked disinterested at once . " Richard , did you miss me while I was gone ? " she said . " Why did n't you answer my letters ? " " When ? " " When I was gone , silly . When I was gone . " It pleased me to be called " silly " by her . " I was busy with school . " " Oh , that ridiculous Johns Behemoth , that disgusting Nash ! But did you miss me ? " " Sure . " " Did your father take away the letters 1 wrote to you , or did you see them ? " " I saw them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Yes , Nada . " " He wanted to come between us , but it 's over now and I do n't blame him . Your father and I are friends now . Everything is forgiven . " " Father was very nice  --  " " He wants you to call him Daddy . " " Daddy  --  " " But call him anything you want . I do n't care . " " He was very nice , he took me to the movies andbowling . He was nice all the time , " I said miserably . " Did he drink much ? " " Drink ? " " Richard , you do n't really know your father . He 's a man you have n't met yet . Do n't let him fool you . " " Yes , Nada . " She stared at me . " What the hell do you mean ? You sound as if you 're imitating someone . What is it ? Are you imitating the person I 'm supposed to think you are ? Who do you talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you keep listening to the wrong people ? I know you were eavesdropping on me the other day when I was on the phone . I heard you upstairs , my little friend , but I was too polite to accuse you . " She had been speaking seriously , but now she laughed . All of Nada 's words were canceled out by her destructive laughter . She gave me the same sideways look a boy had given me the other day , except that boy had been wearing a sweatshirt with JESUS SAVES on its front and dark sunglasses , so that as a matter of fact one should n't have expected a " look " from him at all . Out in the hallway , at the bottom of the door that led to the basement , something moved suddenly  --  a tiny face and paws emerged for an instant and then disappeared.  |p224It  was not enough to wake me from my stupor so I said nothing to my mother . Maybe I had imagined it anyway . Nada talked on and I noticed that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend " business , and that this meant she had herself taken on a new friend . When she fell silent I was afraid she would leave , so I said quickly anything that came to mind . " Mrs. Hofstadter cut Gustave'sfingernails and toenails the other day , with a clippers , and she almost severed his little toe . " Nada frowned . " You say the wildest things , Richard . " " It 's true . Mrs. Hofstadter has been acting funny . " " You 're too critical of adults , " she said . " Anyway , my little friend , if a mother wants to clip off her son 's little toe , or indeed his big toe , who has a better right ? " " Do n't you like Gustave ? " " Of course . IIc 's nice . " She stretched out her legs and sighed lazily . " What say for a treat , friend ? Should I drive us out to IIo-Jo 's and get you a cone , or would you like to go down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some vanilla cones down there . " " I do n't want to go down in the cellar . " " Why not ? " " There are some mice or something down there . " " Oh , you 're crazy ! " She laughed . " We do n't have mice here . What do you think this is , a slum ? We could drive out to Ho-Jo 's then . " " I 'm not hungry . " " Why , mice out there too ? Mice everywhere ? " " I 'm not sure if it 's mice . " Nada straightened . She had heard our maid , Libby , who was in the kitchen doing something ; some pans clattered . " That woman ca n't suppress her unconsciousp225hostile feelings , " Nada said . " Listen to her banging around ! " " She 's nice . " " Oh , everyone 's nice . " There was a moment of awkward silence . Then the telephone rang at Nada 's elbow . She said , " No , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have the wrong number . No , I wish I were that woman . " She hung up and winked at me . " Seriously , Mother , there are mice or something down there  --  " " What 's this , now you 're calling me Mother ? Weaned at last ? Do n't give me that solemn weepy look through your glasses , my friend , I do n't particularly care to be called Mother by anyone . I do n't respond to it . I 'm trying to hold my own and that 's it . No Mother , no Son . No depending on anyone else . I want you to be so free , Richard , that you stink of it . You 're not going to blame me for anything . " " Who should I blame then ? " " Nobody . " " Not even Father ? " " Especially not him . " " Is n't there anybody ? " " My own father , my drunken madman of a father , " Nada said , but without her usual melodramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on that call . " If you do n't be quiet I 'll buy a Home ClipperCutterfrom the Discount Mart and cut your hair here at home and almost sever ' your ears , little chum . You and Gustave both . " She reached over and stroked my hair.  |p226She  was right , it did need to be cut . Father took me out on Saturdays when he had his own hair cut , but sometimes he was far away and forgot about me ; it was possible for me to go a long time without having a haircut . Like most things about me , my long hair did not quite matter . " You know , Richard , once I spent two days tracking down a single lie of your father 's . Two days of my life . And I discovered that he had n't lied , no , but when he told the truth he told it in such a way that one thought , Good Christ ! That must be a lie . That 's your father . " " Nada , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved away from me . There was something too casual about her expression . " An abortion , if you must know , is something that fails to come off . Let 's see : we plan on Father grilling steaks for us tonight , but at the last minute Father fails to come home . Hence , the steak barbecue is aborted . " " Is that what it means ? " She was silent for a moment , not exactly looking at me . It was never possible to tell what she was looking at or thinking . After a moment she said , " What say we drive out to Ho-Jo 's then , pal ? Stuff ourselves on some cheap tasty food ? Father will be gone tonight and tomorrow night , so we can eat anything we please and at any time we please . " " You never tell me the truth , Nada , " I said bitterly . " Oh , you 're making me tired . Leave me alone , you little pest . " The telephone rang and she picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said quickly . Sunk in my lethargy , I watched her and thought how strange it was that she was my mother , that there wasp227so much that should be said between us but which would not be said . The time in which to say it was running out like that breeze drifting gently past us as she dawdled and talked with that Other Person .. . " Oh , I ca n't talk now , do n't annoy me , " she said in the same voice she had used with me . " When , tonight ? No , not tonight . Tomorrow . Yes , he wo n't be back . Look , I ca n't talk now . I 've told you not to call me . Yes . Good-by . " " Who was that , Nada ? " I said . " Do n't Nada me , you little fake , " she said . She rose lazily , happily . Her voice was slightly detached , as if she were still on the telephone . " Look , are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there ? " But we never got out to dinner that night : a strange thing happened . Libby slipped down the three steps that led to the back porch , spraining an ankle , and we had to tend to her . We had been about to leave when this happened , and dutifully we came back . That 's how it is in ordinary life . Scenes move toward sensible conclusions , then someone slips and falls and ruins everything . Now , years later , I still nurse an unreasonable hatred for Libby . She was a greedy woman , my Nada . You know the story of the old grouch Juvenal eating until he was sick , out of pure spite at the heaven of sensuality he could not enter , and if you know that you also know the story of Laurence Sterne and Charles Churchill come to London ( but not together ) , lunatic , depraved gluttons of clergymenwhose only aim in life was to devour as much of anything as was available !  --  and all of history gives us these weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grossness , but not enough to satisfy , coming to London or Paris or Rome or New York , anywhere , to fill their stomachs and brains with whatever was handy . But even as Juvenal vomited as he ate , so Nada did vomit back out much of what she took in so eagerly ; and even as Sterne and Churchill met their ends in excess , so did Nada invite her finish by an excess of greed . On the evening following Libby 's fall Nada went out at about five . She said , " Richard , will you be all right ? I have to see someone . " I heard her drive out and watched the yellow car disappeardown Labyrinth Drive and wondered whether I should follow her on my bicycle ; but no , you do n't do that . And at five-thirty what should turn in our drive but another yellow car ? It was Father come home a day early . He drove up but did not drive the car into the garage . I noticed that . I was sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard Father 's car pause , stall , stop . I heard him sit there for a while , looking in at the empty garage . Finally he got out and came to the backdoor . " Father ? " He stumbled up into the kitchen . " Oh , it 's you , " he said . There was a moment when his smile did not work , then it worked . He rumpled my hair as if this were an obligation to me . " Nada not in just now , eh ? Is she shopping for food ? "  | " I do n't know . " " Did she say where she went ? " " I do n't remember . " " Yes , hmmm , " he said meaninglessly . He wandered into the dining room and turned on the lights . I followed him into the hall , then into the living room . This living room was rather long . You could not be certain , standing in the doorway , if the room was really empty or not . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end , screened by a giant plant or disguisedsimply by distance . In the instant before Father switched on the light I thought I saw someone sitting by the fireplace . " When did she leave ? " Father said . " A few minutes ago . " " So late ? Very strange , " he said . We wandered back into the hall . Father switched on another light , and we heard the scratch of tiny nails down at the far end of the hall , by the basement door . " What in good Christ is that ? " he said , genuinely astonished . I ran to open the basement door , and we saw two chipmunksdashing madly down the carpeted stairs . " What 's that ? " Father cried . " Rats ? Mice ? " " Chipmunks . " " But what are chipmunks doing in here ? In our house ? " " They must have gotten in by mistake . " Father was panting hoarsely . We listened and heard the scratching of tiny , frenzied toenails downstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his suit coat and thrust it at me . " I 'll get ' em , " he said . " Little saucy bastards ! " He ran downstairs two and three at a time , a big ,  |p230heavy  , sweating man , and at the landing he grabbed the broom Libby had left and , wielding it like a great weapon , made his way into the main room of the basement . Three chipmunks scattered , panicked , and Father started after them with the broom raised and his chest sending out great bursts of rage . " Hyar ! Hyar ! " he cried , like a mythical Texan routing a maverick steer . I sat at the foot of the stairs and hugged my knees . I watched . Father rushed at one corner , swinging the broom , and slapped it down hard . The chipmunk flew out to one side and , its tiny legs pumping wildly , ricocheted off the wall and fled in another direction . " Hyar , you little bastard ! " Father yelled . His eyes bulged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time scooping the chipmunk off the floor and slamming it hard against the wall . It fell with a soft plopping noise , and he hit it again and again with the flat of the broom , grunting . " Oh , you little bastard , " he said softly , in just the same tone Nada had once used on him . Then , flushed with victory , he turned from the lifeless and battered chipmunk and rushed into another corner , where another terrified creature darted out blindly  --  and he swung the broom around again in a most skillful , graceful arc , at the last moment scooping the broom up in the air so that he could bring it down flat on the chipmunk . And again . And again . After a few threshing minutes he got the third chipmunk , and then , panting wildly , he whirled around to see yet another chipmunk making its cautious way in from the laundry room . Stupid rodent ! Father yelled and rushed at it and chased it back into the laundry room . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again.  |p231My  heart beat calmly and regularly , 0 my readers , and I will not be so sophisticated as to deny that I felt sorrow for those poor beasts , and something beyond sorrow . When it was over , Father appeared again , with the broom up over his shoulder like a musket . " Good Christ , what a workout , " he said , wiping his forehead . " That did me good . That really did me good . " He glanced at me and said , " You want to help me get rid of them ? " " I feel a little sickish . " " Oh , sickish ! Buster , you 're always sickish ! Poor kid . " He pitched the broom into a corner and it remained standing , as if by magic , then he turned and contemplated the battlefield with his hands on his hips . The three mangled and crushed chipmunks lay curiously close together . " Hah , hah , " Father murmured , rubbing his hands vigorously , " we 'll just clean up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bent to pick the first chipmunk up , delicately by its tail , an unfortunate thing happened : the tail broke in two close to the body and what was left of the chipmunk fell to the floor . " Dirty little bugger , " Father hissed . It is no credit to me that I did not offer to help him . I thought of the newspaper in the corner before he did but had n't the heart or the stomach to speak . I wanted to sit still , very still . But Father finally thought of the paper by himself and unfolded it near the chipmunks and kicked them onto the paper , gingerly enough . Then when he had them he folded the paper up neatly and took it to the incinerator . " Will this stuff burn , Dickie ? " he asked , grimacing over his shoulder.  |p232And  did they fight that night ? No , indeed , because Father did this : he emerged from his triumph with the chipmunks , washed his hands , had a bit of Scotch , sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Richard , I will make a deal with you . I will take you out to all the Little League tryouts you want , I 'll pull strings to get you on the team , if you 'll help me with this . You see , I do n't want to upset your mother , so I think I 'll spend the night at a motel . Then I 'll come home tomorrow as planned , right ? And she need n't know .. . well , she need n't know what you know . I mean , that I was . . . home tonight . Will you help me ? " Yes , it was pathetic to watch , because he was still rather flushed from his workout and at the same time a chill had come over him . Poor Father ! He looked like the mad maniac who had kidnaped a child in Vermont , held her captive and " molested " her for five days , and was finally shot down by police , a state militia , and many private citizens on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first-person tale told by the child herself of the peculiar apocalyptic mutterings of the madman , of the many times he did " it " to her , and how close he came to killing her ! A most chilling tale indeed , and it did your heart good to see the child 's newly curled locks and smile for the photographers , and to know that she had received many thousands of dollars for her exclusive story . But the photograph I speak of is the madman 's :  |p233some  daring cameraman got a shot of him just as he turned to meet a barrage of shotgun pellets and bullets , and his glittering , twisted , wet look was just the same as Father 's look , though Father must not have really expectedbullets to come tearing into his chest . " Is it a deal , buddy ? " he said nervously . " Sure , Dad . " We shook hands on our Secret . Father said I was always sick and and I want to defend myself . I was n't always sick . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many other days when I was well enough to drag myself around . On other days I suppose I was " sick , " but not really ill . There is a difference . I hope you wo n't think that I ever played sick , begging a quiet morning home from school with Nada . It was not necessary for me to play sick , though I played many things . I played healthy , for instance , which could be a tiring task , and I played an eleven-year-old with some success . But I never needed to play sick because sickness , or a mild queasiness , was my natural state . After I confessed to my crime at least one doctor , attracted as they all are by the most choice exhibitions of corrupt flesh and spirit , made a study of my various diseases and ailments and termed me a " medical catastrophe . " Another doctor , a psychiatrist , declared that I was a hopelessly neurotic/ psychotic hypochondriac with some respectable overtonesp234of the Kress syndrome  --  that is , some real disorders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two diagnoses and pronounced my physical organism to be supplying my mad mind with the basis for its madness or , on the other hand , my mad mind so despised itself for lying ( no one believed my confession , of course ) that it summoned up physical disorders to punish the body . I like that theory ! I like the eerie , primitive magic behind it  --  the mad mind " summoning up physical disorders " as if by telephone . Dr. Saskatoon was a genial and intelligent man , and his professional decline saddens me . And what precisely were my troubles ? I will list them in an order dictated by a poetic association of ideas . My readers , I suffered from chronic toothache , mysteriously begun and mysteriously ending . I suffered from twelvehourflu , four-day flu , two-week flu , and common intestinal flu that could shoot incredible pains through my abdomen for half an hour , then vanish . I suffered from watery eyes , sore eyes , sensitive eyes , weak eyes  --  and all the same two eyes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes simultaneously ( the mild ache throughout my brain and the severe one above my left eye ) . I suffered from frequent sore throats , from various kinds of asthma ( I was allergic to cats , to chicken and turkey feathers , to pollen , poppies , birds ' nests , fox stoles , etc. ) , from rashes both scabby and flaky , from bumps , itches , and undefined swellings . I suffered from all kinds of colds : head , chest , stomach , muscle , anywhere . My eyes watered and my teeth chattered . I was subject to severe shivering fits in the winter if I went outside too scantily dressed . I coughed , I hacked , I sneezed . I was always falling down too , even at the age of eleven . As a smaller child I always had bruised andp235scab-marred knees and elbows . I could fall from tricycle , wagon , tractor , pushcart ; I even fell out of my baby buggy once when no one was looking . I could fall while standing flat-footed on a sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs and stumbled up stairs . I fell over my own shoelaces , tied or untied . But nothing ever hurt me , much . It was as if my bones were too unshaped , too limp and malleable , to break . And I had the usual boring run of diseases . Measles , chicken pox , mumps , scarlet fever , rheumatic fever ( a mild case ) . I almost died with one attack of flu , however . Something had been wrong with my tonsils , and I think my appendix flared up once , years ago . Now I am a bundle of worse troubles , but I do n't go to doctors and I do n't know what 's wrong . I do n't care to know . By body is just a vessel or instrument I am using , as this typewriter is an instrument I 'm using , and when I am finished with this memoir I will be finished with this body . That 's all . Sometimes I could hear the invisible grit in the air singing around my ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grove Junior High Summer Session . I studied math . My mathematical steps were always sensible , though my conclusions were often wrong . It was as if , led to the very brink of the inevitable , my pencil somehow swerved and whimsically snatched at an impossibleanswer.  |p236I  think I woke up totally at times . I do n't know . Squealing brakes warned me to jump back up on a curb , yes , but whether this qualifies as " waking " me I 'm not sure . There were pressures that kept me tired and dopey . For instance ? Walking into a room in which Father and Nada were and having them stop at once their conversation to smile dazzlingly at me . That pushed me down a little . Nada had moved out of the big bedroom again and left Father there alone , retiring as she always did to her " study . " Four days in a row she asked me what I was studying in summer school , and Father kept mentioningthe Little League as if it were something I should be teasing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind this because at such times my gaze would meet Nada 's and we would share a silent contempt for such nonsense  --  imagine me acting out the farce of childhoodathletics ! Precarious as they were with each other , their good spirits bubbled over onto everyone else . Many people visited them . I wo n't bother with the list of names ; it 's different from the Fernwood list but only superficially . One interesting man stands out : Mr. Body . You have heard the name Body before ( the advertising man who bought our house in Fernwood ) , but this is another Body family , unrelated , I 'm sorry to say . I 'm sorry because I like unity of one kind or another , however foolish or arbitrary . Mr. Body loved to sit in Nada 's gold Queen Anne chair , cross his legs , and talk about the loss of freedoms in America . " Soon they 'll be taking away from us the right to bear arms , to protect ourselves with rifles , " he declared . Everyone agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone agrees with everyone else in Fernwood , or Cedar Grove , wherever we are . And there was another interesting man , one who did not fit in , one whose coming was contrived and suspicious : an old friend of Nada 's . He was a professional intellectualwhom Nada had brought to town , under the auspices of the Village Great Books Discussion Club . Each year a speaker came to speak at their luncheon , the good literary ladies ' luncheon . They had money , and in the past they had flown out to them James Dickey , Bennett Cerf , a very top narrative-writer for Walt Disney , even Paul Goodman , even Pearl Buck , and many others . But this year Nada had snagged for a mere $5oo the editor of The Transamerican Quarterly , who was also a book reviewer for The New York Times Book Review , . and also the somewhat notorious and flamboyant " film critic " for a prestigious men 's magazine to which Father subscribed . I missed his name , though I believe it ended in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish but Russian-Jewish . He was a house guest of Nada 's , a fact that agonized me , and a scant two hours after his arrival by jet there was a cocktail party for him , with all the literary ladies and their unliterary but very friendly husbands  --  the elite of Cedar Grove  --  present in his honor and anxious to make him feel at ease ; even Mavis Grisell , in town to visit her sister , was present with her winning , girlish smile . I , Richard , was allowed to parade around with plates of hors d'oeuvres ( tiny smoked oysters , tiny anchovies , shrimp with shrimp sauce , glazed crackers , cheesed crackers , cheesebits , onionbits , flaked , blown , browned , and homogenized potato chips , and of coursep238roasted cashews ) , and I took advantage of my role to observe this stranger from another part of my mother 's life . It was so rare that I was allowed to peek into that life . Let us draw nearer to this man . He was in his forties but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " for in Cedar Grove all men under sixty are spry and young , demons on the golf course ( until that fatal day at the ninth hole ) as they are behind desks and alighting from jetliners ; in the intellectual world they evidently head downhill fast after forty . This editor had short , thin , wirelike hair that stood up straight from his skull ; his hair was blond . His face was an aggressive blank to me the first time I served him some smoked oysters ( he scooped up several and ate them greedily ) , but the second time around I was able to look at him more closely . Face an oblong , rather bony , and eyebrows gray and patchy ; a band of small pits along his checks ( acne scars , smallpox ? not important anyway ) . His skin was sallow and heavy . An argumentativenose ; jaw darkened as if with shadow or a bluish beard about to pop out at any moment . His voice was rapid and assured , and his eyes were nervous , darting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the hypocrisy of American society , and he ate large , soft shrimp from a plate beside him as if to emphasize his words . " Our culture , my friends , " he said , " is based upon competition and greed . Who can deny this ? It is inhuman , totally inhuman . It is terrified by love  --  not just sexual love , my friends , but all love . Paradoxically enough , or rather not paradoxically at all , this culture is obsessed with brutality : in its fixed aesthetic forms , the police state and the television set . " Mavis Grisell clinked her Egyptian jewelry in agree/ment ; she was always agreeable . Nada sat a distance away and crossed her legs . Her vagueness that evening puzzled me , and it was only years later that I realized she took Cedar Grove so unseriously that even her old friend , placed in it , became unserious ; she hardly listened to what he said and therefore had no idea that he might be insulting her guests . Of course her guests had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in a dark suit said with enthusiasm . This was Mr. James Bone , a manufacturerof garage doors . The editor popped a shrimp into his mouth and his jaws ground with vehemence . " Certainly it 's interesting ! It happens to be true . America , my friends , is based upon money . And money is based upon man 's natural selfish desire for power . So we may say that the basis of our evil is the selfish desire for power . " Mrs. Bone , a writer of " light verse " for local newspapers , said politely , " I read something like that just this week in The New Yorker , an essay by a Negro , I think  --  " " Power is deadly , disintegrating , " the editor interrupted . He accepted some mushrooms on sticks passed to him on a silver tray . " We have lived for so long , my friends , in the shadow of propaganda put out by the West that we have no conception of objective truth . " He swallowed the mushrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly . Today I flew out here from New York City , a fantastic but utterly real city , totally integrated , totally alert . I flew out here and in two hours I can see that the suburbs of America are doomed . I am , frankly , amazed at the artificiality of this suburban world . Your very children look artificial , dop240you realize that ? Type-cast , healthy , well-fed , tanned children with no cares , no problems , no duties , no responsibilities , no sufferings , no thoughts , children out of a Walt Disney musical ! And these children are your products , my friends . Think of what you are creating ! " I had the idea that Nada glanced at me , vaguely , but I might have been mistaken . " That 's fascinating , " a woman said . " Is it tied in with your work ? " He wiped his mouth . Excited , passionate , a little overwrought  --  wasit the liquor , or the airplane flight , or the prospect of his speech the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , shaky , nervous speech and disappointed the Cedar Grove ladies )  --  he began glancing apprehensively around the room . " Did you speak ironically ? " he said to that lady . " Did I what ? " she said graciously . " Ironically . Did you speak ironically ? " " My heavens no . I do n't know how to speak ironically , " she said , surprised . He grinned at her , then stopped grinning , then glanced around for Nada . Nada was scratching the base of her head idly , off in a corner . Silence fell . " Some of us have been meaning to ask , " another lady ventured shyly , " whether there is much intellectual excitement in the New York world ? Do you think that we in the Midwest are missing much the best part of life ? " Is this the Midwest ? " he asked vaguely . " Oh yes . No . I do n't know . Of course we go to boxing matches in New York . That sport is marvelous . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tests manhood and skill . It . . . it 's very much like writing . I had a work-out the other afternoon with Norman Mailer  --  "  | " Ah yes , " said a gentleman , " did n't he write . . . ? And then did n't he go downhill afterward ? " " John , for heaven 's sake , " said a woman , " do n't you know they all go downhill ? After all ! Did n't Tolstoi go downhill after War and Peace and Anna Karenina ? " The gentleman turned seriously to the editor . " Well , I 'll put that up to you . Did Tolstoi go downhill after War and Peace and Anna Karenina ? " The editor was taking another drink . " I think he did . Yes , I believe so , " he said gloomily . After a few minutes of silence he began again , as if from another angle , telling us about his latest discovery , a disturbed and alienated young man who wrote film reviews for various New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie called Dentist which was forbiddenexhibition even in a private East Village hangout. . a fantastic event , unparalleled , a raw comment upon the psychosociological inertia of contemporary America ... and a very gifted young man too .. . Unfortunately , just then Father arrived from the airport ( " Held up by fog ! " he explained ) , rushed and happy , and strode into the living room already agreeing with the editor . " Yes , yes , interesting , fascinating ! " Father declared loudly . The editor got to his feet and they were introduced . Father chuckled with sheer good feeling . " Yes , very fascinating words I heard just now ! " he said , looking around the room . Everyone agreed . He drew up a chair and sat facing the editor as if he 'd flown in from Holland just for this talk . The editor returned to his subject but something had gone out of his spirit . Father sat facing him , shiftingp242his buttocks and agreeing , " Uh-huh , uh-huh , " and with every grunted agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuttering over the phrase , " the whitewashed society and its brainwashed morality . " Everyone else listened in the way Cedar Grove people listen to all things  --  immensely polite , enthusiastic , generous , showing interest especially around their mouths . Finally Father eased sideways into the conversation by saying , " Now , what you 've said about freedom is , you know , one of my favorite topics of conversation . I 've spent many hours discussing it with various people . However , as our Yugoslav man says , one can not always define such things  --  freedom for me might not be freedomfor you  --  so in the meantime what 's left ? " He had taken on a slight " British " air , just as Nada , when excited , took on a " Russian " air . " Freedom through legislation . . . or . . . or revolution , " the editor stammered . " Ah-hah , it was some Founding Father , I believe , who said , this wonderful man said , Who cares about understanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yessir , and we Americans have changed the world forever , you can bet your last dollar ! " The editor stared at Father . There was a moment of silence , then Mr. Bone said amiably , " Elwood , was it by any chance Thomas Jefferson who said that ? " " Probably , " said Father . The editor looked around . He began to say something , then thought better of it . By the time dinner came and went the editor was inclining his head toward Father and flushing with agreement , yes , uh-huh , his hand with its pointless circular gesture adjusting itself to Father 's more masculine sweep/ing gesture , which reminded you of nothing so much as a jetliner taking off for London in the early gray light of the American continent . Much later that evening , when all of Nada 's guests were gone and only she and the editor and Father remaineddownstairs ( Father had fallen asleep in his chair ) , and I was at my drowsy perch on the stairway landing , the editor began to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been dreading . " Natashya , this is fantastic . This . Him . What is this , where are we ? " " Not so loud , " Nada said . " Is this a location in space or a condition of the brain ? " the editor said drunkenly . " This ? All this ? Who is that man ? Years ago I knew you , and since then this man appears , this mansion of a house , and a child ! Natashya , are you quite serious about all this ? " " Of course I 'm serious , " Nada said vaguely . " And the child too ? " " Of course . " " You 've had a child , you , you 've become a mother ? Is it possible ? " " Will you shut up about that ? " " But you , you 're not even a woman , I mean , you 're in essence not really a woman , and yet you 've had a child . It 's monstrous . . . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a wreck . That man there , that massive man , he frightens me . He unmanned me tonight , he devastated me , and do you know why ? " " You 're drunk . " " He devastated me because he is not contemporary with me . No . That man , what's-his-name , Elmwood ? Elwood ? That man is out of Charles Dickens and he should not exist today , Natashya , not as your husband ,  |p244you  know that very well . Do n't look so disgusted , of course I 'm drunk . Natashya , I see you 've sold yourself and well done too , but do n't you sometimes feel rotten about it ? You 're a beautiful woman , Natashya . I will always regret turning down that novella of yours . You were very spiteful about it  --  it broke off our friendship . You took everything too seriously in those days , but , my friend , imagine a reader struggling through the thoughts and impressions of a fourteen-year-old girl who has become demented ! Imagine ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natashya . Now you 've loosened up and wised up . The other day I read your story in galleys at Esquire , and it 's very nearly a New Yorker story  --  think of how far you 've come ! " " Jesus Christ , " Nada said in disgust . " But a husband out of Charles Dickens  --  " " He is not out of Charles Dickens but out of Proust , you bastard , " Nada said . " Well , anyway I have n't read either of them . Look , Natashya , I 'm not as nervous as I seem . My hands shake like this after midnight . No , do n't laugh , I am being quite serious . . . even tragic . I think I must have been in love with you at one time . Because other women remind me of you . I have an extraordinary fixation upon beautifulwomen ! But then I read those novels of yours , and all those stories , you dumped thousands of pages on me and I could n't possibly . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep so peacefully ? What is his secret ? I have insomnia every night . Why is there such terror in him , in his weight ? Even asleep he looks like a torpedo , or like a certain kind of deadly fish . Tell me , how much money does he make in a year ? " " You 'd better go up to bed , you 're drunk . "  | " But I have something to say to you . I wo n't pretend I came all the way out here just to say it . . . I 'm honest ... actually I need the money and five hundred dollars is a lot to me , I 'm broke . But I wanted to see you again , Natashya , and tell you that I think of you often , and I admire you . . . but must you publish all the time , must I see your name everywhere and feel like puking , Natashya , when I should admire you ? Look . . . I will tell you about the most beautiful evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Nada 's voice had become rather eager . " Do n't mind my hands ' shaking like this , it 's the hour , and also I feel very sentimental . Look . . . you must promise not to tell anyone about what I 'm going to say . " " Of course I promise . " " You know my life . A rotten childhood , like everyone 's , the years at Harvard . . . the early years fighting for the integrity of The Transamerican , rescuing it from the Trotskyites . . . Jesus , what I 've given of my life to that magazine ! And last year the paid subscriptions , library and individual , went down to eight hundred ! And my writing , always my own writing , that took years off my life , my translations of Rilke . . . and my first marriage . . . and . . . and the twins . . . this is very maudlin , Natashya , and I forbid you ever to put this in a story , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But what happened ? What was this wonderful event ? " " It was in New York last winter . By then I had made it , you know , all the years of struggle added up , my anthology of radical essays was reviewed by Harry for the Times Book Review , and by Linda for The Nation , and Joey Kay was all set to do it for Newsweek whenp246he got sick . . . well , anyway , I had made it to the top , I was invited to six parties a week , to ten parties a week ... and . . . and  --  " " And you were a judge for the National Book Awards , you bastard , " Nada said . " And , Natashya , listen to me . I 'm not drunk , I mean I am not simply drunk . . . with alcohol . . . I am drunk with this memory . I was invited to Pandora Bright 's apartment . You know , she owns a television station and some magazines , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there , there at a late supper , at a large gathering of only the best people in the city , there I was introduced to Princess Margaret , who was visiting Pandora that week ... There was a dramatic moment . The moment passed in silence . " You what ? " Nada asked . " My dear , I was introduced to Princess Margaret ! I , Moe Malinsky , the ordinary , insignificant , intellectual Moe Malinsky , I was introduced to Princess Margaret ! " The Transamerican Quarterly , with which some of you are familiar , is an excellent magazine , I believe , though reading it gives me a headache . I do n't think I ever read it through , even in the old days when I suspected Nada of . . . I suspected the editor of . . . but never mind , that will come . The magazine gives you a general frontal headache , a dull glow of a headache that ca n't be concentrated upon and so ca n't be shaken , as you think , Just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen smudgily printed pages . And what is " Action Theater , " after all ? ( " Action Theater ' tears away the walls of the bourgeoisie and destroys totally the idea of Theater ; it is the only art form that will ultimatelyp247bring about the long-awaited synthesis of ethics and aesthetics . . . " ) Pieces on " Soviet Economic Growth " and " China : The Sound of Tomorrow , " de rigueur and harmless enough ; also , " An Open Letter to Our Young Friends of the New Left . " Lyric reviews : " This young poet has vitality , wit , paradox , firm technical control  --  and yet  --  and yet curiously enough his poems do not succeed . . . " " It has become increasingly difficult for me to take American art seriously . . . " And on and on , uh-huh . The stories are all experimental , though not as good as Nada 's ( or am I prejudiced ? ) , and you 've all read the poetry : stroking her hair , singing the Teevee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I read late and reconcileAbraham Lincoln , the Talmud , and God . And now it is time to tell about " A Doctor Looks at Love and Life For Teen-agers , " and about my mad spell in the flower bed outside the Cedar Grove Bank of the Republic , and about Mavis Grisell 's sister who cracked up in her new Lincoln , unable to get it out of a parking spot in the village and therefore driving it into the car ahead , jerking it into reverse and slamming it into the car behind , back and forth , back and forth madly , desperately , while a small crowd watched and a motherp248cautioned her son , " Do n't say anything , she could sue " ( actually , the sister 's crack-up was Mavis ' reason for coming to Cedar Grove ) , and .. . Here is my problem : I am afraid to die , and when I finish this memoir I will be faced with suicide . I have made up my mind . There 's no turning back . But still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps going on , going on . But no matter . I had several other digressionsin mind which I will not indulge in ; I will be concise . The business about the doctor did not seem to me at the time to have anything to do with my behavior , but now , seven years later , I am not so certain . Though my criminal act was committed with all freedom , still it might have been influenced by one or two things in my environment . ( It 's difficult to analyze yourself . ) I know I am completely to blame for what I did ; I was free then and I am free right now . As Nada said , " I want you to be so free , Richard , that you stink of it . " Well , yes , I do stink . And I am free also . Well , one morning Father said to me on his way out , " Kid , I think I know what your trouble is . This moodiness , this out-of-focus look . . . no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . . . it 's typical of young teen-agers , I mean , pre-teen-agers , I know all about it . I was your age myself once ! Greg Hofstadter and I were talking yesterdayat the club , and he said yes , now that I mentioned it , Gustave was the same way , all moody and bookwormy , does n't want to go out and play , and we hit upon a solution . You and Gustave are going tonight to the high school to hear that Doctor what's-his-name give a talk . It 's all very educational , buster , okay ? " He was backing out , his briefcase in hand , and he filled even that large doorway with his brimming holyp249energy . I said yes but he did n't hear me , so I said " YES " and he grinned and winked and was gone . Nada said , " It 's all right if Bebe does n't drive you , " but when Mrs. Hofstadter drove up that evening with Gustave , Nada was not even home to notice . I climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and son ; Gustave and I were both a little embarrassed . It was clear that he did not want to go to this talk any more than I did . Mrs. Hofstadter chattered as she drove . She was a frail , stern-voiced partridge of a woman , always perfumed and attractive , but , unlike Nada , she looked as if she might come off in peelings with her clothes . I could not tell at once whether she was worse or the same as usual or slightly better . Gustave often reported her condition to me in a terse impersonal whisper , but tonight he was strangely silent and seemed to be paying no attention to his mother 's chatter . She had a habit of driving in the middle of our narrow Cedar Grove lanes whether she was ascending a hill or not , and she had a habit of brushing rather close to parked cars , and she often glanced around into the back seat at me while she drove . " There were these Egyptian sailors , you see , and they had been commissioned by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 B.C. or maybe 400 A.D. They certainly had invented things in those days ! You would be fascinated to learn about it , Richard ! Well , the point of this was , that to disprove their findings the European navigators thought it was enough simply to measure their routes according to the existing maps , but  --  and this is the marvelous thing  --  the Egyptians were measuring according to below the Equator , and the Europeans were of course above . . . and so . . . it 's a wonderful example of how we must not leap to conclusions . "  | " Yes , it is , " I said shyly . I felt my brain begin to click off , part by part . The low buzzing and ringing began . Mrs. Hofstadter chattered on , occasionally creasing her powdered neck to look back at me . We passed a drive-in restaurant in front of which sullen Negro women , of middle-age , were walking with picket signs . " That is one thing you would never see me doing , never , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a picket sign ! " " Mother , you 're swerving to the left , " Gustave said . By the time we got to the high-school auditorium and sat down near the back , the talk was well under way . A middle-aged woman stood on the stage , looking out into the lighted auditorium . I heard her say the word " sex , " and another part of my mind turned off , in a panic , but then it focused upon Nada and That Editor , and so I plugged myself in again to the good doctor and her talk . . .. And so , you see , there is this vast , marvelous area of human life called sex , and we know so very little about it , so very little ! But I think that , after our discussiontonight , many of you will feel that the problems you have are not so gigantic after all . Many times a young person is like a driver in a new car , inexperienced and giddy with excitement . He is more interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in safety and the laws of the road , drawn up for him by his somber , well-meaning parents . Yes , some of your parents are well meaning ! " This brought forth a ripple of appreciative laughter . " Now , I hope there will be many , many , many questions . I think that you must have many problems of yourown or many curiosities about sex which you have keptback or expressed only to your peers . Are there any ques/tions ? Did any of you feel shocked or worried about what I said earlier ? Do you think that such things should not have been voiced ? " An awkward moment . There were muffled whispers and the creakings of seats , then a girl put up her hand . You could tell by her taut , unworried throat and her confident voice that she was a Leader . " Dr. Muggeridge , may I ask a pretty far-out question ? " " My dear , nothing is far-out in the twentieth century , " Dr. Muggeridge said , beaming . She was a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to thinking that some of us are going to go home , and maybe our parents are ... I mean ... they might be mad when they hear about this talk . . . " " Yes ? " " They might get mad or something because . . . well , you know ... " Everyone except Gustave and myself chuckled sympathetically . Oh , it was a warm , harmonious group ! I felt my mind begin to drift slowly away . " You know how parents are ! " The girl giggled . " My dear , I know only too well . I have had enormouslypitiful conversations with pregnant teen-aged girls who waited far too long to talk over their problemswith a responsible adult . Yes , I know , I know ! But what can we do , we , all of us , toward educating the parents of teen-agers into discussing these things openly ? " A few seconds of excited silence , then another girl said , " Dr. Muggeridge , I think a talk like yours should be offered to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " Do you think that your parents are perhaps afraid ? "  | " Afraid ? " " Afraid of sex , themselves ? " Everyone hesitated at this . So Dr. Muggeridge went on in her gentle , kindly voice , " It may be that the parents of young people are simply afraid , and that they need help . I have often come to this conclusion in my talks with troubled teen-agers . If some understanding adult had only been available in time ! But I can see so very few young people . Now that I am traveling on this lecture tour , and the tight demands of my television show , I 'm afraid even these few teen-agers I could have helped personally will have to go without anyone to talk to . Incidentally , may I ask , how many of you here tonight feel you can talk openly to your parents about sex ? " Everyone looked stealthily around . One boy started to put his hand up , then thought better of it . Gustave and I sweated and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Muggeridge cried . " How very tragic ! Tragic ! But surely some of you girls talk to your mothers , at least about mild problems ? " A few girls raised hands . " But not openly and freely , Dr. Muggeridge , " someone said . Other girls agreed . " And you boys , with your fathers ? " A few boys laughed . One boy said , " I 'm afraid I ca n't talk with my father about anything . " " This is much more serious than I thought , " Dr. Muggeridge said , shaking her head . " How do you account for this strange secrecy ? " No one knew . " Well , fathers are like that , " a boy said slowly . " You mean they are difficult to approach ? They are embarrassed ? "  | " They get all red and funny , " a boy said . " You know . They start coughing and ca n't stop . " " And why is that , do you think ? " " Who knows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or someone like you . " Dr. Muggeridge smiled . " Thank you , but flattery is out of place here . I wonder , have you ever thought that perhaps your parents do n't discuss these enormously importantand complicated problems even with each other ? That perhaps they are simply afraid ? There are extraordinarycases of non-communication between married people . " For some reason I thought of Nada a few years before , standing on the stairs with her back to Father , who was yelling certain names at her . ( I was peeking around the dining-room louver doors . ) But I shook this image away and uncrossed my legs . Dr. Muggeridge was now saying , " And do n't you think , then , that you boys and girls should feel free to discuss these matters with one another ? Particularly those of you who are already quite intimate , or who are even thinking toward marriages . Yes , I know there are some of you here , " she said , smiling , " and I know there are others of you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any distinction between you . Would n't it be helpful for you to know as much as possible about each other , about your feelings and worries ? Would n't this help communication later , when you 're married ? Then you could avoid the problems your parents have . " A girl said , " Dr. Muggeridge , can I say something ? It 's funny , but . . . but this talk tonight has done me ap254lot of good . It really has . My mother would never talk to me like this . It 's a real experience . " " And this is the tragedy , boys and girls , the tragedy of non-communication . Think of our culture  --  the advertisements , the intensely stimulating movies , your populardances and the clothes you wear . You must come to grips with this environment and conquer it ; otherwise it will conquer you . We must demand of the adults of America that they face up to the realities of the world they have created . There is no room for squeamish hypocrisy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given group of young people a certain percentage of the girls will have unwanted pregnancies , and a certain percentage of all will have a venereal disease ? Everyone knows that , but no parents will face up to the fact that their children may go into these statistics . Were I a parent myself , I would insist that my children come to me with any and all questions they have . There would be no red faces , no coughing spells , nothing except rational , wholesome talk . Sex is not a tabooed subject , boys and girls . It is not unhealthy and dirty . Sex should be discussed openly anywhere , in Sunday school , in classrooms , as well as in school lavatories "  --  ( Laughter of a spontaneous sort )  --  " and even at the dinner table . " " But , Dr. Muggeridge , " a girl said , " have you ever talked to adults on this subject ? " " My dear , I will tell you a secret , " Dr. Muggeridge said sadly . " Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents who need it most who stay away . The open-minded parents who come are rarely in need of my advice  --  and , I must say , there are very , very few of these who do come . I think this points back to somethingwe said earlier , the fear adults have toward sex . "  | " Oh , Dr. Muggeridge , " a boy said , " they did show a movie at our school a while back . About reproduction and stuff like that . " " Shown to which grades ? " " Freshmen . " " A bit late , was n't it ? " Dr. Muggeridge snapped . " By that time many of you had no doubt conducted your own experiments  --  absolutely unknown to your parents and teachers , however . " A few faces reddened . I was leaning forward , my elbows on my knees and my hands encircling part of my face . Someone put his hand up , and I closed my eyes , forcing my mind off . At first there was nothing . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . She and Father had given a party but it was one of their unwise parties , a mingling of Brookfield people and a few stragglers from somewhere else , an awkward group of people who were Nada 's friends . It had been a poolside party , and I followed Nada and a man ( a " composer " ) around the side of the house and hid in some evergreens while I eavesdropped . And this talk stayed in my mind for many months : Nada told him that if he did n't like her guests he could go to hell , and he told Nada she had become a ridiculous person , and Nada told him in a furious whisper that he was a bastard , that his suit was cheap and ready-made and that everyone , everyone , had seen that his shoes were brown , in the first instant everyone had seen that , goddam them ! She began to cry in ugly , jagged gasps . " What do you want from me ? " she said . " I 'm trying to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocate , like my people , my ancestors , everybody 's ancestors ? Most of the world is swimming in a cesspool , trying to keep theirp256heads up , and I 'm sick of it , I 'm sick of knowing it , God , how I 'm sick of living and thinking and being what I am ! But I wo n't live any other way . This is heaven . This is heaven , I 've found it , they do n't torture you or back you in ovens here , in 196o  --  what more can we ask ? Our ancestors tortured other people or were tortured themselves , or both . Well , I am Natashya Everett and I am out of history , I 'm clean of its stink and crap , and there is no one to thank for it , no one but myself and good luck . You son-of-a-bitch , to criticize me for being out of the crap pile ! To criticize me for not suffocating in it ! " They were silent . Then the man ( his face is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulders , and she did a strange thing , she let her head fall back against him as if they were old , old friends , when I 'd never even seen him before ! And he seemed about to kiss her on the mouth , but she turned aside a little and somehow , perhaps with an indolent gesture of her hand , indicated that he should kiss her throat instead , which he did , while I stared from out of the evergreens and my eyeballs pounded . I was eight . Gustave prodded me . " You all right ? " he said . I blushed and nodded and sat back in my seat . The discussion had ranged onto something else . A boy with purplish acne was saying loudly , " Yes , some kids at my school had pictures like that . When the teacher caught them she was afraid to do anything , she just hushed it up . " " Well , now , she was afraid , poor thing , to admit such things existed , " Dr. Muggeridge said brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who resorts to pornography is a wee bit pathetic . What do you think ? After all , normal people exercise their desires in normalp257ways . I think we should all be tremendously sorry for people who use pornography , just as we are for homosexualsand other perverts who are just plain sick people . Let 's all help them , boys and girls , instead of pretending they do n't exist ! And you all know boys and girls your own age who are inclined toward abnormality . I do n't mean just boys with dirty pictures but also the opposite , boys who show no interest at all in sex , and girls who show a morbid disinterest in boys . We have to admit our impulses and curiosities about this , or we are being hypocritical like most of the adult population of America . What do you think ? You all , I suppose , know unfortunate boys and girls who have reached sixth grade already without admitting the slightest interest in sex , do n't you ? " I shifted guiltily in my seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers and sisters ? " she said . " What if you can see how your kid sister , for instance , is really out of it  --  I mean , she just does n't know anything  --  should you maybe talk with her and bring things kind of out in the open ? " " But how can you , if your parents are against it ? " Dr. Muggeridge said . This was true . There was silence for a few seconds , but not a dull silence . I could feel everyone thinking excitedly . Another hand went up and a girl said , " I guess the question most of us girls want to ask you , Dr. Muggeridge , is this  --  and I 'm really serious  --  how do you tell a boy to stop being fresh ? " " Boys , " said Dr. Muggeridge with a smile , " what would you advise ? " " Just say so , " declared a boy . " A slap would n't hurt either , " said another . " No , but some boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the girl said , red-faced . " Why are boys like that , Dr. Muggeridge ? Sometimes they just get so nasty . And society never blames them either . It just blames the girl . " " Now you are talking , my dear , about the notorious double standard , " Dr. Muggeridge said as if this were a favorite topic . " This means that society expects highly moral behavior of its young women and looks the other way when its young men do as they please . Of course this is grossly unfair . But our society is changing , as you know . I think this more than anything else is what is bugging your parents . They expect you girls to be dainty and pure , like their grandmothers . Even the most flagrantlyimmoral boys expect their wives to be pure when they decide to marry . . . finally ! " ( A ripple of laugher . ) " But our society is changing so rapidly that there will be a time when girls will have exactly as much freedom as boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " some people think that if you 're going to get married it 's all right  --  I mean , if you 're engaged or going steady or something . What is your opinion on this ? " " My dear , you have misjudged me if you think I have any opinions on this subject other than the good healthy one of believing that problems should be aired . I would not dream of forcing my moral standards on anyone else . Some people will argue that engaged couples have every right to go to bed together , others argue that an engagementshould be entered into only after this kind of experimentation . I do not give any particular advice . This sort of thing must be worked out between the two young people themselves . "  | " Dr. Muggeridge , " said a girl , " what about a kiss on the first date ? Is that bad , or what ? " " Some people go all the way on the first date , " Dr. Muggeridge said . " It 's just a question of quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , discussion is called for . " " Dr. Muggeridge , " said a girl , " what about abortion ? Do you think that 's a good solution to an unwanted pregnancy , or what ? " " There are many opinions concerning abortion . The old-fashioned religious belief was that it was a crime , and it is still a crime in many states . However , if we look at the situation objectively and scientifically , it is clear that a couple , faced with an unwanted pregnancy , may make the decision themselves about what to do . I personally believe that marriage in such circumstances is a poor solution . For one thing , it would cut down severely on your youthful experiences in the world , to be married in your teens . Think of the fun you 'd miss out on , the dates and dances ! And it suggests that sex is something very , very serious and not just a normal part of life , something to enjoy . . . " " Where are you going ? " Gustave whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auditorium , which was so hot I felt sick . But outside in the corridor , and outside in the parking lot where I was sick to my stomach , it was just as hot . My clothes were drenched with sweat.  |p260And  my mad spell in the flower bed came about like this : I was walking along in a ringing , singing daze of dust particles , thinking of Dr. Muggeridge of the night before and her upraised , kindly , blighting hand pronouncingmy doom , not to mention Nada or rather Nada 's absence when I finally got home ( Mrs. Hofstadterhad been an hour late and we had waited on the school steps . She had burst into tears , seeing how wearily Gustave got to his feet , and for some reason had begun to attack my mother : " I do n't know who Natashya is , and nobody knows , nobody , and your father 's family do not exist in Philadelphia society no matter how much money they have . And at one of your dinner parties I saw lipstick marks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dishwasher . . . " ) when somethinghappened to me . It was terrifying but somehow wonderful . It was like a bolt of lightning ( that marvelous metaphor ! ) that flashed down upon me and would have split my skull in two except for my knowing enough to bend with the blow . Some safety device in my brain melted away and let all of paradise rush loose . I was on my way home from school , which lasted most of the morning , and I was crossing the village green and just passing the Cedar Grove Bank of the Republic when this flash of lightning freed me . You must understand that all morning , allp261the night before , I had been in a kind of slumber . I could hear things well enough  --  sometimes too well  --  and I had been able to do an absurdly simple problem in division up at the board , but . . . but I had not been awake . Then , suddenly , I did awake . It happened that quickly . An overpoweringfury rose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly kept up by the bank ( a bed of pansies , snapdragons , little furry , fuzzy white border flowers ) and began kicking at them . I kicked violently , madly , and as I kicked their tiny faces a feeling of soaring happiness filled my hollow little chest . I muttered something , but it was not " Take that ! Take that ! " ; I do n't know what it was . I could n't hear myself , I was n't interested in hearingmyself , I was not aware of hearing anything . And then I was lying in the flower bed , groveling around and still kicking , fighting , scratching , even tearing with my teeth , the fury let loose in my body ringing in every muscle and giving me that holy strength that was not truly mine . My panting sobs slowed and I heard someone whisper , " Let him alone , do n't say anything . He could sue . " A boy my own age was cautioning a younger boy . And behindand around them were many Cedar Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very edge of the flower bed and bent to look at me . " Did you lose something , son ? " I was still panting violently . " What did you lose , son ? Maybe I can help you . Money ? Keys ? " He was a cautious policeman ; he knew enough not to touch me . I lay there , my heart pounding , and waited . The policeman motioned politely for everyone to disperse  --  " disperse " is the word he wasp262thinking , I am sure  --  and I sat up , still panting , and finally I got to my feet . " I hope it was n't anything important , " the policeman said . I stepped out of the circle of ruined flowers . Someone from the bank was standing nearby , smiling . " It 's quite all right , officer . Quite all right , just an accident . Did you find what you were looking for , son ? " I nodded and began to walk away . It seemed incredible to me that they would let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they let me go ! And though many clean people in the village noted my filthy clothes and tear-streaked , mudstreakedface , of course no one said anything . As I walked home the memory of that devastating flame began to fade and I lapsed once more into my slumberous state . . . until I found myself opening the side door of a house that was n't ours but had once been ours ( our former Cedar Grove house of years back ) , and this mistake kept me moderately awake until I got to our real home , which was the big long elegant one on Labyrinth Drive that seemed to promise so much . Nada was not home . Father was not home . Libby was ironing in the basement  --  I could smell something scorching . I ran upstairs and went to my room , and from under my bed I pulled the soiled sheet in which my rifle was wrapped.  |p263It  was a deer rifle that I thought might blow up in my face if I ever used it . It had a telescopic sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting thing about it . I lay on my bed and aimed the gun in various directions , just to be able to look through the telescope . The gun was a little heavy . Nothing about its sleek , cheap wood and its dull barrel suggested the power it had , and the secrecy of its power frightened me a little . The gun was such a still , quiet object . I went to my window and looked out through the telescope . Everything was brought up close , but it was rather fuzzy . The lens might have been smudged from my wet fingers . I swung the barrel back and forth and saw ordinaryLabyrinth Drive sights : the woman next door , pretty and hurried in white high-heeled shoes and pink suit , was instructing her colored maid in the art of wateringroses  --  the woman tripped daintily to a bush , pointed , and the maid followed and squirted water on that bush from a garden hose , then they went to another bush , and to yet another . There was something beautiful about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grove Green Carpet Lawn Service was at work . The telescope did n't bring the men up close enough so that I could really see their faces . It brought them to me in a kind of haze , not quite real but not imaginary either , and it pleased me to think of how they existed both for themselves and for me , their spy . The Cedar Grove Green Carpet Lawnp264Service was made up of a big foreman who did nothing but smoke and walk from one part of the enormous lawn to another , and a crew of surly , sullen white men who were too tanned to be happy , with overlong hair and sweat-drenched clothes . The foreman could talk to any housewife charmingly , but to his men he did not talk at all . It was clear that they all hated one another . I had to admire the foreman 's empty , blank muscular face . It occurred to me that I could pull the trigger of my deer rifle and bring him down , but that would be cruel , and anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to kill , so I thought then  --  that day . I sat and watched a slow procession of trucks pass by : laundry truck , flower-delivery truck , TV-repair truck , liquor-store truck , plumber 's truck , air-conditioner-repair truck .. . And down the street was the Cedar Grove Sprawater Service , fixing someone 's sprinkling system . All day , every day , these little trucks were parked in front of homes . But these men were too far away . I could not see them well , and probably if I pulled the trigger nothing would happen . I did n't know much about guns and I still do n't . Do bullets drop fast ? Should you aim higher than your target , and how much higher ? The perfunctory instructionsheet that came with my rifle did not tell much . I turned the gun up into the sky and stared dizzily into nothing , nothing . It did not seem possible that anything would ever be within the range of my weapon , of any weapon of mine . Would n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the trigger ?  |p265That  night I heard them arguing , but I must have been a changed boy because I really did not creep out of my room to hear . I did not have to hear . Just as the telescope brought sights nearer to me , so did my strange new peacefulness tell me that I had heard this already , I did not need to hear it again . How could they surprise me ? When I was a child I needed to hear every ugly word and , if possible , I needed to see Nada 's face distorted with hatred and Father 's with rage , but now , now at eleven , I did n't need to hear or see them any more . I knew . It did me no good to play the Thinking Game at these times . The Thinking Game helped if I was sinking so deeply into inertia that I was afraid I might die , then I would seize upon some forlorn trivial memory , of a shoe , of one of Nada 's rings , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces were out ? ) . But the Thinking Game was no good when Nada and Father argued , because I did not want to stay awake at such times . Better to sleep . Better not to hear Nada 's upraised , horrified voice , which did not predict pain or even horror but only her own fury , and better not to hear Father 's bellow , because in the end they would go off to bed , each to his own bed , and they would sleep while I lay awake.  |p266The  next morning when I came downstairs Nada was already up , wearing a flimsy yellow shift of a summer dress , her bare legs stretched out under the dining-room table . This memory brings to my mind exotic things  --  parrots , cockatoos , big bursting jungle flowers  --  because of the shiny green fabric , minutely textured , that covered the dining-room walls , and Nada 's sunburst dress , and the peaches and bananas she was eating . She had quite a few long narrow sheets of paper out before her , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , " she said . " Going to school ? " It was Libby 's day off , and Nada sometimes thrust toward me a conspiratorial , intimate smile on such days , but this morning she was distracted . I asked her what the papers were , and she said nothing , nothing important . Was it a story ? I asked . " Oh , nothing . You wo n't be late to school , will you ? " she said . She brushed her hair back sunnily and indifferently from her face , smiling at me with that smile that meant nothing . It was strange how this gesture reminded me of one of the pretty , confident high-school girls at Dr. Muggeridge 's lecture , a girl I had n't even remarked upon at the time and who was only summoned back by Nada . So I went out to school , but somewhere along the way it occurred to me that I was n't going to school that morning . I turned and came back by a side street , cutting through to the lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Labyrinth Drive . The lane was lined with garbage cans , some new and some weathered , and one or two houses sported a mighty line of six , seven cans all their own ! I am embarrassed to say that the Everett household could fill up no more than two healthy-sized cans in one week . Our house looked a little unfamiliar from this spot . I climbed up onto our back fence , which swayed slightly , and peered over onto our lawn . It was shaded , and the swimming pool glimmered a pale , delicateblue . Insects dotted its surface . The back of the long house was broken up into sections : a screened-in porch with lawn furniture , a glassed-in porch that was the Family Room and looked out onto a patio the former owners of the house had evidently thought highly of  --  there were hanging plants , hanging vines , flowerpots everywhere , which Nada had n't bothered with and out of which now grew stunted little brown things . The patio floor was flagstone , larger than the kind I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rose bushes . The dining-room window was a kind of baywindowaffair , but it was wasted because of the overgrownbushes . I could still see Nada in there at the table , and if I 'd had my telescope with me I could have made sure . I entered the house by the front door . Doors are always unlocked in Cedar Grove . Just inside the door I paused , listening : a sound of rustling paper from the dining room . She was still at work . I tiptoed to the staircase and went upstairs . Nothing creaked . At the top I waited . I was good at waiting . A kind of sunny haze enveloped me , and I stood there waitingand not-waiting , thinking that Nada and I were alone in the house , all alone , and she did not even know it . Ip268was in a kind of agreeable trance . Later , when I was to recount all this as part of my confession , they checked with my math teacher , Mr. Hale , and to my amazement he told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his records , this " Richard Everett " had had perfectattendance up until the time he stopped coming altogether . But I insist , my readers , that I was absent , yes , I was absent from class that morning and all but absent from even this perch at the top of the stairs , my mind was so drifting and wandering . Then the doorbell rang , or rather tolled . I must have been waiting for this , for I came awake at once as if everything had been planned . I heard Nada 's bare feet padding to the door , or rather I felt them , and I shivered to think of the faint little indentations her feet would make in the thick white rug . Then two voices mingled , hers and a man 's . I believed at the time it was the editor Malinsky 's voice ( but it turned out that he had flown back to New York that morning ) . They went into the dining room ; I saw their shadows pass , but I was too frightened to peek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose with a pleasant irony upon the word " Elwood . " The telephone rang . No one answered it . It rang and rang , and its ringing interfered with the wild beating of my heart . I ran down the hall to Nada 's room . The door was open . Inside was the unmade bed ; its white cover had fallen half onto the floor and looked both flouncy and soiled . The floor was covered with a rather thin but still lovely Persian rug Nada had picked up somewhere , under some lady 's influence , and the furniture had an unmatchedlook . Nada had always been influenced by other women , led astray to antique shops , auctions , followingp269up Regency pieces because some emphatic lady had told her they were the finest , seeking out Country French frauds because someone 's mansion was decorated in that style . Of course , Nada had no style of her own . Everywhere there were books and papers . Off to the side was her " powder room , " painted pink , and a big long closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet door and the light went on . I went inside and hid among her fragrant , perfumy clothes , though some of the things should have been dry-cleaned , it seemed to me . What instinct ! Dr. Muggeridge had taught me more than I had realized . In a short while , a half hour , I heard them come into the room . Nada 's voice was very close to the closet door when she said , " It 's a pattern . SometimesI 'm drowning in it . It 's all whirls and spirals , like a diagram of the ear . " " Anytime you want , you can get out . " " Oh , shut up , what do you know ? What point is there living without being normal ? A world like this is shit without money , do n't be pretentious . " Then she said something I could n't make out , a phrase sharp and whiplike . The man 's voice said , " Natashya , that Russian of yours has always been a farce . " " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My sanctuary , my hiding place that was so clever , then turned into my prison . It happened slowly enough . I crouched in there behind something long and silky , listening , sweating , and it occurred gradually to me that I might be sick if I listened any further . No , I can not type out what I heard and it is n't important , I mean not to you . To you nothing is important , this is justp270something to read and discard , but to me , even now I writhe in agony and humiliation to have to remember , but . . I crouched in there with my eyes shut and my hands pressed against my ears , but not hard enough , not hard enough ! I could hear much more than I wanted . I pressed my sweaty palms against my ears so hard that a ringing began that was like the ringing of a telephone , and static sounded in my brain , and .. . After a while I heard nothing . I let my aching hands come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment I thought I might be deaf , I heard nothing at all . Then it came to me : voices . They were talking about something , but very gently . I could not hear what they said . Maybe they spoke in another language , the languageof lovers , who could tell ? Their talk drifted off , drifted on again . It was all very gentle and casual . Then there was a sudden sound of bedsprings and Nada said , " Yes , please , it 's blue , some frilly blue thing . " I knew the man was coming to the closet , and I began to breathe fast through my mouth . My eyes narrowed . I brought my hands up to my head again and crouched down low . Have I mentioned that I spent all this time , an hour or more , with my backbone hunched in two and my thighs aching under me ? Have you ever crouched on top of a pile of women 's shoes thrown all over a closet floor , suffocating and writhing in shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever squatted down just for five minutes , so that your legs ached desperately beneath you and you wanted nothing , nothingso much as to stand up straight ? None of this flashed to me , of course . I thought nothing . I was frozen with terror and baked with terror ,  |p271and  only now in writing this memoir ( God , what shame even to write it ! ) am I able to remember just what I felt . But then , back then , I had no time to think about anything . The closet door opened suddenly and the light came on . I was crouched back of her things , you know , and I hoped desperately that I would be hidden , but this abrupt , hurried man began going through the clothes hanging on the rack as if impatient of all that was offered him , and when he came at last to Nada 's blue bathrobe he moved five or six hangers full of clothes aside , and there , there he stood looking down at me : a naked man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face I had never seen before , eyes that were mildly incredulous . The most horrible thing about a naked man is his face . This naked man stared down at me , and I hunched down farther on my small mountain of shoes , my hands now on top of my head , staring up at him . A second passed . Then he yanked the blue robe off the hanger , the wire hanger nearly swung off , and he turned away and closed the door and the light went out . That was that . In that way I became a Minor Character . I slipped out of focus . It 's difficult for you readers to understand my becoming a Minor Character because i ) you ca n't imagine anyone except yourself being Major , hence my becoming Minor should be no great shock ; z ) you do n't believe a genuine Minor Character should exhibitp272so much anguish , pain , tedium . It 's ridiculous , like a vehement pamphlet put out by an organization of white laboratory mice . Anyway I , Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of schizophrenia and yet closely related , according to Dr. Saskatoon : there is no splitting of the ego in two or three but a curious case of disappearance , like a snake swallowing itself or a pocket pulled out when there 's no pocket there to be pulled out . ( lV1y digressions are getting more desperate : I have to fight back an impulse to type out a list of the things I ate this evening , so you can judge for yourself the depth of my degradation . But who wants to hear about Yang 's Chop Suey in the can , of Teutonic Stewed Tomatoes , and canned spaghetti , crumbly cookies , greasy potato chips . . . and . . . everything else ? A far cry from Nada to crumbs ! ) But if I had it to do over again , and thank God I do n't , I 'd pay more attention to food . Hanley Stuart Hingham 's advice is good advice , for though this is nonfiction , all writing is selection and I have n't selected the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both fresh and frozen , the custard cups , the ice-cream cones , the strawberry and cream tarts , the chocolates , the mints , the fine sweet cake Nada sometimes made ( from a mix ) , the bottles and bottles of all those beverages you see tanned teen-agers holding aloft in advertisements , the meat , the potatoes , the gravy , the lobster , the shrimp , the chicken ( fried , baked , stewed , barbecued , diced , quartered , fricasseed ) , everything  --  everything I stuffed into my voracious mouth from the time of my Disintegrationuntil the time of my Death . I should have reprinted menus from Cedar Grove 's most exclusive res/taurants , and from the country clubs , and from Nada 's kitchen , to give you not simply a sense of my sinking into a slough of food but an idea of social conditions as well . But all these digressions are useless . I am running out of time . I am one of those people who talk faster and faster as the pain mounts in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you swallow a yawn , then you do n't bother swallowing a yawn . But listen .. . That evening I did twenty math problems . You do not recall pure and useless math from your youth  --  the safety of step-by-step procedures , the baroque luxury of numerals slowly and lovingly shaped by pencil ; these fade . But through the maze of slow-motion steps and half steps , a parody of my slowing brain , I kept seeing and hearing things I did not want to remember . No matter what they were , you can guess . I felt as if I were falling headfirst into the blankness contained by those innocuous drawings , but I could do little to stop the fall . I could reach out and grab a triangle 's sides the way you grab the sides of a window to keep from plunging out . But none of this was enough . I went into my bathroom and ran cold water . I put my hands under it , but that was n't enough either ( cold water closes the pores ) . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the mirror was steamed ; then I lathered soap between my hands and washed . I **28;8890;TOOLONG . " I stared at her . She nodded . I struck the keys . " I 'll try to sing a blues for you , " I said , " and , after that , even if I 'm asked to leave , if you 've liked it , I wo n't mind my exile at all . " " You wo n't , " she said , " be exiled . And I 'm sure you know it . " " All right , " I said . " Well , all right , then , " and I jumped into a song which I remembered Caleb singing , which Caleb had loved , and when I reached the lines , Blues , you 're driving me crazy , what am I to do ? Blues , you 're driving me crazy , what am I to do ? I ai n't got nobody to tell my troubles to , " I looked up and found that the entire room had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face  --  she was smiling . She was proud of me . I looked at the nice girl , the girl who had said , " Welcome ! " She was smiling , too . Then I looked at Saul and I struck the keys again . " What , " I asked Barbara , " do you think of my qualifications now , princess ? " " We are still , " said Lola , " looking at them . And you ca n't stop now . " " If I were you , " said Barbara , " I 'd just keep on keepingon . " " Well , then , all right , " I said , and I sang some more . We all got drunk . Barbara borrowed some money from Mr. Frank , and also extorted from him an unopened bottle of Scotch . He was too drunk to care  --  or , rather , too drunk to help himself , for he certainly cared about his money and his liquor . Saul and Lola , and Barbara and I , were the last to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegance and enough borrowed money to drop the San-Marquands , in style , at their stylish Park Avenue apartment . It had been decided that we would work at the Workshop , that summer , in New Jersey , inp101effect , as student handymen . Barbara and I were to prepare , for Saul 's inspection , one or two improvisations , the nature of which he would dictate , and one or two scenes , which we were to choose ourselves . And , depending on what the summer revealed of our qualifications , we would be accepted into the Workshop . We were very confident and we were very happy . The sky was purple and the sun stood ready , behind this curtain , waiting for her cue , as we reached falling-down Paradise Alley . I had held Barbara in my arms all the way home , and I think that we would surely have slept together that night  --  or that morning  --  but Jerry was asleep in Barbara 's quarters , and Charlie was snoring in mine . So we woke them up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that summer , in fact , for one night , Barbara and I both appeared in Of Mice and Men . Barbara played Curley 's wife , and I played Crooks . And now , Barbara , as though conjured up by the twilight , as silently as a reverie , entered my hospital room . " Hi , my love , " she said , and came to the bed and kissed me . " How nice to have you back . " " It was worth the journey , " I said , " just to have you say that . " She looked at me . " I trust , " she said , " that one day soon you 'll find less drastic ways of being reassured . " Then she smiled . " But I have n't come to lecture you . Dr. Evin has promised to take over that department from me . He 's a very nice man , do n't you think ? " " Very nice . Have you told him a lot about me ? " " No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " I laughed . She walked to the window and touched my flowers . " I hope the nurse knows that these must be takenp102out of here at night . She does n't seem to know much , I must say . Would you like me to read some of your telegramsto you ? These silent messengers seem to be merely piling up dust over here . I must speak to that nurse . " " Leave her alone . She 's a nice kid . " " She is far too easily dazzled by fame . She looks on me as a combination of Queen Victoria and Madame X. And the good Lord knows what delicious nightmares you are evoking in those covered-wagon breasts . So naturally she ca n't do her work properly . " She picked up the telegrams and came back to the bed . Time had not done much for Barbara 's figure , though she no longer , as one of her directors had put it , promised only a bony ride . Time had thinned her face and dimmed its color ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the color which it had now adopted  --  due to the demands of her present role  --  was probably as close to the original as she would ever again be able to get ; and , though there were no silver locks in it yet , there were , perceptibly , silver strands . Her elegance was swinging and it was also archaic ; perhaps elegance is always archaic . She was rather splendidly dressed , in something dark , with a dull , heavy brooch at the neck ; her hair was piled very tightly up , in the fashion in which she wore it in the play . She caused one to think , I do n't know why , of sorrow and fragility : she caused one to think of time . Her splendor seemed extorted , ruthlessly , from time , and she wore her splendor in that knowledge , and with that respect , and also with that scarcely perceptibletrembling . One wondered how such a fragility bore such a ruthless weight . This wonder contributed to her force as an actress . Barbara had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a scene which she knew , how/ever , to be barren . Since she knew the scene to be barren , she was not much impressed by her eminence . She tried to work with as little show , and , she hoped , to as decent an effect , as any honorable cook or carpenter  --  though she knew very well that there were not many of these left , either . This lonely effort had stripped her of her affectations . Of course , on the other hand , the authority with which this effort had invested her caused many to insist that her affectations had all been disastrously confirmed , and constituted , furthermore , her entire dramatic arsenal . Barbara went on her swinging way . She seemed to listen to life as though life were the most cunning and charming of confidence men : knowing perfectly well that she was being conned , she , nevertheless , again and again , gave the man the money for the Brooklyn Bridge . She never gained possession of the bridge , of course , but she certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face had been produced as much by laughter as by loss . If life had endlessly cheated her , she had resolved not only never to complain , but to take life 's performance as an object lesson and never to cheat on life . " How 's the show going ? " " Oh , the show 's okay . Your understudy is still goingthrough his **63;8920;TOOLONG  --  but  --  oh , well , you can hear him across the Hudson River and he does n't bump into the furniture . Anymore . He 's the only person who does n't miss you . Naturally . " She opened one telegram . " Do you know anybody named Joan Nelson ? " " No . " " Well , she knows you and she wants you to get well . " She opened another telegram . " So does someone named Bradley Timkins . Do you know him ? "  | " You impress me as being a somewhat solitary type . Not that it 's any wonder , as heartless as you are . " She opened another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know him ? " " Oh , yes . The friend of my youth . " " I think that he really does want you to get well . He wants everyone to get well . " " So do I. " " Yes . Well , we have n't got a prayer , sweetheart . " " How goes the nation ? " " The nation goes abominably . And it 's no subject for a sick man to discuss  --  or a well one , either . " She smiled . " Oh . Here 's one from Lola . Show business ! " " Christopher sent the basket of fruit , " I said . She looked up . The light in the room seemed to change ; or , a more tremendous light than the twilight entered it . Perhaps it was Barbara 's face at that moment which finally reconciled me to life . " Did he ? Oh , let me see . " And I handed her Christopher 's telegram . She read it and she laughed . " Oh . That black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then she was far from me . I watched her face . Although I knew her face so well , I did not know it now at all . It was incredibly trusting and triumphant ; it existed in another realm , which spoke another language ; there is truly something frightening in a woman 's face . And yet  --  how can I say it ?  --  the mystery that I saw there contained a help for me , and promised me my health . " Dear Christopher . " Then she looked down at me . " Leo , I think we have done something very rare . " She smiled . But I can not describe that smile . It was neither sorrowful nor joyful , neither was it both : it spoke of journeys . I can not describe it because I could not readp105it . Then she spoke , very carefully , testing , as it were , each word . " I think we have managed to redeem something . I think it 's our love that we redeemed . Who could have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my flowers . " And I was afraid it was too late  --  that it had all been for nothing  --  that we 'd betrayed and discarded all the best of us  --  for  --  what anyone with five dollars can buy at the box office . " She laughed and turned and looked at me again . " Well . Thank you , Leo . We made it one time . " " What , " I asked , a little frightened , and at the same time amused and moved , " are you talking about , Bar-bara ? " " I 'm talking about our journey through hell . I 'm talking about Christopher . You know what I 'm talking about . " " Maybe , " I said , " you 're making too much of it . " " That 's possible . But you 're making too little . You always do . " She laughed softly again , looking , against the yellow blinds and in the dimming , changing light , exactly like the Barbara of Paradise Alley  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then became grave again . " We have come a long way together , you and I , " she said . " Des kilometres . " She looked out of the window for a second , then closed the blinds . She looked briefly at her watch . The room was dark . She switched on the light . " Well . I must get to the theater . The show must go on . " " Those days with Christopher must have been very hard on you , " I said . She looked at me . " Oh . They were brutal . But why do anything easy ? Those days were very hard on you , too . "  | " But I always felt , " I said , smiling , " that you 'd done nothing to deserve it . " " But you had . Of course ! " She laughed again . " Dear Leo ! " " I have the feeling that you 're making fun of me . But I do n't know why . " " Because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour le clown . " " Well . It 's true . When you were at your funniest , I did n't laugh . I 'm sorry for all the things I did n't see . And for all the things you did n't see . What you did n't see , I saw , it seemed to me , very clearly . Leo , you always want people to forgive you . But we , we others , we need forgiveness , too . We sometimes need it , my dear "  --  she smiled  --  " even from so wretched a man as you . " And she watched me very steadily , with that steady smile . I said , after a moment , with difficulty , " True enough , dear lady . True enough . But I wonder why I feel so de-pressed . " " I should think , " she said , dryly , " that the state of your health might have something to do with that . And I 've stayed longer than I promised Dr. Evin I would . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bye-bye . Is there anything you want me to bring you tomorrow ? " " Only the heads , " I said , " on pikes , of many politi-cians . " " Now you sound like Christopher . " " He 'd be proud of me . " " He was always proud of you . He could n't understand why you could n't understand that . Christopher had a rough time , too . " " How have you , " I asked suddenly , " managed to put up with me for all these years ? "  | " I love you , " she said , " and so I ca n't really claim to have had much choice in the matter . " She looked at her watch again . " Leo , now I really must run . If the heads of politicians prove to be scarce tomorrow , is there anything else you want ? " " Surprise me . " " I 'm honored . I 'm one of the few people left in the world who can still do that . To you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat your supper , read a little , sleep . The world will still be here when you wake up , and there 'll still be everything left to do . Good-night . " " Good-night . " She left , closing the door carefully and softly behind her . But she had left me , as our much loved Bessie Smith would have been prompt to inform her , with everything on my mind . Christopher had always wished to see Africa ; we became friends partly because I had . I told him once that he was certainly black enough to be an African , and even told him that the structure of his face reminded me of faces I had seen in Dakar . This enchanted him : which meant , fatally , that he then invested me with the power of enchantment . I did not want this power . It frightened me . But my fright frightened him , and it made him cruel : for to whom was he to turn , in all this world , if not to an elder brother who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I did not want to see it , the validity of Christopher 's claim . If it is true , as I suspect , that people turn to each other in the hope of being createdby each other then it is absolutely true that the uncreatedyoung turn , to be created , toward their elders . Thus , whoever has been invested with the power of enchantmentis guilty of something more base than treach/ery whenever he fails to exercise the power on which the yet-to-be-created , as helplessly as newborn birds , depend . Well , yes , I saw at last what was demanded of me . I would have to build a nest out of materials I would simply have to find , and be prepared to guard it with my life ; and feed this creature and keep it clean , and keep the nest clean ; and watch for the moment when the creature could fly and force those frightened wings to take the air . On the other hand , any threat to their enchanter , which is simply a threat to life itself , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I first realized this  --  through Christopher  --  at a monsterrally in downtown New York . Thousands of people were gathered in a park near City Hall . We were there to protest the outrages taking place in the city ( and also in the nation ) against those who , already poor and defenseless , were rendered even more so by the apathy and corruptionof the municipality , and by the facts of their ancestry , or color . The rally was guarded by the police , whom we were , in fact , attacking . They were there to make certain that none of the damage which we asserted was being done to the city 's morals would so far transformitself as to become damage to the city 's property . I was one of the speakers at this rally . I would have been there anyway , but not as a speaker , as one of the oppressed : but I was seated on the wooden platform because my name can draw crowds . Having never been quite able to consider my name my own , this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds , than it could have meant to me : but opportunity and duty are sometimes born together . There I sat on the platform , then , uneasy and indignant , and not altogether atp109my ease with the other luminaries , who were certainly not at their ease with me . Our common situation , the fact of my color , had brought us together here ; and here we were to speak as one . But our intensities , our apprehensions , were very different . In many ways , perhaps in nearly all ways , they disapproved of me , and I knew it ; and they knew that in many ways I disapproved of them . But we were responsible , commonly , for something greater than our differences . These differences , anyway , could be blamed on no one and could never have risen to the pressure of a private quarrel had it not been for the nature of our public roles . Our differences were reducibleto one : I was an artist . This is a very curious condition , and only people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It can not be desired , it can only  --  with difficulty  --  be supported , and one of the elements to be supported ( along with one 's own unspeakable terrors ) is the envy , rage , and wonder of the world . Yes , we on the platform were united in our social indignation , united in our affliction , united in our responsibility , united in our necessity to change  --  well , if not the world , at least the condition of some people in the world : but how different were our visions of the world ! I had never been at home in the world and had become incapable of imagining that I ever would be . I did not want others to endure my estrangement , that was why I was on the platform ; yet was it not , at the least , paradoxicalthat it was only my estrangement which had placed me there ? And I could not flatten out this paradox , I could not hammer it into any usable shape . Everyone else desired to be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so had I ; and they were right in this desire , and so had I been ; it was our privilege , to say nothing of our hope , top110attempt to make the world a human dwellingplace for us all ; and yet  --  yet  --  was it not possible that the mighty gentlemen , my honorable and invaluable confreres , by being unable to imagine such a journey as my own , were leaving something of the utmost importance out of their aspirations ? I could not know . I watched Christopher 's face . He trusted none of the people with whom I was sitting . Most of them were from five to ten years older than I , and from twenty to thirty years older than Christopher . And nothing we had done , or left undone , had been able to save him . There was a little black girl on the platform , she was part of a junior choir from a Brooklyn church . They were singing . I knew that when the choir finished singing , I would be on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the little girl 's voice pushed my stage fright far to the side of my mind . They were singing a song about deliverance ; she had a heavy , black , huge voice . She was the leader of the song , and her voice , in all that open air , rang against the sky and the trees and the stone walls of office buildings and the faces of the openmouthedpeople and the closed faces of the cops , as though she were singing in a cave . Deliverance will come , she sang , I know it will come , He said it would come . And , again , Deliverance will come . He said it would come . I know it will come . I watched her face as she sang , a plain , black , stocky girl , who was , nevertheless , very beautiful . Deliverance will come . I wondered how old she was , and what songs she would be singing , and in what company , a few years from now . Deliverance will come . Would it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was only because deliverance had not come that we sat there in all our uneasy rage and splen/dor . Deliverance will come : it had not come for my mother and father , it had not come for Caleb , it had not come for me , it had not come for Christopher , it had not come for this nameless little girl , and it had not come for all these thousands who were listening to her song . I watched the little girl 's face , but I saw my father 's face , and Caleb 's , and Christopher 's . Christopher did not believe that deliverance would ever come  --  he was going to drag it down from heaven or raise it up from hell  --  for Christopher , the party , that banquet at which we had been being poisoned for so long , was over . Yet , he watched the little girl , and listened to her , with delight . And all my speculations began to paralyze me again , and again I wondered what I could say when I rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself : my party , my banquet , in ways which Christopher could not possibly imagine , was over , too . But I wondered if it was possible , and not only for me , to live without the song . No song could possibly be worth the trap in which so many thousands , undelivered , perished every day . No song could be worth what this singing little girl had alreadypaid for it , and was paying , and would continue to pay . And yet  --  without a song ? Was Christopher 's manner of deliverance worth the voices it would silence ? Or would new songs come ? How could I tell ? for the question engaged my life and my responsibilities and perhaps even my love , but it no longer engaged my possibilities . I was defined . I was relieved to recognize that I was not cast down by this quite sufficiently weighty fact , only troubled by the question of how not to fail this little girl , and Christopher . Whatever had happened to me could have no meaning unless it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliverance , this most ambitious of transac/tions , could only be found in a wallet which I had always claimed was not mine . I began to sweat . The little girl 's voice rang out . Caleb 's face hung steadily in the center of my mind . Deliverance will come . Well , if she believed it , then it had to be made possible ; though only she , after all , plain , stocky , beautiful , black girl , could really make it true . I watched Christopher 's face as the song ended , watched his big white teeth in his big black face and watched him clap his big black hands . Then , as silence descended , and his face changed , and the master of ceremoniesrose , I suddenly realized , with a violent nausea , that it was my turn now . Every single orifice in my body first threatened , shamefully , to open , then closed , despairingly , forever , and I began to drip with sweat . Christopher 's face was very calm and proud  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ! as we say in Harlem ; and my little girl looked very tranquil , too , as though she had just been seated at a fried chicken dinner . But I knew , as I stood up and walked to the dangerous promontory , that she had n't tasted it yet . Deliverance will come . There is a truth in the theater and there is a truth in life  --  they meet , but they are not the same , for life , God help us , is the truth . And those disguises which an artist wears are his means , not of fleeing from the truth , but of attempting to approach it . Who , after all , could believe a word spoken by Prince Hamlet or Ophelia should one encounter this unhappy couple at a cocktail party ? Yet , the reason that one would certainly never make the error of inviting them back again is that their story is true  --  and not only for the Prince and his mad lady ; is true , is true , unbearable , unanswerable : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which one can live  --  or from which one can hope , by the effort of living , to be delivered . But on that afternoon I was facing the people with no recognizable disguise  --  though perhaps by this time my disguises were indistinguishable from myself  --  and I was very frightened . I do n't know what I said . I tried to be truthful . I tried to talk to the little girl , and to Christopher , and from time to time , I peeked , so to speak , from the promontory of my despair at their faces . Their faces were very bright . The little girl seemed to be enjoying her fried chicken dinner . Then I wondered if I was right to give her a fried chicken dinner which she could enjoy . Maybe I should have given her a dinner which would cause her to overthrow the table and burn down the house . But I did not want her to vomit or to burn : I wanted her to live . Deliverance , however , was not in my hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his big black face and clapped his big black hands . The little girl ran over to me with her green autograph book held out . She reminded me of everything I hoped never to forget . I took the autograph book and signed it and I wrote above my name , Deliverance will come . It was folly , for I was immediatelysurrounded and trapped on the platform which the policemen wanted me to leave . I wanted to come down , but I did not know how . I did not see the friends who had driven me to the rally . I could no longer see Christopher . I did not know how to get to the car . Then I saw Christopher 's furious and terrified face , struggling to break through the crowd to get to me and in a flash , an awful one , I saw what he saw : the Leo who certainly did not belong to himself and who belonged to the people only on condition that the people were keptp114away from him , surrounded by the uncontrollable public madness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the time of assassins . Christopher could not know , nor , abruptly , could I , who , in the crowd pressing around me , desired my death nor who was willing to execute it . I felt myself being pushed off the platform by the police : it was like being pushed off a cliff . Then Christopher leaped  --  but it really seemed rather more like flying  --  onto the platform , placing his body in front of mine , his arms stretched wide on either side ; and evidently he had alreadygiven a signal to five others of his age and history , who joined him and joined hands , forming a human barricade , and led me to the car  --  which , however , was also , now , surrounded . Christopher used his shoulders and his elbows ruthlessly , and his voice , and got the car door open , got in first and pulled me in after him . Then two of his friends piled in and slammed the door  --  so that I was protected on all sides . The driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , and so Christopher had to take out his wrath on me instead of on all the white devils . But he managed to suggest , in that language he had mastered , that not even the white people in the front seat were above wishing that I were dead . What was most vivid to me was how deeply he desired that I should live . I was not flattered by this , but frightened ; for this was a passion impersonal indeed , and it proved how little I belonged to myself . Not a soul in that crowd mattered for Christopher , nor would a soul have been safe from him as long as that crowd menaced  --  as he later put it : " my only hope . " The nurse now entered with a tray , on which she bore my supper and a threatening black object which turnedp115out to be a transistor radio . " Miss King brought the radio , " she said , " but since you only woke up today , we forgot about it . " I understood , from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on her . She was bewildered because this had revealed  --  or , rather , had failed to reveal  --  a Barbara King and a Leo Proudhammer whose names were not in lights . She did not know her idols , therefore she did not know herself , and she was full of a resentment which she masked by her attention to details . In a chill silence , in which , nevertheless , she kept smiling , she raised the head-rest , arranged the pillows , imprisoned me with the tray . She said , with her firm , girlish impeccability , " You must try to eat it all . " Then she picked up some of the flowers . " These must all be taken out at night , " she said . " I 'll be back when you 've finished your supper . Then the night nurse takes over . The bell is next to your bed . " She left the room , a poor little girl with her feelings hurt . I resolved to make Barbara do something on the morrow to cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which did not interest me , but I forced down my soup and a little salad . Then I lay back , wide awake  --  it was n't even show time yet  --  and wondered what I would do with the night . But either my keepers or my body had foreseen this , for , while I was wondering , I fell asleep : Barbara and I were painting signs in a wooden shed , the toolshed in New Jersey . Barbara was very clumsy and kept laughing at her clumsiness . Every time I got my sign nearly painted , she came over with her bucket and her brush and spoiled it . Every time she came near me , she seemed to envelop me ; she seemed deeper than water , as inescapable as air ; I felt myself suffocating in the foul ,  |p116sticky  web she was spinning with her laughter . I began to be angry . I said , Stop that , now , you stop it ! She kept on laughing . She spilled red paint all over my sign . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  You 'll what ? she asked , and danced very close to me . What will you do , Leo ? And she sounded pleading . I was overcome with fear . I 'll kill you , I said . Honest . But I also sounded pleading . We lay down together in the scarlet paint . Then something happened , and we were running . Caleb was chasing us . His voice came over the mountains : What are you doing with that white girl ? What are you doing ? Caleb grabbed me , and with the great wooden Bible in his hand , he struck me . Nothing . Caleb . Nothing . Caleb struck me again . I began to cry , and I fell to my knees . Caleb struck me on the back of my head . I cried out and I started trying to crawl away from him . I crawled through dirty water which became deeper and deeper , and suddenly I was staring at the bottom of the sea . The filthy water filled my nostrils , filled my mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for Caleb . I could see him through the veil of water , he stood watching me , and now he was stark naked , black and naked . I reached out my hand , but he would not take it . I screamed and started going down . I woke up . The nurse stood with the tray , watching me . " I was about to wake you up , " she said . " You seemed to be havinga bad dream . " It took a second before I could bring her into focus . " I guess I was . " " Do you have them often ? " " Not very often . Only when I 've done something bad  --  like in those plays by Shakespeare . "  |p117She  smiled . " I 'll bring you a sleeping pill , " she said , and left again . I turned on my radio . I listened to the news for awhile , but Barbara had been right  --  it was not for a sick man , or a well man , either . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing my story for me . The winter came , and we were evicted , and ended up in two rooms on the top floor of a defeated building on the edge of the Harlem River . The music Ray was playingreminded me of this house . I have lived long enough to see my language stolen  --  I was about to say betrayed ; but it has certainly been pressed into a most peculiar service . " Beat , " in those days , meant something very different from what it has since come to mean : for example , our poor father was " beat to his socks , " which meant that his hope was gone . And no one , in those days , desired to be " funky " : funk was a bad smell , it was the invincible odor which filled our house , the very odor of battle , the battle waged by the living in the midst of death . In those two rooms we acted out our last days as a family . Our father had been laid off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all he found were odd jobs for a day or two , helping to tear up the city 's streets , or shoveling away the snow downtown  --  I never saw any snow being shoveled away in Harlem ! And Caleb quit school  --  to my father 's wrath and despair  --  but he scarcely fared any better than our father . Our mother began working as a maid in the Bronx , and brought home odds and ends from Miss Anne 's kitchen . Our fatherwould not eat the food that she brought home  --  he said it would have choked him , and I believe it would have . It was hard enough for him to accept the fact thatp118without the money she made , we would probably all have starved to death . I became a shoeshine boy , downtown , after school , and on the weekends I sold shopping bags in front of the department stores and the five and dimes on 14th Street . And we went on relief  --  not for the first time ; for the last time . Our father no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet white wine . We were cold and frightened , and we were hungry , but , except for our father , we were not in despair . Our mother was holding on  --  grim , silent , watchful , but not cheerless ; she was determined to bring us to the daylight . But she had a lot to watch , a lot to carry . She was watchingour father , praying that the daylight would come before his spirit should be forever broken ; she was watching Caleb , praying that the daylight would come before his hope , which was his youth , should be forever destroyed ; and she was watching me , wondering what I was learning , and what I would be like when the daylight came . The daylight may always come , but it does not come for everybody and it does not come on time . My shoeshine box , my shopping bags , were the emblemsof my maturity ; and I now began to learn less from my elders than from my peers ; and from the mysterious downtown strangers whose touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as remote as snowcapped mountainpeaks . They had no rhythm which struck any chords in me . The wonder with which I watched them , and the distaste which I somehow sensed in their distance , needed but a touch to be transformed forever into enmity . I was trying to discover what principle united so peculiarly bloodless a people . I suspected that the principle was cruelty , but I was not sure . My white peers did not really baffle me , not even when they called me names  --  I couldp119call names , too . We fought all the time and sometimes I won and sometimes I lost  --  usually , I guess , I lost ; but I was lucky in that we usually fought fair , and so defeat did not bring about a poisonous rancor . In any case , at least from time to time , we had to band together against the cops  --  and I had long ago dismissed the cops from all human consideration . But the others , the men and women , young and old , sometimes smiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands , would they treat me like the cops ? I was not certain : but I feared the worst . And my black peers thought that my wonder was foolish , that it proved me soft in the head . And I learned a new folklore , by which I did not dare to admit that I was frightened , manfully laughing with them at their pictures of Popeye with a hard-on , screwing Olive Oil , giving respectful attention to their accounts of their sexual discoveries , wondering what was wrong with me , for I had certainly never done any of those things . I could not really imagine them . But I never said so . I never said much , for I was afraid of revealing my ignorance . But , without quite knowing it , I began to look at everyone around me in another way . Did everybody do it ? It was impossible to believe . I had fallen into the habit of going to see Miss Mildredevery once in a while . If it was raining or snowing and my shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be used ; when I was frightened , when I was sad , I would go to see Miss Mildred , for perhaps no one would be home at my house ; and I very often met Caleb there . Sometimes , when I got there , it would be a long time before Caleb and Dolores came out of one of the rooms off the hall . And this made me wonder . But I loved Caleb too much to wonder long . One day I wouldp120ask him if what I was told was true : and I knew that he would tell me the truth . When I look back  --  now  --  it seems to me that the air knew that we were to be parted ; and so the air informed us ; for Caleb and I clung to each other as we never had before . He teased me , as before , of course , but this did not make me feel ashamed . On the contrary , it made me feel proud . I felt that he was beginning to treat me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I did everything I could to live up to his expectations : not to be a crybaby , to fight back , no matter how big the adversary was ( and then to give Caleb his name and address ) , to wash myself , even in the coldest weather , to be respectful to old folks ( if they were colored ) , to do my schoolwork right so that our father and mother would be proud of me . And he said that he would try to send me to college  --  " because you 're smarter than I am , little brother "  --  and he was teaching me to box , and , when summer carne , he was going to teach me to swim . Sometimes , he and Dolores took me to the movies with them . And , at night , when we lay in bed , Caleb would sometimes give me a stolen Milky Way , and talk to me for hours . I do n't remember what we talked about . I just remember the sound of his voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other room , the ferocious industry of the rats which we heard in the kitchen , in the walls , which sometimes took place beneath our bed , the music coming from another apartment , the frost on the windows , so thick sometimes that one could not see out , the blunt , black shape of the kerosene stove which had now been extinguished , for safety and for thrift , and Caleb 's arm around me , his smell , and the taste of chocolate , and the electrical sound of the paper . " You ai n't sleepy yet ? " he might ask , and I would shake my head ,  |p121No  . " Well , little brother , " he would say , with a yawn , " I am , and you better be . " Then he would rub his hand over my head , a trick of our father 's , and say , " Goodnight , little Leo . " Then he would turn on his side , saying , " Snuggle up tight , now . You all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his back , and we fell asleep . One day  --  one day  --  I came down the avenue on my way downtown to buy and sell my shopping bags , and I noticed that the store where Caleb and I always met was closed , was padlocked . There was no one in the store and none of the people who were usually hanging around the store were in the streets . This seemed very odd , especially since this day was a Saturday . But I could n't wonder about it too much ; I had to get downtown . And nothing that happened during all that long day , that cold , bright day , warned me of what was coming . The sun shone all day long  --  a cold sun ; nobody bothered me , neither my peers , nor the police ; people tipped me nicely , that day , and I sold all my shopping bags . I was tremendously proud of myself when I got on the subway to go home . I did n't think of stopping by Miss Mildred 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made . But when I started up the steps to our house somethingwhispered to me , something whispered , trouble . It was in the darkness of the hall  --  the lights had gone out  --  it came out from the walls , it came out  --  I suddenly realizedit  --  from the silence . These steps , these landings , had never been so silent before . I ran faster up the stairs . I pushed on our door , and it opened at once . But it was usually locked . I stared at my father and mother , who stood in the center of the room , staring at me . " You seen your brother ? " my mother asked  | " No , " I said . " I just come from downtown . " I took the money out of my pockets . " Here . " But she did n't see the money , she did n't take it . I just held it . It got heavier and heavier . My mother sat down , crying . I had never seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood above my mother , holding her tightly by the shoulder . I asked , " What 's the matter , Mama ? " My father asked , " You know any of your brother 's friends ? " I said , No , because I wanted to hear what he would say . " They done robbed a store , whoever they is , and stabbed a man half to death . They say Caleb was with them . " " A boy named Arthur  --  Arthur something-or-other. " said my mother , " he the one say Caleb was there . " " Do you know him ? " my father asked . I shook my head , No : for a different reason this time . " They used to steal things  --  they used to steal things , " said my mother , " look like they was a regular gang , and the cops say  --  the cops say  --  they used that store for a hiding place . " " The cops say ! " said my father . I had seen the cops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly with the owner . " The store is closed , " I said . I went over to my mother . " Mama  --  Mama  --  what they going to do if they find Caleb ? " My mind had stopped , stuck , screaming , on the faces of white cops . " They going to take him away , " she said . I looked at my father . " But Caleb do n't steal ! Caleb never stole nothing in his whole life ! " My father saidp123nothing . We heard footsteps on the stairs . Not one of us moved . But the steps stopped just below our landing . Then I realized that I would have to find Caleb and tell him not to come home . I stuffed my money in my pockets  --  maybe he would need it . I said , " I 'll be right back , " and I ran out of the house and down the stairs . I ran down those stairs faster than Caleb ever had , and into the startling wind of the street . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people all were strangers . I do not think I saw them . And yet , somethingcautioned me not to run too fast ; something cautionedme to dissemble my distress ; something cautioned me to look , to look about me , before I moved . I stood on my stoop and I looked toward the dreadful river . Only small boys were playing there . Across the street , there were ladies in windows and men on stoops ; and up the street , more men and boys and ladies , and no cops . I touched the money in my pockets  --  I do n't know why ; perhaps I wanted everyone to believe that I had been sent to the store . And then I started walking , out of the block , toward Miss Mildred 's house . But I did not go down the avenue because I was afraid to pass the store . I went straight west until I came to Miss Mildred 's avenue . I passed cops on my way , but they did not stop me , or seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ran up the steps . I tried to give the funny knock I had heard Arthur give , but , then , I broke , I pounded on the door with all my might , and I screamed , " Miss Mildred ! Miss Mildred ! It 's Leo . It 's Leo ! Let me in ! " Then I heard the pole being moved out of the way , and the rattle of the chain , and the locks unlocking . She stood before me , and I knew she knew . " Miss Mildred ? Is my brother here ? "  |p124She  pulled me inside , with one hand , saying nothing . In the hall stood Dolores . I was led down the long hall to the two big rooms . Caleb sat on the sofa , dressed in his black lumberjacket . He had his arms wrapped around himself , as though he were cold . He looked over at me . His face looked dry , as though he had never sweated . He said , " Hello , little Leo . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I walked over to him . He pulled me onto his lap . " Caleb did n't do it , Leo , " Dolores said . " We know he did n't do it , and we 'll go to court and say so . " Caleb continued rubbing his hand over my head . He sighed , a great sigh , my head moved with it , and he pulled my head back and looked into my face . " Do n't be afraid . Leo , " he said . " Please do n't be afraid . Will you do that ? For me ? " I nodded . Then he said , " I did n't do it . I just want you to hear it from me . All right ? " I said , " All right . " Then I said , " But I do n't care if you did ! " He laughed . He cried , too . He said , " I know that , Leo . " He laughed again . " Caleb  --  are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cops have been at the house , " I said . " Did you see them ? " " No . Mama and Daddy told me . " The three of them looked at each other . " That Arthur , " said Miss Mildred , " that Arthur . " " If I run , " said Caleb , " I wo n't get far . And then they 'll fix my ass for sure . " " I got some money , " I said . But he did n't hear me . He was listening to something in the street . Dolores walked to the window and looked out . She turned back into the room . " Here they come , " she said . I had neverp125seen a face so bitter . And she did not seem to be able to move . Then she looked at Caleb , and she smiled . She tried to say something . Caleb suddenly rose and ran to her , and grabbed her . " I hear you , " said Miss Mildred , for there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hear you , " she cried again , " ai n't no need for all that . " I heard her opening the door . Dolores stood with Caleb ; now it was I who could not move . " Do you people have to make such a racket ? " I heard Miss Mildred ask . " Do n't you people have good sense ? Do n't you push past me this way ! This is my house ! Ai n't you people able to ask for what you want ? " They came down the hall , three of them , white ; one of them had his gun drawn . Still , I could not move . " We 're looking for Caleb Proudhammer , " one of them said . " What for ? " asked Dolores . " That 's none of your business , " one of them said . " Yes , it is my business , " Dolores said , " to ask you what you 're arresting him for . And it 's your business to tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them said . " I 'm Caleb Proudhammer , " Caleb said . " You do n't need those guns . I 've never shot nobody in my life . " " Come on over here . We 're taking you down to the station . " " What for ? " " You 're a very inquisitive bunch of niggers . Here 's what for , " and he suddenly grabbed Caleb and smashed the pistol butt against the side of his head . The blood ran down  --  my brother 's blood . I jumped up , howling , from the sofa , trying to get to Caleb , but they knocked mep130few kids like ourselves ; and since it was political in subject , we felt that we were being very brave . Then I was to come back to Bull Dog Road and collect the signs , and Barbara and Jerry and I were to drive into town to hang them up . But , at the rate Barbara and Jerry were making it , I would have to pitch in and help them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car and I yelled , " Jesus ! Are you two still fucking around ? " Jerry turned , and gestured with his paintbrush , managing to splash paint on his hairy chest . I laughed . He shouted , " Up yours , buddy ! I do n't see you doing any work . " Barbara stood up . " Leo ! You have been driving around like an overseer all day ! Where are you going now ? " " To town , baby ! To town ! " " What are you going to do in town ? " " I 'm going to drink me a couple of mint juleps while you all finish painting them signs . We have been placed in a supervisory position  --  and we expect you to have them signs ready when we return ! " They both looked for something to throw at me . I yodeled , " Oh , I wish I was in the land of cotton ! " and roared down the road , away . Jerry had come out at our insistence , and also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big , cheerful , open-hearted Italian boy , a very gentle creature . He was not at the Workshop , he was working as an artists ' model in town ; but he hung out with us and he helped us out . I had been evicted from my quarters in Paradise Alley . This made the idea of working at the Workshop not only more attractive , but imperative , for it meant that I wouldp131be certain to eat all summer long and that I would spend the summer in the open air . The money was nominal  --  so nominal that both Barbara and I were also working as artists ' models , and Jerry and I mowed lawns . But we were happy , or nearly so . We worked hard all week , sometimes we got drunk in town at night , on Sundays we went rowing or fishing . My Paradise Alley roommate , Charlie , had gone hitchhiking back to Iowa  --  to find an old girl-friend , he said , though this quest , this possibility , did not appear to cheer him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her things and Jerry 's things and mine were there . It was early July , and the sun was a busy and persistentsun . I had turned darker , with a lot of red in my skin and hair ; while Barbara had turned mulatto and her hair had turned blond on her forehead and on the curly sides and edges . Jerry was browner than Arabs , and we called ourselves , when we journeyed through town , " the Negro color problem . " We were just outside a small town on a bluff above a river . The Indian Magua , in The Last of the Mohicans , had forced the British maiden , for whom honor was more important than life , over this bluff , into this river  --  so , at least , Fenimore Cooper and his Hollywooddescendants had informed me ; it was not hard to imagine Indian braves catapulting down this river , and one heard the fury of their arrows through the leaves of trees . In the hope of catching some whisper of the past , we sometimes wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built and ruined by financiers , but saved by a war . Though the graveyard failed to give us any sense of our past , the town gave us all too vivid a sense of our actual condition . The town had been moribunda long time , but factories and government contractsp132and army installations and eventually soldiers with their pay came to the town and saved it . The people in the town were , therefore , happily making money and the natureand the degree of their happiness made them haltinglyfriendly and quickly cruel . Although it was recognizedthat our presence in the town conferred on the town a peculiar prestige and was even good for business , we certainly were not liked . The San-Marquands had rented a big , white wooden house in town , and it was a tremendous sign of status to be invited to one of their parties . It was suspected that the San-Marquands were Jewish , and people said terrible things about them behind their backs ; but , on the other hand , they were friends with the stars of stage and screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appearing under the Workshopbanner . The gentry came to the San-Marquand parties , dazzled , supercilious , and drunk ; and we , the Workshop kids , who were often there , serving canapes and drinks , sometimes picked up an odd job or two  --  or vice versa ; but , whatever the use they might occasionally make of us , the combination of our youth and our aims was distressingly and sharply distasteful to them . Everyonewas certain that the San-Marquands were exotically , unimaginably , erotically corrupt , and so were the movie stars , their friends . They had gotten away with it , and , thus , were obviously a bad example for us ; obviously , kids in such fast company were bound to be depraved . They did not want to know why , when we could have been doing other things , we painted signs and mowed lawns and posed naked . They disliked Jerry because he was Italian , they disliked Barbara because she was not , and , therefore , had no excuse , and they disliked me because I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not , in fact , appear to know that I was colored and this filled them with such a baleful exasperation , such an exasperated wonder , that the waitress ' hand , when I stopped in the diner , actually trembled as she poured my coffee , and people moved away from me , staring as though I were possessed by evil spirits . Naturally , I despised them . They did n't even have the courage of their sick convictions , for , if they had , they would have tarred me and feathered me and ridden me out of town . But they did n't dare do this because of my connection with the Workshop . Naturally , they brought out the worst in all three of us . Their minds were like dirty windowpanes ; and so we obligingly acted out their fantasies for them . When Jerry and I walked through town together , for example , everyone assumed we were queer  --  there could n't be any other reason for our walking together ; and so we sometimes walked with our arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and I had not been so bold , we would have paid  --  more often than we did  --  a bloody price for this . But Jerry 's size intimidatedand bewildered them  --  he certainly did n't act queer  --  and so did my boldness , which seemed to contradictmy color ; on the whole , we were rather too queer to be easily molested . Of course , when Barbara and Jerry walked through town , Barbara had only to put her head on Jerry 's shoulder for them both to become , at once , a pair of lewd and abandoned lovers ; while for the three of us , walking together and holding hands , they had no words at all . Nevertheless , they endured us because the San-Marquands gave parties at which they might meet movie stars . The Workshop kids  --  there were about fifteen of us  --  lived along a mile or two of roads , about three milesp134outside of town , in wooden shacks . These shacks had been built in the twenties ; the place was known as Bull Dog Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all the artists had eventually left it , either upon becoming successful or upon realizing that success was impossible . The Actors ' Means Workshop , aided by the gentry , had taken over this celebrated road . It cost almost nothing to live there , except energy ; but it took rather a lot of that . Barbara and Jerry and I shared a two-story shack , for which we paid , I think , about twelve dollars a month . We thought it was a fine place . Downstairs , where Barbara and Jerry stayed , there was a small , dark kitchen with old , battered pots and pans and chipped dishes and heavy stone mugs ; Jerry had strung it with his Italian spices , and it stank of gorgonzola cheese . We loved it  --  luckily , since Jerry was the only one of us who really knew how to cook . The bathroom was very old and primitive , with a metal tub which took hours to fill and hours to empty ; Jerry and I put up a shower of sorts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being enabled to dump a couple of pails of water over oneself . Their big room had an enormous double bed , big enough for six people , and a fireplace , and two rocking chairs . We screened all the windows and doors and then left them open all the time . At night , we put the rocking chairs on the porch and sat there , talking , and wondering , silently , what it would be like to be old . My room was smaller than theirs , but it had two big windows and outside of one window leaned an old tree , taller than our house , and the other window faced the far-off mountains . We had whitewashed the entire house , inside and out , and the moonlight did strange things to the walls of my room at night . I sat there many nights , all alone , after Barbarap135and Jerry had gone to bed , sometimes simply staring out at the night and sometimes strumming the guitar I had bought . Though we had been at the Workshop for three weeks , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an improvisation . The kind of workers we had become would more probably have been appreciated in a mill or on a farm ; at least insofar as this work could reveal any of our qualifications for the theater . We began to mind this , but we had not minded it in the beginning . We were too excited by the hard preparation necessary to get the Workshop set up , and to get its first summer production on the stage . Our first week , we did a great deal of demolishing  --  of walls , doors , panels  --  and a great deal of carting and burning ; we became relatively efficientwith the hammer and the nail and the saw , and also fairly swift with first aid ; and then we plastered and painted . We made an inventory of the props , which were piled helter-skelter , and covered with dust , in the attic of the theater , and built shelves and compartments for the bells , knives , samovars , lamps , and telephones , and classifiedthem according to a system worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERIOD , TOLSTOIAN , for example , took care of the samovars and ikons , of which there were a great many , the SanMarquandsbeing partial to the Russian drama ; MODERN , NORTH AMERICA , took care of all the phones but one , which stood arrogantly alone on a shelf labeled , CONTEMPORARY , VIENNA . " Contemporary , my ass , " Jerry snarled . " When was the last time anybody around here saw Vienna ? " Nor was it likely that anyone would be seeing it soon . We examined every costume , no matter how old , faded , or torn , and salvaged as many as possible . The cos/fumes gave me a strange , sad thrill : these uniforms of Czarist generals , of Civil War soldiers , the shawls and dresses of Lorca heroines , the patched jackets of Steinbeck peasants , of Odets insurgents , these buckles , shoes , boots , pumps , bonnets , rugged shirts and ruffled shirts , tight breeches and baggy pants , cowls , capes , helmets , swords , shields , spears , drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt that sometimes they shredded at a touch , so icily trapped in time 's indifference that they chilled the hand , spoke of the reality , operating relentlessly every hour , which would one day overtake me and all my styles and poses and all my uniforms . These garments had been worn  --  by real people ; real music had been played for them , and they had moved in a genuine light ; they had put their hands on their hearts and delivered their vows , and the curtain had come down . These costumes were like their dispersed , indifferent bones , and the attic alwaysreminded me of Ezekiel 's valley , and Ezekiel 's question : Oh , Lord , can these bones live ? I had never been on a real stage before , and the first time I stepped on the stage of The Green Barn , one stormy summer afternoon when the sky was wailing as though heaven had gone mad , sending down water in merciless , blinding sheets , and drumming on the roof like all of Africa , I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize how high a stage could be . I looked up and up , into dust and darkness , scaffolds and ropes . It would be terrible to fall from there . I was all alone that afternoon . I had been sent on some kind of errand  --  I was always being sent on errands . But I had to wait for the summer storm to end , and , in the meantime , no one was very likely to be able to get to me . I looked out at the dark , spooky theater  --  very spooky now , withp137the rain roaring  --  and wondered if my destiny could be involved in such a place . But destinies , as I was beginning to discover , are strange  --  and must be , being so mysteriouslyhung up with desire . For I desired , I realized one day  --  if these bones could live  --  to stand here before those living with whom I would fill this dusty void , and hear them bearing witness as I now heard the sound of the rain . I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither had I thought of others as needing my desire ; but I , now , for the first time , in that dusty barn , suspected that this coupling defined one 's destiny , and that on this coupling depended the mysterious life of the world . I was young . Perhaps it is hard , now , to credit , still less to sound , the depth of my bewilderment . I merely suspected in the chilling height , the dusty , roaring darkness , the presence of others , each of whom was myself . But these others could not know it , and neither could I , unless I was able , being filled by them , to fill this theater with our lives . This was , perhaps , my highest possibility of the act of love . But I did not say it that way to myself that afternoon . I merely walked up and down the stage . I measured its length , breadth , and depth , and threw my voice to the topmost balcony . In that empty space , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it echo back ; and I wished that I had brought my guitar with me . In spite of all our manual labor  --  which included hanging drapes for the San-Marquands  --  we , by which I mean principally Barbara and I , read and studied and argued . Saul had explicitly informed us that our improvisationswere to be solo , that we were not to work together on them , or even to discuss them  --  which we could n't , anyway , have done since he had n't given either of us ap138theme . We were to choose our scenes and we were free to do them solo or not , as we liked ; but we did n't know if Saul wanted to see the scenes before he saw the improvisationsor wanted to see the improvisations before he saw the scenes . We were aware that our improvisations might disqualify us for any scenes , and this made us rather edgy with each other sometimes  --  we both dreaded our first test , especially as it had come about so improbably and promised to be so definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's Chillun Got Wings ; Barbara , when the chips were down , conceded that we would probably disgracefully disappear beneath the quicksand of Miss Julie  --  which I had read by now ; and we had compromised , I guess , on the scene between the young hack and his girl in Waiting for Lefty . It was a scene which we felt we could play . Then , when we began to work on it , the scene began to be , in a wordless way , a terrifying challenge . I soon began to wish that we had chosen some other scene , the scene between the gangster and his girl-friend turned whore , in Dead End , for example , but once we had begun work , my pride would n't let me back down . We had felt ourselves very bold to choose this scene , and had also felt that our doing it would put the liberal San-Marquands to a crucial test  --  we had n't realized that it would also put us to a crucial test . It was a scene which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to dance with each other and I got a chance to whistle and do a short tap dance routine . The young hack , Sid , and his girl , Florrie , ca n't marry because it 's the depression and they do n't have any money and this is the scene in which they give each other up . We could n't make it and we could n't let it go  --  I had not known make-believe could be so painful , and , indeed , I now began to learnp139something about make-believe . At one point in the scene , after remembering their furtive lovemaking in parks and hallways , the girl offers to go with Sid to a room somewhere . But he refuses ; he says there is no future for them . There is great tension in the scene , which connected with an unspoken tension in us , and we began to be appalled . For it is also the most crucial of love scenes , the moment of loss and failure : perhaps a great deal of superstition was mixed with our recoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene very well anymore , but perhaps I 'll never forget how it choked me , made me stammer , how it caused me , sometimes , almost to hate Barbara . This I saw in her bewilderedand slowly divining eyes : which both helped the scene and hurt it . Anyway , this scene was very much on my mind the first time , that rainy afternoon , when I paced the stage of The Green Barn and threw my voice to the balcony . For , by this time , I had become impatient with all my hard labor and wanted to be tested . Though I tried to be gallant , I was nevertheless watchful , and I knew that there was something ambiguous , at best , about the uses , the errand boy uses , to which I was permitting myself to be put . I realized how unlikely it was that I would ever work on a stage , and I also realized that my future did not really matter to the San-Marquands at all . My future mattered , really , only to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't expect much of the summer , it was a stop-gap : but I had to be ready for the winter . I stopped the car in front of the diner . I was wearing an old T-shirt and some old pants and sneakers  --  this was one of my uniforms ; the other was a devastating blue serge suit , with which , however , I was careful never to wear a white shirt . The diner was in the shape of a Pull/man car , booths on one side , counter on the other . It was late in the afternoon , and there were only about half a dozen people there , all of them older than I , and all of them evil , and all of them , as they supposed , white . They looked at me as I calve in , and turned away . I smiled at the waitress , whose eyes were as fixed as varnished brown buttons , and who rose slowly , as though pulled up by the hair , as I and my smile  --  or my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , " I said  --  my smile was loud , but my voice was low  --  " can you fill this order for me , please ? " And I handed her the list . She looked at it as though it were a chemical formula . I looked pleasantly around me , and sat down at the counter . " You 've got great weather in this town . Could I have a beer while I 'm waiting , please ? " I knew she would n't refuse me because the one time she 'd dared to ask my age , I 'd been with Jerry who had told her his age and sworn that I was his older brother . She handed my order over into the short-order cook 's domain  --  who peeped out of his cage at me  --  and then , slowly , frowning as over a knotty theological question , produced a bottle of beer , placed it before me , and slowly opened it . Then she walked away and got a glass and placed it on the counter before me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself a beer . I began to hum : " Sinner man , where you going to run to ? " I lit a cigarette . I heard the hamburgers begin sizzling over yonder . " I do n't care , " one of them said , " right is right . " " Do n't get yourself upset , Bill , " one of them said . " It ai n't worth it , " one of them said . They were talking to each other . I continued to hum.  |p141The  waitress , whose name was Sally , began putting coffee in the cardboard containers . " Did you ever hear the story about a nigger fucking a elephant ? " one of them said . They looked sideways at me . I continued to hum . They whispered , they laughed ; then they shouted . " That was the end of that elephant ! " I had heard the story before . " Sally , " I asked , in my mildest voice , " could I please have another beer ? " She looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hatred makes one servile . " Your hamburgers is almost ready . You might not have enough time to finish it . Before they get cold , I mean . " " I 'll manage . " I finished , nearly gagging , my tasteless beer  --  but pride can control one 's reflexes , though I also suspect that one 's reflexes are , sometimes , what one takes to be one 's pride  --  and set my glass down . " There . Okay ? " " Come on , Bill , " said one of them . They took him out . The diner was empty . She stared after them . Then , in a genuine , bewildered sorrow , she looked at me , found a bottle of beer , opened it , set it before me , and started picking up the hamburgers . " I hope you have a box for all this , " I said . " I do n't . Mrs. San-Marquand said that she was sure you would . " " I 'll see , " she said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Thank you . " And I drank my beer . The short-order cook produced the box . I let her put everything in the box herself . I finished my beer . Then I wanted to piss , but I calculated where I could piss on the road . I paid her . She rang up the money . " I must have a receipt , " I said . " All right , " she said , " just a minute . I know the peopleyou work for always want a receipt . " And she gave mep142one . She had won . But I went down smiling . " Bye-bye , Sally . See you tomorrow , God willing . " And I picked up the box and carried it out to the jalopy . I placed it on the front seat next to me . This was sometimes the trickiest moment of all my days , for , since I could n't spill the coffee or the Coke , could n't fail to feed the hungry , I could n't let my fury release itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had rented a pretty house , big and rambling  --  much too big for the two of them , but , then , on the other hand , they were never alone . Their house was always full of people , and Rags Roland was spending the summer with them . Rags was very impressive ; big , and so ugly that she was positively splendid . In fact , a woman who looked like Rags had scarcely any choice but to become splendid if she were to achieve any bearable human quality at all . She was bigger than most men , with a face as square and as expressive as a block of granite  --  a block of granite veined with fine red lines . She had been given , in belated and incongruous compensation , a great deal of very bright , curling hair which was red by the time I met her . She wore it as though it were a helmet , not , I must say , that she could have worn it in any other way . Her clothes all seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twopiecetweed suits , sometimes somber but sometimes startlinglyplaid , which gave way , come summer , to equally relentless , sacklike prints . They boomed like trumpets , they hurt the eye . She was incredibly energetic , one of the people whose relentless good-nature at length becomes rather frightening . She was always smoking and joking ; one wondered if she could ever be still . She had told me once , sitting on the San-Marquand porch , in a large , ornate double swing made of South American straw , thatp143she could not get through a single day without listening to music . I wondered when . I wondered how she could ever turn off all the noise she lived with long enough to hear anything : I should have thought that her spiritual eardrums had long ago been broken . But photographs of herself and the San-Marquands , taken years before when they had just begun the Workshop , showed another Rags , a Rags unreconciled . These photographs were on the walls of The Green Barn office , and in Saul 's study at home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in rehearsal . Saul looked very different , his hair had not been white then ; in one of the photographs he was without his glasses and he looked like a startled boy . Lola had been round but not shapeless , her hair had been long , and her face very earnestand girlish . And Rags  --  Rags had worn her hair very long then , and braided into a crown . The big face , the big mouth , the great square mass of her , seemed , somehow , vulnerable . And she was wearing something which looked gray in the photographs , long and soft and full . She had been trying to be an actress in those days , and she wrote poetry . " Wretched poetry , " she said , " but I 've never had the heart to burn it . It 'll turn up in my private papers after I 'm dead . Do n't let the world laugh at me too much . " This was when she was drunk , at one of the San-Marquand parties . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn and when they saw the car toiling toward the house , they sent up a great cheer . Rags was standing on the porch . " Boy , " she said , " that 's by far the most exciting businesswe 've got out of them all day . I wonder what makes you so popular . Could it be the grub ? "  | " It could be , " I said , " but , then , again , it might be my pretty brown eyes . " " Come on , Leo . Your eyes ca n't begin to compete with those hamburgers . " " Are you going to sit here on all this  --  food  --  all afternoon ? " asked Madeleine , the company 's leading lady , " or are you going to get up off it and give us some ? " She winked at me . " And I know you know what I mean , honey . How are you ? I hope you 're not forgetting your red-hot mama ? " " How could I forget you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Promises , promises . And I 've been so ravenous for so long . " We laughed together . Madeleine and I always carried on like this , but I did n't know to what extent it was for real and I did n't know how to make the first move . She was about thirty , which was intimidating , blonde , rather hefty , but very nice . She was a respected minor actress , who had never been a leading lady before , divorced , with an eight-year-old daughter . The daughter was in the city , with Madeleine 's parents . The other kids came over and took away the boxes of food and drink and put them under a tree . They picked up their Cokes and hamburgers and dispersed . I got out of the car , and stretched , and sat down on the bottom step of the porch . " Are n't you hungry ? " Rags asked me . " No , " I said . " I ate a big breakfast . " I looked up at her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'm directing this shambles . I ca n't eat until they 've all gone home . Actors take away my appetite . "  | " I smiled . " You 're always with them , " T said . " You must eat an awful lot after they 've gone home . " " I think you 're being impertinent , " Rags said , and laughed , and ground out her cigarette in the grass . She sat down on the porch step beside me . " Is it a shambles ? " I asked her . " I thought Lola said that it was going very well . " " Lola dare n't say anything else . It 's her job to keep up everybody 's morale  --  poor Lola . She 's been walking around here these last few days like the white angel  --  the lady with the lamp . " She lit another cigarette and offered one to me , and lit it for me . " But it 's got to be a shambles , boy , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of untried amateurs and a group of aging , uncertain professionals . You spend half the time keeping them from each other 's throats . And the play , just between you and me , is not exactly Hamlet . Oh , well . " " Then why are you doing it ? " I asked . " Well  --  we think the play has something important to say . And why not try to jolt this town a little bit ? Besides , it 's a play they 've heard of  --  it was done on Broadway . With Sylvia Sidney . " Lola came over and sat down in the grass before us , like a girl . " How 'd you like that cheer you got ? " Lola asked . " Was n't that something ? We rehearsed it all morning . " " We might as well have , " Rags said grimly . " Rags , " Lola said , " it did n't go badly . Really . " " Madeleine will never learn how to hold that letter , " Rags murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she ever get any mail ? " " In my class this morning , " Lola said , " I told her top146hold the letter as though the letter were her final divorce papers  --  Madeleine 's divorced , you know , " she said to me  --  " and to realize that now that she is divorced , she does n't really want to be . I thought it began to make a difference in the way she held the letter . I really did . " " Maybe , " Rags said , gloomily . " I still think she looks as though she were holding a raw pork chop . " " Oh . You arc such a perfectionist , " Lola said . I ground out my cigarette and stood up . " I have to go , " I said . " I hope we have those signs all over town , " said Lola . " We do n't yet , " I said , " but we will . " " But they should have been up by now ! " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectthem now . They 'll be all over town in a couple of hours . Do n't worry . " " Oh ! I 'm not complaining about you , " said Lola . " You are really an exemplary model of industry and devotion . It 's just  --  " " Opening night nerves , " said Rags , and laughed grimly . " Well . I think it will prove to be a very exciting theater experience . " " Especially , " said Rags , " if he 's sober . " " How is it going over there today ? " Lola asked me . " He 's sober today , " I said . I got into the car . " And the others ? How are they ? " " Like they 've always been . No better . No worse . " I started the motor . " But , you know , I do n't really have much time to watch rehearsals . " " Leo ! You are the rock on which we all depend . I trust that you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that as soon as this gruelingp147week is over , we will begin serious work . You have my word for that . And Saul 's word . " " Yes , ma'am , " I said . " I 'm glad . Because I sure am tired of being a rock . " I turned the car around . " Boy , " Rags said , " you do n't seem to realize that you 're getting a college education in the theater . " " I 'd feel better about being in college , " I said , " if somebody would give me a test . " " All right , " Lola said , " you shall have your test . Now . off with you . Good-bye . " " Good-night , ladies , " I said , and I drove away . When I drove past the toolshed this time , Barbara and Jerry were nowhere to be seen . I drove up Bull Dog Road and collected the signs from the other kids , and then drove to our shack . Barbara was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with turpentine . He looked as though he were in makeup to play a wounded soldier . " You 're a mess , " I told him , and came up the porch steps and sat down in one of the rocking chairs . " You 're a mess , too , " he said mildly . " What 's the matter , native son ? The theater getting you down ? " " The theater , shit , " I said . " It 's all this fucking runningaround . " " Do not despair , " said Jerry . " You will make your mark . I think I got paint on my shoulder . You want to rub it out for me ? " I got up and took the rag and scrubbed his left shoulderblade . " Christ , you stink , " I said . " Sometimes I ca n't stand myself . " Jerry grinned . He took the rag from me and walked into the kitchen . " You want a beer ? "  | " Yeah . You coming to town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses . I 'll be ready just as soon as Barbaracomes out of the shower and I can wash this stink off me . " He came out with a bottle of beer and two glasses . " Here . " He poured beer into my glass and then into his own , and he sat down . " That 's better . First time I 've sat down this whole fucking day . " " Yeah . We might as well be working for the rail-road . " " Well . You asked for it , " Jerry said . " It must be nice to be philosophical . " " It is . You ought to try it . " He lit two cigarettes and gave one to me . We listened to Barbara singing . " Do you want another pail of water ? " Jerry yelled . " I 've got those mad about him , sad about him , Lord , I ca n't be glad without him  --  what ? " " I asked you if you wanted another pail of water ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And she went on singing : " I 'm not the first on his list , I 'd never be missed , I wish I had a dime for every girl he 's kissed , I swear , I 'd be a millionaire  --  " Jerry and I looked at each other and smiled . " She 's quite a girl , " said Jerry . Then he blushed . " I do n't think I 'm good enough for her . " " Oh . You 're out of your fucking mind . " " You really think so ? " He asked it so very humbly that I looked over at him as though it were the first time I 'd ever seen him . " Of course I think so . What are you worrying yourselfabout ? She 's happy . Listen to her sing . " " I do n't think she 's singing because of me , " Jerryp149said . " She just likes to sing . " He paused . " She says singing will help her in her career . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll love him till I die , poor me ! " We heard the water splashing over her . " Jerry ! Towel ! " " Coming , princess ! " He picked up a bath towel from the porch rail and handed it in to Barbara . He came back and sat down in the rocking chair , and , in a moment , she appeared , covered with the towel . She ran up the porch steps . " Ah ! " she cried , seeing me , " the overseer is back . I 'll be ready in a minute . Jerry , take your shower ! " " Yes , princess , " Jerry said . He winked at me . " You want to fill the bucket for me ? Or maybe you want to take a shower first ? " " No . Go ahead . After you . I told you how you stink . " He hesitated . " Go on , idiot . I 'll fill the buckets . Then you can fill them for me . " " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wo n't be long , " and he stepped out of his shorts and stepped into the wooden cubicle . I detached the two buckets from their platform at the top of the cubicle and filled one with fairly hot water and one with fairly cold water and replaced them . " You 're on , " I told him , and went back to the porch . I heard him yell and heard the water splashing and heard Barbara singing in the room . I lit a cigarette and drank my beer . As soon as the signs were up , our working day would be over and it was not yet five o'clock . " Hey ! " I yelled , " why do n't we have dinner in town ? " " I do n't think we have enough money , " Barbara said . She shouted to Jerry , " Jerry , do you have any money ?  |p150Besides   --  Leo  --  we were supposed to work on our scene tonight . You remember ? " " The hell with it . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really . I 've got six dollars . " " I think I 've got about ten dollars , " Jerry shouted . " Look in my pants pockets . How much do you have , princess ? " " I 've only got five , " she informed him , singing it out like an aria , and arrived at the door , scrubbed and tomboyish , in an old white shirt of Jerry 's and some blue pants of her own . " May I have a cigarette , sir ? " she asked , and came over and leaned on my rocking chair . " Certainly , princess . " I lit one for her and gave it to her . " There you go . " " Princess is something Jerry picked up from you and now I think you 've picked it up from Jerry . I do n't really like it . Why do you call me princess ? " " It 's in tribute to your birth . " She blew a great cloud of smoke into my face . " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making fun of me . " " I 'm not making fun of you . Jerry 's not making fun of you  --  God knows . Do n't think like that . " I watched her . " We 're just teasing you a little bit . " Then I said , " It 's only because we love you . " " Ah ! " She moved away and sat down in the other rocking chair . " Can I have a sip of your beer , please ? " I gave her my glass . I asked , " Shall we have dinner in town ? " " Okay . I do n't think Jerry feels like cooking tonight  --  and I ca n't cook at all  --  and you 're not much better . " She sipped my beer . " But I want to get back here early , so I can get up early . " " Okay . I 've got to get up , too . "  | " Hey ! " Jerry yelled , " throw me a towel ! " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back my beer and rushed into their room . In a moment she reappeared , laughing helplessly , leaning against the door . She waved a small face towel in front of her . I began to laugh . " Jerry , " Barbara called , " we only have one towel left . And it 's  --  Jerry -- it 's pretty small . " " Will you two stop fucking around and bring me a towel ? Leo , you got a towel upstairs ? I 'm wet ! " " I 'll get you a towel . But you can come on out now . Barbara wo n't look . " I got out of the chair and started up the stairs . " I 'll bring it to you inside . " I ran up the stairs to my room . I heard the cubicle door open and slam and I heard Jerry yell , " Geronimo ! " as he ran up the porch steps . I came back down the stairs with two towels , and tossed one towel into their room where they both were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I need a couple of pails of water . " And , to show that I meant business , I took off my T-shirt . " We 've still got to hang up those signs , children . " " Okay , " Jerry yelled , " okay . Go on in , I 'll fill up the buckets . " And he threw a towel around him and went into the kitchen . I heard him running water and I took off my shoes and socks , took off my pants and walked into the cubicle . I took off my shorts and hung them on the nail and hung my towel on the nail and picked up the soap . " You 're on , " yelled Jerry , and then I was alone with the water and the soap and my body . We drove into town at exactly six o'clock  --  so the courthouse clock informed us  --  and by seven we had placed our last sign in the window of the pizza joint which we had virtually taken over . The people who ran this joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inp152fact , they were n't natives of the country . They came from Sicily , I think , they had n't been in America long , and they were beginning to be gravely confused . They -- the old mother and father , the sons and daughters and inlaws  --  stillconsidered , in their barbaric , possessive , and affectionate fashion , that they were responsible for each other , that what happened to one affected all . This showed in their manner with each other and this manner marked them as foreign . This meant , of course , that they were disreputable and so we naturally gravitated there  --  it was our oasis . Neither had this Sicilian family yet arrived at anything resembling a perfect comprehension of what color meant in America , and so it was the only place in town where Negroes sometimes ate and drank , or , rather , it was the only place in town where Negroes and whites sometimes ate and drank together . Only the younger members of the family , and of these mainly the women , were beginning to suspect what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of their children . One sensed this in their worried frowns , in their occasional hesitations , above all in their steadily developing realization that the respectable people never ate their pizzas at the brightly colored tables , but always took them out . They were not yet materially menaced , for soldiers came , and sailors , and frequent travelers , and laborers ; and these all had money to spend . But the soldiersand the sailors often brought their girls  --  rather dubious , rather dangerous girls  --  and so did the travelers , and the laborers were loud . It was inevitable that some of the town Negroes would also appear , inevitable that the Sicilians would not have the sense to turn them away  --  it was against the law to turn them away , though this was not their reason  --  and inevitable , immediately thereafter ,  |p153that  the guardians of the law should descend to deepen the Sicilian confusion . They began to stare at the Negro laborers , who , after all , were often there with white laborers , eating and drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remembered , with the definite and desperate intention of discovering what was wrong with them . It began to occur to the women that there might be something wrong with being a laborer , since it meant , apparently  --  they were indeed confused  --  that one had to be friends with Negroes . They had seen where the Negroes lived by now , and how they lived . But they had yet to ascend high enough in the American scale to become reconciled to the American confusion ; they had not yet learned to despise Negroes , because they were still bemused by life . They liked Barbara and Jerry and me . They did n't know how to hide it . They did n't yet know that there was any reason to hide it . Of course , they particularly liked Jerry because they could speak Italian with him , and they gave each other tremendous joy becauseJerry could put them down for being Sicilian and they could put Jerry down because his family came from Naples . I did n't speak a word of Italian in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to listen . For Jerry 's relationship with these Sicilians was very unlike my relationship with the Negroes in the town . I envied Jerry . Perhaps I hated him a little bit , too . Also , in the pizza joint , since we were in the theater , we were special . we were gentry . It did n't seem at all odd to them that I should be in the theater  --  it was not only logical , it was , so to speak , my inheritance , my destiny . The only Negroes they had ever heard of had been in the theater , or in the ring . They were in awe of Paul Robeson  --  I must say that they really were . They lovedp154Joe Louis . They loved Marian Anderson . They loved Josephine Baker . They made me tell them everything I knew about Father Divine . He had helped to feed the hungry , I told them , and they agreed with me that this meant that he was a good man ; even though , as I later realized , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to Mussolini ; who had also , perhaps , helped to feed the hungry , but who had turned out , after all , not to be a good man . Angelo , the youngest son , seventeen or so , much taken and bewildered by Barbara , had helped us place our sign in the window , just so ; long before this operationwas concluded , his entire family had become involved in it , coming out on the sidewalk to judge the effect , and leaving customers waiting for their dinner . When it was finally judged an artistic success  --  which meant rearranging the window  --  Angelo returned to his function as dishwasher , the others returned to their functions , and we sat down at our table . We had decided that we needed a drink , but before we could order anything , Giuliano , the second son , brought us three dry martinis . " For us , " he said , and smiled and winked . " I hope your play will be a success . " " We are n't in the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in another play , " he said . He looked at Jerry and laughed . " Of course you know , " he said , " this one is of no use . He will never be in a play . " Jerry said something in Italian and they both laughed again . " I hope you do not understand Italian , " Giuliano said to Barbara , " he is a pig , your friend here . " Jerry said something else in Italian , and they both , as it were , vanished in a hurricane of laughter , into Italy . Barbara and I helplessly laughed , too . She lifted her glass.  |p155I  lifted mine . We turned toward Jerry and Giuliano . Jerry lifted his glass . " Cheers , " I said . " And thank you , Giuliano . " He smiled and bowed . " It 's a little pleasure . " He looked at Barbara , then at Jerry . " Do you want a menu , or do you want a pizza ? " " We want a pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with everything on it . " They very nearly , in their brief glance at each other , vanished into Italy again , but Giuliano restrained himselfwhile Jerry choked slightly on his martini . " Very well , " said Giuliano , " a pleasure , " and he inclined his head slightly and walked away . " What were you two laughing about ? " Barbara asked . " Family jokes , " said Jerry . He put one arm around her . They were together on one side of the booth , I was alone on the other . He lit a cigarette for her , and kissed her lightly on her restless forehead . " And family jokes ca n't be translated . " She looked at him , but said nothing . I sipped my martini , and I said , " This drink is on the house , is n't it ? Well , that means that we can have another one . I mean , we were going to have a drink , anyway . " " That means you want to get drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should try to work tonight . " " Barbara , I 'm tired of working in the dark . I know that goddamn scene ass-backward . I dream about it . And I do n't know if I know what I 'm doing and you do n't , either . It 's like  --  jerking off . " " I did n't know acting was that much fun , " said Jerry , and grinned . Barbara hit him lightly on the head . " Maybe I 'll try it . " Barbara raised her hand again , but he caught it and held it.  | " Have you said any more to Saul , " she asked me , " about when he 's going to start working with us ? " " No . But I talked to Lola this afternoon . " " And what did her Highness say ? " " She said that as soon as this grueling week was over , we would begin serious work . She said we had her word for that , and Saul 's word . " I stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going back to the city . " At that moment , I really meant it . " It 's not going to be any good , hanging around here all summer , if I 'm not learning any-thing . " Barbara opened her mouth , but Jerry spoke first . " You would n't just go away and leave us ? We 'd miss you , baby . " " Well  --  you two have each other . " I said this a little awkwardly . " Oh , Leo , " Barbara said . " Really ! " Wrathfully , she put out her cigarette . Then she looked up at me with a smile . I could never resist her , never , when she looked at me that way , she could make me do anything . " Nothing would be the same without you , Leo . Really not . " She put her hand , gently , on mine . " Let 's wait out the week . They 'll keep their word . You have my word for that . " And she nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips , and took her hand away . " If you 're lonely , " Jerry said , winking , " there are a couple of girls in the Life class who are very hot for your fine brown frame . " He laughed and told Barbara , " They sit there drooling all over their sketch pads . They 're supposedto be working in charcoal but they 're really doing water colors , believe me . " He looked at me . " How about it ? Just to while away the long summer evenings ? " " Those fat old bags ? You must be out of your mind . "  | " They 're not so old . They 're at the right age , baby . " The earnest , quizzical expression on his face made me laugh . " They 're not worried about having babies anymore , you see , so  --  well , you know . Anything goes . " " Jerry , " Barbara said , " those women are awful . EspeciallyMrs . Jenkins . She must weigh more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo likes that , " Jerry said . " Little men always like big women . " " Jesus , " I said , " I wish you 'd keep your cotton pickinghands off my sex life . " " Hey , I 'm glad you put it that way , " Jerry said . " A couple of the guys in the class are pretty hot for you , too , and they told me  --  " I dipped my paper napkin in my water glass and wadded it up and threw it at him . It hit him on the shoulder ; he dropped it on the floor . " Gosh , Leo . I was only trying to help . " " Shit . I 'm going to have another drink . " I grinned at Barbara . " Sex-starved actor takes to drink . " " But I really feel for you , baby , sometimes , when I know you 're going to be up there on that stand , " Jerry said . " In front of those harpies . Christ . They make my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hell , yes . " The patriarch of the tribe , Salvatore , came across my line of vision , and I signaled for more drinks . " I know what you mean , all right . " The Life class was pretty depressing . It was made up mainly of aging , idle women , and not one of them , as far as I could judge , had the remotest hint of talent . They usually placed me somewhere in Africa and I was often invested with a spear . But their concept of the African savage was fatally indebted to , and entangled with , their concept of the American Indian ; the results on paperp158were stunning indeed . I found it disquieting that anyone could look at me and see what they saw ; it was not less disquieting to realize that their bland , dumpling exteriorsconcealed so much of fantasy , helpless , lonely , and vindictive . These ladies gave me my first glimpse of a species of psychology which I eventually summed up  --  or dismissed  --  as the fig leaf complex ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did indeed , as Jerry said , cause my skin to " crinkle " when I stood before them naked . At first , I was most intimidated by my color  --  all of me naked seemed a vast quantity of color to bear ; but it was not long before I began to be intimidated , far more grievously , by the fact of my sex . I wore the regulation jockstrap , though this seemed silly to me . Female models wore nothing at all . But then I began to feel that the jockstrap actually functioned  --  and perhaps was meant to function  --  as a kind of incitement , both for them and for me . I began to resent the jockstrap , for it seemed a kind of insult to my body . I could n't help but become terribly conscious of what the jockstrap concealed and this made my penis nervous . I was always frightened of having an erection : all of me could be seen except that most private and definitive part of me , which was on no account to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all of my anxiety centered below my waist , I always , inexorably , felt the vengeful organ begin to stretch and swell  --  with anxiety , I suppose , certainly not with lust  --  pulling the jockstrap down . But I kept my eyes straight ahead of me , and held my pose , expecting at any moment to hear the women scream and faint , while sweat poured from my armpits and over my pubic hair and down my legs . Holdinga five-minute pose before my ladies was harder than working in the mines . But the ladies worked steadily withp159their pads and pencils and brushes , sometimes holding a pencil up before them to dissect me , while I felt my rebelliousblack prick pounding against the walls of its dungeon , and threatening , as it seemed to my unhappy imagination , to destroy it . When it was over and I stepped down , they had achieved a noble savage who was carrying a spear and adorned with a loincloth as bland and as shapeless as their faces  --  a harmless savage , suitable for a pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Salvatore himself brought our fresh round of drinks and began setting up our table . He was a very sturdy , peaceful man , built rather like a short tree , incontestably and effortlessly the ruler of his house . Though he liked Barbara , as a patriarch he was also slightly disapproving of her ; but the fact that Jerry was Italian reassured him , for he knew that Jerry would surely regulate their situationand then they could begin to have babies . Salvatore did not take any other human possibility very seriously . There was something very wonderful which Salvatore brought to the fore in Jerry . Jerry showed a side of himself to Salvatore which he showed to no one else . I think if I had never seen Jerry with Salvatore , I would never have known what pain and love were in the boy , could not have guessed how much he had lost already , and why it was possible for Barbara really to care about him . Salvatoretreated Jerry like a son ; and this brought forward the man in Jerry . It brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in most of his daily life , disguised by rough speech and rough play . The lost and loving boy Jerry was attempting  --  helplessly  --  to divorce and deny was the only creature Salvatore saw , and it did not even occur to him to doubt the value of this creature.  |p160Salvatore  could not know it , but he thus reached directly into the heart of Jerry 's loneliness , and also foreshadowed his hard and lonely life . When I watched Salvatore and Jerry together , I was happy for Jerry but I was sad for me . For the old , sturdy man recognized Jerry , he had seen him before . He found the key to Jerry in the life he himself had lived . But he had no key for me : my life , in effect , had not yet happened in anybody 's consciousness . And I did not know why . Sometimes , alone , I fled to the Negro part of town . Sometimes I got drunk there , and a couple of times I got laid there . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italian , Jerry looking up at him with a child 's huge , limpid eyes , when Madeleine came in . And perhaps because I wished to be protected from my thoughts  --  or from Barbara and Jerry , who were my thoughts made flesh  --  I was irrationally glad to see her . She had that polished look women have when they come back from the hairdresser and she was wearing a bright orange dress  --  of which Barbara , I realized , as she gave a small , theatrical shudder , completely disapproved . " Well , " said Madeleine , with her big , good-natured grin , " are you all having a conference , or can I join you ? " " The conference ended , " I said , " when we hung up the last sign . So you can come on in the house . " " Good . " She sat down and beamed at Barbara . " How are you , sugar ? I think they 've been running the ass off you kids this week , have n't they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He abruptly ended his conversation with Jerry , glanced quickly at Madeleine , and walked away . And I realizedp161that Jerry was a little embarrassed . " Hi , " he said , with a crooked smile , " how 're things going ? " " It seems to me that they work everybody like slaves , " Barbara said . " You must be weary , too . But at least you 're doing a play . " " Am I ? " asked Madeleine , with her eyes big , and her hands in the air . " Is that what I 'm doing ? I 'm glad somebodytold me  --  I need a drink . " " What 's wrong ? " asked Barbara . " Is n't it going all right ? " " Look . I know I 'm not a big Hollywood star , like that broken-down lost weekend you 've got over at The Green Barn now  --  and is that going to be a mess , my God !  --  but I 'm a good actress and I 've worked hard and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I wo n't tell you what they 're paying me because I 'm too ashamed  --  for them  --  and I just do n't think artists should be treated like shit . Baby , if I survive this mistake , you can have The Actors ' Means Workshop , believe me . Especially that old dyke who calls herself a director , who could n't direct a kid on rollerskates across the yard . " She paused . She subsided . She looked at us and laughed . " Well . I had to tell somebody before I burst . " Giuliano came and she smiled up at him and ordered a double bourbon . " You 've got a rehearsal tomorrow morning , " Barbara said . " You 'd better be careful tonight . " " Fuck them , " said Madeleine . " Maybe I 'll get there and maybe I wo n't . Maybe I 'll walk out on them .. And let them try to find somebody else now . " " What happened ? " I asked . " Oh , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ? They do n't know what they 're doing , that'sp162what happened . That 's what 's been happening ever since I joined this bullshit outfit . " Giuliano brought her her drink and she smiled at him again . She sipped it . " Let 's not talk about it  --  at least not until I 've finished my drink and had something to eat . " She looked at me and smiled her really quite disarming smile . " One of these days , baby , " she said to me , " you 'll maybe wish you 'd stayed in the post office . " I smiled . " Or the church . But they both threw me out . " " And how 'd that happen ? " Jerry asked , grinning . " He just could n't deliver the messages , " Barbara said , and she looked at me and we all laughed . Giuliano now returned to ask us , most politely , if the lady were going to eat , and , if she were , if we wished to wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to eat , Madeleine ? " Barbara asked . " We 've just ordered the biggest pizza in the house . " " Well , may I share your pizza ? " Madeleine asked . " I need company much more than I need food . " She looked quickly from Jerry to Barbara , and then leaned forward to Barbara . " Sugar  --  I know they pay me more than they pay you  --  and I 've crashed your party  --  so please let me pick up the tab . " She looked at Jerry and then at rne . " If you wo n't let me do it , then I 'll have to go . And I do n't want to go . " Giuliano stood listening to this with a face as closed as a wall . Jerry was aware of Giuliano and Barbara was aware of Jerry . Therefore , she leaned forward and grabbed both of Madeleine 's hands , and said , " Actually , we were just waiting for someone like you to come along , Madeleine . We have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeleine threw back her head and laughed , and Barbara laughed . Giuliano smiled , and Jerry informed him , in Italian , that the pizza was now to be divided among four instead of among three . Giuliano gave Madeleinea look very different from that which his father had given her , and bowed , and walked away . But he had also thrown a look at me , a look of adolescent envy . He was sure that Madeleine was my girl  --  or , rather , my woman ; and he was sure that such a woman , though , of course , one could never marry her , must be wonderful to sleep with . Jerry , following a different route , had arrived at essentially the same point of view . " Here 's hoping your prayers will be answered , " he said , and raised his glass and winked at me . " Is Leo still saying his prayers ? " Madeleine asked . She turned to me . " I thought you were emancipated . " " I am , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning candles for me . " " Is there something , " asked Madeleine , " that you need that you do n't have ? " We all laughed . " Until I met Leo , " Madeleine said to Barbara , " I never knew that a colored person could blush . But look at Leo ! " " Oh , Leo can blush , " Barbara said gravely , " but he hates anybody to notice it . He thinks that if you know he can blush  --  just like white folks  --  you 'll think he 's just ordinary . " I protested , " I never said anything like that , and you know it . " " Leo also thinks , " said Barbara , still speaking to Madeleine , " that unless he tells you , you ca n't tell . " " Poor Leo ! " Jerry said . " Barbara 's been on his ass all afternoon . " " She 's mad at me , " I said , " about that goddamnp164scene . But I swear I do n't see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . I 've got to find out what I 'm doing . " She said nothing . She watched me . " All right , " I said , " all right . Maybe we 'll work on it after supper . Okay , princess ? " And she dropped her eyes . " What scene are you two working on ? " Madeleine asked . I told her . " We 've been working on it for a long time . But Saul 's supposed to look at it and he has n't looked at it yet  --  and  --  well , you know , I just feel like we 're going round and round in a circle . Somebody 's got to tell me something . " " Well , Saul can tell you some things , " said Madeleine . She paused and sipped her drink . " I do n't know . I used to think much more of him than I think I think right now . " She looked at Barbara , then at me . " I 'm not sure he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can any director do that ? " Barbara asked . " In the first place , " said Madeleine , " let 's face it , Saul is not a director . He 's a teacher . That 's a mighty funny breed of cat , especially in the theater . Some people think he 's a great teacher . Some people think he 's a lousy teacher . " She paused . " I do n't want to say anything to discourage either of you two lambs  --  let 's put it this way : So-and-so may be a great director for you and a lousy director for me . If a director can reach you , if you trust him , then he can probably direct you , and maybe get things out of you which nobody knew were there  --  which you did n't know were there . " She looked at me again ; I knew she was not saying all she meant ; I began to suspect that I knew what she meant . " Look . Let 's leave actors out of it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example ? For that matter , not many canp165direct Ibsen or Shaw or Shakespeare , and of that few "  --  she laughed , and took another swallow of her drink  --  " none are to be found at The Actors ' Means Workshop . " " But we do n't , mainly , " Barbara said , " play Ibsen or Shaw or Shakespeare in this country . " " Well , " said Madeleine , and threw up her hands again , " that 's why directors direct what they direct , is n't it ? It 's not their fault . But I would n't expect too much from any of them , if I were you . But I 'm talking too much . " " No , " said Barbara , " I see your point . " She looked astonishingly grave , even weary ; then , after a moment , " Ca n't we change that ? " she asked . She looked very hard at Madeleine , as though , with that look , she intended to convey to Madeleine a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeleine . She leaned forward . " Look . I 've got a daughter and she 's got to eat . You do n't think I think I 'm doing a masterpiece , do you ? No , sugar . I needed a job . It 's the lead , and I think I can make something out of the part . If I can , I 'll get better jobs . I might even appear in a couple of really good productions of really good plays . But , mainly , you take what you can get . " " You take what you can get , " Barbara said , " but , then , when you 've taken it , you can make it do what you want . " " Can you ? " asked Madeleine . There was a pause . Barbara finished her drink . " I can , " said Barbara . Giuliano came , with the pizza . " Let 's celebrate . " said Madeleine , " and have a bottle of Chianti . "  | " Baby , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're going to need another job right quick . " " I 'm going to be splendid , " she said , " in spite of Rags Roland . And Madame Lola Sans Gene . The hell with it . If I had n't run into you kids , I 'd probably have ended up in that river they 've got howling over yonder . " Giuliano began cutting up the pizza , and , while he was doing this , two young Negro laborers came into the place . I say they were young  --  they were both somewhat older than I ; than I was then . One was perhaps about thirty , chunky , dark , and cheerful . And I say laborers , but , actually , the younger , not far into his twenties , impressed me as being a soldier , for I remember that he was dressed in khaki . He was lean , light brown , long , and shy , with a narrow face . I had seen the chunky one before , on the Negro side of town , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had not known how to speak to him . But I had not seen the younger one before , and something in his manner  --  the particular manner of his diffidence  --  made me decide that he was a stranger here . I suppose I mean that the older one , the chunky , cheerful one , was accustomed to being uneasy , and sailed into it , smiling , as into the wind of his life , whereas the younger , stiff and silent , was only beginning to be aware of the chill . Here they were , here they came , and the elder , with that ready smile , and with all those lighthouse teeth , piloted the young one to a table  --  a table three tables from us . Jerry and Barbara were facing Madeleine and me ; we certainly looked like a unit . Besides , I was already notorious , because , in complete innocence , like a foreigner outrageouslyovertipping in a desperate nation , I had disruptedthe town 's emotional economy . I had not known ,  |p167after  all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with such a town , and there was absolutely no possibilitythat I could accept , much less survive , on such terms . But if it was vivid to me that they had , it was equally vivid to them that I had n't  --  either because I knew more or because I knew less ; either because I would n't or because I could n't ; either because I despised my color or because I did n't . We desperately wished to get to the root of the matter , but we did not know how to begin . Here I was , sitting with three white people  --  or , rather , with two white women . I could not leave my table and go to theirs . They could not leave their table and come to ours  --  or , rather , in this context , mine . We could not do what we wished to do , which was simply to be easy with each other . No : there we sat , under the eyes of the observant and bewildered Sicilians , studiously ignoring each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order , the lanky , lean , brown cat looking down , with his hands between his knees . For a moment , I hated all of my companions , for whom , as I supposed , nothing had happened . We were all concentrating on our pizza and our wine . " Actually , " Madeleine said abruptly , " I 'm not sure I really go for all this Actors ' Means bullshit , anyway . I mean , I 'm not sure an actor can be taught , or should be taught . " " Then how do you learn ? " I asked . I had one eye on the laborers ; I was making a certain resolution . " Leo , " she said , " I think you 'll learn more by going out and falling flat on your ass in front of five hundred people than you 'll ever learn from Saul . Believe me . " " But how , " asked Barbara , " do you get the chance to fall flat on your ass before five hundred people ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Madeleine , " the Workshoplabel helps . ' That 's because everybody else is as full of shit as they are . But , baby , that 's just politics  --  it 's a way of getting a job . " Barbara was silent . I watched the laborers . They were drinking rye and water . The darker one was laughing and talking  --  easily and slowly , even intimately , but absolutelyonstage . The light had hit him early  --  that unspeakablelight ; he would be onstage until the day he died . And the proof of his authority was that the young one , uneasily , chuckled , with his head down . " Now , " the black one was saying , " you ca n't find a better black broad than my old lady  --  you see what I mean ? She is a champ , baby . I mean , she is a champ . But even she is started to go for the jive . You see what I mean ? She want me to keep working my ass off so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked wisely at the young one , who was watching him carefully , his drink held in both hands before his face , and then turned carelessly , laughing , away , showing us all his teeth . " You make it sound pretty depressing , " Barbara said . " The truth usually is pretty depressing , Barbara , " Jerry said . " You know that . " " Yes . I know that . " She smiled . " I know a hell of a lot , really  --  but I do n't seem to understand very much . " I laughed . " Be careful , Madeleine . She 's cracking up . " " Stop teasing her . " She leaned forward and tappedBarbara lightly on the cheek . " You 're very nice . " " I think you 're very nice , too , " Barbara said . They were finishing their drinks . I gestured toGiuliano.  | " Please , " I told him , " buy the two colored cats over there a drink for me ? Just take it to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jerry and Barbaraand Madeleine looked at me . " Oh ! Here we go ! " said Madeleine . " Pretty reckless , " said Barbara , smiling , " pretty reckless . " But she seemed pleased . " Do you know them ? " " No . But I thought we might as well get to know each other . Only "  --  I said to Madeleine  --  " I might have to borrow a couple of bucks from you till I get paid . " Madeleine slapped me on the thigh . " Do n't worry about it , " she said . And her hand rested on my thigh for a second . " What made you do that ? " Jerry asked . He looked amused . " I do n't know . I just felt like it . " Giuliano brought the drinks to their table . I concentrated on my pizza . They looked bewildered for a second . Giuliano pointed to our table , and they turned and looked at us . I raised my glass of wine . Barbara and Jerry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly , had changed . If we had not broken through to each other , at least we had managed to accept each other 's presence . The boy was still very shy , but very pleased , and the older man glowed ; partly because we had helped to please his boy . " Hello , " I said . They said , " Hello . Thank you . " " Let 's have a drink together , " Madeleine said , " after we finish eating ? " The young one said , shyly , after a glance at the older one , " That 's fine with me. "  | " Only , it 's got to be on us , " said his mentor . " We 'll fight about that later , " Jerry said . We all laughed . We raised our glasses again . " Cheers ! " Perhaps my heart shook in my chest like the wings of a small bird , but I was incredibly happy not to have been rejected . I was happy enough , I realized , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began gossiping about the theater . Three tables away , they resumed their talk about women . Giuliano came up to Jerry and they had a quick conversation in Italian . Giuliano went away . Jerry looked at me . " Baby , " he said , " I have a feeling that we 're all going to be drunk  --  and broke  --  by morning . " " The hell with it , " I said . " It 's Saturday night . " Bye and bye , it was time for coffee , and our coffee came ; and then Giuliano brought up a small table and two chairs . " This is for your friends , " he said . Jerry turned , smiling , and said , " Come and join us ! " The elder , because his hesitation was the greatest , deepest , rose at once , smiling  --  like a man accustomed to rise quickly if he were to rise at all ; while the younger , because of his eagerness , seemed for a moment unwilling to rise . But here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My name is Jerry . This is Barbara "  --  and Barbarasmiled and held out her hand , and they shook hands  --  " and this is Madeleine "  --  " Hi , fellows , " said Madeleine  --  " and this is Leo . " We shook hands . " Hello , " I said . " Sit down . " " My name , " said the older one , " is Fowler . And this is my buddy , Matthew . " And they sat down . " Do you fellows live in this town ? " Madeleine asked . She had the invaluable attribute of a friendliness com/pletely uncorrupted by imagination . It meant that she could ask anything  --  it also meant , probably , that she could not hear whatever was stammered back . " I do , " said Fowler . His smile could be read as the precise barometer of his attention ; the more he smiled , the more he was watching , the more he saw . " I do n't , " said Matthew . " I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here long ? " Barbara asked . " A few days . " " And then do you go back to Philadelphia ? " Fowler and Matthew looked at each other with a brief smile . " I 'm not sure I know where I 'm going from here , " said Matthew . " None of us do , " I said . Matthew looked at me . Fowler ceased to smile ; I was not a danger . " Where are you from ? " he asked me . " I 'm from New York , " I told him . " I mean , from the city  --  Harlem . " " Then what are you doing here ? " Matthew asked me , with a shy smile . " I 'm studying , " I said , " to be an actor . " He looked a little blank  --  not hostile , merely blank . I could not imagine what he was thinking . " We 're supposed to do a couple of shows this summer . " " We 're working with The Actors ' Means Workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if you 've heard of it  --  " " No , " said Fowler , " I have n't . " " Well , since you live here , " said Madeleine , " you 've heard of The Green Barn  --  the theater up Bull Dog Road ? " " Out Bull Dog Road way ? Oh , yes , " he said , " I 've heard of The Green Barn , all right . "  | " Well , " said Barbara , " that 's where we are . We have a play opening there tomorrow night . " " And I , " said Madeleine , " am opening in a play there five nights from tomorrow night  --  would you like to come ? Just tell me how many tickets you want  --  " " And we 'll get them for you , " said Barbara . " You 'd be doing us a favor , really . That way , we 'll be sure of having at least two people in the audience . " " Thanks , sugar , " Madeleine said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to come as our guests . " Fowler and Matthew looked at each other . " Look here , " Matthew said to me , " are you going to be in this play ? " " Not this play , " I said . " We 're just students , " Barbara said . " We wo n't be in a play until  --  oh , about a month from now . " " I 'll be gone by then , " said Matthew . " What kind of play you going to be in , boy ? " Fowler asked me . He was smiling . There was a shrewd , amused speculation in his eyes . " I do n't know yet , " I said . " I 've just started . " " What made you decide you wanted to be an actor ? " " I do n't know that , either . But I guess it 's because I 'm crazy . They laughed at that  --  they really laughed . Matthew looked at me , and said , " You all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You been over to our side of town yet ? " Fowler asked me . " I 've been over at Lucy 's Place a couple of times . " " Oh ! Lucy 's ! " and he laughed . " I saw you there one night , " I said.  | " And I 'm going to tell the missus on you , " Matthew said . " You saw me there ? Why did n't you say something ? " " Well , " I said  --  lamely  --  " I did n't want to bother you . He sucked his teeth . " I 'm going to take you to my house one of these days and let my wife put some meat on your bones . You need some good down-home cooking . How much do you weigh ? " I told him . " Oh , boy , " he said , " would my wife love to get her hands on you ! " " It appears like , " Matthew said to me , " that you miss your mama 's home cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been missing it for awhile . " " Where is your mama ? " Fowler asked . " She 's in New York  --  in the city . " " And your papa ? " They were both watching me with an interest which made me uneasy ; and Barbara and Jerry and Madeleine were watching , too . " He 's with my mother , " I said . They began to react to my discomfort . They remembered that there were white people at the table . " What are you folks drinking ? " Fowler asked . " We invited you , " said Madeleine . " Oh , now , do n't you start coming on like that , " said Fowler . " I asked you what you was drinking . " " I can see you 're a hard man to fight , " Jerry said . " We 'll give you the first round . Madeleine 's drinking bourbon . What do you want , Barbara ? " " Oh  --  I do n't know  --  whiskey . With ginger ale . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew asked Madeleine.  |p174Madeleine  opened her eyes very wide , looked resentfullyaround the table , and then back to Matthew . " I 've been called a great many things in my life , " she murmured , " but I did n't expect to be called ma'am for yet awhile . " Matthew laughed helplessly . " My name , " she informed him , " is Madeleine . Have you got that ? " " All right , Madeleine , " Matthew said . " I 'm sorry . What do you want with your bourbon  --  water or ginger ale or soda  --  or  --  or beer ? " " Beer ! " Madeleine said . " First he treats me like a schoolteacher and now he treats me like a lush . " We all laughed . She turned to Matthew again . " I 'll have a little water , please . You better watch your step , Matthew . I 'm an extremely vindictive woman . " Matthew laughed again . " Well , I promise , " he said , to try not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with interest , in rather the way Giuliano had looked at her , in fact . He looked very briefly at me , and then , " Where are yolc from , Madeleine ? " he asked . " I 'm from Texas , " she said , " a town you never heard of . I 'm sure that 's what snakes me so vindictive . " " Oh , come on , " said Matthew , " I do n't believe you 're vindictive at all . You just like to try and frighten folks . " Madeleine laughed . " I do pretty well at it , too , let me tell you . " She turned to Barbara . " I scared the living shit out of Rags Roland this afternoon . " She turned to Matthewand Fowler . " Rags Roland is a horrible old woman , built exactly like an army base , and she 's the director  --  God help us all ! of the play I 'm in . " " The play , " said Barbara , " of which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Madeleine . " My first starringrole . " Matthew nodded appreciatively . " Out here withthe corn and the cows . " Matthew and Fowler laughed.  | " Anyway , " and Madeleine turned again to Barbara , " Rags was giving me hell this afternoon  --  in front of the whole company  --  about that scene near the end when I find out that my lover is n't ever coming back from that half-assed revolution in Ecuador . Part of my trouble with this play is that I 've never understood why he went in the first place  --  but I 'm not playing that part , thank God . Anyway , I finally blew my top and I asked Rags how the hell she knew what a woman felt like when she 'd lost her lover forever . And I said a few other choice things about my co-star , who could certainly never be my lover , and walked out . I left them all standing there . " She nodded . Our drinks came . Fowler and Matthew looked somewhat bewildered , and also looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " She did n't say anything . She just stood there , like  --  " " An army base , " said Fowler . Madeleine raised her glass . " Exactly ! It was a terrible thing to say . But the old dyke got my goat . " Jerry said , " You should n't call her names like that . You do n't know if she 's a dyke or not . Anyway , it 's nobody's business what a person does  --  " " That 's right , " said Matthew , staring at Jerry : he looked rather as though he had stumbled into a seminar . " What a grown person does with his life is that person 's business . " And he looked at Fowler . " Especially , " I said , " since it 's the person who pays for it . For what he does , I mean . " " That 's right , " said Fowler . He sipped his drink . " Of course , I do think that we can use each other 's advice from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at Matthew . " Are you sure , " asked Barbara , smiling , " that wep176can  --  use the advice we get ? We get so much advice . You know . I 'm not sure that I can use  --  any of the advice Iget . " I looked at her . " Do you get so much advice ? " " Oh ! All the time . By phone , by wire , by pony express . Oh , yes , my dear . Everyone 's anxious to give me advice . " She looked back to Fowler . " But I ca n't use it . " " She 's like me , " said Matthew . " Why ca n't you use it ? " Fowler asked . " Well , it 's wonderful advice  --  for somebody else . And it 's well meant . I mean , I know that . But it does n't "  --  she stared helplessly at Matthew  --  " seem to have anything to do with  --  me . " " What do you mean , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " Barbara said  --  there was a silence " for example , I 'm from Kentucky . Well , if I 'd taken all the advice I was given , Leo and I could n't be friends and I would n't be able to sit at this table . I 'd be just another dried out or drying out  --  Southern belle , looking for a rich husband . " Belatedly , she laughed . " Do you see what I mean ? " she asked Fowler . " Yeah , " said Fowler  --  he was very thoughtful " I see what you mean , all right . " " That terrible round of parties and bridge , " said Barbara . " Really terrible . And the necking in the woods or in the car or on the porch . Really . Awful ! And you 're really expected to marry one of them . After you 've done just about everything that can be done , short "  --  she coughed  --  " of actually going to bed with "  --  she laughed  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Who can take that advice ? " " You 're quite a girl , " Fowler said.  | " Oh ! " said Barbara . " I just want to live ! " " Tell me , " said Matthew quickly , " do you find it hard to live ? I mean "  --  he was very earnest ; Fowler watched him with a smile  --  " really to live ? Not just "  --  he waved his big hands nervously  --  " to go to the job and come home and go to sleep and get up and eat and go back to the job  --  but  --  to live . " His hands reached out , his fingers clutched the air . His hands fell to the table , flat , palms downward ; and he looked , for a moment , at his hands . Then he looked at Barbara . " You know ? " " Yes , " she said . " And it do n't have nothing to do , do it , " Fowler asked  --  " pardon me , young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , with being white or black ? " " No , " said Barbara . Then , after a moment , " Not reallv . " Fowler gestured toward Matthew . " You hear her , " he said . " Oh , " said Barbara quickly , " I ca n't speak for him . I can barely speak for myself . " She stirred her drink , looking down again . " I do n't know enough , " she said , " about anything . " " Well , " said Fowler , " you seem to be learning pretty fast . " " You 've got to learn fast , " said Matthew , " this day and age , if you going to learn at all . " " Well , that 's true , " said Fowler . " That 's what I been trying to tell you . " Matthew sighed . He looked at me . " Look here , " he said , " are you in the Army ? " " No , " I said . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go ? " I finished my drink . " Hell , no . You must be joking.  |p178I  'd rather drop dead than fight for this miserable coun- try . What have I got to fight for ? " Matthew smiled faintly , though he also looked a little shocked . " You got a point , boy . I ca n't deny it . " Fowler was indignant . " You both too young to know what you talking about , " he said , with finality . " If you 'd been around as long as I 've been around , you 'd know what you got to fight for . " He turned to Barbara , as though he had decided that she was the most sensible one . " Matthew 's got a great opportunity to go in the Army , and they 'll send him to school so he can make something of himself when he comes out  --  but he do n't want to go . He wants to join the Merchant Marine instead . " He looked at Matthew with a furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine . " " Matthew 's got to do what Matthew thinks is best , " Barbara said gently . " We all do , " I said . And Matthew and I looked at each other a moment , as though we were really brothers . " I just do n't see myself in the Army , " Matthew said stubbornly . " Get sent to some damn base in the Deep South  --  you know I ai n't for that . I ai n't about to take no crap off them rednecks . No , I ca n't do it . " " I think I know how you feel , " said Madeleine . " I think I do , " said Barbara . " I do n't think I could stand it if I was a man . " " Young lady , " said Fowler  --  Jerry signaled to Giulianoto bring us another round  --  " sometimes a man have to stand a whole lot of things he do n't want to stand . Take me . I got three children . I ai n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't crazy about my job . Sometimethat man get on my back like white on rice and call me all out of my name , and everything  --  now , what am Ip179going to do ? I got to feed my kids . They do n't want to hear nothing about me being a man . They want some food in their little stomachs . " He looked at Matthew again . " And Matthew , he got a chance to make something of himself so he wo n't have to work on the kind of jobs I have to work  --  and he too dumb to take it . I declare . " And he picked up his drink and finished it . " Look here , " Matthew said , " you keep talking about this fine job I 'm going to get when I come out the Army . How many  --  how many colored folks you know got fine jobs , huh ? Tell me . " He waited . " Oh , come on , " Fowler said , " things is changing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him . " " Fowler , " said Matthew , " I do n't believe the white man 's promises no more , you hear me ? I do n't believe them . " He spoke very quickly and nervously , almost stammering . Then he looked up . " Excuse me , folks . I ai n't talking about none of you , you understand . But I 'm sure , you being intelligent people and all , you know pretty well what the score is , right ? " " Hell , yes , " said Jerry , looking down , looking sad and sullen , " we know the score , all right . " Giuliano arrived with a new round of drinks . We watched him pick up empty glasses and put full ones down , in a sudden , unhappy silence . Madeleine reached for my hand , and held it for a moment . " Hell , " said Barbara suddenly , raising her glass , " let 's drink to the glorious land of the free . " " And the former home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We drank . " You 're going to freeze your ass off , " Fowler said , " on that North Atlantic . " " Well , I 'd a hell of a lot rather do that , " said Matthew , " than get it burned off in Georgia . "  |p180We  laughed . " I 'm with you , " I said to Matthew . " And that 's all right with me , " he said , and grinned . We had a couple more rounds , and we all exchanged addresses , earnestly scribbling on scraps of paper brought to us by Giuliano . I think we all really wished to see each other again , but I think we also wondered if we really would  --  wondered , dimly , if there could really be any point to it . Furthermore , I was aware that I had not really given any address . I had no address . Paradise Alley was not my address , Bull Dog Road was not my address , and where my mother and father were living was n't my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down . I very much doubted whether Fowler 's wife , when confronted with the opportunity of putting flesh on my bones , would react with a positive glee . I suspected that Fowler and I might prove to have very little to say to each other . Matthewand I might have been another matter , but Matthewwas leaving within the week . As for the others , Barbara , Jerry , and Madeleine , they were white . They really could not hang out with Fowler , and Fowler could not hang out with them . It was not that the price was high . I do n't think they thought of the price , though , indeed , the price would have been highest for Fowler : but connectionswilled into existence can never become organic . Yet  --  we all liked each other well enough . We felt dimly lost and baffled as we finally rose to take our leave . By this time it was nearly midnight , and we were just about the last people in the place . As soon as we left , Salvatore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinball machine , and Salvatore and his tribe would lock up and go to bed . I did not feel like going to bed at all . I scarcely knew what I felt like doing , but I did n't want the night to end . It was a marvelousp181night , blue-black , with a crescent moon , the air was fine and soft . It was unbelievably silent . There was not a soul on the streets . " This is one hell of a wide-open town , " Matthew said . He was a little drunk . " Oh , there 's a whole lot happening in this town , " Fowler said . " You just got to know where to find it . " " Well , if you know where to find it , " said Matthew , " take me there . " I almost suggested that we have a nightcap on the other side of town , but then I hesitated . Only Fowler could make this suggestion , for only Fowler could take us there . I could not say , Take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was with . It was the presence of Madeleine which was most inhibiting , for I did not know what  --  if anything  --  she wanted from me , and I did not know if I really wanted anything at all from her . Fowler and Matthew , Barbara and Jerry , and Madeleine and I , walked in twos together down the slumbering street . If Madeleine had not been there , I would have driven Barbara and Jerry home , and then driven back to meet Matthew and Fowler on the Negro side of town . Madeleine held my hand loosely , and we walked very slowly . " A penny for your thoughts , " she said . " Oh . They 're not worth a penny . I was just  --  thinking  --  of  --  of some people I used to know . " " So was I. " Then , " That Matthew 's a nice kid . " " Yes . Very nice . " We walked in silence . I heard Fowler and Jerry laugh . " But where , " asked Madeleine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car ? " " Behind us . I guess we 're just taking a walk . "  | " Well . It 's a nice night for walking , " Madeleine said , and it seemed to me that she held my hand a little tighter . We reached a kind of lookout point , above the river . Straight before us was a stone wall ; between us and the wall , road signs ; the road to New York City was on the right , the road to New England was on the left . The road was very wide , and , on the far side of the road was a large space , for motorists who wished to rest , or possibly picnic , or simply look at the river . We crossed the road and stood in silence at the wall , looking down at the river . The river was black , with a thin coating of silver . Tonight it seemed still , yet it was moving . The sound of this movement , which made me think of pebbles being overturned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled all the night air and seemed very far away . " Did you grow up in this town ? " I asked Fowler . " That 's right , " he said peacefully , " this is my town . " " Do your folks come from here ? " " No , my folks is from the South . " He lit a cigarette , leaning on the wall , and threw the match into the void . " Where your folks from ? " " My daddy 's from Barbados , " I said . " And your mama ? " " Louisiana . " We leaned on the wall , looking at the river . Jerry had his arm around Barbara , who was very still . Her profile looked childlike and defenseless under the crescent moon . Madeleine 's hand in mine felt wet . I felt a sudden fear , as present as the running of the river , as nameless and as deep . " Fowler , " said Matthew carefully , " look here . If you ai n't too tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere ? "  | " We might , " said Fowler , looking at the water . " You got any idea where ? " " Yeah . I know where . " He turned to Barbara . " You folks tired , or you want to have a drink with us ? " Barbara looked at him . Her eyes were so bright that I thought for a moment that there were tears in her eyes . But she was smiling , and the moonlight made her more beautiful than she had ever seemed to me before . " Of course , " she said , " we 'd love to have a drink with you . Even though it means "  --  and she smiled at me  --  " that we wo n't get any work done tomorrow . " " Tomorrow 's Sunday , " Matthew said . " Not in the theater , " Barbara said . She took Jerry 's arm , and Fowler 's arm . She smiled up at Fowler . " Will you lead the way ? Kind sir ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turned from the wall and the river and we crossed the road again , Fowler , Barbara , and Jerry arm in arm , and Matthew , Madeleine , and me . The other side of town , at this hour , was only about a five-minute drive away . Fowler insisted , once he had seen our jalopy , that we all go together in his car , which was an enormous Ford station wagon . We were not pleased by this , it seemed impractical for Fowler to drive us back to our car ; but we had already gone too far to turn back and we did not dare to speculate on the reasons for Fowler 's vehemence . We piled into Fowler 's car , Fowler , Jerry , and Barbara in front , Matthew , Madeleine , and I behind . and crossed the sleeping town . I have crossed many a frontier since then , have had my passport stamped , say , at the French-Swiss border , at the Swiss-Italian border ; and I am beginning to believe that a landscape is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people who live in it certainly this is what one is watching as one crosses their forests and plains , vineyards and mountains , cities , tunnels , towns . French towns are mostly hideous , all French trees are mercilessly cropped , with a view , presumably , to thelandscape , the larger vision  --  in the way French poodles operate as accessories to the wardrobes of their owners . There is absolutely no nonsense about it , whatever does not fit in is out , down to the merest flickering flower , the puniest , struggling branch . I suppose the French impose such a violent topographical order in order to compensate for an extreme untidiness , indeed , disorder , which the nature of their history  --  their passion  --  does not allow them to attack in any other way . The man at the frontier has cigarette ashes all up and down his uniform , and a cigarette is established between his lips . He has not the remotest interest in the voyager , or his passport : he forces , himself to squint at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Sometimes he stamps the passport ; sometimes one has to ask him to stamp it . His office , , were it not in France , would remind one of nothingso much as a cell in purgatory ; and he and confreres seem to feel that they are serving a sentence which they probably , after all , deserve . Within seconds , the time it takes to cross a small backyard , one has left this outpost , the last witness to this indisputably dour and extraordinarily interesting people , and one is facing the applefaced Swiss . Their quarters are impeccable , as are their uniforms . The Swiss do not smoke their cigarettes , but leave , - ' them quietly burning in one of their millions of ashtrays . Their uniforms are ironed every morning and laundered every night ; and the man within the uniformp185would find himself in something much worse than purgatoryif he Nvere not laundered and ironed , too . He examineseverything very carefully , passport , luggage , voyager ; causes one to think of the dirty socks and shorts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly active intestines ; is unspeakably polite , as patient as a ferret , as distrustful as a thief ; and when one has escaped the Swiss correctness , one feels that one is being pursued  --  they are hoping to delude you into leading them to your accomplice . And then , abruptly , one is at the Italian frontier . They seem extremely surprised , but , on the whole , delighted , that you decided to drop by . Between extravagantoffers of extravagant dinners , and impassioned questions as to what drove you from your part of the world , they are perfectly willing to glance at your passport and stamp it on any random page . They swear eternal brotherhood , and so you pass out of their offices and out of their lives . The French landscape is cerebral , this being the form that the French passion deludes itself into taking . The Swiss landscape is ordered , nothing could be more remote from passion  --  people who can not make love make money  --  and it is designed to advertise one of the most flagrantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ragged , wild , unpredictable , like the landscape of Spain , the landscape of Africa . And something in me answers to such a landscape . Somethingin me is caught and held and solaced . I am profoundlyrepelled by the smug angularities of northern Europe , the cold sky and the spiteful lips of New England . A day may come , but not for me , when the AmericanSouth will be habitable . Till then  --  well , I am wandering . But I was about to say that , however dramatic thep186frontiers I have mentioned , the most dramatic , the most appalling , remains that invisible frontier which divides American towns , white from black . We drove through the sleeping town , mostly in silencenow , our thoughts more than ever flesh . Barbara 's head was on Jerry 's shoulder , Madeleine had her hand in mine , Fowler whistled as he drove , Matthew 's thigh was against my thigh . Perhaps for the first time , certainly not for the last , I had a sudden , frightening apprehension of the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arbitrary series of groupings and regroupings , like the figures  --  if one can call them figures  --  in a kaleidoscope . I think we all felt this , in our different fashions . Barbara hid her head in Jerry 's warm and gentle shadow . Fowler whistled , Matthew hummed , shifting his weight from time to time , Madeleine held my hand . I was very grateful for her hand . As the car rushed through the darkness , I felt myself being hurtled into some crucial confrontation ; with Madeleine ; or with Matthew ; or with my past . We were approaching a bridge which spanned a narrow creek . On the other side of this bridge lived the dark people to whom I belonged . Matthew moved , and touched me , and I wondered what was in his mind . Then I wondered what was in my mind . I held on to Madeleine  --  but I was terribly aware of her color ; for the first time , or so , at least , I wished to think . The car rushed forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkingand talking , began to populate the landscape . The streets narrowed , the houses clustered , the music became louder . Children erupted , like beautiful , doomed flowers . They were on porches , playing jacks , a light behind their heads , two boys were rolling around in their yard , a couple of boys and girls were singing . I felt myself in thep187middle of a turning wheel . It felt like that , as one might feel at a circus , with all its shifting , multicolored , terrifyinglights , and with all that sound ; or as one might feel walking on the tightrope , with all the lights and sounds and people , mortally , hideously , unbelievably beneath ; everything depending on what one was able to achieve of balance . Lord , I wondered  --  wondered : and Matthew , with one great hand , lightly touched the back of my neck , Madeleine 's hand tightened , and Jerry lowered his head to Barbara 's . The car sped into the impasse created by a bar on the right hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff above the terrifying river directly before us . Fowler turned the car around , and we parked before Lucy 's Place . We had crossed from death into what certainly sounded like life . And not only did it sound like life , it looked like life ; and not only did it look like life , it looked like a particular life , a life which was a particular reproach to me . I saw , with a peculiar shock , the root of the despicable and tenacious American folkloreconcerning the happy , prancing niggers . Some of these people were moving , indeed , and the jukebox was loud ; their movements followed the music which their movements had produced ; but prancing scarcely fairly described their uses of their vigor . Only someone who no longer had any sense of what constituted happiness could ever have confounded happiness with this rage . Yet , the scene we entered had been tirelessly reproduced , in stale and meticulous , absolutely libelous detail , in countless musical comedies and innumerable pork-chop-in-the-sky films : the nigger , moving in uncanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet working , all flashing teeth and eyes , without a care in the world . It was my own uneasiness as we entered which afforded me my key to the domesticp188fantasy . The music was loud and aggressive . If it held the heat of love , it equally held the heat of fury , and it could not be described as friendly . Passion is not friendly . It is arrogant , superbly contemptuous of all that is not itself , and , as the very definition of passion implies the impulse to freedom , it has a mighty , intimidating power . It containsa challenge . It contains an unspeakable hope . It contains a comment on all human beings , and the commentis not flattering . How logical , then , that those who had been saved by those exquisite qualities With which they had invested the fact of their color and the accidents of their history , should , immediately , inevitably , and helplessly , regard the passion of their servitors as proof that their servitors were less than human and deserved the sentence meted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased . " God , what I would n't give to dance like that , " Madeleine muttered  --  but the history which produced one can not be given away : so I told myself as we entered , as I saw the faces change , heard Fowler 's much too hearty , " Brought some friends by to see you , " and forced myself not to let go Madeleine 's hand . Some of the women looked at me With a terrible contempt . Some of the men looked at me as though I were a fool , but , just possibly  --  looking at Madeleine with a cool , speculative , lewd contempt  --  a lucky fool . Their eyes said they would n't mind , maybe , taking my place in Madeleine 's bed , oh , maybe , four or five times . I knew that some of them would n't scruple to suggest this . If a white woman would sleep with one black man , then , obviously , she had no self-respect , and would sleep with an entire black regiment . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how hideous it is to be always in a false position . I was hurt for Madeleine , andp189bewildered  --  and I was glad that I had not come in holding Barbara 's hand  --  but I was hurt for them , too . It seemed to me that their swift estimate of Madeleine revealedtheir estimate of themselves , and this revealed estimatefrightened me as being , perhaps , after all , at bottom , my own . But  --  they saw what they saw . They saw themselves as others had seen them . They had been formed by the images made of them by those who had had the deepest necessity to despise them . The bitterly contemptuoususes to which they had been put by others was the beginning of their history , the key to their lives , and the very cornerstone of their identities : exactly like those who had first maligned them , they saw what their history had taught them to see . I did not know then , and I do not know now if one ever sees more than that . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to read one 's history and resolved to step out of the book . Piloted by Fowler , watched ironically by the bartender , threading our way through the dancers , we arrived at a table in the back . " Well , " said Matthew , " look at us ! " And he grinned , and I realized that he knew more than I had thought he knew . He was no one to play with  --  as the dark lady makingit over to our table would have been the first to observe . " Here 's Miss Lucy , " Fowler said , and Jerry rose at once , and I rose . " Sit down , " said Miss Lucy  --  she had a voice like a man  --  and she did n't shake my hand , she rubbed her hand over my head . " Fowler , does this boy 's mama know he 's out ? And out with yore ? Sit down , " she said to Jerry , " make yourself at home . Good evening , you young ladies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by here this time of evening , Fowler ? I thought you was a respectable , church-going man . And you know tomorrow 's Sunday . " " We 're strangers in town , ma'am , " Matthew said , and old Fowler was kind enough to do us a favor and show us that his town was n't dead , like I was beginning to think . He said all the life in the town Was right here . " Miss Lucy laughed . " Fowler 's full of the devil . You liable to get yourself in trouble , hanging out with Fowler . " " But it appears like he was right this time , ma'am , " Matthew said . " Oh , this ai n't nothing but a little friendly place , " said Miss Lucy , proudly . " Everybody 's welcome here . All the time . " " These here young ladies , " Fowler said , " they both in that theater come to town  --  " " The Green Barn , " said Madeleine . " We 're actresses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Fowler , indicating me. " he 's with the theater , too . " " He 's an actor , " Barbara said . " I hope , " I said . A brief , uneasy silence fell before Miss Lucy recovered . " Well . The Green Barn . I 've heard of it  --  " " Out Bull Dog Road way , " Fowler said . " Oh , yes ! Out Bull Dog Road . I 've heard of it . My , that 's real nice , " she said , and smiled again . " You folks going to be with us long ? " " Till the end of the summer , " Madeleine said . " Well , I sure hope you wo n't let yourselves be no strangers here , " said Miss Lucy . " You welcome any time . Where you from ? " she asked me.  | " I 'm from Harlem , " I said . " Oh , you a Harlem boy ! I used to go to Harlem a whole lot . But , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . " Where you from in Harlem ? " I told her . " I used to have folks lived around there . " She looked at me with a quick , speculative interest . " But that was before you was born . " She turned to Fowler . " Fowler , let me offer you and your friends a round . What you folks drinking ? " " Will you sit with us , Miss Lucy ? " Fowler asked . " Sure , " said Miss Lucy , " I 'll come back just as soon as I tend to a couple of folks . Let me just send Andy over . He 'll take real good care of you . You all have a good time , now , " and she smiled again , and left us . I watched her talking to the bartender , who nodded several times , not looking in our direction . Then she was very cheerful and proud with several other people , who glanced in our directiononce or twice : it was established that the form our madness took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , even , not impossibly , charming . We were there for a long time , and we got quite drunk . Barbara and Jerry danced . Barbara and Matthew danced . Fowler danced with Madeleine . I was afraid to dance . This realization came as a shock , for I had never been afraid to dance before . But I had never danced with a white woman . In that youth , so swiftly receding , vanishingbehind me , I had only danced with black girls ; and we danced among the dancers and we had , in effect , no audience . But now there was an audience , a black audiencewatching a black boy dancing with a white woman ; and they would know , from the dance , whether the woman was really his or not . I had no woman , I had onlyp192had adventures  --  though I must confess that I have never , in the sexual context , arrived at an understanding of the meaning of this word . They were not adventures at all , at least not if one supposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , predictable , and Joyless , as laconic as a thermometer . I was very , very frightened , and because I was frightened , I forced myself to stand up and dance with Barbara . I knew that I could never dance with Madeleine . " Bravo , " said Matthew . And I led Barbara onto the floor . It was a slow dance , for I did not feel exuberant . She was very soft and small in my arms . I felt very strange  --  quite peaceful in one way ; quite disturbed in another . Barbara 's hand was very light on my back , her hand in mine was warm and dry , she held me with an unexpected , a surprising intensity . I do n't know anything about the way we are put together , how long , in what secrecy , a moment prepares itself , or according to what law it suddenly comes into the light , so that one is standing , abruptly , trembling , face to face with the unimaginable . I do n't think that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was now , and I felt that she was aware of mine . I thought , at once , guiltily , of Jerry ; perhaps Barbara had also been thinking of Jerry ; and I had a sudden , bewildering sense of Barbara as being trapped . I turned my mind away from this too bleak confusion . I became dreadfully uncomfortable , thinking of Jerry and Matthew and all the black people watching : it was almost as though we were making love in public . And yet  --  how can I explain this ?  --  this profound discomfort did not really disturb my peace . I knew I could not move out of Barbara 's arms . Then I was horrified to remember that I was wearing no underwear , and my member , withp193no warning , with uncontrollable speed , raged and thickenedagainst the cloth of my jeans . Barbara had to feel it , but her face gave no sign ; and I  --  poor me !  --  had no choice but to keep the rude witness hidden against her body . It was horrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without realizing I was doing so , I pressed Barbara closer . Sweat broke out on my forehead , at the hairline . I wanted the dance never to end . I wanted the dance to end at once . How would I ever be able to get across the dance floor ? I tried to move as little as possible , but this made matters worse . I cursed myself . Then I maneuveredus closer to our table , and thanked God that the lights were dim . Yet , beneath it all , I felt a curious peace . At last the record ended . In a grave and decorous silence we walked back to our table and I slipped quickly into my seat . We were silent . Something of the greatest importancehad happened to us . Everyone seemed perfectly at ease . Matthew was involved in a joking flirtation with a rather pretty girl at the next table , who was sitting with two couples . He was quite drunk now , but very cheerful , and it seemed to me that he had certainly scored with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fowler was watching him with a kind of amused and lofty affection . Barbara sat down next to Jerry , her face still and closed ; I thought there was a certain fear in her face . She said , " Jerry , I really think it 's time we started home . " I did n't want to go home to my empty room , with the two of them together downstairs . I grabbed Madeleine 's hand again . " Any time you ready , " Fowler said , " I 'll be happy to drive you back to your car . " " I think we might as well be going now , " Jerry said.  | " You folks thinking of leaving now ? " Matthew asked . " The evening 's just getting started . " " It 's just getting started for you , " said Jerry . Barbara rose . " It 's been a fine night . Thanks for bringing us here . " " Well , it sure was my pleasure , " Matthew said , " and we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all shook hands . " You fixing to stay here ? " Fowler asked . " I 'll stay here till you bring the car back , Fowler . You know I ca n't just tear myself away from this charming young lady just like that . " He grinned and winked at me . " Look here , " he said , " I 'm going to give you a call up at your theater in a couple of days . We 'll have us a couple of drinks together before I cut out of here . " " Good luck on the North Atlantic , " Madeleine said . " Thank you  --  Madeleine . You see , I remembered that time . " And we laughed . " Be good , " I told him . " You too . Bye-bye now . " We walked slowly to the door . " Bye-bye , " shouted Miss Lucy . " Do n't you all be no strangers now , you hear ? " We told her that we would n't be strangers , and we stepped outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat in the back , and I put my arm around her . And , looking at her very hard , emboldened perhaps by the whiskey and the fear of my white-washed room , I asked her , " Can I come up and have a nightcap at your place ? " She paused for a moment . She said , " All right . That might be nice . " I asked Fowler to make a slight detour , so we couldp195let Madeleine off before going back to our car . When we reached Madeleine 's house , Madeleine and I stepped out and I gave Jerry the car keys . " I 'm going to have a drink with Madeleine , " I said . " I 'll see you all later . Bye-bye , Fowler , and thank you . I 'll see you soon . Good-night , Barbara . " She looked slightly stunned , but she smiled and said , " Good-night , Leo . Good-night , Madeleine . " " Good-night , kids . See you all tomorrow . " " I 'll fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One night at my house . Before Matthew goes . " " Okay . Good-night . " " Good-night . " And they drove off down the dark street , leaving everything empty . Now , I was really frightened , though , now it was too late . What would people say if they saw me coming out of Madeleine 's house in the morning ? We were crazy , both of us . But Madeleine already had keys out , there was no one , anyone , to see us go in . I took the keys and opened the door and we climbed in silence to the third floor . Still in silence we entered Madeleine 's apartment and she turned on the light . " Well ! " said Madeleine . She was smiling . " Do you think we shocked anybody ? " " I think we shocked Fowler . " " Do you think it matters ? " " No . I do n't think it matters . " We walked into the living room . " But we may , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , no , " I said . " Barbara 's not like that . " I turned from her and walked about the room . " You 've got a veryp196nice place here . " It was pleasant enough . She had big , curtained windows , the bedroom was on the right , and the john and the kitchen were behind me . " Oh , it 's all right , " she said . " But those windows just open on that awful street  --  but from the kitchen you can see a little bit of the river . Is n't that silly ? " " All these towns have their ass in the river , " I said . " Come look . " I walked into the kitchen and we stood beside the window . And it was true  --  through the interstices formed by other buildings and mighty poles and wires and the dull gleam of the railroad tracks , one made out the river . It caught the light differently ; or it threw back another light . And if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did , one could hear it , faint and steady , rolling along . For a second , I listened to Madeleine 's breathing , which was faint , but not very steady . I did n't know what role she wanted me to play with her , and for the moment I was just stalling , being a kind of bebop kid . " Put something on the record player , " she said , " and I 'll make that drink . " " Right . " I walked back into the living room . " What do you want to hear ? " " Anything you want to hear . But keep it very low . " " That 's right . We certainly do n't want the neighbors barging in here tonight . " She laughed . " No . I do n't want to be sent back to the convent . " I could n't guess what she wanted to hear , she did n't have anything I particularly Wanted to hear , and so I put on something very easy , maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sure of myself , probably because I was not alone in my room . I sat down on the sofa . Onp197the table next to the sofa , tinder the lamp , was a picture of a little girl with long hair , standing near a white fence . Her head was up , and she was laughing . " That 's my daughter , " Madeleine said . She came in with the drinks and sat down on the sofa beside me . She put the drinks , with coasters and napkins , on the coffee table . " She was only six then . " " She looks like a nice little girl . " I put the picture down . " How old is she now ? " " Eight . " " What 's her name ? " " Audrey . She 's my pride and joy . She makes my life worth living . " I looked at her . " Good for you . " I picked up my drink . " Here 's to a life worth living . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the music . I put my glass down . I pulled her blond head onto my shoulder . " You 're not drinking , " she said , after a moment . Some instinct made me do exactly what she wanted me to do . I looked at her , I changed my position , and I put my head in her lap . She looked down at me , smiling . Her breasts seemed very big . I put my hand on one of them , really rather like a kid playing doctor , but also aware that a strange and mighty storm was rising in me . I was aware that the storm had really nothing to do with Madeleine , except that she was in the path . " You 're a strange boy , " she said . " Why ? Why am I a strange boy ? " She took , very deliberately , a sip of her drink . My hand stroked one breast . Part of me felt , Leo , you 're nothing but a goddamn sex-fiend and you 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alive . If this broadp198could read your mind and know what a freak you are , your ass would be in the river , your head would be on a pike , and your cock and . balls would be nailed to the courthouse door . And I thought , Fuck it . I want to see how much of a freak she is . She 's come this far , let 's see how far she 'll go . I began fumbling with the buttons of her blouse . She put her drink down , and , as she leaned over to do this , I put one hand inside her blouse . " Tell me . Why am I a funny boy ? What 's funny about me ? " She was silent . I said , " Maybe you better tell me later . " Then  --  we fooled around . I worked with my lips and my tongue and my fingers , she was n't working much yet , but she would ; we fooled around . I ca n't say what was driving me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body could be despised , how much it could be despised ; perhaps I had to know how much was demanded of my body to make the shameful sentence valid ; or to invalidatethe sentence . I got her nearly naked on that sofa , shoes and stockings off , dress half on , half off , panties and bra on the floor . I was striding through a meadow , and it certainly felt like mine . She shook and whimpered and caressed me and I did not recognize her anymore . I wondered if she recognized me , if we mattered now at all to each other . A terrible bafflement began in me . The bafflement , causing a drop in my ferocity , raised the level of my need . I did not want to watch her anymore , I was afraid of what I would see ; I was afraid of what I had wanted , and still wanted , to see . I did not want to watch myself anymore either . I wanted to be held and cleansed and emptied . I stroked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to cry . And though she was still now , and I was in the dark , our touch had more meaning  --  at least ,  |p199our  touch was more friendly . Then I opened my eyes and looked at her , her clothes half off , and all the white flesh waiting , and I wondered if she , while I had been tramplingthrough a meadow , had been crawling through a jungle , dreading the hot breath and awaiting the great stroke of King Kong . She was nearly naked , but I was still dressed . I pulled my shirt over my head . She opened her eyes . " Let 's take off these clothes , " I said , " and go to bed  --  like civilized people . " She smiled , " Are we civilized ? " " Hell , no . But come on and take me to your big brass bed . " I watched her . " And give me some head . " She struggled up on one elbow . " Help me get this silly dress off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and stepped out of her dress . Then she looked at me , quite helplessly , with a smile . I took her hand and led her to the bedroom . She pulled down the covers . I took off my jeans . She said , " Just a moment  --  I 'll be right back . " I pulled her into my arms and kissed her . She pressed against me , then she pulled away . " Just a minute , " she said , pleading , and she went into the john . I fell into bed and lay on my back , frightened and evil , patiently waiting , immense and heavy and curdled with love . I woke up suddenly , out of a sleep like drowning . In my sleep , I had traveled back to Harlem , and I was curled up against Caleb , in our narrow bed . Caleb 's chest was hot and heavy , I was soaking with his sweat and chokingwith his odor . Our mother 's voice rang over us hike the thunder of a church bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I struggled against Caleb 's weight . I turned and struggled , turned and struggled . I woke up . I could not have been sleeping long , for there was no light in the sky . Madeleine 's head was on my chest . She snored very lightly , and drooled a little bit . Her weight was intolerable , and I hated it . I was terribly , terribly afraid . I knew that something awful was going to happen . And there was nothing I could do and there was no place to run . Here I was , in this white cunt 's bed ; here I was , ready for the slaughter ; here I was , 1 , Judas , with a stiffening prick and a windy heart , lost , doomed , terrified , alone . The air whispered , or I whispered , my brother'sname . But nothing , now , forever , could rescue my brother , or me . I moved from beneath Madeleine 's weight as gently as I could , and went into the bathroom and took a piss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water as hard as I could . The needles of the water hit me like Saint Sebastian 's arrows . I wrapped myself up in one of Madeleine 's enormous towels , found a cigarette and lit it , and recovered my stale drink and sat down before the kitchen window . Leo . You are more than nineteen years old . What the fuck do you think you 're doing , with your life ? I listened to the river ; but I saw my mother 's face . I sipped my drink . My abandoned mother . My abandoned father . Their lost sons . This was Saturday night . They would be asleep now on the top floor of the tenement , in their bedroom , which was their only room . The rest of their apartment was rented out . The room which would have been Caleb 's Was occupied by a junkie and his girlfriend . The room which would have been mine was filled with all that was left of an old elevator operator , he , too ,  |p201abandoned  by all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom and the living room  --  and that was all there was to the apartment , which was like Miss Mildred 's apartment , except that it was smaller . We moved there while Caleb was away . Caleb had never lived there ; and I did not live there long . My father would have been drunk , but quietly drunk ; his rages were ended ; he lived only to sleep . His lips were narrower , his face was thinner , the big eyes were dulled with the heat of his life , but all the fire was gone . My father was a porter in the garment center . My mother spent all day sewing in the same neighborhood , but not for the same firm . In any case , their hours were different . My mother left work before my father did , and hurried home to cook for him . To do this , she had , first , every day , to conquer the filth of the kitchen  --  for a kitchen used by strangers is always filthy  --  and do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was always weary , and her hair was almost always knotted on the top of her head . But , sometimes , on Saturday nights , she accompanied my father to a bar in the neighborhood and they laughed and gossiped with the people there . This was to prevent my father from becoming melancholy mad : he drowned in his sorrow when he drank alone . And when she went out with him , she alwaystook care to look her best , and she wore her danglingearrings . But she was wondering , as he was wondering , Lord , where can my children be tonight ? They were wondering how it had happened that their lives had come to a full stop so soon . They were close to death , and yet it was as though they had never lived . " It would have been better if you 'd never lived , " said Caleb , " because then I would n't be here , neither . I didn'tp202want this life , this hell , this hell ! Why did you give it to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a little past fourteen . He had been home a week . We were all standing in the kitchen ; and Caleb was very drunk . He and our father had got drunk together . But our father was not drunk now . We had all been , like a family , to a Saturday night function at the Renaissance , on Seventh Avenue . And Caleb and our father had spent more and more time at the bar , talking together . Caleb had begun to weep . And then we left . He was thinner , much thinner , but harder and tougher . He was beautiful , with a very dangerous , cruel , and ruthless beauty . He had been home a week , but he and I had found it hard to talk  --  he did not want to tell me what his time away had been like . But I knew what it had been like from the way he flinched whenever my breath touched the open wound , from the distance between us , as though he were saying , Do n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caleb , " said our mother  --  she was still in her green evening gown ; her earrings caught the light ; there were combs in her splendid hair  --  " do n't try to hurt your father . We did the best we could . We love you . " " We did n't ask to come here , neither , " our father said . " We hoped it would be better , " said our mother , " for you , than it was for us . " " You were wrong , " said Caleb . " It 's worse . " But then he relented ; he had to relent ; tears stood in his eyes . " I was n't trying to hurt my father . " He looked down . " I love my father . " " Then tell him so , " said our mother. p 203Caleb looked at our father . " I 'm telling you so , " he said . " Do n't you love your mother , too ? " she asked , smiling . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He looked at me and his face changed . He smiled again , and he pulled me to him . " Yes . Oh , yes . I love my brother . " Then : " But I have n't been able to help him much . " " I do n't mind , " I said . " I 'll love you all my life . And I 'll help you . I swear it . You 'll see . " " Old man , " said Caleb , holding me by the neck , " let 's have a drink  --  a loving cup . " He looked at our mother . " All right ? " Then he looked down at me . " Give us a kiss , " he said . I kissed him . " That 's better , " said our mother . " You all sit down and I 'll pour the drinks . " And she glittered , jangled , swept , out of the room . Caleb , our father , and I uneasily sat down . Caleb put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daddy , I know it 's not your fault . But you do n't know what they do to you , baby , once they got you . " " Man , " said our father , " they doing it to me . " Caleb looked down at me . " And they doing it to little Leo . Ai n't that the truth , Leo ? " He stared at me . He turned away . He took his hand away . " Do n't tell me . I know . " " They 're not , " I said , " doing anything to me that I ca n't take . So , do n't worry about me . " Then I said , " I hate them . I hate them . I hate them . " " Yeah , " said Caleb wearily , " they 're doing it to you ,  |p204all  right . " Then I was sorry I had spoken . But what I had said was true ; and , anyway , whether or not I had said it , Caleb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could not , of course , what time had done to me . Whateverthey had wanted for me was now locked in the countryof dreams . It was now never going to happen . No one knew what was going to happen , and no one could controlit . In a way , it can be said that I was the ruin of all their hopes . They had not been able to save me  --  my life would be like theirs . The streets had claimed me because my challenges were there , and everything now depended on what I could learn in the school which was to prepare me for my life . I was very nearly lost because my elders , through no fault of their own , had betrayed me . Perhaps I loved my father , but I did not want to live his life . I did not want to become like him , he was the living example of defeat . He could not correct me . None of my elders could correct me because I was appalled by their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , but rage and pity are not love , and the determination to outwit one 's situation means that one has no models , only object lessons . I was no longer Caleb 's little brother : I was part of Caleb 's heavy load . And this was because he realized that he had become a part of mine , forever . For even Caleb had become , for me , an object lesson . Furtively , I watched him . Covertly , against my will , God knows , I judged him . My brother . My brother . Big , black , beautiful , he should have been a king . But his girl , Dolores , had turned into a barmaid whore . Miss Mildred was bigger and more aimless than ever ; the treacherous Arthur was always stoned . And now there was something in Caleb lonely and sad , shrinking and hysterical . Itp205broke my heart to watch him . He had been beaten too hard . I hated the people who had beaten him ; by the time I was fourteen , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill  --  I mean , no moral reason . But there were too many  --  too many ; they were everywhere one turned , the bland , white , happy , stupid faces . I walked the streets , I went to school , I watched them , and I loathed them . My brother . But it is also hard to love the beaten . It means accepting their condition ; whereas , precisely , one is asking oneself , What shall I do to be saved ? My encounters with Caleb when he came home the first time are blurred . Some moments are very sharply in focus , others are dim , very nearly advancing into the light , then receding into darkness . Other moments are irrecoverable , and I know it , and I have lately begun to know why . I do not subscribe to the superstition that one 's understanding of an event alters the event . No , it is the event which does the altering , and the question one faces is how to live with time 's brutal alterations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with the whiskey Caleb had stolen from the dance-hall bar , he endeavored to be cheerful , and we tried , too . After all , it was good to see him . It had been good to see him , before he and our father became lachrymoseat the bar , dancing with the girls and jiving them and making them helpless before his grace and charm . But even the girls , I noticed , with that really awful increaseof awareness which I owed entirely to Caleb , did not take him seriously : a boy with an unspeakable past was a man with an unendurable future . He was good to look at , good to dance with , probably good to sleep with : but he was no longer good for love . And certainly Caleb felt this , for in his dealings with the girls there was a notep206of brutality which I had never felt in him before . He was not really teasing , charming , seducing them : he was taunting them . He was saying , I 've got what you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up to none of you black bitches . Our mother returned and she poured the drinks . I was n't really permitted to drink , and , luckily , in those days , I did n't like to drink ; but this prohibition , like all of my parents ' prohibitions , was rendered a dead letter by the fact that my parents knew very well that I did whatever I wished , outside . Now , my mother said , " I 'm makingyours real weak , Leo , " and handed me a glass of ginger ale only very faintly colored by whiskey . " That 's just so you can feel part of the family , " she said , and handed drinks to my father and Caleb and sat down . Caleb and our father looked at each other , but neither of them smiled . I drank my ginger ale . I thought of a girl I knew . I tried to think of everything but the room I was in , and the people I was with . " Little Leo sure ai n't grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding him ? " " Exactly what we fed you , " said our mother . " Red beans and rice and cornbread and pork chops and ham hocks and ribs and greens . " " What did they feed you down the way ? " our father asked . " They fed us on what the pigs did n't want , " said Caleb . " One thing I 'll never eat no more in life is hominy grits nor beans nor molasses . " He paused . " They just fed us so we could work , you know  --  like you feed a mule . And they beat us like that , too . " He looked at me . " Yeah , " he said , and sipped his drink.  | " What you figure on doing now ? " our father asked carefully , " now that you out ? " " Do ? " asked Caleb , gently . " Do ? What do I figure on doing ? Is that what you asked me ? Why  --  I might find me a rich white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as her chauffeur , you understand , a lot of them white ladies suffer from black fever  --  or I might get a job in a bank  --  or I might take over a life insurance company  --  or , let me see now , there 's a lot of money in real estate , there 's a whole lot of money in that , I might take over a few blocks of houses  --  or , then , again , I might become an aviator , I 've always liked to fly . That 's what I 'll do , " he said decisively , " I 'll fly . " " You 've got to walk , " said our mother , " before youcan fly . What do you intend to do while you 're walking ? " He looked at her . " Walk , " he said . " Just walk . " " You 've got to eat , " she said , " while you 're walking . " " I can steal , " he said . " I can steal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back half of what they stole fromme . " " Well , if you ca n't , " she said , " steal it back , it do n't look like to me there 's much point in stealing . " He was silent . And our father was silent . " You young , Caleb , " our mother said . " Do n't let this stop you . You just make up your mind that you can do anything you want to do . " " Can I ? " he asked . " Is that the truth ? " She refused to falter . " If you make up your mind to it. -A see . " He stared at the ceiling . He rose . " And you think that 's true for other black boys , too ? " " When we make up our minds , " said our father.  | " When we make up our minds , " Caleb shouted , " to what ? " " When we make up our minds , " said our mother , that we just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good , just as good ! " Caleb laughed . He mimicked her . " Just as good ! Just as good as who  --  them people who beat my ass and called me nigger and made me eat shit and wallow in the dirt like a dog ? Just as good as them ? Is that what you want for me ? I 'd like to see every single one of them in their graves  --  in their graves , Mama , that 's right . And I would n't be a white man for all the coals in hell . " He sat down . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do . I 've got to figure it out . Do n't worry about me . I wo n't be a burden on you for long . " " I ai n't worried about you being a burden , " said our mother , " and you know it , so do n't you talk to me that way . " Caleb smiled , and looked at our father . Our father looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caleb , after a very long moment . " I 'm sorry . " " I 'm sleepy , " I said . " I 'm going to go to bed now . Good-night . " They watched me as I walked out of the room . " I guess , " I heard my mother say , " that that is a good idea . " " Leo 's got good sense , " said Caleb grimly . I crawled into the bed . I did n't want to cry . I listened to them . They talked for awhile . Then my father went to the bathroom . He was in the bathroom a long time . I began to be afraid that he was sick . Then I heard water flushing , heard water running , heard him come out . My mother went into the kitchen . Our father and Caleb saidp209good-night and then Caleb went into the bathroom . Our mother finished in the kitchen and turned out the kitchen lights and the lights in the living room . Then she joined our father and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bath . I fell asleep . I woke to the sound of weeping . Somebody was weeping , all alone , holding his breath , shaking the bed . I listened , extended , so to speak , in a terror unlike any terror I had known . How he wept ! How he wept . And it was as though I were weeping ; but it was much worse than that . I knew I could not bear it . I turned and I touched his wet face and I whispered , " Caleb . Please , Caleb . Please do n't cry . Tell me what 's the matter . Please tell me what 's the matter . " But his chest continued to shake and the tears fell and fell . I did not know what to do . I put my arms around him . I kissed his tears . " Caleb . Please , Caleb "  --  but I might as well have spoken to a storm . " Oh , what they did to me . Oh , what they did to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did they do to you ? " " Oh . Oh . Oh . Little Leo . Go to sleep . " " You go to sleep . Then I 'll go to sleep . " He put his arms around me ; it was strange to feel that I was his big brother now . And he held me so tightly , or , rather , with such an intensity , that I knew , without knowing that I knew it , how empty his arms had been . " Go to sleep . " " All right , little brother . You all right ? " " Yes . Good-night . " " Good-night . " The face against my shoulder was still wet ; slowly , it dried . His breathing slowly became calmer  --  the stormp210began to pass . The storm began to pass , that is , out of him ; and into me . I could not really see his face in the darkness , but I studied his face in the darkness of my mind . The eyes , the mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , woolly hair ; he was much better-looking than I was , he was beautiful ; and the world had taken my brother , for no reason at all , and squeezed him like a lemon , taken out his insides and filled him with sawdust , kicked him about as though he were a dirty rag ! Never , never , never , I swore it , with Caleb 's breath in my face , his tears drying on my neck , my arms around him , would I ever forgive this world . Never . Never . Never . I would find some way to snake them pay . I would do something one day to at least one bland , stupid , happy white face which would change that face forever . If they thought that Caleb was black , and if they thought that I was black , I would show them , yes , I would , one day , exactly what blackness was ! I swore it . I swore it . I whispered it to Caleb 's kinky hair . I cursed God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my balls . I called Him the greatest coward in the universe because He did not dare to show Himself and fight me like a man . I fell into a stormy sleep , and awoke to find myself , like Jacob with the angel , struggling with a very different god , and one yet more tyrannical , the god of the flesh . My brother held me close , and he was terribly excited ; his excitement excited me . I was briefly surprised , I was briefly afraid . But there was really nothing very surprising in such an event , and if there was any reason to be afraid , well , then , I hoped that God was watching . He probably was . He never did anything else . I knew , I knew , what my brother wanted , what my brother needed , and I was not at all afraid  --  morep211than I could say for God , who took all and gave nothing : and who paid for nothing , though all His creatures paid . I held my brother very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pain and wonder I had never felt before . My brother 's heart was broken ; I knew it from his touch . In all the great , vast , dirty world , he trusted the love of one person only , his brother , his brother , who was in his arms . And I thought , Yes . Yes . Yes . I 'll love you , Caleb , I 'll love you forever , and in the sight of the Father and the Son and the fucking Holy Ghost and all their filthy hosts , and in the sight of all the world , and I 'll sing hallelujahsto my love for you in hell . I stripped both of us naked . He held me and he kissed me and he murmured my name . I was full of attention , I was full of wonder . My brother had never , for me , had a body before . And , in truth , I had never had a body before , either , though I carried it about with me and occasionally experimented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were only using our hands and , of course , I had already done this by myself and I had done it with other boys : but it had not been like this because there had been no agony in it , I had not been trying to give , I had not even been trying to take , and I had not felt myself , as I did now , to be present in the body of the other person , had not felt his breath as mine , his sighs and moans , his quivering and shaking as mine , his journey as mine . More than anything on earth , that night , I wanted Caleb 's joy . His joy was mine . When his breathing changed and his tremors began , I trembled , too , with joy , with joy , with joy and pride , and we came together . Caleb held me for a long time . Then he whispered , against my ear , " You all right . " Yes , " I said . " I 'm all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then , " You still love me ? You not mad at me ? " " Why should I be mad at you ? " Then I said , " Yes , I love you , Caleb , more than anybody in the whole wide world . You believe me ? " After a moment , he said , " Yes . I believe you . " " Give us a kiss , " I said . He kissed me . " Now , go to sleep . " He kissed me again . " Good-night , little Leo . I do n't know what I 'd do without you . " " But you have n't got to do without me , " I said , " that 's just what I just told you . Good-night . " " Good-night . " And we fell asleep . I suppose we were both utterly worn out , drained dry , for we did not wake up until the early afternoon . I peeked out of the window , which faced the wall of the house next door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice day , and it felt like a nice day . The radios were going , a church service here , a jazz band there , and the irrepressible voices , and the sound and smell of cooking . It was familiar , it was safe , and both Caleb and I were reluctant to move . " It 's cold out , " I said . " And how you know that ? " " I looked , " I said . " You 'll know it , too , you put your butt out of this bed . " " What you want to do today ? " " I do n't know . Anything you want to do . " We listened to the voices of our parents in the living room.  | " I just feel lazy , " Caleb said . He lit a cigarette . " I just feel like turning over and going back to sleep . " " Then you wo n't be able to sleep tonight . But suit yourself . Can I have a puff off your cigarette ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the cigarette , watching me . " You smoking ? " I gave him back the cigarette . " Just sometimes . With the other guys . " No wonder you do n't grow , " he said . " I do n't think I 'll ever grow very big . But if you do n't want me to smoke , I 'll stop . " " Well , I do n't think smoking will do you any good . " " All right . " Caleb smoked in silence for awhile . I watched his profile and I watched the smoke . I put my head , so to speak , under his wing , and he held me . Then he put out his cigarette , and moved , slapping me on the behind . " Come on . Let 's get up . I 'll take you to the show . " And he found his shorts , and mine , and put his on , and walked into the bathroom . When he came out , he pulled the covers off me and we fought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wrestled each other around the room , and our mother yelled , " Are you two finally gettingout of bed ? You ought to be ashamed of your big , black , lazy selves ! " " Big , black , lazy selves , " laughed Caleb to himself ; I laughed , too . Caleb yelled , " It ai n't me , Mama . It 's Leo . I 'm up . I been up ! " " I 'll bet . You two just better make yourselves presentableand come on out here , if you want to eat to-day . " Since Caleb was tickling me with one hand and spar/ring with the other , I was forced to my feet , and spun out of the door and down the hall . " He 's out of bed , Mama , " Caleb cried jubilantly . " I do n't know if he 's hungry , but I am . " " Declare , " our mother grumbled , " you both too old to be carrying on like this . It 's your father you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was in the kitchen . " You want a cup of coffee , Caleb ? It ai n't good to eat just as soon as you get out of bed . And do you know what time it is ? " " I 'd like some coffee , Mama , please . What time is it ? " " It 's past two o'clock in the afternoon , that 's what time it is . Leo , do n't you come out of that bathroom until you take your bath . " " Is it two o'clock in the afternoon ? " Caleb cried . " My ! We sure must have had ourselves a time last night . " " Keep it up , " she grunted . " Keep it up . " " Did n't you have a time , old lady ? " asked Caleb , in the kitchen now . " You stop aggravating your mother , " our father cried , " and come on out here . " " Why here I am , " Caleb said , and I heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggravate me now , I suppose . " " Why , there 's just no pleasing nobody in this house this morning , " said Caleb pleasantly , and turned on the radio . By the time I got dressed and joined them , he had found a station which was playing Calypso , and had one arm around our mother and was waltzing her , half laughing , half protesting , across the floor . " Lord , " she said , " now why do I have to be the mother of the one nigger in the whole world ai n't got no sense of rhythm  --  now , look , Caleb "  --  and they both broke up , laughing , and they triedp215it again . Across the floor , a proud , hincty , mocking prance ; then they had to turn together and meet each other and then they had to part ; and then they had to meet each other again , and come across the floor , again . " Lord , Caleb , " and they both laughed ; and the number ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father laughed , too . " That ai n't the way , " he said , " we did it in the islands . " Another number started . " Come on , " said Caleb , " and show us how you did it in the islands , man . " And he turned our mother toward our father , and she raised him by the hand . He was growing old , our father , but he was also very young ; and when he rose , tall and courtly , one saw hog , young he was . With his lips pressed together , he was smil ing , smiling with , and at , his woman , who was being led by him . It was almost as though Caleb and I were not present , or present only as a possibility . It was a dance which was a wedding of the English and the islands , for 1 really was , as it began , in the English sense , formal Then , without becoming less formal , it became on her part more tantalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was a game , a ritual , a sacrament , it became bolder and more humorous . Her plump hips moved like the hips of a girl , and her bright , bright face turned toward him and then away from him . His patient , egg plant color pursued her everywhere , and his hips moved like the hips of a boy . Their feet beat as though they were barefoot in the fields . He held her by one hip , she held him by one shoulder . They were smiling an indescribable smile . They felt the end of the number approaching , the , . turned once more , and , as the number ended , she curtsied and he bowed . Caleb clapped his hands.  | " Hell , " said our father , while our mother sat down in his chair and exaggeratedly wiped her brow , and lit a cigarette , " that ai n't nothing . You should have seen us when we could really do it . " " Is that a fact now ? " said Caleb , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our mother glared at both of them , then looked at me . " Both of them , " she said , confidentially , " both of them . They are both completely insane . This morning . Caleb , your coffee 's cold . " She rose , and tasted it . " Stone cold . " She took it into the kitchen . " You Want some coffee , Leo ? " " Yes , you just going to have to wait till I make some more . " Now , the news teas on , and our father restlessly clicked the dials : the air was full of a false urgency , such news as there might be entirely muffled by the habits and exigencies of salesmen . " Now , do n't you want to know , " asked Caleb , " what 's happening in the world ? " " No , " said our father imperturbably , still clicking dials , " ai n't no white boy living can tell me what 's happening in the world . Not before they find out what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't never going to do that , " said Caleb . " No , " said our father , and clicked off the radio . " There 'll be something lively on it by and by , " he said . Our mother brought in fresh coffee , and We sat at the Window , Watching the streets . Opposite us , other people also sat in Windows , watching the streets . I have some/times thought that there is probably no more vivid rendering of silence and no more definitive image of attention , than that presented by Harlem windows , some Sunday afternoons . Four or five or six stories up or down , the people sit , or lean , as though they had been stationed or planted there : their faces as still as the stone which frames them . At a top floor window , behind the grillwork he has placed there to prevent his children from falling , sits a man wearing a stocking cap , holding his infant child . The child is restless , but cheerfully restless , and he easily meets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time . If it were not for these slight movements , one might wonder if he realized that he was holding a child at all . His face is attentive , but utterly closed and unmoving . A cigarette smolders between his heavy lips ; his eyes are attentive to the smoke . It is impossible to say what he is watching ; or if he is watching at all . Yet , something is happening in him , one can almost hear small hammers beating and small wheels turning . Just so , the lady on the floor below , her hair tied up in a rag , her elbows leaning on the sill , a fist on either side of her chin . Her face is very black and rather heavy , her lips are very soft and sad , and her long , dark eyes do not move . At the window next to hers , sits a very old lady , in profile , with a strong Indian nose , head thrown back , eyes closed ; and at the window below this , sits a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his fists covering his ears , his eyes very wide and black . His hair is very short , and gleams with Vaseline . A fairly light woman , with Straightened hair , and wearing a black dress , sits at the ground floor window , with her small daughter standing between her knees . It would appear that they are all watching thep218street . The street is very long and wide . On either side of the street , long , gleaming automobiles are parked . The cars are much cleaner than the street  --  indeed , one very stocky man in shirt-sleeves is busy polishing his car . Garbagecans , so full that their lids can not fit , stand before every house , and garbage blows up and down the street and collects in the windy gutters . Cars come through the street , scattering the boys ; and even though it is rather cold today , the streets are never empty . Girls , in their finery , walk proudly along , sometimes alone , sometimes with each other , sometimes with the boys , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drunken man comes singing , howling along , his old black overcoat blowing in the wind ; only the children appear to notice him , and this merely to make his life more difficult by calling him , and following after him . Everything is happening and nothing is happening , and everything is still , like thunder . One might be in the catacombs , with the first believers , waiting for a sign . And always , the echo of music , the presence of voices , as constant and compelling as the movement of the sea . At length , our mother , having decided to feed her children  --  and Caleb growing restless , smoking one cigaretteafter another , and staring out of the window  --  rose , and went to the kitchen and heated the biscuits , the yams , the chicken , the ham , the gravy , and the rice . She set up the card table for Caleb and me , and we sat down to eat . They sat near the window , watching us ; it was almost as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said our father carefully , " the place where I work , they looking for a shipping clerk . The one they had been took by the Army . " Caleb looked up , but said nothing.  | " He asked me if I knew of anybody , " our father said , and I said I might . It ai n't a bad job  --  just to tide a person over . " He looked at our mother . " You reckon you want to try it , Caleb ? " she asked . " What do they pay ? " asked Caleb . Our father told him . Caleb laughed . " That 'll tide me over , all right , " he said . " I think you might do well at it , " said our mother . " Until you find  --  until you find  --  something more to your liking . " She met his eyes . Then she said , " You got to do something , Caleb  --  just for your own sake , I mean . You ca n't just sit around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to tell them , " Caleb asked merrily , when they ask me where I been so long ? " " Do n't worry about that . Your father can explain all that . They think a whole lot of your father . " Caleb poured himself some coffee and lit a cigarette . " They ai n't particular , anyway , " our father said . " They ca n't afford to be so particular now . " " Yeah , " said Caleb , " they can use us now . They got a war to fight . I think I might as well join the Army . Be quicker . " " Caleb , " said our mother , " do n't you talk like that . You hear me ? " " I hear you . " He rose . " If you ready , little brother , we 'll go on to the show . " " I 'm ready , " I said . I stood up . There was a silence . Somebody , somewhere , was singing " A Tisket , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What time you leave in the morning ? " " At seven , " said our mother . " Well , all right , " said Caleb , " at seven . Leo , get yourp220coat . Get mine , too . " I got our coats . When I came back into the room , Caleb was standing at the door . He took his coat without looking at it , and shrugged himself into it . " Like the farmer said to the sweet potato , I 'll plant you now and dig you later ! ' " The door closed behind us . We dropped down the stairs two at a time . Now we seemed to be fleeing from the voices and the odors . We hit the street . Caleb put his hand on my neck , and hurried us down the long block . He did not say anything , and I did not say anything . One of the Holy Roller churches was making even more noise than usual , and Caleb and I danced past it , laughing . " What movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . " " We got enough money to go downtown ? " " I do n't know . I got four , how much you got ? " " The old man let me have five . " " You want to go downtown ? " " I do n't know . Do you ? " We looked at each other . " Oh , hell , " Caleb said , " Let 's go on downtown . " " Okay . Let 's go . " " You want to take the bus or the subway ? " " Let 's take the bus . " We stood on the avenue and waited for the bus . We were very shy with each other , suddenly ; we were very happy with each other , too . Because we were shy , I watched the people passing , listened to the music coming from a bar behind us , watched the church members going home from church . We , as a family , had never gone to church , for our father could not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , suddenly , for the first time and for no reason , that he must surely have gone top221church in the islands , when he was young . I turned to ask Caleb about this , but I was stunned and silenced by his face . The sun was yellow , it was in his eyes , causing him to squint ; it fell over his forehead and curled in his hair ; his lips stretched upward in a scowl . He was looking at me . He looked worried and thoughtful and happy : no one had ever before looked at me with such a concentrated love . It stunned me , as I say , for he made no effort to hide it . It made me very proud , and it frightened me . The bus came as we stared at one another , and Caleb pushed me on the bus , before him . He got change , and dropped the coins in the box . We sat down . He made me sit next to the window . " Well , tomorrow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughed . " I reckon we going to pass through the garment center , ai n't we , on our way down ? " " I could show you the block where Daddy works  --  but it 's further downtown . " " I 'm not sure I really want to see it . " He laughed again , and the bus rolled down the avenue and we were silent for awhile . " Leo , " he said , " what you reckon you want to be ? to do ? You know ? " I watched the streets and the houses roll by , and I watched the people in the streets . I said , " You 'll think I 'm crazy if I tell you the truth . " " Well , as I already know you 're crazy , " he said , " you might as well tell me the truth . " " I 'm going to be an actor , " I said . I did not look at him , but I felt him watching me . I watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " In the movies ? " " On the stage , " I said . I looked at him and I looked away . " You 'll see . " " How you going to go about it , Leo ? " " I do n't know yet . But I 'll find out . I 'll do it . " " You told Mama and Daddy ? " " No . " Then , " I have n't told nobody except you . " " Well , " he said , after a moment , " you know the odds , little brother ? I mean , you know the odds are against you ? " " Hell , yes , " I said , " I know the odds are against me . But the odds would n't be any less against me if  --  if I worked for the garment center ! " He said nothing . I wished to take back my last words , but I did not know how . " That 's true , " he said at last , mildly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look , Caleb , " I said , " I know I ca n't be a janitor . You know ? I just know it . I know I ca n't work in  --  inthekind of jobs they give us . Maybe I ca n't be an actor , either . But I have to try it . I know I have to try it . " " Do n't get upset , " said Caleb . " You did n't hear me say you could n't do it , did you ? " " No . But I bet that 's what you 're thinking . " " Well , then , " said Caleb , " you 're wrong . That 's not what I was thinking at all . I was thinking how proud I am of you . Do n't look like that . It 's the truth I 'm telling you . " Honest ? " He laughed . " Honest . " He raised both hands . " I swear . All right ? " I said , " All right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sobered.  | " But Mama and Daddy ai n't going to like this notion a bit . " " I 'm not going to tell them . You think I 'm crazy ? " Now , he was entirely sober and still . " No , " he said . " No . You 're not the one who 's crazy . " Then , " Daddy used to always say , I wonder what 's the matter with our people . ' I 've got to wondering , too . But  --  baby !  --  they sure do have us in a mighty tight place . " " They do n't want us to do nothing because we might do it better than them , " I said . " Well , they do , " said Caleb , " tend to try to beat the shit out of you before you can get around to doing anything . But we going to have to fox them , little brother . " He put his hand on my neck ; he looked out of the window , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to fox them . " The bus rolled on , turned west at 116th Street , rolled alongside Morningside Park for awhile , turned again on 110th Street , and started rolling out of Harlem . This was ( in those days ) a kind of transition neighborhood ; white boys and black boys were in the streets , and white girls and black girls , some carrying books ; and we whirled past black and white figures sitting on the benches outside of Central Park , or walking up and down the pathetic green . Now , the buildings began to be higher and cleaner , canopies and doormen appeared , and black and white messengers , on bicycles . More and more white people got on the bus , in furs and perfumes and hats , carrying newspapers and expensive-looking packages . Instinctively , Caleb and I sat closer together . I kept my eyes on the street , in order not to look at the people on the bus . I wondered how we were ever going to fox them if we could n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intop224the eyes of a red-faced , black-haired , corpulent man , who had , briefly and idly , looked up from his newspaper . His hair was very well combed , his face was very well shaven , his nails were manicured , his shoes gleamed , his suit and his topcoat were expensive , he was wearing cufflinks , and I could almost smell his toilet water . I do n't know what was in my eyes  --  base envy , I think , base hatred , and great wonder  --  but whatever it was held his wandering , not altogether hostile nor altogether amused attention for a second or so . He glanced at my brother . Then he returned to his newspaper . Then , all of my ambitions seemed flat and ridiculous . How could we fox them if we could neither bear to look at them , nor bear it when they looked at us ? And who were they , anyway ? which was the really terrible , the boomeranging question . And one alwaysfelt : maybe they 're right . Maybe you are nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the life they make you lead , is the only life you deserve . They say that God said so  --  and if God said so , then you mean about as much to God as you do to this red-faced , black-haired , fat white man . Fuck God . Fuck you , too , mister . But there he sat , just the same , impervious , gleaming and redolent with safety , rustling , as it were , the Scriptures , in which I appeared only as the object lesson . We got off the bus near Madison Square Garden . I think the circus was in town , for the Garden was surrounded by policemen and the streets were full of dazzledmen and women and children . The streets were full of a noise like gaiety . But one realized that it could not be gaiety when one looked at the thin lips and the flashing spectacles , the crisply toasted , curled hair of the ladies ; when one listened to the brutal , denigrating , lewd voicesp225of the men , and watched their stretched lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning , tyrannical wail of the children , vaguely and vocally dissatisfiedby the fair ; and when one watched the policemenwho moved through the crowd , on foot or on horseback , as though the crowd were cattle . There were no movies on this avenue , and so we turned off it , walking east , moving now with , now against , the current , sometimesseparated by it , often stopped , sometimes , in searching for each other , spun around . People looked into storewindows , and so did we , walked in and out of stores , but we did n't bother , and they were visible behind the plate-glass windows of cafeterias , sitting , in my memory , bolt upright , or wandering about with trays . The crowd , no doubt , would have described itself as friendly ; a fair observation would have been that they were in a holiday mood . But their holidays were , emphatically , not my holidays  --  I had too often been the occasion of their fearful celebrations ; and I did not feel any friendliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a mortal danger . I kept my hands in my pockets ( and so did Caleb ) so I could not be accused of molesting any of the women who jostled past , and kept my eyes carefully expressionlessso I could not be accused of lusting after the women , or desiring the death of the men . When my countrymen were on holiday , their exuberance took strange forms . And I was aware  --  for the first time , though not for the last  --  that I was with Caleb , whose danger , since he was so much more visible , was greater than mine . It was not here and not now and not among these people , that he could protect me by his size . On the contrary , our roles were reversed , and here , now , amongp226these people , it was my size and my presumed innocence which might operate as protection for him . He was not , walking beside me , a burly black man prowling the streets but an attentive older brother taking his little brother sightseeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envied metropolis of New York . My presence , potentially , at least , proved his innocence and goodwill and also bore witness to the charity and splendorof the people to whom I owed so much and from whom I had so much to learn . We came to Broadway , and the great marquees . " You going to have your name up there in lights , little Leo ? " Caleb asked , with a smile . " Yes , " I said . " I will . You wait and see . " " Little Leo , " said Caleb , " on the great white way . " " It wo n't be so white , " I said , " when I get through with it . " Caleb threw back his head and laughed . People turned to look at us : but I made my eyes very big as I looked up at Caleb , and carefully not at them , and they saw what I had wanted them to see . Some of them smiled , too , happy that we were enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What movie you want us to see ? And I will bow to your judgment , man , because I see you are becomingan expert . " Well , in fact , I realized , as I scanned the procession of marquees , there was n't anything playing that I was really dying to see . I had outgrown my taste for some movies without having acquired any real taste for others . But , of course , I did not know how to say this . I had begun to be interested in foreign movies , mostly Russian and French , but I did n't think that Caleb would especially like seeing a foreign movie . So I said , " Well , let 's look . If you see something you like before I see something I like , why ,  |p227we  'll go and see that ; and if . I see something I like before you see something you like , why , we 'll go and see that . Okay ? " " Okay , " he said , amused  --  seeming , also , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wandered through the holiday crowds , stopping now beneath this marquee and now that , examining the merchandise so carefully that we might have been expecting to buy it and take it home and live with it for the rest of our lives and hand it down to our children . We walked carefully down one side of the avenue , stoppingand choosing , rather enjoying ourselves now , all the way to 42nd Street ; and then up the other side of the avenue , slowly , although it was getting late ; but it did n't much matter what time we got home tonight as long as we got home together , and we were n't planning to separate . We forgot about the other people . We began to talk to each other as we had n't talked since Caleb had come home  --  as we had never talked before , in fact , for it was only now that Caleb could talk to me without rememberingthat he was talking to a child . I was determined to make him know that I was no longer a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet , in another way , I did . I was concentrating on not being a disappointment to him : I wanted him to know that he could lean on me . Because Caleb liked Ann Sheridan , we ended up in King 's Row . I did n't like Ann Sheridan , I thought she looked like a dumpling , and I did n't like Robert Cummings , who looked like two or three , and I could n't stand Ronald Reagan , who looked like a pitchfork and had teeth like a ferret ; but I did like Charles Coburn and Claude Rains and Judith Anderson , and I especiallyp228liked Betty Field because she had a niggerish mouth , a mouth like mine . So , Caleb paid for the tickets , and we went on in . We entered , first , into a kind of cathedral  --  an impression of tapestries , of banging gold , a vaulted height , a slinging , descending , mightily carpeted floor , great doors before us , Roman couches on either side , on one of which sat a lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin umbrella , and smoking a cigarette . A bored male attendant , two bored usherettes , who looked sharply at Caleb and me . ' Tin going to go to the bathroom , " Caleb said , and vanished behind the door marked MEN . I waited . I looked at the photographs of the movie stars on the walls . They were white and cheerful and dramatic . I was already arrogant enough to feel that they could n't , mainly , act their way out of a sieve , but lights and makeup and an innocence as brutal as it was despairingdid marvelous things for these sons and daughters of the one and only God , and very nearly reconciled me to Ronald Reagan 's teeth . Caleb came back . We left the cathedral and entered the cave . Dark , dark indeed , sloping , hushed . We were in the balcony , so that Caleb could smoke , and from other worshipershere and there a taper glowed . The movie had been running for some time , it may indeed have been a revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , although it was a Saturday night , the house was far from full . Caleb and I sat down somewhere in the middle of the balcony , at an angle as steeply tilted as that of a bucking horse or a dying boat , and Caleb lit a cigarette . We had entered during a newsreel . There was trouble in the world . We saw Roosevelt , we saw Churchill , we saw Stalin : " I hope they all killp229each other , " Caleb said . We saw our great Marines in the Pacific , destroying the yellow-bellied Japs . And we saw Old Glory . " Well , " said Caleb , " I 'll be damned . " Some people in the audience applauded . Caleb lit another cigarette . Then the cartoon came on . Woody Woodpecker or Mickey Mouse or Little Red Riding Hood or Bugs Bunny or some fucking body got beaten with hammers , strangled with chains , crushed under a tractor , thrown over a cliff , gored by a cornice , and disemboweled , it appeared , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other worshipers , cracked up with laughter . Then the lights came on . We sat , silently , watching the people . Strange people , sitting , mainly , all alone . There were one or two couples , very , very young ; the boy 's hair still bright from the water , the girl 's hair still bright from the heat ; they sat very close together , and as to popcorn , chewing gum , and candy , the boys were attentive indeed , climbing the tilted steps from time to time to call on the usherettes . I was between fourteen and fifteen then , and the boys and girls could not have been much older . But they impressed me as being children , children forever , children not as a biological fact , but as a perpetual condition . I am sure that I was a very disagreeable boy in those days , for I really despised them for their blank , pimpled faces and their bright , haunted eyes . It had not occurred to me  --  partly , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had to shit , like I did , and they jerked off sometimes , like I did , and were just as frightenedas I. It had not yet occurred to me that the mask of my bravado was very much like theirs , concealed though it was , and most effectively , by the mask of my color , and by the reflexes which this mask occasioned in them and inp230me . No : I simply despised them because they were not as I was , and because I thought it might have been better for me if I had been like them . The lights went down , and a majestic music was heard . The curtains slowly parted , and the screen was filled with the immense shieldsaying WB , WARNER BROTHERS PRESENTS . Brothers . Ithought of my own brother , and I think I hated the movie before the movie began . The names of the actors . The music . The makeup man , the light man , the sound man , the decorators , the set designers , James Wong Howe on camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A town somewhere in the United States . I am afraid that my memory of this movie is hopelesslydistorted by the fact that it cracked Caleb up completely . I very much doubt that a major masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin or W. C. Fields could have caused him to laugh harder . When we finally picked up the story line  --  so to speak ; it was by no means an easy matter  --  Caleb whispered , " Shit . They acting just like niggers . Only , they ai n't got as much sense about it as we got . " I rather liked Cassandra , who was played by Betty Field , but Caleb thought that she was a living freak , and wondered why no one had ever told her to tie up her hair . When it developed , coyly enough indeed , and with tremendous laments from the mighty music , that her father had been interfering with her , had lain between her thighs , had , in short , been screwing her , thus causing her to become mentally unbalanced  --  which we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we watched Robert Cummings ' plum-pudding reactions , Caleb hid his face in his hands , which was thoughtful of him , for we would otherwise have been thrown out of the theater . Of course , hep237adored Ann Sheridan , winsome Irish colleen , and I found her somewhat more probable than I had ever found her to be before ; but when Ronald Reagan lost his legs  --  " both of them ! "  --  Caleb cracked up again , and tears were streaming down his face by the time Robert Cummings delivered Invictus . " So that 's why , " he gasped , as we walked up the aisle , out of the cave , " they make us come in the back door . I 'll be damned . " And he was off again , halfway across the cathedral floor , before I could catch up with him . Into the streets again , dark now , with a light rain falling , and the incredible people everywhere . Much later , that night , Caleb had a dream so awful that he shook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook him to wake him up . He fought me and he continued to fight me even after his eyes were open , and he seemed to be awake ; and I got frightened because my brother was very strong , and I started , helplessly , to cry . The terror went out of his face then  --  his face had been blank and brutal with terror ; and his eyes cleared , with a great astonishment , and a terrible sorrow . " Oh , do n't cry . Do n't cry , Leo . I did n't mean to hurt you , man . I swear I did n't mean to hurt you . " His hands were trying to wipe away my tears . " Hit me . Hit me back . I swear I did n't mean to hurt you . " " You did n't hurt me . You scared me . " He took his hand away . He was silent . " I guess so , " he said . " Sometimes I scare myself . " He lay back on the pillow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what 's going to happen to me . " " I wo n't let anything happen to you . " He smiled . " The farm I was on , down yonder . They used to beat me . With whips . With rifle butts . It madep232them feel good to beat us ; I can see their faces now . There would always be two or three of them , big motherfuckers . The ring-leader had red hair , his name was MartinHowell . Big , dumb Irishman , sometimes he used to snake the colored guys beat each other . And he 'd stand there , watching , with his lips dropping , his lips wet , laughing , until the poor guy dropped to the ground . And he 'd say , That 's just so you all wo n't forget that you is niggersand niggers ai n't worth a shit . And he 'd make the colored guys say it . He 'd say , You ai n't worth shit , are you ? And they 'd say , No , Mr. Howell , we ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw it , I vomited . But he made me say it , too . It took awhile , but I said it , too , he made me say it , too . That hurt me , hurt me more than his whip , more than his rifle butt , more than his fists . Oh . That hurt me . " Silence , and darkness , and Caleb 's breath  --  they are with me still , they will be with me when I am carried to my grave . And , from the grave , I swear it , my rotting flesh , my useless bones , will yet cry out : I will never forgivethis world . Oh , that a day of judgment should come , oh , that it should come , and I could rise from my grave and make my testimony heard ! Yes . Everyone who pierced him . " The first time I saw this red-haired mother-fucker , I was in the field , working . He was on a horse . He come riding up , and stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he yells out , Hey , Sam ! but I just kept on doing what I was doing . He yells out , Do n't you hear me calling you ? and then I stopped and put down my fork and I said : My name ai n't Sam . " He rode in a little closer , then , and looked down at me . I looked up at him . He said , Who the fuck do youp233think you are ? and I said , My name is Caleb Proudhammer , mister , and I 'd appreciate it if you 'd let me get on with my work . He laughed . He actually laughed , like it was the best joke he 'd heard in a long time . He said , Nigger , if my balls was on your chin , where would my prick be ? And I did n't understand him at first , I just looked at him . Then , when I understood it , I do n't know why , I picked up the pitchfork . I did n't do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse kind of jumped . And this red-haired mother-fucker , he looked surprised , and he looked scared , and he was having a little trouble holdingon to his horse . I knew he did n't want me to see that . I knew it . He knew I knew it . And he rode off across the field , mainly because he did n't know what to do with me and did n't know what to do with his horse , and he yelled , All right , Sam ! I 'll be seeing you , you hear me ? I will be seeing you ! " And , you know , it 's funny , I realized right then and there , while I was watching him ride off , it was n't , you know , exactly like what he 'd said . I mean , shit , you know . I 'm a big boy and I know the score . Shit . You know . If it came down on me like that , well , all right , I 'd suck a cock , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why the fuck not , and whose business is it ? Like , shit . You know . Ai n't nobody's business . You know , like , man , I 'd do anything in the world for you because you 're my brother and because you 're my baby and I love you and I believe you 'd do anything in the world for me . I know you would . So , you know , it ai n't that shit that bothered me . No . He made me feel like I was my grandmother in the fields somewhere and this white mother-fucker rides over and decides to throw her down in the fields . Well , shit . You know . I ai n't my grandmother . I 'm a man . And a man canp234do anything he wants to do , but ca n't nobody make him do it . I ai n't about to be raped . Shit . But I knew this mother-fucker had it in for me . I knew , like he said , I was going to be seeing him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , oh , yes , I did . The week was n't out before I saw him . He was going to break my back . I knew it . He was going to make me kneel down . He was going to make me act out his question . I was n't going to do it . He knew it . And I knew it . And there we were . " Caleb 's voice , his breath : darkness and silence . " They had a place there where they put you when they was displeased . It was a kind of cellar . We was already in jail , you understand , but they had a jail inside the jail . But , at least , you know , if they was n't displeased with you , if you could kiss enough ass , or if they just plain did n't notice you , well , you was in the open air , and , you know , you could talk to your buddies  --  we was only put there , like they said , for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . But that cellar , baby , I wo n't never forget that cellar . You ai n't never smelled nothing like that cellar  --  phew ! baby , I thought I 'd never get that stink out of me . Never . I was dreaming about it just now . That 's what I was dreaming about . Me , and Martin Howell , and he had his whip . Oh , Leo . Wow . I did n't know people could treat each other so . And I do n't want you to think that it was just him . It was n't just him . It was all of them , really , and the black guys , too , them that was called the trusties . Shit , baby , they loved whipping ass and the blacker they was , the harder they hit . But , old Martin , he was ring-leader . Everybody was scared of him . I do n't know why . And he had it in for me . And  --  you know . I did n't know what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of him , exactly . I believe I could of beat him , had it come to a fair fight . But I was scared . The other guys knew he had it in for me , and they was scared , too , and they moved away from me . And all I 'd said to the fire-haired cock-sucker was that my name was n't Sam ! " Your brother was a very lonely man , because I knew was n't nobody going to help me . Not even if they wanted to . And I thought of you , you know that  --  my big-eyed little brother ? But I was glad you was n't there . I was mighty glad you was n't there . " First , he made it so that I got took off my job . 1 worked in the fields , I piled the hay and took care of the grass and all that shit . I liked it , you know , because , you know , fuck it , there I was , and I knew I could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no business there , I mean I knew I should never have been sent there , I had n't done nothing to be sent there , but I could n't afford to think about that too much and so I thought , well , all right , I 'll make me some muscles . But he got me taken off that and they put me in the kitchen . I did n't like the kitchen , but he was going with the head cook , a big old white German lady named Mrs. Waldo . I believe her husband was dead , I do n't know . But , anyway  --  they had me  --  between them , they had me . They could do anything they wanted to do and could n't nobody do nothing about it . Baby . That woman worked me like I was somebody 's mule . Or maybe nobody 's mule . Or her mule , but a mule she knew she could n't never sell and so she might as well work him till he dropped . I had to be there at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I washed all the dishcloths and hung them out on the line and then I had to chop wood for the fires . Then I washed the dishes and the pots and pans , theyp236kind of threw them at me , you know , and , shit , it was a big farm and I did n't have but one helper and he did n't help me because Mrs. Waldo did n't want him to and she always had hire out of the kitchen , doing something else . She had a funny way with her . She used always to talk about my mother . She used to say , I bet your mama 's mighty sad whenever she thinks of you . She 'd say , Where 's your father ? Your father home ? Has he been home lately ? You ever seen your father ? And , Leo , I just did not know how to handle it . I tried not to say anything , but then she 'd get mad and most likely hit me on the head with whatever she happened to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , I was scared to death of that woman . I was even more scared of her than I was of him because she had me all day . You know . And he 'd come into the kitchen , Lord , Lord , Lord , and sit there like a king and she 'd feed him and he 'd go on about me and my mama and daddy and my big tool which he wanted me to show him , so he could cut it off . Well , you know , Leo , flesh and blood ca n't stand but so much . And , one day , I 'll never forget it , it was after lunch and I had n't had my lunch yet , there was just them and me in the kitchen and I could hear the boys outside leaving the dining hall , and it was the kind of day that it was today , cold , you know , and it looked a little like rain , and he said something about my mama and my daddy and he come up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sink  --  and when he said whatever he said and touched me , I picked up the big black heavy pot I was washing and I threw the water all over him and I beat him over the head with that pot . As hard as I could . As hard as I could . Oh , we wrestled in that kitchen , baby , I mean we had us a waltz . You ai n't never seen such waltz/ing . I was trying to kill him . I mean , I knew I was trying to kill him and he knew it , too . And she was screaming . She came at me with a knife and I knocked the knife out of her hand and I knocked her down . Then , they all ganged up on me and some of them held me while he beat me . Then , they threw me in that cellar . " In that cellar , there was n't no window , there was just a door with bars on it and if you sat near the bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the daytime . In the nighttime , there was n't no light at all . But you could hear for awhile . Could n't nobody come near you . They shoved the food in through the bars . The food was bread and water . I mean it , man . Stale bread and cold water . You had to shit and piss in a pail . And you had to empty the pail and that was the only time you ever got out of there and then there was two men with you . And , sometimes they made like they was going to spill the pail on you , they had a lot of fun that way and sometimes these mother-fuckers was white , baby , and sometimes they was black . Shit . When they first threw me in there I was in pretty bad shape and what saved me was the rats . I mean it . The rats . I was flat on my back , I guess I was half unconscious , I do n't know , and I was thinking of my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard this sound , this rattling sound and I wondered what it was and.I do n't know how to explain this but all of a sudden I felt like I was being watched , like there was eyes on me . And I looked toward the bars , but were n't nobody there . My mouth was caked with blood and I wiped my mouth and I heard the sound again . It was near me , it was n't at the bars . Then , I saw their eyes . I was so sick I did n't know if I could move . But if I did n't move  --  oh , man  --  if I did n't move and there was a whole lot of themp238and I knew if I did n't move  --  and I screamed and I got to the bars and I heard them scurrying away because , then , they knew I was alive and I hung on the bars all night . I was afraid to lie down again . I 'd feel myself dropping off , you know , and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they was still there , scurrying here and yonder . And did n't nobody come near me , nobody , all night long . " I do n't know how long I was down there , Leo , I swear to God I do n't , I 'll never know . But , one morning , here he come , like I 'd known he was going to , Old MartinHowell , red-haired mother-fucker with his whip . He said , Do n't you want to see your friends upstairs ? and I said , I got no friends upstairs . He said , Ai n't you tired of bread and water ? and I said , I 'm getting used to it , thanks . The thing is , I was scared of him and he was scared of me . But I really believe that he was a little more scared of me than I was of him , because I knew , if it really got down to it , I was going to have to kill him . Yes . I really do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was n't a man , I do n't know what he was , but I knew he was n't never going to get me on my knees . He had his boys and all , though , I knew it , just upstairs . " He said , Nigger , you remember that question I asked you ? He was smiling . I did n't say nothing . He walked up and down , kind of weighing his whip . He was trying to scare me with that whip . He wanted me to beg him not to beat me . I watched him . I knew what he did n't want to do was have to call in nobody . He wanted me all to himself . I did n't give a shit . I was going to get beaten , anyway . So I called him every name I could think of , just to get it started , just to get it over with , and hep239raised his whip to strike me and I ducked and he raised it again and I grabbed his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm pretty strong but I was weakened by being on bread and water for so long and he cracked me across the back of the head with the whip handle and I fell down to my knees . When I fell , he came at me again , but I managed to roll out of his way and when he came back at me I pulled him down , hard , and I got him by the balls and , believe me , I made that mother scream . Oh , yeah , he screamed that morning . I beat him with the handleof his whip and I made his red hair a little bit redder . I heard them coming and I tried to hold them off with my whip but of course they got me and when they got through with me I was lying against a wall . He was standingover me . He said , Nigger , you ai n't worth shit . Ai n't that right ? And he kicked me . I could hardly see anything , I could hardly see his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he kicked me again . Then , one of the black trusties spit on me and so I said , You right , Mr. Howell . I ai n't worth shit . And they left me . And I was alone down there for a long time . On bread and water . " His voice stopped : his silence created a great wound in the universe . There was nothing for me to say : nothing . I held him , held what there was to hold . I held him . Because I could love , I realized I could hate . And I realized that I would feed my hatred , feed it every day and every hour . I would keep it healthy , I would make it strong , and I would find a use for it one day . I listened to Caleb 's breathing and I watched him in the slowly growinglight of the morning . He picked up a cigarette and lit it and I watched the glow , watched his nose , watched his eyes . Neither did he have anything more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that he had to get up soon , to go down to the garment center . He put out his cigarette . I put my arms around him . And so we slept . Caleb went downtown with our father in the morning , but by noon , he had left the garment center , forever , and he left New York the early morning of the following day . This is one of the encounters with Caleb which is most dim in my memory , one of the moments which inexorablyrecedes ; most dim , because it was to prove so crucial ; most dim , because so painful . I was home around midday , I think . I suppose I had been to school , though I have no recollection of having been at school . Our mother was silent , but I knew she had been crying . Caleb was throwing socks in a bag . " What 's the matter ? " I was standing at the door of our room . I had n't asked my mother anything . " I 'm going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ? Where ? " " California . " I did n't say anything . I watched him throw some shirts into a baga little cardboard bag . " California ? " " Yes . " He threw some more stuff into the bag . " Where 's Daddy ? " " Daddy , " he said , " is at work . " " When are you going ? " " I 'm taking a bus out of here in the morning . " " You want to take me with you ? " " No. "  |p241I  sat there . I watched him . I did n't want to cry , and I was n't going to cry . I did n't cry . He kept on doing what he was doing . I sat on the bed . " All right , " I said . And I walked out of the room . Then I walked out of the house . I had nothing in my mind . I did n't know what I was doing . I did n't know where I was going . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen it before this day . Everything seemed scrubbed , scoured , older than the oldest bones , and cleaner . Everything lay beneath a high , high , immaculate sky , and was washed as clean as it could be . Everything  --  and everything was still : the stairs down which I walked , the doors I passed , the garbage , the cats , the old wine bottles , the radiators , the drying scum-bag on the steps , the light in the doorway of the vestibule , the boys in the doorway , the white curtains in the window across the street the blue sedan which briefly cut off the sight of the curtains , the street , long , long , long , the grocery store , the tailor shop , the candystore , the church which faced us when I reached the end of the block , the red lights , the green lights , the long , loaded buses and the people in the buses , the subway kiosks and the people coming upstairs and downstairs , the policeman 's badge catching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetable stand , with greens , with turnips , potatoes , okra , onions , cabbage , cauliflower , apples , pears , the sign over anotherchurch , saying THE YOU DRAY FOR ME CHURCH OF THEAIR , the liquor store and all the bottles in the window , the bar signs , and the women outside the bar , the men standingat the corners , the lampposts , the undertaker parlors , the grain of the sidewalk pavement , the light in the water of the gutter , the polish of the asphalt street , the gratingp242over the sewer 's black and fearful depths , the singing of tires and the crying of brakes , the shape of doorways , the monotony of steps , the order and age of cornices , the height of roofs , the unspeaking sky , the tree , the sparrow , the Public Library , and the plaque there which held the name , CARNEGIE , the stone wall of the park , the people scattered about like bones , the hill , the dying flowers , the height , the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not , as I could never be , and all  --  all  --  were as remote from me as they would have been had I been in my grave and had drilled a hole through my tombstone to peep out at the world . I cared no more than that . I sat down somewhere in the park . The stars came out . I watched the stars , and I counted them . I was really surprised to realize that the sky could be so black , that the sky could be so closed . I looked for the moon , but it was n't there . The moon . For no reason at all , I suddenly missed the moon ; and because I missed the moon so much , I started to cry . But I think that I had never cried this way before . I did not cry in the hope of being comforted . I had no hope . I am not even certain that there was anything at all in my mind  --  what we call the mind . I cried because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining ; they could n't help it , either . Perhaps , like me , they could n't believe that their sentence had been passed , and that now they were to serve it . I am sure that there was nothing in my mind , because , otherwise , my mind would have cracked and I would have had to go mad . I had walked to the very top of the park . Now , I rose , for no particular reason , and started walking back down the hill . It had been daylight when I entered the park , and now it was night ; but I did not start walking uptown toward our house , but downtown , away from it.  |p243It  may be odd , I do n't know , but I did n't think of what was happening at the house , and I was not afraid to walk through the city , though I had always been afraid before . I did not feel , either , even remotely defiant . I do n't think I even saw the cops : I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in no way resembles the American one . I watched the boys and girls , who , oddly enough , did not challenge me or make any move to menace me , though I walked very slowly and must surely have looked very odd . But , no , they went on with what they were doing and I went my way ; and only when I got to the outskirts of Harlem  --  only when the streets began to be sedate and quiet , and the faces began to turn pale  --  did I think that , by now , at my house , they must really be worried . I realized that I could not , after all , spend the night walking the streets . So I walked west , and I started back uptown . But I did not , in fact , get home that night . It may be that , at the very bottom of my mind , I had never intended to go home . Or , that , as home came closer , my nerve deserted me . It may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be that I was afraid of seeing Caleb . But my memory , for reasons which are not at all mysterious , blurs everything here , resists going over the ground again . This was the night that I discoveredchaos , or perhaps it was the night that chaos discoveredme ; but it certainly began the most dreadful time of my life , a time I am astounded to have survived . It was the first of my nights in hell . It was this night , or a night very soon after it , that I first smoked marihuana , in a cellar with some other , older boys , and a very funky girl . I know that it was around this time that I became friends with an older boy , named Francis , who helped to protectp244me in the streets ; I know that the first time I ever smoked marihuana , I was with him and his friends , and I remember the cellar , which was near the Apollo Theater . Francislater turned into a junkie , and , after many attempts to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut his wrists . But we had traveled the same road together for awhile . And neither of us had had any reason for not doing whatever came to mind . Or , it may have been this night , or a night very soon thereafter , that I was picked up by a Harlem racketeer named Johnnie , big , Spanishlooking , very sharp , and very good-natured  --  goodnaturedwith me , anyway  --  who took me home and gave me my first drink of brandy , and took me to bed . He frightened me , or his vehemence , once the lights were out , frightened me , and I did n't like it , but I liked him . I had to keep him from buying things for me which I could n't take home ; he was an even greater protection than Francis , and it took me a long time to break with him , simply because he was fond of me  --  he was often the only person to whom I could turn . Eventually , Johnnie and another pimp tangled , and Johnnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same road together for awhile . After the beating , the shouting , the tears , when I got home next day , my mother handed me Caleb 's note . I took it in the room and lay down on the bed . Little BrotherYou should n't have walked out on me like that . I must have sounded pretty mean , but you should have known I did n't mean it for you . I just could n't take working on that job . It was n't so much for me . It was for Daddy . I could n't stand the way they talked to him , like he was somebody 's hired clown . But I did n't say nothing.  |p245Just  , when the twelve o'clock blew , I walked out . AndI decided that I would have to leave this city . I think I 'll be better off someplace else and I 'm going to work in the shipyard in California . And I could n't take you with me , Leo , you know that . You got your schooling to finish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of life would it be , when you hanging out with me ? You 've got very good sense , Leo , like I 've always said . You 're much smarter than I am and so I know you 'll see it my way as soon as you cool off . But I 'm mighty sorry I had to leave without saying good-bye to you like I wanted to do . Take care of Mama and Daddy as well as you can and take care of yourself . I 'll write you as soon as I get an address and please write to me . Do n't be mad at me . When you get older , you 'll see that this was the best way . I guess I love you more than anything in this world , Leo , and I want you to.grow up to be a happy healthy man . So , no matter how I thought about it , it seemed to me that this was the best way for everybody concerned . And I want you to have some flesh on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't forget me . Your brother , CalebCaleb got into some trouble in California , and he joined the Army . I hit the streets . I realized I was shivering , and I pulled Madeleine 's big towel closer around me . Then I dropped it and left her kitchen and crawled , naked , into bed beside her . I slept . She woke me up . We made , as the saying goes , love . Then , I slept again.  |p246Like  in the movies , I woke to the smell of coffee and the sound and smell of bacon . I do n't really know how it goes in the movies , but I know that I lay there on my back , apprehensive , drained , empty  --  drained and empty without having , really , touched , or been touched . Then , as she entered the room , smiling , in a scarlet negligee , and before I had had time to pretend that I was still sleeping , I realized that I had a performance to give . I realized that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , mainly , I wanted to get that white flesh in my hands again , I simply wanted to fuck her : and this was not because I liked her . " You awake ? " My God , she was cheerful . She sat down on the bed . I made a sound , it was meant to convey , No , and I turned away and then I turned toward her again and I pulled her down on top of me . " I got breakfast on the stove , sugar . " " I got breakfast here . " And , after a moment , I said , " All you got to do is reach out your hand . " " Let me turn down the fire under the bacon . " I laughed . " You do that . " She wavered into the kitchen . She came back . I took her hand . " Did you put out the fire ? under the bacon ? " " Yes . " " No , you did n't . Put it out now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her robe . " I want to watch you do it . " I laughed . But Madeleine certainly was n't anybody 's freak . She claimed it was n't because she was unwilling . It was because I was too big . Well , all right . And we fooled around , while I became more and more aware of the smell of coffee and more and more , rather , worried about the disappearing bacon , and we ended up doing it likep247mama and daddy . Well . All right . And she went away again , and I fell asleep again . When I woke up again , she was dressed , in blue . " Listen , my love , " she said  --  my love !  --  " everything you need is out there in the kitchen . I 've got a rehearsal , and I 've got to run . Here 's an extra set of keys . " She put them on top of my jeans . She looked at me . " So . Will you be here when I get back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What time do you get back ? " She looked at her watch . " Well . It 's nearly two now . Not before six or seven . " Slowly , and most reluctantly , my head began to clear . " I might go home . But I think I 'll sleep awhile . I think I 'll be here when you get back . But , if I 'm not going to be here , I 'll call you at Lola 's . " " All right , sugar . That 's a good boy . " I turned my head into the pillows . " Oh , shit . WhateverI am , God knows I 'm not a good boy . " " Oh , well . What God knows and what I know seem never to coincide . " " Get on to your rehearsal . " " Are n't you going to kiss me ? Just for luck ? " She leaned down ; I leaned up ; I kissed her . " Break a leg . " " Thanks , sugar . See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quiet with the door . So there I was . And I went back to sleep . When I finally persuaded myself to get up , and had showered , it was past six o'clock . I decided that I had better go and see what was happening out on Bull Dog Road . I was just about to pick up the phone and call Madeleine , when the phone rang . I jumped . It sounded very strange and even ominous in the empty place . Then ,  |p248I  wondered if I should answer it . But Madeleine had n't said anything about not answering it ; I was pretty sure she did n't have any boyfriends in town . I decided to take a chance  --  she might be calling me . " Hello ? " It was Lola 's voice . " Hello . " " Hello ? What number is this , please ? " I told her . " Well  --  is Miss Madeleine Overstreet there ? " " No . She 's at the theater . " " To whom am I speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking ?  --  may I ask ? " " Lola San-Marquand is my name . " " Oh . Why did n't you say so ? My name is Leo Proud-hammer . " " Leo ? Leo ! What are you doing at Madeleine 's house ? " " I 'm cleaning up the joint . A boy 's got to make a living . " There was a silence , a calculating silence . " When I came in , " said I carefully , " just before she left , she said she was rushing to rehearsal . " " We broke early . Will you leave a message for Madeleine ? The call has been changed . We are to work in the theater tonight , on the Green Barn stage , from eightthirtyuntil twelve . She is not to come to my home , but to go directly to the theater . " " Okay . I got it . Eight-thirty . " " Will you write that down ? " " How do you spell theater ? " " Oh ! Leo , you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No. "  | " Well , she will inform you of the exact hour tomorrowmorning when Saul will watch your scene . " " Oh ? Is he watching us tomorrow ? " " He has been watching you for weeks . You simply have n't realized it . " " What happens if I ca n't find Barbara ? " " Then you will simply have to call Saul I know nothing of these matters . Saul keeps the details of the teaching side of his life far from me . I only see the results . Write down the message for Madeleine . I hope she 's coming home . You would n't  --  would you  --  know where Madeleinewould be likely to go in the event that she does not come home ? " " I just work here , lady . " " I see . Thank you . Good-bye . " " Good-bye . " I put down the receiver . I felt an unwilling and uneasyexcitement . So , he was going to watch us ; and that was something . But why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? And that was something else . But I had to get home , so Barbara and I could work tonight . I wrote out the note for Madeleine , saying that I would see her , or call her , after my class  --  my first class !  --  tomorrow . The note sounded , perhaps , a bit too jubilant , but I thought , Fuck it , and I left it in the middle of the table , weighted down with a clock . Madeleine 's door faced the steps , and an elderly man and his wife were mounting these steps as I jubilantly bounced out of Madeleine 's door , and locked it behind me . They stared at me as though I were a ghost , and they really seemed , for a moment , unable to move . Perhaps their terror , for an instant , terrified me , I do n't know ; anyway , for less than a second , snake to rabbit , we stoodp250immobilized by each other . Then , I said gently , " You can keep coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite . " This broke the charm , and they came briskly to the landing . He had now found his voice , and he asked me sternly , " What are you doing in this building , boy ? " " I was looking for a file , so I could sharpen my teeth . Suh . But I could n't find none . " I grinned . " See ? " I shrugged . " Some days are like that . " Then I crooned , " Oh , dat old man ribber , he sure do keep rolling along ! Ai n't it de truf ! Laws-a-massy , hush my mouf , he he he and yuk yuk yuk ! " and I tapdanced down the stairs . At least they now knew that I was n't a ghost , but it did n't seem to reassure them . I went straight home , in a taxi , but there was no one there . I looked upstairs and downstairs for a note , but there was n't any . I supposed that Jerry and Barbara had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , as I had no way of getting to town and no more money , even if I did get there , I scrambled myself some eggs and started reading the scene from Waiting for Lefty . I had n't got far , when I heard a car coming . But it was n't our car , though it stopped in front of the house , and the powerful lights fell over the line I was reading : Sid : The answer is no  --  a big electric sign looking dozen on Broadway ! I put down my book , and I walked to the porch , which was bathed in light , as I was trapped in light . " What 's the matter ? What do you want ? " Some reflex , or perhaps some whisper from my ancestors , helped to keep my mortal terror out of my voice . I sounded angry , and I immediately realized that this was , for the moment , anyway , the only tone I could take . " Get that light out of my eyes ! What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to put up your hands , " said a drawling voice , " and then we 'll put out the light . " I put up my hands . There they were , of course , in blue , two of them , of course , white , of course . One stood by the car , while the other came up to me , and frisked me . Cops love frisking black boys , they want to find out if what they 've heard is true . " All right . You 're coming down to the station with us . " People become frightened in very different ways  --  the ways in which they become frightened may sometimes determine how long they live . Here I was , in the country , and on a country road , alone , facing two armed white men who had legal sanction to kill me ; and if killing me should prove to be an error , it would not matter very much , it would not , for them , be a serious error . It would not cost them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would care about my death could certainly never reach them . I knew this . It was more vivid to me than the policeman 's hands , his breath , his holster . I knew that I was frightened , and I knew how frightened I was . But I remembered , vaguely , reading somewhere that animals can smell fear , and that when they do , they leap and they devour . I was determined that these animals should not smell my fear , and this determination deflected , so to speak , my terror from them to myself : my life was in my hands . I had not yet guessed why they had come for me , and I did not know what was going to happen . But I was going to scheme as long as I had breath , and outwit them if I could . So I did not whimper , What for ? I ai n't done nothing , but asked , as deliberately as I could , and as mockingly as I could , " What is it that you imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reflexes . They were accustomed to black boys whimpering , or , on the other hand , defiant , and it was easy , in either case , for them to know exactly what to do  --  to amuse themselves with the whimper or the defiance , and beat the shit out of the boy , and sometimes to beat the boy to death . I had to walk a tightrope between groveling and shouting , and had to hope that a faintly mocking amusement would be sufficientlyunexpected to confound their reflexes and immobilizetheir impulses , at least until I got to the station , where I would have to begin to calculate again . Central to my calculations was the terror of finding myself begging for mercy : I hoped I would be able to see that momentcoming , and nullify that moment by causing it to come too late . There I was , in the car , handcuffed , in the back . We moved along the road , fast ; it was , I carefully noted , the road to town . So , I dared , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're arresting me for ? " Neither of them said anything , from which I concluded that they either did not know what to say , or were undecided as to what tone to take . I thought , They came to my house , so even they must know that I 'm a stranger in this town , and am working with people sufficiently celebrated to get them into trouble . But then I thought , If they were really worried about that , then they would n't have come at all . I thought , Saul and Lola and Rags do n't really care much about me ; I ca n't depend on them . The two or three movie stars who had been driftingin and out of our ken all summer did n't know me from any other shoeshine boy  --  though I was determined , if I had to , to use their names as a threat . Barbara and Jerry cared , but where were they ? And Madeleine cared.  |p253Madeleine  . She gets to the theater at eight-thirty , but maybe they 'll let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I remembered the elderly man and his wife . Solid citizens , they had done their duty and called the police . It was unbelievably funny . If I had not been handcuffed , I think I might have laughed . But it was not a laughing matter . We arrived at the station , which looked ominous indeed , and ostentatiously crossed the sidewalk , while people stared at us , and nudged other people , and came up behind us , and began gathering , staring , on the steps . We walked into the station . A colored boy . They arrested a colored boy . I becamefaint , and hot and cold with terror . It was in vain that I told myself , Leo , this is n't the South . I knew better than to place any hope in the accidents of North Americangeography . This was America , America , America , and those people out there , my countrymen , had been tearing me limb from limb , like dogs , for centuries . I would not be the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . I thought , I wonder if Madeleine has charged me with rape ? But , no , I thought , do n't you have to be caught in the act ? Then I thought , No . They just need Miss Ann 's word . But I knew if I allowed myself to think this way , I would lose my nerve completely . The man was behind the desk , and I forced myself to look him in the eye ; and I forced myself , nearly fainting , to attack : " Why have I been arrested ? " He looked at me with a curiously impersonal loathing . He was fat , red-faced , Irish , a true believer , a regular fellow . " It 's just routine , boy . We 'll satisfy your curiosity when we get around to it . " " I 'm sorry . But I think the law compels you to tell mep254what the charges are against me . You have no right to hold me without charges . " His face got redder , and he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other  --  if I had allowedmyself to drop my eyes , I would have fallen to the floor . " Are you trying to tell me my business , boy ? " " I 'm only telling you what my rights are , as a citizen of this country . " He and his buddies laughed . I realized that I had made a tactical error . " What 's the matter with you , boy ? You some kind of nut ? Are you a Red ? " I said nothing , only looked at him . Again , he darkenedand swelled . He did not know how frightened I was . He was , Allah be praised , far too dense for that : but he knew that I hated him , and would have been happy to see him dead . And this baffled him and angered him  --  which increased my danger  --  for he , after all , did not hate me . I was not real enough for that . I was not as real for him as he , unspeakably , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told myself that there was nothing I could do , now , to minimize the danger . All that I could do was control my fear . I was not booked , I was not fingerprinted . I was taken into another room , and left alone there for awhile  --  to meditate , I supposed , on my sins , or else to count over my blues . I knew that this probably meant that they were not yet certain to what extent they were to be allowed to vent themselves on me . I took this as a good sign , though I also knew that this might merely mean that I was being saved for their more accomplished sadists . I knew that it was best not to think , not to undermine myself with visions of what was before me . For the moment , there was nothing Ip255could do . There was no way to tell what would happen , who would enter , when the door opened again . And , not altogether consciously , I began to evolve a trick which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo , I said , you ca n't know what 's going to happen , and , until it happens , you ca n't know what to do . You 're going to be surprised  --  so be surprised . That 's the only way you 'll be ready . But when the door opened  --  so much for the most impeccable theories !  --  I was not surprised . Two plainclothesmenstood there , with the elderly man and his wife . I stood up , and we looked at each other . How can I explain this ? I still thought that they were funny . " Is that the boy ? " one of the detectives asked . " Yes , " said the man ; and " That 's him , " said his wife . They stood as though they were in a jungle , protected by their hunters , but poised to scream and run at the leap of the jungle cat . " This gentleman , " said one of the plainclothesmen , " says he saw you coming out of an apartment a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He raised his eyebrows at me . Well , they might beat me up when the couple left the room , but they were n't going to beat me while the couple were still in it ; and I did n't care , abruptly . I was tired of this vicious comedy , and ashamed of myself for playing any role whatever in it ; something turned in me , in an instant , cold and hard  --  it might have been the abject posture of the old man and his wife . I said , " The gentleman is a nervous old lady . He does n't know whether I have any business in the apartmentor not . " I felt myself beginning to be angry , and I forced myself to take a breath . " The apartment is rented by Miss Madeleine Overstreet . She is an actress , and shep256is working here in The Green Barn Theater , and I am an actor , and we are friends . " I was damned if 1 was going to cop a plea , and say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her joint . Fuck the mother-fuckers . " I believe the gentleman will tell you that when he saw me , I was locking the door of the apartment and had the keys in my hand . The gentleman will certainly tell you that , if his eyesight is not failing , and if he is in the habit of telling the truth . Which , " I could not resist adding , though I knew it to be foolish , " on both counts , I doubt . " " Do you have the keys on you now ? " the plainclothesmanasked . " I refuse to answer any questions until I have been allowed to make a phone call , which is my right by law , or unless my lawyer is present . " Well , it was funny , all right . I saw what they saw  --  a funky , little black boy , talking about his lawyer . And I did n't give a shit . All you can do is beat my ass . I knew they were too dumb and too scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fuck you , miserable white motherfuckers . Fuck you . I stared at the detective who was askingthe questions , and I charged my eyes to say , Baby , if my prick was a broomstick , I 'd sure make your tonsils know that you had an ass-hole . Believe me . Oh , yes . Now , come on , you fagot , and beat my ass . But  --  1 had frightened them . They did not know what to make of it . I do n't mean at all to suggest that they believed me . They did n't believe me . They thought that I was mad . But they had not intended to tangle with a lunatic : they had merely been ordered to pick up a black boy . Well , here I was : black , certainly , and not much more than a boy . And there they were . Now , I was dangerousp257to them . They did not know what might happen  --  if I were not a lunatic , then my story might be true . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they might be in trouble , and they might lose their pensions . If I could happen , then anything could happen . I could see this in their eyes . " What 's your name ? " " I have told you that I will not answer any more questions until I am allowed to make a phone call , or until I am advised by my lawyer . You have not booked me , you have not charged me  --  it is you who are acting against the law ! " One of them moved toward me then , but the other one checked him . Thank God , the couple were still in the room . Or thank my ancestors . " You say you 're an actor ? " one of them asked , in a friendly , conciliatory tone . I sat down on my bench , and folded my arms . " Young man , " said the elderly gentleman  --  at anothermoment , I might have been sorry for him  --  " I just thoughtI did n't mean to cause you any trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " caused me any trouble at all . But I can make a whole lot of trouble for you . " The plainclothesmen and I looked at each other  --  for what seemed a long time . Then , they all left the room . And I was alone again , a long time , while my anger subsidedand my fear returned . Someone now entered whom I had not seen before , bluff , hearty , red-faced , who called me by my name and slapped me on the back . " So , you 're an actor ! Why did n't you tell us that in the first place , Leo ? You ca n't blame us for a little misunderstanding . Mistakes will happen , wo n't they ? "  |p258I  stared at him , and I said nothing . I really did not know what to say . " I used to have a brother in show business . " He choked a little on his monstrous cigar ; he sat down next to me . I decided he was probably from Texas . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were born . " He chuckled , wrapped in the veils of memory . " Yes , he used to do a routine with the great George M. Cohan himself  --  now , there was a trouper ! And a prince . A prince among men , Leo , I assure you . " I was very young then . I watched him with an amazementwhich steadily filled with loathing . I really could not move . " But it 's a rough life , show business . Very rough . I know you realize that , Leo , you look like a very intelligentboy . " He chuckled again , and nudged me . " But it 's got its good side , too , eh , Leo  --  just between us men ? The best broads . I bet the girls love you , do n't they , Leo ? " He leaned confidentially toward me , and winked . " You know , there 's a saying , Big man , little tool , little man , all tool ! Ha-ha-ha ! " He pinched my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to say it , but I can see it in your eyes . You 've been around a little , young as you are  --  how old are you , Leo ? " He looked at me . I looked at him . I said nothing . There was a choked , ugly pause . " All right . Let me guess . It 's hard to tell with your people . Let 's see . Seventeen ? Twenty-two ? " He was very , very good at his job , and I think that I probably would have made some sign if I had been able to move my head . I simply stared at him , hypnotized , dumb ; and now really frightened , more terribly , more profoundly , than I had been before . When he realized that I was not going to answer , hep259said , " Leo , like I said before , mistakes will happen . All of us are human , and we all make mistakes . That 's why we invented erasers . " He was watching me closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff and hearty and he continued to smile . " I hate to say it , Leo , but you know as well as I do that people in show business , they tend to be , well , kind of lax  --  lax in their morals . That 's the reasonmy brother finally just had to get out . He could n't stand the life . " He looked at me with great sympathy . " I 'm not saying this for you , you look like a fine , upstandingboy . I bet your mother 's proud of you . Where does your mother live , Leo ? " " In Johannesburg , " I said . " She 's a missionary . " He did not know what to say to this , and my face did not help him . I could see him struggling to find a map somewhere , but it was difficult to ask me for one . " Oh . Well , then , I 'm sure she would n't want you mixed up in bad company . And , Leo , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends are mighty bad company for a fine-looking boy like you . Mighty bad company . That 's how this mistakewas made . We was n't looking for you  --  we was n't expecting to find no colored people in that house . Of course not . You can see that . No . We 've been getting complaints about  --  oh , certain parties , and it 's our job to investigate all complaints and we do our job . Now , I 'm old enough to be your father , Leo , so let me give you a word of advice . " He paused . " Show business broke my brother 's heart . That 's a fact . He said "  --  he jabbed me with his forefinger , and it hurt ; I knew he wanted it to hurt  --  " I wish I had stayed with my own people . That 's what he said . " He leaned back triumphantly . " You see my point , Leo ? You stay with your own people and you 're sure to stay out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored people in this town  --  they 're just the nicest bunch of colored people you 'd ever want to meet , they work hard and save their money , and go to church . But this crowd you hang out with , Leo , with their wild parties and loose women and smoking marihuana  --  they'regoing to bring you to grief , son . You see , I said , son , ' it just slipped out before I thought , but I mean it . That 's just the way I feel . And I just hope you wo n't go to no more of those parties , Leo . I 'd like you to promise me you wo n't continue to undermine your health and your morals by  --  smoking all that marihuana and running with loose white women  --  " I stood up . I said , " If I 'm under arrest , arrest me . If not , please let me go . " We stared at each other . He might talk about the " bad " company I kept , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented him from rising , and bouncing me about that room like a ball . It was in his eyes , it was in the air , it was in the muscle that beat in his forehead . And I doubted , as we stared at each other , that even this fear would control him very long . My luck had run out . I felt my bowels loosen and lock  --  for fear ; and my mouth turned dry . But , anyway , all my words were gone . I 'd run my course . Silence , now , was my only hope , for if I could not open my mouth , I could not beg for mercy . The door opened , and one of the plainclothesmenstood there , saying something . I did n't hear what he said , because , when the door opened , I heard Madeleine 's voice in the other room . And I simply walked out , in the direction of the voice . She was standing in front of the desk , with Saul and Lola . Saul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her hands and legs were shaking . She was staring at the manp 261behind the desk with a malevolence which would have done credit to Medea . " Now , miss , " he was saying , " it was just a mistake , and we 're very sorry for it . I would n't let it get me all upset . See , " he said , turning to me as I appeared , " we have n't harmed a hair of his precious head . He 's just as good as new . " " A mistake , " she said . " A mistake . You dirty , racist bastard , you 're goddamn lucky you did n't harm a hair of his head . You 'd lose that badge so goddamn fast your head would never stop spinning . " " I do n't like your language , miss . " " Fuck you , " she said . " Fuck you . You goddamn Nazi . " Then , she started to cry . " Madeleine , " Lola said . She walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . I will try to put it in extremely simple language , so that you can understand it . The people standing before you are more powerful than you . I am more powerful than you , and I can break you by making a phone call . I am responsible for my theatricalcompany , and nothing will prevent me from fulfilling that responsibility . With no justification whatever , you have taken Mr. Proudhammer out of his home and brought him here and forced him , and forced us , to undergoneedless harassment . You will take good care not to molest any of my company in future  --  else , you will have no future , and I am not a woman to make idle threats . You have already , allow me to inform you , rendered yourself liable to suit for false arrest . Come , Leo . Goodnight , my Nazi friends . " " Heil Hitler , " said Madeleine , and Lola took my arm and we walked out.  |p262We  got into the San-Marquand car . There were still people in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . " How could you two be so foolish ? " he asked us , then . " We ? " said Madeleine . " We ? " What did we do ? " " You know what the people in this town are like , " Saul said . " The people in this town , " said Madeleine . " The people in this town . I hope the river rises the moment we get out of here , and drowns them all like rats . Like the rats they are . But why are we foolish ? " I said nothing . I leaned back in the car , scarcely listening . " Not foolish , Saul , " said Lola , " but , surely , a little in-discreet . " " What do you mean , " shouted Madeleine , " indiscreet ! Leo left my house in broad goddamn Sunday daylight , and went to his house  --  and the cops dragged him to the police station , because he 'd been to my house . Now , what the fuck are you talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every summer for a long time , Madeleine , " Saul said . " We know the people and the people know us and we 've never had any trouble . You have to realize that this is a small town and the people here are not very sophisticated  --  they 're not bad people . You just have to  --  understand their limits . That 's how you manage to play a character on the stage , by understandingthe character 's limits . That 's the only way you can play Hedda Gabler , for instance  --  by understandingHedda 's limits . I do n't think that 's so unreason-able . " " I am not Hedda Gabler , " Madeleine said , " but if Ip263ever get a chance to play her , I 'll certainly pretend that she 's living in this town . But what this town could really use is a couple of Negro cooks , named Lady Macbeth and Medea . " " You mean , " I said  --  but I scarcely knew why I was bothering to speak  --  " you never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? " " Leo , " said Lola , " do n't be touchy . " I looked at her . " Touchy . All right . I wo n't be touchy . I just asked a question . Is that what you mean , Saul ? " " I do n't think there 's any point in discussing it now , " Saul said . " You are upset , understandably upset , we would say . We do not blame you , Leo , but our schedule has been thoroughly disrupted and we must return to the theater . If you are going home , I 'll drop you . " " Thanks , " I said , after a moment , " let 's do that . " And I leaned back again . I did n't know what Madeleine was thinking . I did n't care . I was surprised to realize that I did n't care , and a little ashamed . I knew that she was hurt and baffled ; and she wanted to reach me , but did not know how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the road leading out of town . Nobody said anything . We passed the theater . The lights were on . Our signs were up . " Maybe , " said Madeleine , haltingly , " you 'd rather watch rehearsal , Leo ? Especially as there 's nobody at home in your place . " Saul did not slow down . I said , " No , thanks , Madeleine . I think I 'd just like to get on home . Nothing else will happen to me tonight . " And so we stopped before the whitewashed house . Ip264could see that no one had come home yet , because the light was still burning as I had left it . I got out of the car . " Thanks for bailing me out , " I said to Saul and Lola . Then , I said to Madeleine , " Please , do n't you feel badly . Do n't you feel badly . These things happen . " She smiled . There were still tears on her face . " Do you want me to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound between a grunt and a cough , looking straight ahead . I said , " No . I 'll see you tomorrow . Good-night , all . " And the car drove away , and I went into the house . I sat down in my chair , and I picked up my book . The words bounced around the page , and I followed them around in the hope that they would eventually do something which could capture my attention . I wondered where Barbara and Jerry were . Sid : But that sort of life ai n't for the dogs which is us . Christ , baby ! I get like thunder in my chest when we 're together . If we went off together I could maybe look the world straight in the face , spit in its eye like a man should do . God damn it , it 's trying to be a man on the earth . Two in life together . Sid 's ravings meant nothing to me . The lines seemed bombastic and empty and false ; I wondered why I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver those lines . And , anyway  --  should I ? Should I submit myself to the judgment of a Saul ? I put down my book and I turned out the light . I went up the stairs to my room . I suddenly did n't want to talk to anybody or to see anybody , and I sat there in the dark . I looked at the sky . I picked up my guitar and I strummed it a little . Then , I put it down.  |p265The  night was very still . I heard the car coming when the car was still a long way off . If they had heard of my adventure , they would want to talk about it . I did n't want to talk . The car stopped in front of our door . Then , the lights went on downstairs . The car door slammed . I moved back from the window . Barbara called my name . I could n't sit and hide in the dark ; these were my friends . I opened my door and I walked downstairs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two been ? " " We 've been to the movies , " Barbara said , " but we hear you 've been in jail . " " A slight misunderstanding , " I said . I sat down on the porch . " Did they really come all the way out here to get you ? " Jerry asked . " Oh , yes . They were right here . " " I 'll be damned . I swear to God , they got bacon fat where their brains should be . Jesus Christ . Do n't they have anything else to do ? " He sounded  --  and I was very surprised to hear it  --  as though he were on the verge of tears . " But what did they want ? " Barbara asked . " Why did they come here ? " " They saw a black boy leaving a white lady 's apartment , " I said , " and they had to do their duty . You know how that is . " She turned whiter than Madeleine had been , and her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , after a moment . " they did n't do anything to you ? " " No . They just scared me . " I stood up . " They humiliated me . They made me feel like a dog . They tried to turn me into something worse than they are . They hadp266a wonderful time doing it , now they all feel more like men . And I was very lucky . They were afraid to go too far . They were afraid the Workshop might make a stink . " I paused , and I laughed . " So now I owe my life to Saul and Lola . " " But they were all right , were n't they ? " Jerry asked . I shrugged . I did n't want to pursue it , because I did n't get any pleasure out of seeing Jerry hurt . " They were all right . " But I had to add , " Saul did say that he thought we were foolish . " " Yes , " said Barbara . " He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . We thought you might be there , because  --  well , we knew that Madeleine had a rehearsal . " " Do you think I was foolish ? " " Do I ? " She stared at me . " My God , Leo , how can you ask me that ? " She shrugged . " I might think you 're foolish , because I do n't think Madeleine 's worth your time  --  " " Why ? " " Oh , I do n't want to talk about that , it 's none of my business , and it 's got nothing to do with her . I like her well enough . I just do n't think she 's good enough for you  --  but , you know , that does n't give me any reason to call the cops . So , you 're foolish . So is everybody else . That 's got nothing to do with the cops . Wow . I wish it had been me . The police chief of this town would be looking for a job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " I mean it . After all , I 'm an heiress . I do n't always like being an heiress , but that does n't mean that I 'm not prepared to use it . " She came over to me and kissed me quickly on the forehead . " Poor Leo . I know you do n't want to talk about it anymore . "
