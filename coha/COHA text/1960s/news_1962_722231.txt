txt A city-wide strike of 9,000 electricians was set to start it 8 A. M. today as negotiations to avert the walkout failed . Mayor Wagner , who intervened personally in an attempt to ? prevent the strike , announced the breakdown of bargaining at 1:15 A. M. after spending nearly nine hours with negotiators for Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and for 600 contractors . The Mayor entered the talks after two months of bargaining had failed to produce an agreement . Although the Mayor announced that the strike was on , both sides agreed to resume negotiations at 10 o'clock this morning . Air . Wagner said he would be available to meet with them if he was needed Fact-finding Rejected In his last-minute attempt to prevent a walkout , which ultimately might shut down the city 's vast construction industry , with 200,000 workers , the Mayor unsuccessfully sought to win acceptance of a proposal to submit the issues in dispute to fact-finding . The employers accepted , but the union , saying it had a mandate from the members to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal . The main point in contention had been the union 's demand for a four-hour day . But last night ' a Local 3 spokesman inH:Iicated that the labor group ' was not irrevocably committed to that demand , but that it did want a shorter work week . Industry negotiators , led by Efrem A. Kahn , had refused to discuss any other subject until the union removed the topic from the bargaining table . Local 3 negotiators , headed by Harry Van Arsdale Jr. , business manager , had refused to talk about anything else until the employers first discussed a cut in hours . Despite this deadlock , the Mayor was able to win a promise from both sides that essential private and public services would be maintained in the event of a strike . This set at rest reports that a walkout would mean " a dark city . " The Mayor received the guarantee of uninterrupted service late yesterday afternoon soon after arriving at the Commodore Hotel , where both sides were waiting for him . Then he and his aides , Labor Commissioner Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a panel of Federal , state and city mediators went into separate sessions  --  first with the industry and then with the union . He left for a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , promising to return later and " to spend the night if it will help avert a strike . " Report on Pickets There were reports last night that the union was considering not posting picket lines . If so , this would prevent the broadening of the strike into a general tie-up , for a few days at least , of the $1,250,000,000 a year construction industry . Other crafts , it was suggested , could still perform their jobs , provided the builders did not decide to shut down . Earlier this week Mr. Felix made a suggestion to leave the subject of hours in the hands of a high-level , fact-finding committee . Both sides turned down the proposal . The industry , however , said it might have accepted the proposal had it called for study by the fact-finders of other issues as well . The guarantees made to the Mayor covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals and devices , municipal and government services essential to the health and safety of residents , hospitals , incinerators , sewage disposal plants , bridges , ferries , and police and fire operations . The private functions covered by the service pledge included private and voluntary hospitals , blood banks , nursing homes , homes for the aged , child-care institutions and food and drug ( processing plants . ? The Mayor also announced he would set up an emergency board to rule " on other requests for service . " Similar boards were set up in earlier strikes affecting the city 's fuel and milk supplies . The last strike in the industry , in 1941 , was a token " blackout " by the union for a few hours . The last major stoppage was forty years ago . Since then the union and the industry have been noted for their long record of responsible dealing . Mr. Van Arsdale , the author of the four-hour day demand , has insisted this is not an effort to fatten pay envelopes with overtime wages . He has said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread joblessness in the future as a result of automation . Local 3 members have had a contractual six-hour day since 1934 . But because of the shortage of skilled electricians they have recently been working a seventh hour at time-and-ahalf rates . The union has had to bring in about 2,000 electricians from other cities to fill the demand . Under the old contract ? which expired on Dec. 31 but which was extended until this morning after court action by the employers ? electricians earned $4.40 an hour for a sixhour day and $6.60 for the seventh hour . In addition , they received welfare and pension benefits worth about $2.20 more an hour . The industry estimated the old arrangement brought the workers a weekly minimum pay check of $165 . If that figure were used as base pay for a twenty-hour week . the hourly rate would go to $8.25 , and the average hourly rate , including overtime , would be $10.02 . Mr. Van Arsdale called these figures exaggerated . Statement Disputed In a related development yesterday , Boris Pregel , chairman of the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sciences , charged he had been quoted out of context by Mr. Van Arsdale . Mr. Van Arsdale had asked Dr. Pregel when he thought the four-hour day would be general in the United States . He quoted Dr. Pregel as having replied : " By 1970 the four-hour day will be a must in the United States . " Dr. Pregel said yesterday his view was that the arrival of the nuclear age would create " a leisure-stricken people " and that " the four-hour workday must come In an organized manner , linked to the orderly progress of productivity . " Dr. Pregel , who made his statements in an interview in his office at 630 Fifth Avenue , was drawn into the controversy as a result of a new book , " America Faces the Nuclear Age . " In this volume , a textual report of a Cooper Union Forum , published by Sheridan House , he states : " Automation will wipe out , whole strata of labor * * It will affect most directly thel specialized skilled and sem1- , skilled workers who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank of unskilled labor .
