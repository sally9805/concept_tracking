txt A long , slow rise toward the boiling point is grimly expected to take place in the underdeveloped world , as it mulls over the " failure " of the recent Delhi conference . The rich and poor nations met under United Nations auspices . And the rich felt they had to give short shrift to the poor . The reason : a gold and trade crisis in the West . Plus the stubborn fact that the wealthy countries will not or can not  --  depending on the viewpoint  --  sacrifice their trading power and position , which they regard as essential to prosperity at home . The developing countries have no power to change this situation  --  only to turn away from the West toward the East . But most of them do n't want to . And the Communist world is even shorter than the West on resources for foreign aid . So Washington reluctantly expects to see a deeper frustration develop , without much consolation for anyone . . Despite some grumbling , the well-to-do countries probably will help the United States out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold big dollar balances . The fact that they do n't cash them already is a major help to the United States . Washington reciprocated by not devaluing the dollar  --  and those balances  --  in terms of gold . But something more is needed from these affluent friends : a " Buy American " program for the present  --  a willingness to flex trading arrangements to take more American goods . There are hopeful signs here that several Western countries are ready to apply some tariff reductions quicker than the " Kennedy round " called for  --  and to let the United States delay its pledge to do the same thing . This would ease the pressure . Interest runs high in seeing who will succeed R. Sargent Shriver as head of OEO . The President 's choice may well determine whether the beleaguered Office of Economic Opportunity will stand or crumble in months ahead . Many knowledgeable observers are forecasting its early demise . The transfer of the director of Head Start to the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare is only the latest clue . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work programs have been transferred'to the Labor Department . If the President taps a big bright name to head the agency , this spin-off could be delayed . If he chooses a line bureaucrat , it could signal the final dismantling of OEO . Trends .. . The Army pins high hopes on Project Delta Falcon . It 's a new effort aimed at familiarizing South Vietnamese with the latest concepts of modern warfare . South Vietnamese infantrymen are being used together with United States air reconnaissance , helicopter gun ships , and troop carriers . The effort is closely related to Washington 's long-range hope of turning over the bulk of the warfare in South Vietnam to Saigon 's forces . In Delta Falcon , proven air concepts are being applied to this combination of forces in many sections of the Delta . The hope is that the Falcon thrust will prove effective in combating trained enemy troops . This , it is felt . will enhance the morale and technical abilities of the South Vietnamese . How and why .. . Sen. Robert F. Kennedy says that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Commission . This comment , made during a campaign tour in Indiana , was in answer to the pointblank question : Would he , if president , question the commission 's conclusion that the assassination of his brother , President John F. Kennedy , was the work of a single psychotic killer ? " No , " the New York Senator replied quietly , " I would not . " He thus cast the family vote flatly against Jim Garrison , New Orleans ' District Attorney . The flamboyant public prosecutor has continued to charge that the President was killed as a result of a widespred conspiracy of which Lee Harvey Oswald was only the figurehead . Theoretically , Clay L. Shaw , an accused retired businessman , is to go on trial next month , though his attorneys may win a further postponement . Mr. Garrison has some ardent supporters who believe the real culprits were whitewashed by the Warren Commission . Senator Kennedy has made it clear he is not one of them .               @ @ @ @ @ @
