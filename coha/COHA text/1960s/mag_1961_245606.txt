THE history of art is to a certain extent one long series of rehabilitations . As styles change , men and periods slip into comparative obscurity , and a later age whisks them back into favor . So it has been to a large degree with the art of France in the 17th century-a century that for a long time seemed too staid and static for modern tastes . Since World War II , museums on both sides of the Atlantic have been fighting for the few surviving works of the 17th century master Georges de La Tour . Last summer , the Louvre put on the biggest exhibit of Nicolas Poussin ever held . <P> This week the Toledo Museum of Art is displaying the first major exhibition of French 17th century art ever shown in the U.S. ( see color ) . The show , billed as " The Splendid Century , " was five years in the gathering , involved scores of French officials from Cultural Minister Andr Malraux on down , includes works from 50 French and U.S. museums . It opened in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Metropolitan Museum of Art , its final stop . <P> In some ways the paintings and sculptures are not native French . In the first years of the century , such " mannerists " as Jacques Bellange and Jacques Callot-a school that liked to dramatize its paintings by theatrical elongations , foreshortenings and tricks of lighting-were still active , but the school as a whole had had its day . New styles were needed , and most of them had to be borrowed . Poussin developed his meticulous classicism in Rome , where he worked most of his life . Philippe de Champaigne moved to Paris from his native Flanders , and a school of naturalists bore the stamp of the Italian Caravaggio . But what the French borrowed they made their own . Under Henri IV ( who ruled from 1589 to 1610 ) and Louis XIII ( 1610-43 ) , France 's artists were free spirits , and they used their freedom well . <P> Pastry Cook 's Path . One name boldly signed to the Splendid Century is Le Nain . It belonged to three famous brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same canvas and rarely signed their first names to anything . But scholars have gone far in separating the three . Antoine , according to contemporary accounts , " excelled in miniatures and portraits in small . " The peasant paintings of Louis , the most talented of the three , were a happy blend of Dutch naturalism and Roman classicism . Mathieu , the most successful , became master painter to the city of Paris , assumed the title of Seigneur de la Jumelle . But this sort of pomposity does not invade his Card Players . The game is tense , the players wary ; an everyday scene becomes a study in suspense . <P> A Le Nain contemporary , the onetime pastry cook Claude Lorrain , was a classicist , but he followed a far different path than Poussin took . He was less interested in ideas or subject matter than in the wonders that nature poured out all around him . He was the first Frenchman to paint similar scenes at different times of day , the first to record the fickle moods of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting should be , but there is a quiet sadness about the yellow daylight and a heavy loneliness about the dancing sea .
