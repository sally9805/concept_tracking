Paris Belongs to Us . " Of all the New Wave films , this is the most original and the richest . " Such is the opinion of many French reviewers . Perhaps they are talking about some other movie . This one is the first full-length effort of a 34-year-old critic ( Cahiers du Cinma ) named Jacques Rivette , and the best that can conscientiously be said for Director Rivette at this point is that he promises handsomely to do better next time . <P> " The whole world is in danger ! Not just a few people but the whole world ! It 's the greatest conspiracy of all time ! " What conspiracy ? The heroine ( Betty Schneider ) does not know . She only knows what she has been told by a possibly paranoid American ( Daniel Crohem ) : that a young man ( Giani Esposito ) she has just met is " next . " The idea obsesses her . It sounds like a mischievous fiction , but suppose it is n't ? And if it is n't , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help me ! " she begs the American . He smiles sadly . " You ca n't fight the Organization . " But she has to try . She visits the young man 's mistress ( Franoise Prvost ) , visits the mistress of a man who may have been murdered by the Organization , visits a sinister intellectual who murmurs something prophetic about " une fatalit biologique . " No clues from any of them . No real reason to believe that the young man is in danger . But suddenly one morning he is dead . <P> Whodunit ? The hero himself ? The American ? The Organization ? Does the Organization actually exist ? Is it just a paranoid delusion ? Is the film a study of psychic contagion ? an attack on the creeping totalitarianism of modern life ? an intricate exercise in confusion ? Director Rivette has suggested the explanation he prefers . " My picture is the adventure of a theory-in turn proposed , set aside , revived , distorted , exhausted . The end cancels the original intention . Nothing has really taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
