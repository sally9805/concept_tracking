 | WILD WEDDING ON A SMALL ISLAND Here am I , /Your special island ! ' says the song from South Pacific . And here it was , gleaming green in the sunrise on the ocean ahead . Its name , to be sure , was not Bali Ha'i . It was , prosaically , Swains . But it was ? and is ? as " special " an island as exists anywhere in the world . To locate it you need 1 ) a large-scale - map of the Pacific and 2 ) a magnifying glass ? or , better , a microscope . Start at American Samoa ( which is small enough to begin with ) : move north and very slightly west from the main island of Tutuila : and after 200 miles of blue nothing ? if your navigation is perfect ? you will come upon the low , lost midge that is Swains ( see map , page 66 ) . Geographically , it is the southernmost of the Tokelau , or Union Islands group , of which the next one , Fakaofo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of American Samoa , and therefore a possession of the United States . But it is a possession in an unusual , almost theoretical , sense , for what makes Swains Island special is that it is ? all three square miles of it ? private property . The dream of a " South Sea island of one 's own " is one of the most persistent and venerable of romantic cliches . But here , on this one dot in the Pacific , dream and cliche become plain fact . For Swains is owned lock , stock and lagoon by a family named Jennings , and has now been so owned ? and occupied -- for more than 100 years . Its known history , to be sure , goes back much farther than that : specifically , to 1606 , when it was sighted and placed on the map by the Portuguese mariner Quiros , exploring the South Pacific under the flag of Spain . He called it Peregrina . The Spaniard Espinosa , happening along a while later , renamed it Isla de Gente Hermosa because its inhabitants -- presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and elegant people that were met with during the voyage . " Since then it has been called QuirOs Island , Olosenga , Jennings and a variety of other names . But the one that has stuck , unfortunately ? for it has neither magic nor much appropriateness ? is Swains , which was bestowed on it in 1840 by a Captain Hudson , of the U.S. exploring ship Peacock , in honor of a whaling ship captain who had told him of its existence . It remained for another whaling man , however , to give more than a name to the tiny atoll . This was Eli Hutchinson Jennings , a far-ranging Yankee from Southampton , Long Island . Having seen and admired the island in the course of his voyaging , Jennings conceived the idea of making it his home . He obviously was a man adept at changing fancy into fact , for in 1856 , age 42 , he sailed up from Samoa with a few islanders and a newly acquired part-Samoan wife ? and did exactly that . At that time no Western power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate . The few Tokelauans who dwelt there were hospitable . And Captain Jennings forthwith set about founding the community and dynasty that have endured to this day . Before he died on Swains in 1878 , Eli Jennings and his wife had had six children . These , in turn , had many more , as did their children , until today there are some 200 living descendants . In the process , a medley of national and racial strains came into the family ? including British , Dutch , Spanish , Portuguese and many varieties of Polynesian -- and its present members are widely scattered . But in each generation the oldest son has made his home and raised his children on Swains , so that the continuity of family-on-island has remained unbroken . After the original Eli came Eli II SPORTS ILLUSTRATED May 1 , 1961 65  | from 1878 to 1920 ; then Alexander Eli , who " ruled " until 1958 , or two years beyond the island 's centenary . And now the head man is young Wallace Hutchinson Jennings , freshly emerged from six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely heritage . True , he does not control Swains as absolutely as did his forebears . For with the coming of the 20th century it was no longer feasible for the family to remain stateless , and in 1925 , after repeated Jennings requests , the island was annexed by the United States as part of the territory of American Samoa . During the Pacific war it was used as a weather and planetracking outpost . And today it boasts a total of three non-Jennings-employed inhabitants : a nurse , a radio operator and a schoolteacher ? all Samoan ? the last of whom also serves as general government representative . Very few of the Stateside personnel in Samoa , concentrated in the capital and port of Pago Pago , have been to Swains , and those few have been mostly doctors on emergency missions . No place on earth , alas , is total paradise , and the island has its problems ? of isolation , weather , food supply and health . But of such modern plagues as bureaucracy and officialdom , file clerks and tax collectors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until a few months ago I , like almost anyone else , had never heard of the place . Then , reaching Samoa , I heard of it all right , but still with little thought of getting there , for there is nothing vaguely resembling regular transportation . Even in the notoriously unhurried South Pacific , however , things do occasionally happen quickly . And , happily , such an occasion came now . For within the space of two days , in Pago Pago , I met a Jennings , was invited to Swains and found myself , rather bewilderedly , on my way . Neither bewilderment nor subsequent @#  | enjoyment were lessened by the fact that I was to be not only a guest on the island but at a wedding as well . The couple-to-be were David Eli Jennings , younger brother of clan leader Wallace , and Bessie Brown of Apia , in Western Samoa . Like Wallace , David had had his hitch with the U.S. armed forces ? in his case , three years in the Navy ? and though predominantly Polynesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thoroughly Westernized young man . Bessie , too , was of mixed background ? part Samoan , part British ? and had had several years of school in New Zealand , which administers Western Samoa as a United Nations trusteeship . They had met and become engaged the year before , when David 's ship had called at Apia in the course of a Pacific cruise ; and now , with the Navy behind him , they were ready to marry and settle down . They were not planning to settle down at Swains ; one brother , one family head , was all that so tiny an island could comfortably hold , and David had a promised job in government radio communications in Pago Pago . But the wedding itself was to be at Swains . Over a century , virtually every Jennings wedding ? and birth and burial ? had taken place at Swains , and it was unthinkable that this should be otherwise . Or , at least , it was unthinkable to the Jenningses . In Samoa , as elsewhere , weddings are usually held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bessie Brown 's family had plumped hard for Apia . But Swains and its tradition had won out . The wedding party was now assembled in Pago . And presently off it ? and 1 ? went to the midocean nuptials . It was David who had invited me , and he greeted me as I boarded the Isabel Rose , an ex-Navy patrol ship that now plies about the islands and had been specially chartered for the voyage . The rest of the 50-odd passengers , however , remained all but invisible for the duration . Though the inheritor of a great maritime tradition , the present-day Polynesian ? the professional sailor excluded ? has perhaps the weakest seagoing stomach in the world , a condition to which he is fatalistically resigned . And no sooner had most of my fellow voyagers boarded the ship than they were stretched flat on the deck on their sleeping mats , heads to the rail , expecting the worst ? and soon getting it . Once outside the harbor , the sea rose , the wind howled , and the Isabel Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bride-to-be Bessie strove mightily to remain at least semi-upright , her pretty face bowed in concentration over a Donald Duck comic book . But soon she too had to give up and was lying with head cradled in David 's lap . As for me , I soon switched to a bunk in the tiny cabin , which at least had the advantage of being attached to the ship . Around me , even the cockroaches were having trouble holding their grip on the swaying walls . The sun 's rim dipped , the stars rushed out ; at one stride came the dark . ( Which , I think , is how the Ancient Mariner put it ? except that now it 's the wedding guest telling the story . ) And in the dark we floundered on through the most misnamed of oceans . Par for the voyage from Pago to Swains is 20 hours , and since we had set out toward midmorning we were due , with luck , to sight our goal at dawn the next day . Repeat : with luck . On its previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of a second day before sighting Swains 's 20-foot-high crest in the emptiness of sea and sky . We were lucky , however . At first light there was a shout from the masthead ; soon , in the brightening dawn , even I could see a slight thickening on the horizon ahead ; and when the sun rose , there it was ? our island ? in all its improbable glory . I have not used the word glory carelessly . There is no other word for a South Sea atoll in the oceanic sunrise . Swains was beauty itself . It was peace . Most of all , above and beyond all else , it was untouched , unflawed aloneness . Stevenson , writing of his own island , said it best : " It touches a virginity of sense . " The trade wind was still blowing , but more gently . And now we moved into the lee of the island , and the sea was calm . A village swung into view . Two longboats were pulling out from it : across the lagoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside us ; voices were shouting back and forth , up and down ; and now Swains was no @#  | longer an island of dream but an island of men . Figures rose like resurrected corpses along the decks of the Isabel and became men too . Men , women and children , sisters , cousins and aunts , in bewildering Polynesian profusion . As the longboats bore us shoreward , David sorted them out for me . About half were Bessie 's kin , from Western Samoa , led by a high chief with the paunch and bearing of a Roman senator . The other half were Jenningses , or nearJenningses ; most from Tutuila , a few from the great distances beyond . Among the latter was brother-in-law Jack Thompson , who had come all the way from Honolulu . But this won him only runner-up position , for there was also David 's sister , Lilly Billings , from Oceanside , Calif . On the Isabel she had been merely another shroud-covered shape , with two smaller shapes beside her . Now she was a young American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead as we approached an opening in the reef . Soon coral fangs rose close beside us . The sea rumbled and foamed . The longboat pitched and swayed as steersman and rowers sweated at their oars . Then we were through . We were in the lagoon , in the shallows , and what seemed the entire male population of Swains was hauling us up onto the beach . Before us , with hand outstretched , was a tall brown young man in shorts and sandals , looking not unlike a younger Gregory Peck on South Sea location . This was Wallace Jennings , late of the U.S. Air Force , now master of Swains . And beside him was his widowed mother , Margaret Pedro Jennings . She had , David told me , been born in Tokelau , of an island mother and a half-Spanish half-Portuguese father ? in the true family tradition of scrambled races . She and her daughter Lilly had not seen each other in nine years , and they kissed and embraced , weeping happily , on the beach . Before and around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of its 100-odd permanent inhabitants . At its center , dominant , stood a big tin-roofed copra shed , now filled with the dried coconut meat that would @# be shipped out onto the Isabel Rose . And roundabout were the islanders ' homes : oval Samoan-style fales with thatched roofs , open pillared sides and pebbled floors ? which would now , with the arrival of the wedding party , hase to accommodate a 50% increase in population . Other than the copra shed there were only two Western-type structures . One was a tiny white-painted church , which looked as if it might have been transported bodily from the original Jennings ' 19th-century Long Island . And the other was a one-room bungalow that Wallace used as a combination office and bachelor sleeping quarters . It was here , it developed , that I was to stay ? in spite of my protest to my self-evicted host . " It will be good for me to sleep on a mat for a change , " he told me , grinning . " The Air Force softened me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " And off he went to direct the unloading of the ship . " So here you are , Mr. Crusoe , " 1 thought . sitting on the fresh print bedspread and looking at desk , typewriter , bookshelves and phonograph . But it was n't the phonograph that was making the music 1 heard . It was a guitar and living voices . In the nextdoor Pale , perhaps 10 yards away , were the rest of the Jenningses , plus assorted guests and islanders : now all barefoot , decked in lava-lavas and flowered garlands , sitting crowded on the pebbled floor , singing the joys of reunion . " Hey , come on ! " David called . " Kava 's coming . We 're waiting for you . " And soon typewriters and phonographs were remote beyond imagining . The wedding , I had been told , was to have taken place that morning ; but Bessie , not unreasonably , needed more time to recover from the rigors of the journey . So , " Come on , " said David again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one functioning vehicle , a decrepit but valiant zombie of a jeep . Unlike most coral atolls , which are patches of land strung like loose beads on a necklace , Swains is a continuous circular band of island enclosing a wholly landlocked lagoon . Airmen flying over it have remarked its resemblance to a gleaming green doughnut . And now it was around the doughnut that we went , with the outer lagoon , reef and sound-@#  | ing sea on one side of us and the serene inner lagoon on the other . Across the quarter-mile strip between them rose tall armies of coconut trees , their crowns bursting like emerald born bs against the sunlit sky . Swains puts forth other tropical produce as well , including taro and breadfruit , mangoes and pandanus . But coconut is king : the one cash crop and export , and the support of the House of Jennings for over a century . " Pennies from Heaven , " the nuts are sometimes called in the islands . For they and their trees need little care . They burgeon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth when it is ripe and ready to be made into copra . Almost the only onus they impose on man is reasonable care in selecting a spot for taking a nap . Perhaps a third of the way around we came to a clearing and , in it , a sight that would have startled me had I not been briefed beforehand . This was Etena ? in English , Eden ? a big rambling Western-style building that has been the Jennings homestead for half a century- past . Wallace , David and their three sisters had all been born there . In a nearby glade were the graves of their forebears : Eli I , Eli II and Alexander Eli . Currently it was tenanted by Mrs. Margaret Jennings , Wallace ( when he was not in his village " office " ) and miscellaneous relatives and servants ; and it was here that David and Bessie would spend their wedding night . But this afternoon it was deserted , for all attention was centered on Taulaga , where nuptials and feast were to be held . Completing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . There we found the tiny island school , and met its lone teacher ? one of the three " outsiders " on Swains . Not that all the others are " insiders " to the extent of being Jenningses , or even semi-Jenningses . But all , except teacher , nurse and radio man , work directly and exclusively for The Family , and most have been on Swains for a long time . The majority , I had learned , were not Samoans but Tokelauans , preferred as workers by the ruling clan because they were simpler folk than their southern neighbors , less influenced by Western ways or a restless itch for the Yankee dollar . But , nevertheless , there had been some trouble a few years back ? a strike for higher wages , in good Stateside style . And though the matter had been amicably settled , it had evoked the decision in Pago Pago that the Swains schoolteacher would serve also as sort of governmental proconsul in charge of grievances and complaints . There had been no major trouble since . Swains was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , and the teacher had remained 99% teacher . But it was obvious that The Family would have preferred the percentage at a nice round 100. continued  | The village itself was now buzzing like a hive . In every cookhouse were roasting pigs , spitted chickens , frying fish ; in every Pale , piles of other foodstuffs that were to be the various families ' contributions to the feast . From midmorning the wedding ceremony had been postponed to noon , then to 2 , then to 4 . Now it was set , definitely , for the hour of sunset , a point in time far more meaningful to the islanders than the obscure logarithmics of a clock . About an hour beforehand , Bessie , with Mrs. Jennings and assorted other females , was driven off to Etena to make her preparations . And presently groom David and best man Wallace had been metamorphosed from almost-naked brown Polynesians into two sleek young Americans in black-and-white tropical evening dress . Lacking such finery , I had brought along , and now donned , a dark blue suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as strange as if clad in a lava-lava in New York 's Times Square . he sun sank . The sky flamed . Dust T rose from under our polished shoes as we marched the 100-odd yards to the church , with the whole village in our train . There was room in the pews for only about 50 people , and most of the crowd jammed the door and windows while family and special guests sat down inside . There was the traditional wait . It was growing rapidly darker , and a kerosene pressure lamp was lighted and hung from a beam above the altar . The island pastor appeared : a tall chiefly-looking man with white hair , clothed from waist up in a white jacket , shirt and tie , but with lava-lava below and his brown feet bare . Then , at a signal , the congregation began to sing ; and though the music may once have been Mendelssohn 's , the rhythm was South Seas undiluted . Feet tapped gently and hips swayed along the prim lines of the pews . At the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anywhere . Then they became immobile , as Bessie appeared , attended by a single maid of honor . She was dressed as a Western bride in long white gown with cap and veil ; and she seemed , and indeed was , much taller than before , for she was precariously balanced on high spike-heeled shoes . The ceremony was that of the London Missionary Society , an outgrowth of the British Congregationalist Church , which for years has been the dominant Protestant sect in Polynesia . And the language used was Samoan ? or at least I think it was ( the roaring pressure lamp above the altar reduced the pastor 's voice to a mere murmur ) . The couple knelt , then rose . Vows and rings were exchanged . There was the benediction : and again the congregation sang ? and swayed ; and in the eyes of the L.M.S. , the Government of American Samoa and the world at large , David and Bessie Jennings were now man and wife . Outside , as they marched forth , the last of the day was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . After solemnization ? celebration . And Pacific islanders , as has been oft told in song and story , are the best celebrators on earth . The big copra shed had been cleared . Where before there had been the mounds of dried coconut waiting for the Isabel Rose , there were now great swathes of banana fronds spread to make floor-level tables ; and on them , row upon row , was piled all the edible bounty that island plus guests could provide . Above all , there was pig ? pig everywhere ? from tiny tender sucklers half lost among the greenery to huge bulging shapes that looked less like pork than roast mastodon . There were fowls. fish , shellfish , land crabs . And taro and yams and breadfruit and mangoes . There were two gigantic wedding cakes , one supplied by each family , and , for libation , kava , coconut milk and stacked cases of beer brought up , specially , from Pago Pago . For a few guests ? meaning those inured to this particular form of the white man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Swains Highballs , with coconut milk as mixer . ( And since these , I night add , did not put me permanently on the wagon , I 'm afraid that nothing ever will . ) We ate and ate . . . and drank .. . and now there was music again ; this time not merely singing voices but the plunk of guitars , the thrum of ukuleles , the whack of drumming hands on empty biscuit tins . Almost magically the banana-leaf tables and the mountains of  | food disappeared , and the copra shed became a dancehall . Tradition called for bride and groom to dance first , and out they went , Bessie and David , while the music swelled and the crowd shouted and clapped time . She was still wearing her full bridal dress , he his immaculate summer tux ; for a moment they could have been a pair of newlyweds in Southampton , Long Island ? but for a moment only . Then the focus changed . The earth spun . spiked For now Bessie had kicked off her her shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient patterns of the Samoan siva ; and David was circling her , his feet stamping , his body jerking in primeval rhythm . Faster they went , and faster . The drumbeat swelled . Their pace rose toward frenzy . And in the bizarre contrast of their clothing and movement , of the steel beams of the shed and the wild shouting that rang from them , was contained , it seemed to me , the very essence of the story of Polynesia . Then Bessie and David sat down . They were resting , panting , laughing ; again a Western bride and groom in their nuptial finery . But others took over where they had left off . At first it was impromptu , catch-as-catch-can : each individual or couple or group gyrating impulse seized them . Then an announcement was made . Sides were taken . And now for hours , the shed rocked to a siva contest between the homegrown Swains Islanders and the visiting firemen from Samoa . It was not only the young who danced , but the old as well : island e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowliest fetcher-and-carrier in Swains 's social hierarchy ' ' Fat old grandmothers , whom one would have thought incapable of three consecutive steps , became light-footed creatures of grace and abandon . A hunchbacked dwarf leaped and twisted like a brown Nijinsky . The need to dance was in blood and bones , no less than the and along breathe or eat or propagate ; with the need , the skill as well . For among the hundred or more responding to drum and string and shouting voices , there was not one misfit , not one ri loolde Indeed , there were only whole crowd who did n't dance . One , of course , was I , now filled like the rest continued  | with the wild rhythm ( not to mention Swains Highballs ) but still too frozen in Western inhibitions to do anything about it . And the other was the Jennings sister , Lilly Billings . We had sat together through the feast and since , and by now I knew a good deal about her . That ? for instance she had left Swains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samoa and then in Hawaii . That in Hawaii she had met and married a Stateside Marine Corps sergeant with whom she had gone to live in California and there had had her two blond , blue-eyed children . That she was now returning home for the first time to attend David 's wedding and spend some time with her mother . ( And , incidentally , that Sergeant Billings was a lucky marine , for she was both Iovely to look at and a gay , charming companion . ) " Go . Go dance too , " i told her now . " Do n't stick yourself with me all evening . " But she shook her dark head , a little sadly . " I ca n't , " she said . " Ca n't ? " " I 've forgotten how . All night I 've been trying to get it back . To feel it again ? do it again . But it does n't come . " She was silent a while . Then she added : " There 's even more than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her voice seemed to catch a little . " They come to talk to me , to be friends with me ? my own people ? like in the old days ; and I ca n't understand what they 're saying . " Midnight came ; then 1 , then 2 in the morning . And soon after 2 we left together . The party was still gathering momentum as we walked away from it through the empty village : not one but two strangers in an alien world . The next morning ? one morning in thousands ? Swains slept late . As stepped from Wallace 's bungalow , there was no sign even of the usual crowd of children that , on all out-islands , follows a papalagi ( white man ) about as if he were , as indeed he is , a man from outer space . Alone , I walked off along the great curve of the beach . Alone , I sat on the warm sunlit sand and looked out at the  | reef and the sea . On the reef the breakers shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear the sound of their rumbling . It was a sound deeper and quieter than silence ; so quiet it seemed to me I could almost hear the rub of shell on sand grains as a hermit crab wove its tiny course along the beach beside me . The press and din , the feasting and dancing of the previous night might have been on another island in another ocean . For here , now , was the classic Desert Island , and I was its castaway . Of all the wonders of a South Sea atoll , this , I think , is the greatest : that here , at one moment , it can throb with a matchless intensity of human living ; there , at the next , lie as still and empty as if untouched through all eternity by the hand of man . Then ? " Hi , papalagi ! " a shrill voice called . " I3i , =ester ! " called another . And that was the end of solitude and reverie . The village kids had rediscovered me , and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polynesian wedding , like the Polish variety , is not looked upon as something to be got over with in a hurry , and often the festivities will last for a week or more . For the Bessie-David nuptials this would not be possible . Swains could not maintain such a swollen population for more than a couple of days ; and also there was the Isabel Rose cruising back and forth beyond the reef at a pretty penny per hour . But at least there was to be one more night of celebration , and so through this second day , again , the ovens glowed and the smell of roasting porkers filled the air . Toward midafternoon it was decided that there were not enough of them , and Wally ( Wallace was for first-day formalities only ) led an expedition of men and dogs to the far side of the island and shot two of the wild pigs that made their home there . Then , toward nightfall , there was a crisis about fish . It was by now , of course , too late to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party , and off three of us went in an outrigger canoe in quest of the flying variety . We waited until full dark to set out ( for flying fish are wary creatures by daylight ) . Then we moved off into @#  | @# the lagoon : Wally erect in the prow with a long-handled net , another man paddling astern , and I seated amidships holding a huge torch of blazing brushwood . The fish cooperated magnificently . Attracted by the flame , they bore in on us by the school and shoal until the black water gleamed with darting silver . A few leaped of their own accord right into the canoe , or rammed themselves insensible against its sides and had only to be lifted up . Most , however , had to be netted . And this Wally effected in what seemed less a fishing operation than a ritual dance , his bare body twisting and lunging in the firelight , the long pole darting and sweeping ; the net scooping up the fish , singly and by twos and threes , some from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the air above as they whizzed past like shining projectiles . In what seemed no time at all we had more than 100 and were back in the " office , " adjusting ties and pocket handkerchiefs for the evening 's festivities . David and Bessie were not rewedded on this second night . But otherwise everything was as on the first , even to Bessie 's again wearing her bridal gown ? and kicking her shoes off . Down went new mountains of food . Up went the beat of the biscuit-tin drums , and round and round went the dancers in marathon siva ? no , there was another difference ? for at along about 1 , Lilly Billings turned to me bravely and said , " Oh heck , let 's try . " And try we did , feet stomping , hips swaying ? while , to my horror , every other dancer in the shed stopped dead to watch . " Ai , ai , rock ' n ' roil ! " a voice shouted in admiration . And I retired precipitately for another Swains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was scheduled for 9 in the morning . It was rescheduled for noon . And it finally happened at 4 ; or , at least , began to happen , for there followed another hour of leave-taking . Every human being on the island ? plus most of its dogs , chickens and uneaten pigs ? ? ? as there on the beach , in a welter of handshaking , kissing , embracing and weep-@# ing . Even I was bidden good by as if were a charter member of the community ( which by now , so warm had been my welcome , I really felt myself to be ) . And as I waded out at last to the waiting longboat I too was not far from a good old-fashioned Polynesian cry . Almost all the Samoan guests were returning home . And so too were David and Bessie , for David was to report the following week to begin his government radio job in Pago Pago . But Lilly , with her two children , was staying on to visit with her mother , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sadness as she waved a damp-cheeked goodby . For it would be another three months before the next ship came to Swains . During that time there could be no letters to or from her husband . There would be no trim Stateside bungalow , no refrigerator in the kitchen or sedan in the carport , no TV or movies or Saturday night dances at the Camp Pendleton sergeants ' club . Nor would there be even a single person with whom she could talk easily in what was now her only natural language . Much as she might love her mother and her onetime home , life on Swains ' y as not going to be easy for a young American matron from Oceanside , Calif . Now the shore had receded . We departees were again on the Isabel Rose , with all but the most optimistic laid out in neat rows on the afterdeck . The ship 's horn hooted ; the engine turned ; the sea took us . And the recumbent figures groaned and edged closer to the rails . As before , Bessie strove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supine in her husband 's arms ? which is , after all , exactly where a bride ( even seasick ) is supposed to be . Toward noon of the next day we entered Pago Pago Harbor . As we nosed in to the wharf the seagoing corpses once again rose from their shrouds and tottered weakly ashore . Battered but valiant , Bessie rode off in a taxi to her new life as Mrs. David Jennings ? the pigs , which were part of her bridal gifts , following in a truck behind . And I , on rubbery legs , made my way through the town . Before , Pago had seemed to me a tiny place , a minute inconsequential outpost lost in the vast Pacific . Now , after Swains , it was Metropolis ? the very center of the world .
