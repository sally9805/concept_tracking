At the edge of a birch grove , four mounted outlaws try to stare down the aging lawman . <P> " I mean to kill you or see you hanged at Fort Smith . . . " barks Marshal Rooster Cogburn . <P> " Bold talk for a one-eyed fat man , " the bandit leader sneers . <P> " Fill your hand , you sonuvabitch ! " <P> Cogburn answers , clamping his reins in his teeth and letting loose with a two-handed fusillade from his Winchester and long-barreled revolver . <P> At the end of the battle , four villains - and one horse-lie punctured and defunct upon the ground . " Dammit , Bo , " says Cogburn to his mount as he lies pinned beneath it . " First time ya ever gave me reason to curse ya . " <P> SELF-PARODY is the price of style . <P> Hemingway verged on it in his later novels ; Presidents Roosevelt and Eisenhower accomplished it in their later speeches . John Wayne charges into it in his latest movie , True Grit . Like all consummate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . <P> The broader the parody , the bigger the self . Wayne has been honing and buffing that self in some 250 pictures - mostly westerns-for 40 years . He has become the essential American soul that D. H. Lawrence once characterized as " harsh , isolate , stoic and a killer . " Superficially his films have been as alike as buffalo nickels . Only the date changes ; even the Indian looks the same . Yet through the decades there has been a perceptible alteration . The public , riding along in movie houses or taking the TV shortcut , has watched the celluloid Wayne pass through three stages of life . In the ' 30s , he was the outspoken , hair-trigger-tempered son who would straighten out if he did n't get shot first . By the late ' 40s , he had graduated to fatherhood : topkick Marine to a platoon of shavetails or trail boss to a bunch of saddle tramps . In True Grit his belt disappears into his abdomen , his opinions are sclerotic and his face is beginning to crack like granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using booze for arterial Antifreeze , putting off winter for one more day . They also recognize Wayne as an actor of force and persuasion . And the frontier town of Hollywood-which has never granted Wayne a single Academy Award-has begun to realize that it might just be a little behind in its payments . <P> <P> Romantic Backlash <P> On one side of the screen , Wayne has often appeared to be loping through his roles . But on the other side , it seems , there has always been an exacting competitive performer . In McLintock , recalls Actress Maureen O'Hara , " he did n't like the way I was doing a scene , and he said angrily , ' C'm on , Maureen , get going . This is your scene . ' I said I was trying to go fifty-fifty . ' Fifty-fifty , hell , ' he said . ' It 's your scene . Take it . ' Then he added under his breath , ' If you can . ' " The master of the western , Director John Ford , calls Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act . " Agrees Director Andrew McLaglen : " All of a sudden they 're saying that he 's an actor . Well , he always was . " <P> <P> Even such an anti-Establishmentarian as Steve McQueen is a Wayne buff . " Sometimes kids ask me what a pro is , " he says . " I just point to the Duke .
