In the 17 years since Congress adopted the anti-Communist McCarran act over a presidential veto , the law 's provisions have been systematically chipped away by the Supreme Court . Last week the court filed the act 's last remaining fangs almost to the vanishing point . <P> By a vote of 6 to 2 , the court rejected as unconstitutional the McCarran provision that any Communist Party member is ipso facto denied the right to work in defense plants .

" The Congress undoubtedly will take the hint and pass substitute legislation that will guard against subversives without infringing on their constitutional rights .                @ @ @ @ @
