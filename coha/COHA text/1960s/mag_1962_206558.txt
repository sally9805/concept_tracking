There were moments last week when the Kremlin seemed to have less trouble coexisting with the U.S. than with the Communist bloc ( or blocs ) . While the world was positively smothered in peace talk from Moscow about how Nikita Khrushchev 's wisdom had prevented a war between the U.S. and Russia , there were audible rumblings of dissension in the Communist realm . <P> At a reception in the Palace of Congresses banquet hall , celebrating the 45th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution , Nikita Khrushchev presented the picture of a man bouncing back in great style from his own Cuban fiasco . In one of his most dazzling displays of personal diplomacy , he seemed relaxed , relieved and philosophical . " Who won and who lost ? " he asked reporters . " Reason won . Mankind won because if there had n't been reason , then there might not have been this reception , and there might not have been any elections in the U.S. " Khrushchev even seemed to concede a U.S. missile lead . " We put 40 rockets in Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Even 140 would not have been enough . " <P> Then , toasting the U.S. with a glass of sweet Georgian wine , he turned to U.S. Ambassador Foy Kohler , standing 15 feet away . " If we do n't love each other , " he said affably , " then that 's a question of taste . If we do n't embrace , we can at least shake hands , because if we should clash , the others will not go unscathed . " <P> " This is not a threat , " he added quickly .

First Deputy Premier Aleksei Kosygin , who hailed " concessions made by both sides to peace and sanity " in Moscow 's missile misadventure in the Caribbean . Regarding Berlin , Kosygin omitted the usual Communist demand that Western troops quit the city and did not refer , even vaguely , to a deadline for a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Chief Rodion Malinovsky reduced his professional rocket-rattling to below last year 's noise level , reviewed an eight-minute march-past of military hardware that included only one new item : a 50-ft. - long , probably solid-fuel missile that was billed by the Russians as capable of being fired from a submerged submarine , like the U.S. Polaris missile . <P> Usually the Bolshevik anniversary is the occasion for an informal Red summit . But as of last week , Khrushchev seemed eager to avoid such mass meetings . He sent no invitations at all to Red China , North Korea and North Viet Nam , and called in his East European allies to Moscow one by one for quick briefings on Cuba . Last to arrive and last to leave was Hungary 's Janos Kadar .
