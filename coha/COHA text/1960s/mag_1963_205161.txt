On the train from Cleveland to New York , Music Writer Barry Farrell sat back to enjoy a leisurely breakfast with a copy of Bruno Walter 's book . Of Music and Music-Making . He had just turned to Chapter 3 , titled " The Conductor , " when a trainman passed by his table and peered over his shoulder . <P> Trainman : Are you planning to be a conductor ? Farrell : No , I 'm just writing about them for TIME . <P> Trainman : TIME ! Is it going to be a big story ? Farrell : Yes , a cover story . <P> Trainman : What 's the name of the conductor who 's going to be on the cover ? Farrell : George Szell . <P> Trainman : I do n't think I 've heard of him . Where does he work out of ? Farrell : Cleveland . <P> When he learned that the cover subject was not his kind of conductor , the trainman went on his disappointed way through the train . But Writer Farrell found , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Szell was his kind of conductor . After long hours in concert halls and at the stereo set in his office listening to the great orchestras of the U.S. , after warm conversations with the cover subject over , as Szell put it , " un bon p'ti ' vin , " Farrell wound up with " a new devotion-the Cleveland Orchestra . " <P> Cover Artist Henry Koerner , who like Szell was born in Central Europe , sized up his subject as " a father , the ultimate dictator , a tyrant . " The painter and conductor talked amiably in German and listened to recordings of the Cleveland Orchestra as the painting progressed . Koerner , who also did the drawings of orchestra members that appear with the cover story , found painting the conductor a " delightful project , " partly because he could show the subject 's hands as an expression of character . " When else , ' ' exulted Koerner , " would I have the opportunity to paint a stick-a magic wand-in the hand over the head ? "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
