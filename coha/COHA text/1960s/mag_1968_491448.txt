When I got on the bus there at Travis Air Force Base , headed downtown for San Francisco . I had my discharge papers in my pocket and I had twelve hundred dollars in savings . It felt good , man . We got to the gate at Travis , and right outside was this big sign flashing Go-Go Gins ! We started yelling , ' Stop the bus , man ! Stop the bus ! ' And he did , and we all piled out , duffel bags and all . I mean , you can always catch another bus . There it was , all laid out . Topless go-go , right out  --  side the gale . " Ronald Harmon was talking in the Blue Moon Bar on White Plains Road in the Bronx . Ten months had passed since he burst through the gates of Travis . and he was dead broke and unemployed . His last employer , B. Alt-man 's , a big New York department store , had laid him off two days before Christmas . His mother was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding down two jobs in an attempt to keep her family together . " It was like getting hit on the head , " said Harmon , brooding over his drink , a slender and rather dapper man in a shirt of red velour . " You come home thinking the world is going to open right up for you . And you find out you 've still got to work twice as hard as Whitey , just to stay alive . " There will be more than 40,000 of them this year . In growing numbers , the Negro soldier is coming home from the jungles and cities of Vietnam to an unsettling , uncer  --  tain future . He is a quite special man . this veteran , cap  --  able of greatly enriching the American society to which he returns , or of ripping it to shreds . He has been conditioned by a war of brutality and caprice , a war in which a sniper 's bullet or a mine might kill a buddy a few yards away , but leave him untouched . He has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration , imposed by both Army discipline and the de  --  mands of combat . Indeed , he has been immersed in it . for within the tight , closed fraternity of a combat unit , color simply drops away . " The only color in the jungle . " the veterans say , " is green . " The cruel divider in combat is not color but courage and skill at arms . Almost all of the veterans hold a high-school diploma , since they come from the elite 30 per  --  cent of their race who can pass the qualifying exams for Army service . Most of them have had technical training of one sort or another during their hitches . Many have commanded white soldiers in battle . " After a tough fire fight . " says a Negro paratrooper. " 1 have seen white boys from the South throw their arms around a Negro noncom , hugging him and kissing him . " The militant Black Power groups know about this veteran and his importance . These groups , which denounce the U.S. role in Vietnam as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat skills in a worldwide revolution of colored peoples against their white " oppressors . " On the other hand . Negro moderates like Whitney Young of the National Urban League look hope  --  fully . almost wistfully , to the returning veteran for the new and constructive leadership that the Negro community badly needs . During a Icing tour of Vietnam . I had seen these splendid troops in combat . On a cross-country trip . 1 sought them out again and found them  --  back in the ghettos from which the nation had plucked them for its defense . Out of dozens oflengthy interviews , some basic patterns emerged . The veterans themselves are at this point over  --  whelmingly concerned about their own personal futures . Their attitudes within the Negro move  --  ment will probably turn on whether or not they " make it , " a phrase that constantly recurs in their conversations . They are rather poised young men , but filled with bitterly mixed emotions . They can be smoothly buttoned down in a per  --  sonnel office for a job interview , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Americans . the Negro vet  --  erans are deeply attached to clothes , cars , color TV. all the appurtenances of success . Some of the veterans see these rewards at the end of a difficult passage that begins with college under the GI bill . Most talk about somehow getting the good things here and now . " It is those sixty-dollar-a  --  week jobs that grind you down , " says Ronald Harmon. " 1 have pushed my share of those clothes carts in the garment district . I want some  --  thing better now . " For many Negro veterans , California is the place to go " when I make my play , " James Price , 26 , who fought for a year with the tank battalion of the 25th Division in the jungles of War Zone C. is slight and intense . a talented amateur at photog  --  raphy . When he got his Army discharge , he madehis move from Akron to Los Angeles- where he io cleaning toilets on the night shift at the City 1 lall Annex and going to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at First and Main . By day it is a busy , bustling place ; by night it is fluorescent and silent , except for the footsteps and mops of Price and the rest of his clean-up brigade , Between 5 P.M. and 1 A.M. , Price cleans 15 places . " It is all coded , automated , you see , by these tags on my cart . " He leaned a mop taller than himself against a toilet wall . " I give them all a good going-over every night . work over the toilet bowls with bleach here , and work over the mirrors there , all according to the tags . I can give you a regular guided tour . This is the men 's room of the Civil Service Commission . " His voice rose up the scale of anger , and he threw a dirty . wet rag into his cleaning cart . " Is this any job for a man ? Is this any job for a man ? " Later Price explained why he had made his move to Los Angeles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small town , a rubber town . You can walk right downtown in twenty minutes . I was a part of the Brownleigh Court gang , from the neighborhood where I lived . It was not what you think of as a gang  --  that was our own name for ourselves . The worst we ever managed was to bust up a few street  --  lights . I went to Akron Central High . but it was this big place that looked like a detention home . that 's how I always thought about it , someplace to get out of . So my grades were n't good . " When I got back home to Akron from Viet  --  nam . it was like , you know , everybody had for  --  gotten I was alive . They said , ' Oh , it 's you , ' I was down , man , way down . so I came out here bag and baggage and moved in with my dad . He 's got a job driving a truck . We 're having some good times here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a kid . " Like many or perhaps even a majority of the Negro veterans , Price comes from a broken home . He was raised by his mother . " I used to put my old man down , but I can see now he had his problems . In hard times , it is the man that gets thrown out of work . The woman can always get some sort of a job . It will break a man 's heart . It 's the system , not the man . " Is ' Go West ' a good plan ? Well , I will tell you . if you 've got a case of the smarts , this place will knock it out of you . I still feel lost . It 's so big and it 's wide . In Akron I know who you can trust . Out here you ca n't trust nobody , they 're all of them hustling . Now I am making four hundred twenty a month , but it slips away . twenty here and twenty there . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money too long . In Akron there were these soft chicks you grew up with . Here they are hard . If you talk marriage . yes . but there go all your plans out the window . Another road is hustling for them . and I 'm not never going to get in that bag . I 'm not never going to pimp for a woman . " I 'm going to hang in there with the work and the school . This chick I was out with the other night said , ' Money . money , money . that 's all you think about , ' and I said , ' That 's all there is . ' " The Negro veteran headed for college is a promising , and badly needed , young man . But his problems would defeat all but the most deter  --  mined , Since his high-school training was usually poor , like Price's. he must often do remedial work even to get in . The GI bill pays only $130 a month for a single man , just enough to cover tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no posi  --  tion to subsidize his education . He must usually hold down a fulltime job in addition to his de  --  manding academic work . Price is attending re  --  fresher courses in English , math and economics at an adult training center in Los Angeles . He is hoping to enter Trade Technical College this fail to study accounting or data processing if he can pass the entrance exams . " I 'm losing weight because I 'm running so hard all the time , " says Price . " I never have time for a righteous meal . I 'm always tired . I work from five P.N1. to one A.M. , and I go to school front nine-thirty till three-thirty . The classes bend me just about out of my mind . You are tired and you doze off for a minute . and you 're an hour behind . ou miss one week of class and it takes you a month to catch up . It puts you down on yourself . These are the white man 's exams and you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher is this nice white chick , Mrs. Betty Peck , and I sometimes imagine her trying to run a crap game with ten side bets going and the odds changing with every roll . That is a math exam I could handle without even thinking , and she would flunk . But you 've got to play the white man 's game  --  so many apples and oranges , and interest at six percent per annum . But going back to school was one of the few good moves I ever made . " What am I aiming for ? I 'm going to set me behind a big desk and push me some buttons somewhere . " Many Negro veterans of Vietnam are finding within the Army itself the sort of status and au  --  thority that Price is seeking . Their reenlistment rate is three times that of the whites . The Negroes are becoming an elite guard . the shock troops and centurions of a society they could not breach as civilians . They are paying for it in blood , volun  --  teering for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percEnt of the troops in Vietnam are Negro . they have taken 14 percent of the combat death toll . " If you have been called ' boy ' all your life , " one Negro para  --  trooper explains , " you want to prove that you 're a man . " An Air Force veteran , Cpl . Algernon Trimble of Harlem , makes another point . " When you hit E-6 Staff Sergeantl you have really got it made , and these guys eat it up like walnuts . They just tell the E-5 's what to do . Where else would a Negro get to boss white boys around ? If he is married . where else could he make enough money to keep his family together ? " A splendid example of this new professional soldier is Elija Fields , 29 , of Quincy , Fla . He is modest in speech and unobtrusively flawless in the cut and press of his uniform as an E-7 Pla  --  toon Sergeant ) in the IOlst Airborne . At Fort Campbell , Ky. , where he runs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a starlet on a movie lot or a vice president on Madison Avenue . Over his breast pocket Fields wears the modest blue , red and white ribbon of the Distinguished Strvice Cross , the nation 's highest decoration after the Medal of Honor . On February 8 , 1967 , Fields crawled into Vietcong machine-gun fire and , al  --  though hit twice himself , pulled a badly wounded man to safety . Fields happens to be a teetotaler , but in 1958 , while on a visit home to Quincy , Fla. , he was arrested for drunken driving . " I could n't make up my mind whether to stay in the Army or get out , " he recalls , " I went home to see my folks , driving a car with New York plates . I drove my mother to the supermarket one day , and when I came out there was this policeman taking down my tag number . I came up to him and said , ' What 's the problem ? ' He said , ' We 've got reports on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your license for reckless driving . ' I said , ' What reports ? ' and be got mad . He said . ' Do n't get wige with me , boy . I 'm going to lock you up . ' I asked what the charge was , and he said . ' We 'll have something on you by the morning . ' He threw me in jail and chargedinc with drunken driving  --  and I do n't even drink . The only reason he jumped me were those New York plates . Anyway , that was what decided me to make the service a career . " I 'm staying in for the twenty years , and I 'll probably do thirty , " Fields says . " Do we stay in because we 're afraid to face the world outside ? There might have been some truth in that , for me , in 1958 . Not now . The services are still far ahead of the world outside in integration . But the world outside is changing . They have a white teacher where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a white policeman would n't blink an eye at a Negro driving a car with New York plates . " I believe in Black Power if it means more economic and political power for the Negro , that if I were arrested again and fought the charge , there would be a Negro on the jury . Black Power is like an infantry tactic that can be used well or poorly . " I 'm staying in because it 's a good job , and I like it and do it well . " Fields lives in a neat , brick , three-bedroom duplex on post and drives a 1966 blue Ford Galaxie . The family shops at the PX at bargain prices . Rent is free , and Fields takes home $463 a month . " Security for my family is part of it , of course  --  it is for any Negro , I do hope to be able to send my two children to college . But I 'm not a killer for hire . I would n't be in if I did not believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Weusi be  --  lieves in another country entirely  --  a worldwide community of colored people whose fascist op  --  pressor , he thinks , is the very country he fought for in Vietnam . He lives in the Watts area of southern Los Angeles , and he speaks from a deep well of racial hatred . He dresses in African tunics of brilliant hue ; there is an African totem on a black chain around his neck . He spends most of his time training Watts Negroes in the Army skills he learned in Vietnam , beginning with close-order drill . " Like the Boy Scouts , " he explains with an unpleasant smile . " What do we want ? Black revolution in this country , the sooner the better . The revolts in the cities were a start  --  they were something we 've been needing for four hundred and fifty years . They were a cleansing force , a fresh wind . Whitey thought he had us programmed like a computer . We were the best asset he ever had , better than a diamond mine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weusi declares . " Non  --  violence ? The white boy does n't respect nonvio  --  lence . Power can not be granted . it must be taken . " Do I carry a gun ? That 's none of your busi  --  ness . " Weusi , 22. grew up in Pasadena as George Arm  --  strong , which he now calls his " slave name . " He is light-skinned , live-feet-nine and heavily muscled . He shaves his head every morning and wears a thin line of beard across his upper lip and down under his chin . He is warm and friendly by nature and so must constantly catch himself up around whites , his jaw muscles tightening . " Pasadena was a deceptive place to grow up in . " Weusi explained at the All-Nations Pool Hall on South Broadway in Los Angeles . He dug into a luncheon of the Southern cooking that is known in Black Nationalist circles these days as " soul food " ? in this case fried fish and collard greens . " Pasadena was a town that was integrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was make me hate myself . It made me ache and hunger to be something and somebody I could never be , which is white . When you rub shoulders with Whitey in a town like Pasadena , you are in one way or another being called nigger every day . " High school was a nothing . I did n't know why I was there , what it was all about . I dropped out and joined the Army , and that was the worst . When Whitey gets you in a controlled situation like that . he can make you know you 're a nigger every minute , every day . I got off the bus at Fort Leonard Wood , Missouri . I had done my basic. won my stripes , and there I was for advanced infantry school . Three of us started to gel into a taxi . The first two were white . The driver stopped me and shut the door on the two white boys al  --  ready inside . You can get another taxi down that-away , ' he told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And there I stood on the curb , uniform and all . and watched him drive away . " That was my patriotic period , I call it , when I believed in America and all that . In Vietnam I was in the combat engineers clearing an area about Cam Ranh Bay . There were two bars in town , and one of them had a sign in front , No NIGAS ALLOWED . That was to please the white boy , but he did n't respect the Vietnamese . He called them gooks and yellow niggers . The white boy talks racism just as naturally as he breathes . We had some Hawaiians in our outfit , and Whitey called them pineapples . I never heard that one before , did you ? And my black brothers at home were being shot down in the streets . " Back home in Pasadena , after his discharge . Weusi worked the bedpan bngade as a hospital orderly , stood in unemployment lines and " hus  --  tled " ? a broad term covering activities at the outer fringe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion during a Sunday " soul session " in Watts at the temple of US , a militant Black Nationalist group which recently pulled half the Negro children of Los Angeles out of school to celebrate " Kuzaliwa " Swahili for birthday ) , the birthday of the move  --  ment 's maximum hero , Malcolm X. They are a gun-carrying crowd led by a decep  --  tively mild-mannered mulatto intellectual named Maulana Ron Karenga , who dropped out of graduate studies at U.C.L.A .. where he was com  --  piling a new Swahili-English dictionary , to found US . Fearing assassination like Malcolm X , he is accompanied everywhere by bodyguards . The secret handshake and the code phrases of US i " All praise to Maulana Karenga. the Great Elephant , the Black Panther " ) struck me a bit like old Negro Masonic Lodgism brought up to date , Kingfisher revisited . " You still do n't understand , " said Weusi . " I do n't care what you think . Go away and send us technicians and foreign aid . You owe us repara  --  tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are going to make a black nation Within this nation , peacefully or , as Malcolm said , with ' whatever means available . ' " Oddly enough , by embracing this extremist doctrine , Weusi won an advantage over most of his fellow veterans . So terrified is Los Angeles County of another Watts that it appointed him as an aide in the Community Relations Bureau of the sheriff 's office . Weusi is supposed to do what he can to prevent another riot , but he has not stopped proclaiming his doctrines . He began one of his daily rounds with a fiery explanation to a Negro mechanic of the origin of vigilantes . " When the law did n't work for the white man , he organized the vigilantes in the West . That is what we need right here . " Outside the police station in downtown Watts , he began haranguing a white deputy sheriff on his constitutional duties . " Why do you go after black men with your club and your gun ? Why tell us to move on . break it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the white part of town ? " Blood began to well up in the deputy 's freckled neck , and a crowd began gathering . Weusi broke it off at that point and walked away . Later , when I reminded Weusi that many whites had worked for civil rights , he replied , " I 'm not concerned about the hankies , the white devils . I 'm concerned about all the blacks who died on theslave passage to this country and the millions flogged. shot and lynched once they got here . I 'm fighting for them . My future is the revolution . " The black revolution tugs strongly at the emo  --  tions of the Negro veterans . Army Cpl . Charles Turner of Los Angeles was a rioter himself at Watts . " I was right in the middle of it , " he says proudly . " I do n't really know why . I got drafted right after that , and so did a lot of my buddies . I guess somebody figured that it was one way to keep us off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as point man on an infantry patrol he stepped on a mine and was riddled with shrapnel . Permanently deafened in the left ear , he was sent to the Army hospital at Fort Ord , Calif . " I do n't agree with everything that happened in Watts , " he explained to me , " but they were my people and I felt a strong urge to stand up and be counted . " Very few , however , care to dedicate their lives to Weusi 's sort of revolution . " These brothers in US are telling where we stand , " said James Price as he cleaned his round of toilets . " But a riot is not a program . I have the feeling that the movement is going out of its righteous mind trying to find unity and a program . " There is a general feeling among the Negro veterans that the right leadership has not yet emerged to give them some hope . " The frighten  --  ing thing is that my family began scrambling up the ladder two generations ago , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx . " But when a Negro makes it into the middle class , he is still only hanging on by his nails . My granddaddy opened a little store in the colored part of Hous  --  ton , and that made the money to send my dad to Howard University . He 's a CPA . I 'll show you where I grew up . It 's just around the corner . " The handsome , two-story house of dark-red brick was in a white neighborhood . " We moved here from central Harlem and it seemed like , well , paradise . Six bedrooms . My mother worked . and we took in boarders to keep the place floating . The money was always short . My parents fought about it and two years ago my dad split . We lost the place , and now we are in a tarpaper house . ter  --  rified about the rent . " I joined the Air Force because they promised to teach me . a trade . You know what they made me ? A cook , like generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even count them . There I was at Tan Son Nhut Airbase in Saigon . the temperature in the kitchen one hundred and twenty . I was working a twelve-hour shift , poking food in the oven and dishing it up for Whitey . " I told you about that good feeling I 'd had . at the gate at Travis , go-go girls and twelve hundred dollars in my pocket . I bought some things 1 wanted , like a slide projector , and I lay around the house for three months and the money just slipped away . I took a job in a White Tower hamburger joint . but it was right between two bars , and I could n't take the drunks that came in every night . One of them waved a gun in my face and I quit . " Harmon had two big hopes . He went up for a promising job as a trainee with the telephone company . " This white guy in front of me had been in Vietnam too , and the white girl taking the application gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the form . She did n't even notice mine , even though they were exactly the same . The job never came through . " While working as a stock clerk at Altman's. he boned up at night school in Harlem to pass an exam for the steamfitters ' union . The steam-fitters , notoriously laggard on integration , like many other unions , had decided to give Negroes an equal shot at 50 new places . " Did you know " What do we wont ? " asks I ; Weitsi . " Black revolution In this ( NM ' dry . 7'he revolts in the cities were u Wort . " steamlitters make seven dollars and eighty cents an hour ? Now that 's real ' stoney . You could begin to live on that . But I just knew when 1 sat down to the exam that I was n't going to make it . There was this white guy . a big shot in the union , giving the big handshake to some of the white boys taking the tests . They were probably blood kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had predicted , Ron Harmon failed . Now Harmon was on the bleak platform of the Dyer Avenue elevated station , where the subway trains emerge from underground and run clatter  --  ing through hillsides of Bronx tenements . " We 're spending billions in space , and I 'm down here hustling. " he said . It was 4 A.N1. and Harmon was waiting for a train to take him to his newest job -- as a cook at New York University Medical Center . " Well , the Air Force promised to teach me a trade . They did . and it 's the only kind of work I can get . Screwy as it sounds , I sometimes think about going back in the service . If I could get the right kind of deal I would go back over there . " Go to college ? I honestly do n't think I have the aptitude . I 'm the slow one in my family . So why waste someone else 's time ? And the un  --  employment bread is very , very small . And they rub your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make you feel like a crumb . I 'd rather cook eggs than take that kind of crap from Whitey . " The Negro veteran did not come home in anger , or aflame for crusade . He came home puzzled and disturbed about the riots in the ghettos . " We wondered what it meant , " says Harlem 's Corporal Trimble . " the brothers burning down the stores and houses , their own places where they lived . " But the dominant mood was hope , bolstered by a comfortable packet of Army severance pay and savings from overseas . That hope is turning into bitterness . A door slams in his face , and the veteran sees he has reverted from hero abroad almost all the way back to his old status as society 's dropout at home . The help being offered is minimal : a parsimonious GI bill ; a small bonus on civil-service exams , lead  --  ing some to a safe if unexciting future in the postal service . The Urban League has opened a counsel  --  ing service in nine major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Los Angeles office , " is that there just are n't enough good jobs to go around . " Out of bitterness  --  and the return to an America of de facto segregation  --  Black Nationalist feeling is growing . But the concept of " Brother " has its positive as well as its virulent side , both at work within the veteran . The most heartening evidence so far is that , at whatever emotional cost to him  --  self , the veteran is " hanging in there , " as James Price put it . He has not yet lost hope , " You know , when I was working at Altman 's , as a stock clerk , - said Ron Harmon , " they had this great topcoat in the men 's department , black cashmere with a Persian-lamb collar . I would walk by it and just stroke the lapels . And all the things you see on color TV. the cars and all the rest . You lie in bed at night and think about them , and think , ' What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human if you did n't . " " When I came home to Harlem , " says Corporal Trimble , " there were all those guys I grew up with . doing the same thing they were doing when we were teen-agers  --  playing ball , just goofing off . They might not have moved an inch the whole time I was gone . I do n't mean to put myself over them , but I think I learned some things in the service . I put on the old sneakers and shorts and tossed the ball around with them . but it did n't seem the same . I told myself , I 'm going to make it out of here . I 've got to . " q
