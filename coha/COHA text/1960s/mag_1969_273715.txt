Lord of a sumptuous villa , master of a 200-worker foundry , Miguel Berrocal is , at 36 , the latest in a long and rather glorious tradition of Spanish grandees in the arts . Like Picasso and Dali before him , he is both a dazzling technician and a self-consciously public personality , immoderately gifted and immodestly inclined to say so . With his French-born wife Michele , he presides over the 40-room Villa Rizzardi outside Verona , a Renaissance palazzo set among stately cypresses and broad formal gardens that he has studded with his own works . There , the couple entertains some of the top sculptors of Europe , who seek out Berrocal 's foundry for expert casting and professional guidance . " I 'm the boss of the Mafia of sculptors , " he says . <P> Double-Entendres . Berrocal 's own sculptures are the best advertisement of his professional skills . They are composed of as many as 40 tightly interlocking parts , so intricately fitted that never a bolt or a screw is necessary . Taken apart , they look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together again requires the aid of an instruction sheet , which accompanies each work . <P> Berrocal 's sculptures are more than ingenious gadgets . Currently on display at Manhattan 's Loeb and Krugier Gallery , they are handsome works of art , rich in double-entendres about the literary and legendary characters that they portray . Berrocal 's Cleopatra , for example , is a curvaceous seductress whose voluptuous thighs , when the proper key is turned , open to reveal a red velvet jewel box inside . Her face disassembles into a bracelet that can be removed and worn by the owner . The most dramatic work is one called Alfa and Romeo , which looks like a demure pair of lovers in a hand-to-hand embrace . But wait . A sharp below-the-belt blow to Romeo brings down Alfa 's blouse and releases a knife that whips with dazzling speed into her midsection . <P> The idea of works that can be disassembled , says Berrocal , grew out of his conviction that sculpture is primarily an art that appeals to both hand and eye . To feel what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to hold its weight in his hand-an experience that can be satisfyingly sensual . <P> The Mini-Multiple . Born into a comfortable bourgeois family in Malaga , Berrocal studied architecture and mathematics before setting off for Rome and art studies in 1952 . After a spell in Paris , he wound up in Verona because of the excellent foundry that was there . He is presently obsessed with the idea of spreading his art around the world . " A Berrocal in every house and a Berrocal in every pocket , " is his slogan . To implement it , he conceived of something he calls the " mini-multiple " - reproductions that are identical with his expensive cast bronzes except for size and material . A 5 inch nickel Mini-David ( one of 9,500 ) sells for $75 and is a perfectly duplicated cast of the original 11 inch David , which sells for $6,000 . With his plans for a mini-multiple priced as low as $10 by 1970 , he will bring a Berrocal within the reach of nearly anyone-or at least , anyone who wants to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
