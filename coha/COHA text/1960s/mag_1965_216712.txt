Two catastrophic failures out of five firings , an accidental explosion on a test stand , a three-year lag in the development schedule , and a $552 million price tag have all earned NASA 's liquid-hydrogen-fueled Centaur rocket such derisive nicknames as " the Hangar Queen " and " the Edsel of the Missile Industry . " But as it separated from its Atlas booster and ignited in a burst of pale blue flame high above the Atlantic Ocean last week , Centaur took on its proper dignity . The most powerful rocket of its size in the world , built to fire a one-ton Surveyor spacecraft to the moon , the 48-ft . Centaur shoved a dum my Surveyor into a perfect flight toward a preselected point in space , 240,000 miles from earth . <P> Not only did the trouble-plagued Pratt &; Whitney hydrogen engines take full charge in flight , but the guidance for the General Dynamics rocket sys tem checked out perfectly . Centaur soared into an orbit that was so exact that had Surveyor carried the proper equipment , it could have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon .
