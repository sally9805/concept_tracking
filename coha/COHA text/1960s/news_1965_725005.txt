txt SAIGON , Viet Nam , Sept. 14 t-American infantrymen have been going into combat in boots that are falling apart . Some men of the " Screaming Eagles " 101st airborne division marched against the Viet Cong last week in boots with gaping holes in their uppers and with soles that peeled off as the men hiked thru the jungle . Brig . Gen. John Norton . deputy commanding general of the United States army in Viet Nam , said today that jungle boots had been airlifted to the 101st to meet emergency requirements . Several Weeks Away But he said it would be several weeks before enough boots were available for all combat soldiers whose footgear wore out . Norton , whose supplies number 81,000 different items of equipment , said he had considered at one point taking boots from rear-echelon soldiers and sending them to the front . The danger of spreading foot ailments deterred him . Until last week 's airlift , some " Screaming Eagles " had been going into action in tennis shoes , senior officers of the 101st said . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to see how fast steamy jungles rip boots to pieces . Each man of the 101st brought two pairs of leather boots with him on landing July 29 . Six weeks have been enough to render their footgear unfit . Most men of the 101st wear all-leather boots and Viet Nam 's humidity makes the uppers come away from the soles . Several soles were seen on jungle trails during the 101st 's operation last week . The new jungle boots being issued have heavy canvas uppers equipped with leechproof drainholes to get rid of the water that constantly soaks a jungle fighter 's feet .
