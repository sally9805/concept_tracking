If 31 months of bombing by the U.S. has not succeeded in breaking North Viet Nam 's spirit , it has certainly taken an enormous toll of its national substance . Despite the dispute in the U.S. over extending the range of targets , there are so few major ones yet unbombed that U.S. pilots spend most of their time returning to plaster the same old places time and again . Last week the U.S. not only further shrunk the list of off-limit targets but employed a new aerial bombing strategy that threatens to paralyze completely North Viet Nam 's transportation and supply arteries . <P> <P> Flying through cloud-laden skies that signaled the approaching monsoons , Navy attack planes from the carriers Oriskany and Coral Sea rained bombs and missiles for the first time on the port of Cam Pha , which is only 46 miles northeast of Haiphong and serves as its auxiliary port . Under congressional pressure to hit North Viet Nam harder , President Johnson gave the go-ahead to bomb Cam Pha when no ships were at the piers , thus seeking to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right moment , the raiders demolished Cam Pha 's wharves , badly damaged its rail facilities , destroyed its four giant handling cranes and set fire to huge piles of coal , North Viet Nam 's only remaining money-earning export . <P> Chop &; Smash . The Cam Pha raid , and raids on five other previously forbidden places in recent weeks , reduced the number of untouched targets in North Viet Nam to a mere 46 . Most of those 46 are too insignificant ( small factories , pint-sized petroleum dumps ) to warrant the risk of U.S. lives ; other potential targets , such as factories in downtown areas , are ruled out on humanitarian grounds . Of the major targets not yet hit , many will probably be bombed in time . The most likely remaining targets : the power station and railyards at Lao Cai , an important supply link with China ; three MIG fields near Hanoi and one at Haiphong ; and the dock facilities at Hon Gai , the only unscathed port . <P> The day after they hit Cam Pha , planes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its center ( eight-tenths of a mile ) than ever before . Avoiding the Soviet and other foreign ships jamming the piers , the pilots smashed overcrowded warehouses , chopped up the railyards and knocked spans from both the rail and highway bridges over which supplies must pass to reach the rest of the country . U.S. strategists have decided that , for the time being at least , they will not try to deny access to Haiphong from the sea by bombing its dock areas or mining its harbor-and thus risking a confrontation with Russia if its ships are hit by a U.S. attack . Instead , the U.S. planners intend to seal off access to the port from the land side , hoping that Soviet and other materials will simply pile up on the docks .
