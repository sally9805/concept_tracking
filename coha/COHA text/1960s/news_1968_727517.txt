txt Chief Judge William J. Campbell of federal District court said yesterday that Daniel Walker , chairman of the controversial riot report , " went back on his word to me " when he released the report without first showing a copy to a federal grand jury investigating the convention week disturbances . Campbell , speaking at a press conference , said : " My agreement with Mr. Walker was made so that it this report would not interfere with the work of the grand jury . I clearly understood that it was to be submitted to the grand jury before being released . " Agree in Meeting According to Campbell , the agreement was made on Oct. 3 in a meeting with Walker . " He told me that he had a discussion with the attorney general about heading an investigation into the convention week disorders , " Campbell said .

To this , Campbell answered : " I have no authority to make public deletions in ' the report . I will give the grand jury copies of the report ; which I 'll have to buy in a bookstore , but I will not show them the 16 pages of deletions .
