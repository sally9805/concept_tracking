The Walsh brothers , James and William , were only a year apart in their family of nine brothers and sisters . They were inseparable while they grew up in Cumberland , Md. and later at Mount St. Mary 's College in Emmitsburg , where they both graduated in the class of 1910 . Fortnight ago they saw each other in a Communist jail in Peking-for what will almost certainly be the last time on earth . <P> Twelve years ago , just before the fall of Nationalist China , Roman Catholic Bishop James Edward Walsh went back to China ( after 18 years of missionary work there ) as executive secretary of the Catholic Central Bureau , coordinating Catholic missionary , cultural and welfare activities .

" No , he had not been allowed to say Mass since his arrest 22 months ago . <P> And so it went for half an hour-and during two other visits . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody likes to be confined , but I 'm not unhappy . Let 's leave the future in the hands of God . " When his brother was taken away by the guard , Judge Walsh watched him from the window of the visitors ' room as the bishop crossed the courtyard to his cell . The judge called to him , and the bishop stopped , looked back and waved . " So long , James , " the judge said .
