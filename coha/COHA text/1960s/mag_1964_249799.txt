Though the red-checked tablecloths and steins of beer might as easily be found in Heidelberg or Hanover , the audiences are more akin to Hackensack . Some , of course , are college kids , but a surprising number are middle-aged couples , flushed of face and strong of voice , swinging down memory lane , with a stop now and then for a swig and some peanuts . The band is properly twangy , the repertory-On , Wisconsin ! , " Hold That Tiger , " " Roll Out the Barrel " - the sort that only a trombone , a tuba , a washboard and a couple of banjos can get away with . <P> Beer-and-banjo fun was started six years ago in San Francisco at the Red Garter on North Broadway Street , and from Frisco the fad has rippled across the land . There 's the Blue Banjo in Seattle , the Levee in Dallas , the Silk and Satin in Portland , the Red Garter in Chicago . <P> Typical is Your Father 's Mustache in Manhattan 's Greenwich Village . There , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schlitz and have a look under the mellow light of Tiffany lamps at gilt-framed pictures of Civil War officers . Fellows feeling particularly risqu can peep at pictures of Gay Nineties showgirls ; those feeling like a change of face can purchase a mustache for 50 . Young people feel a sense of release from the rapt silence that is derigueur at cool-jazz joints . Stag girls like the clubs because the wholesome entertainment reassures them that the boy singing Bye Bye Blackbird across the stein is not likely to turn out to be a mugger ( and even if he is , at least he 's a happy one ) . <P> Mustache is owned by Joel Schiavone , 27 , a barefoot boy from Harvard who sports a stubble of raggedy beard . A banjo strummer himself , Joel opened a club in Boston two years ago shortly after graduating from business school . Happily riding the banjo tide , he has opened another in Cape Cod and is planning a new one on New Orleans ' Bourbon Street . But Joel views the future with the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crowds drop off , " he says . " The life expectancy of these places is ten to 15 years at most . "
