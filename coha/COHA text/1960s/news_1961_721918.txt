txt When Jonathan Logan . Inc. , decided toward the end of 1960 to acquire a competing dress manufacturer . Linsk of Philadelphia , for 137,500 shares of stock , Logan 's president , David Schwartz , hit upon an idea to minimize the number of new shares his company would have to issue . He had Logan buy nom the David Schwartz Foundation . a charitable organization he had set up in 1945 , 100,000 Logan shares at $10 a share , the market price at the time . Mr. Schwartz also worked out an arrangement that in effect extended the time Logan had to pay for the stock . The foundation agreed to donate $1 million , its proceeds from the sale , to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York , the contribution to be made in three instalments . As the instalments come due , the money is being paid by Logan to the foundation , which is turning it over to the school . This transaction points up what appears to be a growing trend : Many charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trustees or directors who control them . Because foundations are granted tax exemption on the theory they exist only for charitable purposes , the question arises , to what extent is this activity proper and where may it conflict with the public interest ? Although the legality of the Logan case is not in question  --  charity clearly was a beneficiary here  --  many officers of large foundations are disturbed by other uses to which some foundations have been put of late . The Battle for Allegheny During the struggle between Allan P. Kirby and the brothers John and Clint W. Murchison , Jr. , of Texas for control of Allegheny Corp. , the Fred M. Kirby Foundation , of which Mr. Kirby is president , purchased at least 91,100 shares of Alleghany common , a stock which at the times of the purchases had never paid a dividend . Interestingly , Mr. Kirby apparently had second thoughts about this acquisition . He arranged in March , 1961 , before he knew the outcome of the proxy battle , to buy 100,000 Allegheny shares from the foundation for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the tax-exempt status of his foundation would not be in question . In the abortive attempt earlier this year by Glen Alden Corp . to gain control of shoe producer Endicott Johnson , two charitable foundations figured in an unusual exchange of stock . J. M. Kaplan , an Endicott Johnson director who favored the Glen Alden bid , exchanged 60,000 Endicott shares , of which some 54.000 had been held by the J. M. Kaplan Fund , Inc. , for 140,000 Glen Alden shares held by the Albert A. List Foundation ' . Mr. List is head of Glen Alden . When , several weeks later , strong support for Endicott Johnson 's management forced Glen Alden to withdraw its bid , the 60,000 Endicott shares obtained . by the List Foundation were sold to the Endicott Johnson employes ' . pension fund . While the proxy struggle was still under way , the Internal Revenue Service was asked by supporters of Endicott 's management to investigate the exchange of shares by the two tax-exempt foundations . Foundations Multiply One factor which , authorities agree , undoubtedly has contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply the marked growth in recent years in the size and number of foundations themselves . F. Emerson Andrews , director of the Foundation Library Center , an independent agency in New York City which gathers information on foundations and makes its material available to the public , estimates that U.S. foundations today have assets of more than $12 billion and are making grants of about $625 million a year . The center 's files list 13,000 foundations , 87% of which have been established since 1940 . Mr. Andrews estimates about 1,200 new foundations are created every year . Not all foundation authorities believe it is possible or necessarily desirable to separate the affairs of foundations from the affairs of businesses whose stock they hold . A number of foundations have been set up with gifts or bequests of major holdings , often controlling interests , in corporations ; if the foundations are to look after their own interests , this reasoning goes , they must be concerned with how the corporations are run . A few years ago . trustees of the Kress Foundation , for example , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , . in which the foundation held a 42% voting interest . The trustees placed four men on the Kress hoard of directors in March , 1958 , and soon thereafter the board received the resignations of four Kress executives , including the president . The largest single stockholder in the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. is the John A. Hartford Foundation , Inc. , whose trustees are headed by Ralph Burger , president of A &P.; There is no question that the foundation trustees have had a strong voice in the operation of A &P; down through the years . Several Types of Foundations In its broadest sense , the foundation " is an instrument for contributing private wealth to public purpoNe , " as Mr. Andrews of the Foundation Library Center puts it . There are several types of foundations . Communities often set tip foundations to receive and sometimes pool gifts and bequests from residents . Many big corporations establish foundations through which to channel their charitable giving . These foundations generally have funds just large enough to enable the corporations to maintain their customary level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply or evaporate . There are special purpose foundations . One such New Jersey foundation with a self-explanatory name : The Dr. Coles Trust Fund for Ice Cream for the Pupils of Scotch Plains and Fanwood . There are general research foundations , which usually have relatively large endowments and broad charters ; this category includes most of the large foundations and an estimated 66% of the assets of all foundations . There also are family foundations , generally set up by living donors and started with relatively small contributions . Such foundations , as well as other charities , have benefited significantly in recent years from Federal tax laws . In some cases , taxpayers with substantial incomes actually can retain more of their money by giving away assets than by selling them . Consider the hypothetical case of an unmarried taxpayer with an adjusted gross income ? essentially , gross income less business deductions ? of $200,000 and a taxable income of $150,000 . If this taxpayer wishes to dispose of $60,000 worth of stock which he bought some years ago for $10,000 , he would end up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would by selling the shares . Here is how this is figured : The tax on a taxable income of $150,000 is $111,820 . If the taxpayer sells his stock , he also would have to pay on his $50.000 profit the maximum long-term capital gains tax of 25%. or $12,500 . Thus , the taxpayer would pay Uncle Sam $124,320 . He would keep $88,180 of income and $47,500 from the stock sale . including the original $10,000 investment , or a total of $135,680 . Donating and Deducting If a taxpayer elects to donate his stock to charitable organizations , he may deduct up to 30% of his adjusted gross income if he allocates his contributions to conform with the tax laws ; in this case , the taxpayer could deduct the full $60,000 value of his stock . This would reduce his taxable income to $90,000 , on which the tax is $58,620 , and he would have no other tax to pay . Thus , if the taxpayer chooses this course , he would pay Uncle Sam $58,620 and keep $141,380 of income , $5,700 more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One authority on such matters notes that the taxpayer might further elect to set up a charitable foundation , install himself as the principal officer or trustee , and make at least part of his donation to his own foundation . In this way , he not only could take the course most advantageous to him financially , he also could retain control of the stock . Or , if the stock is in a company with a relatively small number of shares outstanding and the taxpayer is interested in raising the stock 's price  --  perhaps he is donating only a part of his holdings ? he can insist on being given an investment letter by each Charity to which he contributes securities . The investment letter is a device by which the receiver of the shares agrees to hold them as an investment for a stated period . This step would have the effect of keeping the stock off the market , reducing the supply . Generally , the thinner the supply , the stronger the price trend of any stock . Mr. Andrews of the Foundation Library Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past decade and a half has substantial relation to the tax levels and policies of that period . sand the financial structures of a few foundations suggest that industrial control was at least one strong motive in creating them . " But Mr. Andrews adds : ' Many of the larger and older foundations were set up before there was a personal income , estate or corporation laa of significant size , and nearly all the larger foundations are now administered by boards independent of the original donor and dedicated to spending the income , and sometimes the principal as well , for the public welfare . " Paul Windels , Jr. , a New York lawyer and the regional administrator here of the Securities and Exchange Commission until his resignation earlier this year , believes " the use of charitable organizations as personal vehicles is a widespread practice . " A current court case in Los Angeles contains charges along this line The dispute involves Lewis S. Rosenstiel. president of Schenley Industries , and his daughter , Mrs. Louise S. Frank . The controversy relates to the administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has assets of nearly $15 million . In an affidavit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court . Mrs. Frank states that the Rosenstiel Foundation was established by her mother shortly before her death in 1944 . The mother 's original gift to the foundation , according to the affidavit , was 125.000 shares of Schenley stock . Taking into account subsequent stock splits , this contribution has grown into a block of almost 450,000 Schenley shares , worth about $12 million . In fighting an attempt by her father to confirm the election earlier this year of three new directors of the Rosenstiel Foundation , Mrs. Frank charges Mr. Rosenstiel with using the foundation 's Schenley holdings , along with his own and those of trusts under his control , to " dominate " Schenley . Mrs. Frank asserts that Robert S. Marx . a former director of the Rosenstiel Foundation who died in September . 1960 , " repeatedly stated to me that the emoluments flowing from this domination , consisting at that time of $300,000 per year . lucrative stock options and the opportunity to charge enormous expenses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs Frank charges that in recent months facts have come to her atten ?

" The affidavit points to a suit settled in New Castle County . Del . chancery court in January . The suit , brought by Schenley stockholders , charged among other things , that Mr. Rosenstiel 's salary and stock options were out of line and that Schenley had reimbursed Mr. Rosenstiel " or paid on his behalf certain business expenses which were excessive . " In the settlement resulting from the legal action . Mr. Rosenstiel agreed to take a cut in his annual . pay from $300.000 to $250,000. to reduce his vacation period from three months to two months ei cry year , to increase by $3 a share the price he would pay for Schenley shares acquired upon the exercise of certain options . to refund $135,000 he had received from Schenley in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all .

Mr. Rosenstiel ' . Reply Replying to Mrs. Frank . Mr. Rosenstiel states that " this entire matter has arisen because of my desire to perpetuate the foundation which , since its ' nem poration in California in 1944. has made gifts exceeding $6 million to educational , scientific and religious organizations . " " As a result of deaths , the directors of the foundation , within the past year . have been reduced to two ? my daughter and myself . I propose adding Cardinal Spellman , Rabbi Nelson Glueck , president of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion ( in Cincinnati ) , and Russell G.

" My daughter opposed this plan and thus it became necessary for me , if the foundation is to continue its good work , to seek a declaratory judgment in the California courts . " The charters and policies of some foundations limit their financial position in any single company . The Carnegie Col p. of New York , founded by Andrew Cal negie in 1911. has two such self-denying rules . This foundation . whose $261 million in assets rank it among the nation 's largest , will not put more than 5% of its investments in common stocks into any one business corporation and will not hold in its portfolio more than 1% of the stock of any corporation . Mr. Andrews of the Foundation Library Center believes that " if the voting power of nonprofit institutions continues to increase , such agencies may have to face realistically their responsibility to use their new power both toward efficient management and for the general welfare . Federal laws regulating foundations require . among other things , that foundations must not accumulate out of income an amount that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at getting foundations to make their grants as soon as Is practicable after receiving their income and at preventing a foundation manager from using the charitable organization to build control of a business or businesses . In April , the Danforth Foundation of St. Louis filed suit to recover $557,809 in taxes and penalties assessed by Internal Revenue for 1951 and 1952 . The Danforth Foundation , with $110 million in assets , was founded by the late William H. Danforth , founder and chairman of the Ralston Purina Co .. and his wife . The Danforths ' son , Donald , is now president of the foundation . The Internal Revenue Service ruled the foundation had forfeited its tax exempt status for 1951 and 1952 by not having spent more of its income for those two years . The foundation concedes it did n't spend all its income for the years in question , but contends it hired a new executive director at the time and needed a reasonable period for him to develop plans and policies .
