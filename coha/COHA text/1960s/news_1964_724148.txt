txt New York Except in the East ? with this exception being most noticeable in New England ? Democratic leaders are accepting the President 's decision to narrow the vice-presidential field with good grace . Correspondents of The Christian Science Monitor asked Democratic leaders in all regions of the United States what their reaction was to this surprise move , a move that eliminated a front-runner , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , and seemed to forward the prospects of the two senators from Minnesota , Hubert H. Humphrey and Eugene J. McCarthy . In New England the Monitor 's regional political editor , Edgar M. Mills , found the leaders " decidedly unhappy " over the dropping of Mr. Kennedy . " Generally , " he reports , " they are ready , however , to follow the President 's lead . " Draft Kennedy ' for Senate Renewed Mr. Mills goes on to say that " if a floor fight should develop over the nomination and Mr. Kennedy shows any inclination to battle for it , Massachusetts delegation members will lead the charge to support Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elimination of Mr. Kennedy , but it was of a lesser intensity and took this outlet : A " draft-Kennedy " for the Senate race was renewed . In the South , too , the President 's move was greeted with something less than enthusiasm , even though the removal of Mr. Kennedy won immediate approval . Writes Ray Jenkins from Montgomery , Ala. : " President Johnson 's elimination of Cabinet members as potential running mates removes at least one , and perhaps two , men who would improve Democratic prospects in the South , in the eyes of the region 's party regulars . These are Robert F. McNamara and Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . Neither , say the party leaders , are identifiable liberals on the race question . " The South 's best hope , says Alabama 's loyalist Democratic chairman Roy Mayhall , is that some dark horse with an obscure reputation will gain the nomination . He mentioned Senator McCarthy as an example . Midwest Evidences . Enthusiasm Both Senator Humphrey and Mr. Kennedy are looked upon in the South as civil-rights activists who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest little interest in the President 's announcement has been expressed openly , although it is known that privately it is being greeted with enthusiasm . Most Midwest leaders are delighted to gain what appears to be presidential support for two of their own , Senators . Humphrey and McCarthy . Western Democrats , too  --  correspondent John C. Waugh ; reports  --  are leaning so noticeably to Senator Humphrey that the Johnson move evoked only such commonplace remarks as , " I figured as much . " // Democrats Back V-P Move // These leaders , say Mr Waugh , seem to admire two qualities in Senator Humphrey First is his proved ability as a campaigner . Second is the feeling that he is well equipped by stature and ability to step up to President if necessary . " Democratic leaders here , " writes Mr. Waugh out of Los Angeles , " believe that this last consideration will loom large in President Johnson 's ultimate choice of a running mate . " In looking around the Midwest , staff correspondent Dorothea Kahn Jaffe found , with few exceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lead Says James Ronan , chairman of the Illinois State Central Committee of the Democratic Party : " Both Senator Humphrey and Senator McCarthy are fine gentlemen . And so is that man from Maine Sen. Edmund S. Muskie . We have n't discussed the matter much . Whichever person the President wants , we 're for . The President has to live with him . . . " It is generally believed that Chicago 's Democratic leader , Mayor Richard J. Daley , wanted Mr. Kennedy but will say nothing now against the President 's final choice . Senator Humphrey , a man who has ' been mayor of a large city ? Minneapolis ? has much in common with the Chicago Mayor , and Mr. Daley is said to be friendly toward him , Strength Seen One of the top Democratic leaders in Kentucky told a correspondent of the Monitor : Reproduced with permission of the " I do n't think the President 's announcement makes much difference . We 'll rise or fall on Lyndon . " Gov , Edward T. Breathitt Jr . of Kentucky had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real effect one way , or the other . Senator Humphrey would give Johnson a strong running mate and a good liberal one . " Opposition of former Gov , A. B. Chandler and his resignation from the Kentucky delegation in protest against the elimination of Mr. Kennedy is not expected to have much political effect in the state . In Missouri , however , a different attitude is reported . Rural Democrats are conservative , and Senator Humphrey is thought to be too closely associated with the liberal wing of the party to attract their votes . Says Mark R. Hollaran , Democratic national committeeman from Missouri : Senator Humphrey . " Delegates were polled last week and not one said he did not like the Minnesota Senator , said Mr. Ferency . Iowa Democrats like Senator Humphrey , are apparently pleased that possible rivals are eliminated , but are on record as leaving the choice to the President . Leaders are unwilling to make any other statement . Ohio Democrats show very little interest in any vice-presidential candidate . If there is any reaction to the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ohio Democratic leaders are glad to see the way opened for Senator Humphrey 's nomination . Powers Protests In Massachusetts John E. Powers , Democratic national committeeman and former Bay State Senate President , questioned the wisdom of the Presi dent 's move : " There is too much at stake to eliminate any qualified candidate , and Bobby Kennedy is the most qualified of all . If the choice is to be made even before we go to the convention , what is the use of going ? " In somewhat the same mood Rep. John E. Fogarty of Rhode Island said : " If there is a floor fight for the nomination , I will support Attorney General Ken . nedy . " But the prospects of any kind of a revolt seemed slight , even in New England . Said William Ryan , Vermont Democratic national committeeman : " While Vermont 's delegates have been wholeheartedly behind Attorney General Kennedy , they will , in my opinion , go along with the President . It is up to him to decide . " prohibited without permission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
