Like all history , the history of art must be constantly rewritten , for even in the most obscure artist , now forsaken or forgotten , an ancestor with a message for the present might be found . In its current big show , * Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art spotlights three new candidates for ancestorhood , three 19th century symbolists who drew their inspiration from dreams and fantasy at a time when their more powerful contemporaries , the realists and the impressionists , were in their different ways exploring nature . <P> Of the three-Odilon Redon , Gustave Moreau and Rodolphe Bresdin-only Redon is well known today , though more for his glowing flower pieces than for his excursions into eeriness . Moreau is a clouded memory , and if Bresdin is remembered at all , it is primarily as Redon 's teacher . The exhibition links the three as fathers of surrealism . <P> La Belle Inertie . Unhappily , in the case of Moreau , the quest for ancestry gets a bit out of hand ; his is a case in which a painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long been embalmed in the musty , state-run Muse Gustave Moreau in Paris . Not until the Louvre , apparently at the instigation of Culture Minister Andr Malraux , put on a big Moreau show last summer ( TIME , July 21 ) was the general public suddenly informed that Moreau should be remembered not only as the brilliant teacher of Matisse and Rouault but also as an artist with special pertinence today : alongside his stilted and sickly mythological scenes , Moreau also turned out years before anyone else color sketches that were abstract . <P> In the accompanying catalogue , one-time New York Times Critic Dore Ashton does her sympathetic best to sustain the Louvre thesis that Moreau was a kind of New Frontiersman of Abstraction . Like the thoroughgoing pro that he was , Moreau often did sketches before starting a large work , some being orchestrations of color without the trace of an image . These are Moreau 's " abstractions , " and much is made of the fact that he squeezed paint on canvas directly from the tube , used his palette knife instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was he the great " precursor " of 20th century abstraction ? " There is no answer , " says Dore Ashton , and a viewer may be tempted to wonder whether it really matters . <P> <P> In the end Moreau still remains a mystery . His males are disconcertingly female ; his females are almost invariably feline ; the colors of his salon canvases-seasick green , hepatitis yellow , muddy brown-are faintly repellent . Moreau took as a principle something he called la belle inertie-a kind of suspended animation that seems less dreamlike than dead . Another Moreau doctrine was that of la richesse ncessaire . His big scenes from mythology and the Bible almost choke to death on their own bejeweled detail .
