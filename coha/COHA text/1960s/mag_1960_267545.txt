FRIDAY 'S FOOTPRINT ( 244 pp. ) - Nadlne Gordimer-Viking ( $3.95 ) . <P> The 13 stories in this new collection deal with Whitest Africa . Some blacks do appear , but only to serve meals , provide background music or fetch and carry . <P> In other books ( A World of Strangers , The Lying Days , Author Gordimer 's characters faced the fact that they were white men , " few , guilty and unloved , in the black men 's continent . " This time , mostly , they face themselves . <P> With only each other to treat savagely , they still do a consummate job . In the title story , fat , foolish Rita Cunningham marries her dead husband 's stepbrother , a slim , sardonic man with a tomcat 's morals and the face of a ' ' boy film-star . " The end is total humiliation for Rita . Women , generally , have a bad time . Our Bovary tells of Sonia Smith , who looks like a dahlia , " large , top-heavy , gorgeous , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stiflingly small home town . South African Author Gordimer , 35 , who is a tiny , finely made woman herself , often seems appalled by the size and beefiness of her fellow countrymen-matrons with " goose-fleshed , quaking red arms , " and large , blond , blue-eyed men with red faces . <P> Most of their struggles are internal : soundless voices scream for help while faces keep smiling gamely . But Author Gordimer can describe the outer world as evocatively as the inner chaos of man . A slight story , The Bridegroom , comes alive in its loving account of a night on the Kalahari Desert , a vast stretch of grey sand , thorn bushes and cratered earth , under a " spiky spread of cold stars . " In The Gentle Art , she neatly combines her love of the African land with her often shocked observation of its inhabitants . It deals with another night under the cold stars , this time on a wide and sullen river during a hunt for crocodiles . The searchlight 's beam picks up the two glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From a distance of three yards the hunter fires and the crocodile 's head explodes . The still twitching saurian is hauled aboard , and one of Nadine Gordimer 's hearty women , a guest on the expedition , gives tongue . " Oh , my God ! " she cries . " Was n't that wonderful ? Did you ever see anything like it ! Those eyes ! Staring at you ! Crash-Whoom-Finished ! "
