Before the audience are three gorgeous girls . They are talking among themselves . They all look exactly alike . They are indeed the same chick-one in the flesh and two on movie screens . <P> Actually , they are the same Czech , appearing in Czechoslovakia 's unique Laterna Magika at a Munich theater . Using ten screens of assorted sizes , five projectors , 21 technicians , 17 performers and two conveyor belts , Laterna Magika achieves a series of kinetic marvels that leaves the Germans jawohling in the aisles . Actors on the boards engage in dance and dialogue with actors on the screens , mingling reality and illusion , adding to the stage the weightless ease of movies and to the movies the presence of theater . <P> A male dancer reaches into a movie screen for his ballerina and performs a perfect pas de deux with her projected image . A pianist plays onstage accompanied by seven movie versions of himself , playing different instruments . A roller skater , chasing four girls who have boarded a bus , rolls downhill on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestrians , cars , cops , beer carts , fire engines , lampposts . This roller skater is onstage as well as on various screens , weaving and skirring from one medium to the other . Some spectators found this bizarre slalom more breathtaking than the roller-coaster ride in the original Cinerama . <P> More Art than Farce . An old silent movie flashes onto a screen . An unfaithful wife shoves her lover into a large armoire when her husband unexpectedly returns from a business trip . A second screen lights up . On it , Othello is about to strangle Desdemona , her cleavage akimbo . Screen 1 : the wife shoves the armoire out of sight to hide it , but ends by shoving it right into Screen 2 . <P> The jealous Moor opens the armoire . He discovers the enclosed lover , who emerges and shoves Othello , first on film , then live , across the gap and onto the other screen . The husband returning from the business trip now finds Othello in his wife 's armoire . Farce to be sure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is foolish . <P> Only in America . In 1918 , the great Sergei Eisenstein produced a show in Russia that combined stage and cinema , and in the ' 30s a theater project of the WPA did a similar experiment on Broadway . Then the hybrid form remained dormant until two brothers named Emil and Alfred Radok developed it into Laterna Magika , starting in 1948 . They mainly saw it , says Emil , " as a means to add new interpretations and new dimensions to already existing works , and as a real possibility for creating entirely new works . " <P> Their version of Tales of Hoffmann , with principals live and all secondary characters on film , has long been the major tourist attraction of Prague . Laterna 's Munich engagement is one of its few appearances outside the Iron Curtain since the Brussels World 's Fair , and Laterna Magika techniques , curiously enough , have been used in quite minor ways in both the Du Pont and Texas shows at the present New York World 's Fair . This summer the Laterna Magika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A four-month tour of the U.S. will begin at Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall .
