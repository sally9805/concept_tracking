The critics were downright disgusted when Gian Carlo Menotti 's new opera buffa was first performed in Paris last October . Le Dernier Sauvage had a libretto the French found far from funny , and its music they found distressingly short on substance . " A misery , " said Le Figaro . But the Paris production was starved and skimpy , and Menotti 's countless champions comforted themselves in the faith that The Last Savage would find a happier habitat in New York . Last week the Savage arrived at the Met in a production so beautiful that Menotti cheerfully conceded he would have no excuse if it failed . It did , and he has n't . <P> Parties &; Pants . Merely to be believed , the Savage requires a better-natured audience than a composer can expect to find in all Christendom . Attempting " smiling satire , " Menotti has a Vassar girl ( Roberta Peters ) go to India in search of the Abominable Snowman . Her father ( Morley Meredith ) meets a maharajah and arranges a marriage of convenience between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the girl is an anthropologist , and she insists upon her savage . Her father offers a peasant ( George London ) $100,000 to play the role , and the ersatz savage allows himself to be packed off to Chicago . <P> All the vanities of North Shore existence are exposed by the horrified savage-action painting and splintered Christianity , electro-dodecaphonic music and beat poetry , capri pants and cocktail parties . The peasant-savage finally flees to the jungle , having become a no-nonsense savage in the crucible of crumbling society . The girl follows on the wings of love : " Now my unquiet heart is at ease , " she sings . " Nothing remains but ourselves and the trees . " They seal their defection with a kiss-as native bearers carry the appliances of the fat life into their cave . <P> All this had little of " the pleasure of sweetness " that Menotti intended . A month of rehearsals under the sure hand of Thomas Schippers , excellent performances by Peters , Meredith and London , some last-minute opera-doctoring by Menotti , sets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside a crystal Easter egg-nothing could rescue the Savage from its basic banality . <P> Fool &; School . Menotti moves through music like a troop ship avoiding U-boats-back and forth , in and out . He darts from failure ( Labyrinth ) to triumph ( The Death of the Bishop of Brindisi ) with great agility , but nothing he has written since 1955 can approach the genius of The Saint of Bleecker Street or even The Consul . Aside from one or two pleasant arias and one superb septet , there is very little in the Savage that suggests its composer 's grand reputation . The music could have been written any time after 1850 , and the libretto could have been improved by almost anyone with 15 minutes and a pencil . " I would look like a fool , I have never been to school " constitutes a rhyme , but it is a rhyme Menotti shares with the composer of a pop song called Stupid Cupid that was big last year .               @ @ @ @ @ @
