txt American labor thinks it finally sees a rift in the wall it never could breach  --  the American farm . The AFL-CIO is mapping a new campaign now to unionize farm workers . It comes hard on the heels of a " first real break " in California . Schenley Industries , Inc. , ha : ; agreed to talk contract terms with grape pickers in California 's Central Valley . And farm workers have taken the first wobbly steps toward a union election at Di Giorgio Corporation . If these two giants sign up , others might fall in line . They are two of the biggest farm employers on the West Coast . The outcome is still far from certain . But organizers are moving in , swept on by this new impetus . The chief target is California 's lush Central Valley . But the campaign will spill into fields in Florida , Arizona , and New Mexico , too . Labor also is beginning to plow in another field long fenced off from its organizing efforts . It has a nationwide drive under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teachers says it is getting about 15 calls a week from faculty groups wanting information on how to organize AFT locals in halls of ivy . Why ? Money is n't the only reason . Many professors sympathize deeply with the fight 100 faculty members are pressing at St. John 's University in New York . This sympathy has ' sparked organizing drives from New York to California and into the South and Southwest . The strike that gripped St. John 's last fall is still on . To many professors nationally it involves freedom of the individual on campus faculties . And it is causing them to look at a union label for the first time . A presidential emergency board in 60 days hopes to untangle a bargaining knot that nobody else could loose in six months of negotiating . The board , headed by Sen. Wayne Morse ( D ) of Oregon , has already started clawing at the dispute that divides the International Association of Machinists and five major airlines . Wide pay and fringe differences still separate the two parties . President Johnson named the emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The presence of Senator Morse at the head of the table stresses how serious the situation is . The Senator is an ace trouble shooter . Those who have dealt with him on such matters before say he combines " persuasiveness and bludgeon " in just the right degree to untie knots . Trends ... Computers are threatening management 's middle . They can whir and figure and make many management decisions quicker and better than men . And the men who usually make such decisions are middle-management men . The American Foundation on Automation and Employment in New York says computers have already sliced deeply into the need for middle-management people . But up to now , those displaced have quickly landed other jobs . The manpower needs of a b9oming economy wo n't let them stay idle long . However , what happens when times are n't so booming ? The foundation , in a special study , warns that " the storm signals as well as the potential for the future can not be safely ignored or overlooked . " How and why ? ? ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobless pay . Labor has been pressing for changes in the **25;0;TOOLONG laws since 1950 . One change they want is to federalize the system . It now is in state hands . Before the fight is over , the jobless-pay program probably will be changed  --  but much less than labor and the administration want . A strong combine of employers and states ' rights advocates do n't want any substantialchanges that will drive the federal government deeper into the program . But Congress is wary of another rebuff to organized labor in an election year . It already has refused to repeal the right-to-work clause in the Taft Hartley Act " and thereby stirred labor 's ire . Another rebuff might hurt badly at the polls this fall . So labor will get part of what it wants  --  the parts easiest to justify on economic grounds . A watered-down jobless pay package is almost certain to pass . Congress hopes it will make nobody angry  --  though it is n't likely to make anyone very happy either .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
