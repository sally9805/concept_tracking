Not long ago , Abdul Karim Kassem , lean and psychotic strongman of Iraq , boasted that he had survived 38 attempts to kill him over the past 4 years . Last week in Baghdad , death kept the 39th appointment . <P> Rebel Iraqi army officers overthrew the government and issued a characteristic Middle Eastern communiqu : " With the help of God , we have been able to destroy the enemy of God and of the people , Abdul Karim Kassem , and his gang , who have used the country for their own interests and who choked liberty and disrupted the law ! " <P> Home &; Headquarters . The insurrection began on Friday , holiest day of the Moslem week , and in the midst of Ramadan , the month when good Moslems fast every day from sunup to sundown and tempers are everywhere short . Army trucks and tanks were already rumbling through the streets when at 9:30 a.m. , a strident new voice on Radio Baghdad began exulting , " This is the voice of the Iraqi revolution ! " Accusing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened the army , imprisoned and executed scores of officers , " the broadcaster claimed that the rebels " have destroyed the tyrant ! " <P> But the fight was only beginning . Rebel units surrounded Baghdad 's huge , yellow brick Defense Ministry , the home and headquarters of Premier Kassem , which was defended by 600 trusted soldiers . The rebels brought up tanks and heavy artillery , and Iraqi fighter planes strafed and bombed the Kassem fortress . <P> Loyal Disciple . The rebel radio voice frenziedly called for the " people " to pour into the streets " to destroy the remnants of the Kassem regime . " Between exhortations , martial music filled the air , especially songs extolling Arab unity , and Alahu Akbar ( God Is Great ) , a favorite hymn of Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser . <P> The six-man rebel junta that plotted Kassem 's overthrow was apparently made up of captains and lieutenants , except for its leader , ex-Paratroop Colonel Abdul Mustafa . But the man they put forward as their front man came as a shock to Kassem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The junta named as its new rebel head of state Colonel Abdul Salam Aref , 41 , long Kassem 's closest friend and most loyal disciple , and alive only because Kassem commuted his 1959 death sentence . <P> Unshared Prize . To Kassem the coup must have seemed only too familiar . In the same way back in 1958 , Kassem seized power by ruthlessly slaughtering King Feisal II and his ironfisted , pro-Western Premier , Nuri asSaid , who was caught trying to escape the city dressed in women 's clothes . In those days Kassem was a brigadier , with the reputation of being the King 's most loyal soldier . Actually , he was leader of a group of army conspirators including mercurial Colonel Abdul Salam Aref , a passionate pro-Nasserite . After the young King was slain , Kassem appointed himself Premier , named Aref as his deputy , and proclaimed his dedication to " improving the living standards of our population and saving them from living in slums.
