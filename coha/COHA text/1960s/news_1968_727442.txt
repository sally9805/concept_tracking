txt Diplomats discussing the Middle East situation in private conversations here are a bit like drivers of those yellow and black rural school buses loaded with happy , serious , and usually yammering youngsters . Simultaneously , they must drive the bus and still maintain some degree of decorum . These diplomats do n't want to disturb or harm their precious cargo ? in this case , the behind-scenes talks on the Mideast . So when they come to railroad crossings in their conversation , they stop . They look both ways . Then they proceed with caution across the tracks , aware that if they give the wrong signal , tip their hand too obviously , or drop a vital verb or adjective at a critical moment they could ruffle an already aggravated situation . The most difficult crossing , the essential , operative issue here just now at the UN is : ? Whether to permit UN special envoy Gunnar V. Jarring to try to complete some satisfactory phase of private negotiations through his personal mediumship between the Arabs and the Israelis . ? Or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the June , 1967 , war out into public debate again where recrimination and charges and countercharges would resume . Mute or maelstrom The choice lies between muting the anger through private diplomacy , or letting it loose in the forum . Both functions lie within the United Nations ' domain . The trend at the moment is to try private diplomacy a bit longer . United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk has been encouraged by what he terms the " precious state of momentum " being achieved at the UN . Since late September Dr. Jarring , after arduous months of sorting out discussions on location in the Middle East , has met in New York with Arab and Israeli officials trying to detect some nuance or clue of willingness to negotiate . Events unroll And here is where the taut drama begins to unfold . The curtain raiser perhaps could be described as the private talks between Secretary of State Rusk and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko at the Waldorf-Astoria Towers during the week ending Oct. 6 .

Oct. 9 : Significantly , President Johnson authorizes Mr. Rusk to begin talks with Israel on the sale of supersonic Phantom jets .

October 10 : United Arab Republic Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad urges before the : General Assembly Israeli " implementation " - of the Nov. 22 , 1967 , UN resolution concerning Israeli withdrawal from occupied areas . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " througn Dr. Jarring 's mediation , other elements of the resolution involving recognition of the sovereignty of nations , international water-travel rights ( for Israel in the Suez Canal ? and elsewhere ) , refugee problems , etc . , The term " implementation " used in con- nection with the Nov. 22 resolution makes the Israelis squirm . They assert that the only implementation technically requested ? in the resolution has already been complied ? with by UN Secretary General U Thant  --  the appointment of a Middle East mediator , namely Dr. Jarring . The other desirable elements in the resoilution are listed only as principles for nego4iation , say the Israelis who maintain they are willing to discuss them through Dr. Jarring . Significantly the Israelis have waived , at least initially , their demands for face-to-face talks . October 15 : Israel 's Mr. Eban spends several . hours of discussion with Dr. Jarring at his UN office . Mr. Eban elucidates and amplifies his nine-point peace proposals .

October 22 : The Israelis label this as ? " diplomacy by leaks " to the press . They term the Riad reply to the Eban memo as " disappointing " and say it does not respond to any of the Eban points or proposals . There is talk here at the UN that , with all this publicity given to the private talks , Dr. Jarring may be considering moving his mediator 's table , to Geneva or elsewhere , for the convenience of the participants : this , even though he has been allocated a larger office at UN headquarters to accommodate a If corners .
