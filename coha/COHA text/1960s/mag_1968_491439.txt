THE GREAT WORLD AND MILLERSBURG This is an account of what some people who live in the small town of . Mitlersburg , Pennsylvania ( population 3,0007 , told me they are thinking about , especially what they think about the war in Vietnam . However , Vietnam is not exclusively the subject , since iL is difficult to explain a.e 's thoughts about Vietnam without explaining how one feels about being an American in the year 1968 . Even more than this report concern ; what people in Millersburg are thinking , it concerns what I have thought about them and their thoughts . This is a point worth making early in the proceedings . We turn to Millersburg more or less at random . believing , mostly as an act of faith , that the kind of town it is influences the people who live in it , and that in some essential ways Millersburg is similar to Marysville , Waycross , Rapid City . Yellow Springs , Kalamazoo . The town is built directly on the eastern shore of the Susquehanna River . between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks of Market the maim Street . you can see the river glinting between the stores . If you walk two blocks west from Market you can stand on the riverbank in the grass , among the trees , and watch the play of current , rafts of driftwood moving downstream , wild ducks feeding . Any place in town you can look up over the buildings an:I trees and see the mountains , their outlines usually softened by a smoky blue haze . What influence this scenery has had on Millersburg residents , what value it has for them , is hard to say . However , there must be some value to living in a pretty place . since so many who do not , struggle so hard to do so , Many of our citizens today travel in discomfort and aggravation forseveral hours each working day in order to live within sound of a brook or sight of a poor spirea ; others pay extra rent for an outside window , tax themselves , lobby , picket for the sake of a park , a riverscape , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so desirable to so many , people in Millersburg enjoy without effort or sacrifice , as their casual bequest from Daniel Miller , who in 1790 bought the land the town now stands on . The mountains and river not only are aesthetic resources of Millersburg but also have a good hit to do with the social and physical character of the town . Millersburg is 25 miles north of Harrisburg. a city of 74.000. which is the state capital . Elsewhere in the Harrisburg area and in the country as a whole . most small towns so close to the city have been hulled into the urban mass . Among the reasons that this has not happened to Millersburg is that there is no bridge over the river for 15 miles in either direction , and because the state highway going south toward Harrisburg is a two-lane route which crosses Berry 's Mountain in a series of tight , traffic-retarding switchbacks . And so Harrisburg has sprawled in the opposite direction , to . ward the south and east where the land is flatter , and Millersburg has not felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was in 1920. and Millersburg probably looks , sounds , smells now very much as it did then . One late afternoon I was talking to an elderly man about a variety of things horses , fox hunting , juvenile delinquency . Vietnam . We were sitting in the parlor of his substantial square house , a dark . knickknack-lilted room illuminated only . bY a laree Oot - ele tillt , the volume of which had been I timed ? The collection of sou-venirs. the Tv in th , old-fashioned pallor , nnulr me I hink historically . and I asked bow lone and Ins - wife had lived in the hi use . " We moved into it in 1911 and it was brand-new then . We have raised a family id : three here , sonic grandchildren , and 1 hope I hey will carry inc out of the place . 11 stands on a piece of limit my father had acquired . I bought it from him . Then I determined to build on it . though we had a year-old baby . and my wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture , but we survived it . The joists are three-by-nine oak , hauled right to the site from the mountains . A carpenter today would n't know what to do with that kind of lumber . He would be afraid to drive a nail into it . " Some of the houses in Millersburg are naturally smaller , poorer , less well kept than others , but the builders of nearly all of them seem to have had in the back of their minds that a man 's home is his castle . Most are heavy , dark , fortress-like . Street-side windows are small , curtained , doors are solid , discouraging unauthorized entry or observation . Backyards arc big and private . Along the magi streets , merchants do business in buildings 30 , 50 , 70 years old . The stores serve as well now as when they were built , because they serve about the same number and kind of people . There are always enough parking places on Market Street . You can walk the length of the business district , or any place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average suburban shopping-center parking lot . Millersburg High School sits above the town , surrounded by lawns , overlooking the river , looking off toward the mountains . Everyone of high-school age attends this one school , as did many of the adults in town . Parents have some idea of what the junior prom , or a class trip to Washington involves , because they went to the samed / T hi. , , ; : rni.11-111 : " 5 years ago . Every sum . Th . I ilee , ars people have been doing about . with and about the river , camp- crilig1,1 on I he low , brush-covered islands , swimming , fishing , potting about in canoes , it is easy to sentimentalize and so patronize a place like Millersburg . The town is not pretty in a village-on-a-postcard sense , being middle-aged but not antique , a little gray , corroded by use and exposure . People there are largely occupied by the same things that occupy people in Cincinnati or Levittown  --  their bodies , jobs , hills , automobiles , television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social trivia . However , there is a special quality about Millersburg which comes in a way from its being a place where so many people know the history of their own floor joists . Millersburg exudes a soothing sense of continuity , stability . Such a quality can not be created in a community where new streets , buildings , neighborhoods , neighbors , schools , stores , parks , physicians , barbers , bars , embalmers , jobs are constantly being introduced into the environment . On my first day in .11 , ifillersbure I went to visit allied Chubb at his home . Mr. Chubb , the editor and one of the owners of the weekly h. , lillersburg Sentinel . gave inc a copy of I he Millersburg Sesquicentennial Soutenir Book . - When we were getting information together for this book , " he said . " an interesting discovery was made . There had not been a murder in the history of the town . That is quite a record . " I asked air . Chubb if lie would simply talk to me about Millersburg. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . " This is a very quiet , orderly town , " he said . " I am sure sonic of the younger people will tell you it is too quiet . I am not sure that from their standpoint this is not right . and it is probably a failing . " Minding one 's own business , abiding by the law . hard work , neatness , thrift are considered to be important virtues by the Pennsylvania Dutch , and many of us are from that stock . " There are no Negroes in town . though there is a family outside the borough whose children attend our school , without any difficulty so far as I know . There was a Negro family in town , a barber . a line man , but when he retired he moved hack to wherever lie came from , Philadelphia I believe . There is not anything you could call an ethnic minority group here . " This is a Protestant community . We have nine churches in town , the usual ones . We have no Jewish church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they refer to as a chapel . However , there is no Catholic priest here on a regular basis . I suppose you would say most of our religious beliefs , activities are traditional Christian ones . There was a young minister who felt strongly about Vietnam , was against our being there , but lie is no longer with us , though I am sure his beliefs had nothing to do with his leaving . " As you would expect , this is a conservative town politically . strongly Republican . We do have a Democrat for mayor . Stephen Hurko , who is a workingman at Millersburg Reamer &; Tool . That is sort of a special case . Mr. Hurko is very popular personally . I suppose a Democrat every now and then wo n't contaminate us . We have a very high rate of employment here  --  one of the highest in the country , I am told . This has always been the case , even during the Depression . The major industries are four tool-andreamer plants . two shoe factories and a maker of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no question about that . Most of our industries employ unskilled or semiskilled help . The opportunity for higher-paying positions is limited here . That is why so many young people leave . and why a lot of Millersburg residents work in the Harrisburg area . None of the tool-and-reamer works has a union , but the vote at one was close the last time . " By and large , I would say that while this is not a wealthy town , it is a sound one economically . In the basic way people live , it is n't a town of extremes . A family in which both husband and wife work in a factory  --  many of them do  --  will live about the same way as a family of more means . We have our poor , but it is nothing like what you hear about in other places . Usually it is a case of misfortune , a widow , elderly , illness . There is an organization in town which gives Christmas baskets to the needy , I should imagine about a dozen baskets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year in emergencies . Otherwise there are no relief agencies . There are no federal poverty programs or anything like that . There is no need for them , and this type of thing would not be popular in town . " But , as I say , poverty is not really a problem in Millersburg . We are fortunate in that respect and many others . We can stand improvement , but when you think about problems elsewhere , ours are minor . This is a good place to live  --  far better than most as far as I am concerned . " It seems to me that this opinion is more modest than boosterish . A good case can he made to support the claim that Millersburg  --  Millersburgsare the most benign environments our species has ever found or created for itself . In Millersburg water , air and land are plentiful and good ; vermin , disease , pests . predators have been eliminated or are tightly controlled ; food is abundant ; there is enough work to keep everybody occupied , but work is neither endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obtainable ; gregariousness can be satisfied ; no one needs to be constantly on guard against natural disasters or human violence . Because of the excellence of transportation and communication , a man in Millersburg , if he chooses , can he as much in touch with society in general as one who lives in New York ; there is sufficient stability to allow a man to enjoy the illusion of temporal immortality , to permit him to hope that the things he has made and cherished will be used and cherished when he is dead . And what is the effect of living in this benign environment ? It has created a certain amount of gratitude. as evidenced by the general feeling of " we are lucky to live here . " However , it seems to me that a greater effect has been to make people deeply conservative , suspicious of , hostile toward those who do not live in Millersburg and determined to defend themselves against these outsiders . I spent an evening in Millersburg talking with five ladies all of whom are active in the Veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Baker , said , " I think the thing we forget . about Vietnam is that it is part of the overall Communistic plot to destroy us . They are using the war to bleed us economically , cause dissension at home . lower our moral standards , undermine our way of life . That is what worries me. what the Communists are doing here at home . and what all of us can do to stop them . " " Does that really worry you . Mrs. Baker ? I mean , is it a real worry like the furnace not working , or the plumbing going bad ? " " I see what you mean . Maybe it is not that kind of a worry . We are not directly involved so much here . We are protected , thank goodness . If I lived in Harrisburg it would be different . " " Communists are a threat in Harrisburg ? " " Well , for example , if you live in Harrisburg you just do n't go out without locking your house . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you saying Communists are breaking into homes in . Harrisburg ? " " Well , it is all part of the same thing . Crime , the streets being unsafe , strikes , the trouble with the colored , all this dope-taking , people leaving the churches . It is sort of a breakdown of our standards , the American way of life . " Another evening 1 was talking to Mrs. Robert . Novinger . " Everything seems so prosperous and secure now , " she said , " but I have never felt more insecure in my life . " Mrs. Novinger found it difficult to explain the precise cause of her insecurity . She said she had a feeling that the world was full of threatening forces , and she gave , lamely , the example of Medicare . " That 's not what I really mean , " she apologized . " It 's just that there seem to be many things which we have to do , when , before , you could choose to do them . I just have this terrible feeling we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All of which can and has been made to sound like the most pathetic sort of lunatic-fringe raving . But to treat it in that way is a mistake , I think . Mrs. Baker , Mrs. Novinger and others in Millersburg , those in other Millersburgs who share these feelings , are a numerous group , and they are not paranoid kooks . They are solid , constructive . responsible citizens who are talking about things that genuinely trouble them . One difficulty is their manner of speaking , or rather our manner of listening . We fail to consider the special way in which people like Mrs. Baker use certain symbols . " Communist . " for example , is a catchall word . It applies not only to those who are members of the Communist Party . live in Communist countries , subscribe to Communist economic and political theories , but also to a variety of people . institutions , forces that are hostile , Mrs. Baker believes , to what Mrs. Baker regards as the reasonable , moral , legal , human way to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should pick the word " Communist " to describe these hostile forces is scarcely surprising , since for almost a quarter of a century the Communist has been regarded as National Enemy No. 1 . That Mrs. Baker and Mrs. Novinger should believe that there are people and forces working toward the elimination or drastic alteration of Millersburg America ) does not seem to me to be evidence of derangement . There are such people and forces . Every year communities like Millersburg become fewer . They are gobbled up by freeways and housing developments , sacrificed , rightly or wrongly . to the needs of a growing , mobile population . Also , as anybody inside or outside of Millersburg knows . there are a lot of real and prominent people , ranging from Sinclair Lewis to Stokely Carmichael. who have made it quite clear that Millersburg is anathema to them  --  that it is too dull , too WASPish , private . materialistic , antisocial , and that the sooner 11Iillersburg 's influence on America is scotched , the better . There are a great many people in Millersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . However , I was honestly struck by how many seemed to share at least partially the opinion that Millersburg is besieged by hostile forces . It seemed to me that this is the principal way in which the benign , small-town environment influences the people who live in it and colors what they think about many things , including Vietnam . If you ask people in Millersburg what they think about increasing our military commitment in Vietnam , pressing for negotiations , halting the bombing , any of the official issues of war or peace . the opinion they give you is seldom a passionate one . Nor are these issues a topic of general conversation . Not once during the three months or so I was around Millersburg in public and private places did I hear anyone talking about Vietnam . except in response to my direct questions . However , there is a related subject that is talked about passionately - the protest against the war . What To Do About the War Protesters seemed to me to be a much larger , more emotional issue in Millersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only explanation I have for this is that the matter of war protesters touches on the sensitive we  --  are-besieged nerve of Millersburg . In Millersburg. " war protester " is synonymous with " hippie . " Communist is the generic term for hostile people and forces , but the personification of the hostile individual is no longer the seedy spy carrying a bomb ; it is a hairy youth with needle marks on his arm , wearing a blanket and flowers , who is more than likely also a Communist . A hippie does not believe in God . family , private property , good grooming , personal daintiness . Bing Crosby , Bart Starr or almost anything else that Millersburg believes in . One of the things that worries some adults and parents in Millersburg is that the hippie-protesters , like witches or gypsies , will steal their children . There may be something to this worry . I made arrangements to spend four class periods each with two Problems of Democracy classes ( mostly seniors ) at Millersburg High School . I found the 60 high-school students afire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four exceptions , each one seemed to want to outdo his classmates in speaking badly of the flower children . I thought the students did protest too much . One morning I asked both classes to characterize war protesters . What follows is the collectively contributed portrait . " They are badly informed , cowards . " " Why are they badly informed ? So many of them seem to be connected with universities . " " They are probably smart in classes , but they are not practical . They do n't know anything about America . " " Why are they cowards ? They go to jail , get beat on the head by police . That seems to me to take some courage . " " If they were n't cowards they would go into the service . " " But why do they protest ? They could dodge the draft and not protest . " " They do it for publicity . " One night a week or so before Christmas . sitting on the edge of a pool table above the fire station , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoke , a foreman in a Harrisburg defense plant . Kenneth Rowe , an employee in a Millersburg shoe factory , and Baylis Macy. a railroad clerk who also works as a part-time borough policeman . All of us were middle-aged veterans of World War II . " What I would like to know , " Rowe asked rhetorically when the conversation turned , as so many in Millersburg did , to the protesters . " is how they get away with it . If I break into a public building , burn up papers , I 'd go to jail . Once in a while you see a picture of a few of these kids out of how many thousands in front of a judge . but the next day they are right back at it . " " We 've gone overboard on the respect due the criminal . We have lost respect for the law , " said Macy . " I think whether it is war protest or any other trouble the authorities should enforce all laws impartially , and the rest of us should support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do when you have fifty thousand of them trespassing on the Pentagon ? Shoot them ? " " Maybe we 'd be better off if we did . " said Hoke . Hoke is a hard-looking. angry-sounding man . " These punk kids , draft-card burners , all those Rap Browns think we are afraid of them . If we would crack down hard a few times , they would straighten out in a hurry . What I 'd like to see is all these long-haired birds sent to Vietnam so the decent kids could come home . " Some people left me with the impression that the reason they supported the war in Vietnam was because the war protesters were against it . I got the feeling generally that war protesters were more passionately disliked than the battlefield enemy . However , no one seemed particularly alarmed or exercised by individuals who seek quietly to avoid becoming personally involved with the war . Unlike war protesters , War Avoid . ers are to be found in Millersburg . I talked to parents who were planning their sons ' educational careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met men of my age who favored vigorous prosecution of the war in Vietnam , but . when the conversation got easier , told a few funny stories about how they had avoided service in World War II , or escaped lengthy or dangerous service . There is a boy I know in Millersburg who has a hernia sufficiently severe to make him ineligible for induction . " They say they ca n't take me until it is corrected , but that I am not obligated to have the operation . I figure I can live with it for quite a while . " One afternoon I was sitting in the Millersburg draft-board office when a boy came in to talk to Mrs. Ruth Sweigard , the local clerk . His questions being more important than mine . I retired to a corner chair and eavesdropped . The boy handed Mrs. Sweigard a paper . She pulled out a file . typed an entry and returned the document to him . It was apparently a marriage record , for he then asked , " What does that do for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Mrs. Sweigard said . " In that line the only thing that would change your classification is if you were an expectant father . For that you would have to bring in a medical certificate from your physician . " " I 'll bring one in tomorrow , " the boy said . Why the difference in how most people regard war protesters and war avoiders ? I think the explanation is that war protesters are judged to be attacking the right of society to impose its will on an individual , while war avoiders merely try to outmaneuver the apparatus but do not deny the right . Thus it is no more unpatriotic to cherish a small hernia in order to avoid military service than it is to hire an accountant to avoid taxes . What most people in Millersburg think the war protester is attacking is mythic America , the Logres of the West . A number of people in Millersburg indicated in one way or another that they believe Uncle Sam still lives , and that he lives best in . Millersburgs , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laissez-faire economic system ; in Protestant churches that still respect the Bible . He also lives . if a little uneasily these days , in certain public institutions . notably the Constitution , most state governments and all law-enforcement agencies . Respect for these institutions ( which are those that created Millersburg and have given it a special position of influence within the nation 1 is regarded as the patriotic duty of true Americans . Patriotism is straight in Millersburg , and the patriotic principle is fairly well summed up by the slogan . " My country right or wrong . " One day I asked the Problems of Democracy students each to write a few lines expressing their reaction to this famous cora inued on page 14 I quotation . The following answers are generally typical of what was virtually the unanimous response : " If your country should make a mistake we should not turn our backs on it . If we would we would n't have it the way we do now " ? Ron Leit4el . " The people make up the government . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your congressman , but by all means stick behind your government . Remember . you are the government " ? Ken Dimpsey . ' ' Right , because a nation as great as ours is n't wrong or we would not be as great " ? David Lenker . The overwhelming majority of the people I talked to supported the war in Vietnam , and the majority of this majority did so for reasons very similar to those expressed by David Lenker . Though many admitted overtly or covertly that they might be uncertain as to the causes and objectives of the war , they were for it because they thought this was a good ( in a moral , historical sense ) country , and whatever this country did was probably for the best . Mrs. Ruth Sweigard has been the clerk of the Millersburg draft board for 17 years . " In my position . " says Mrs. Sweigard , " I sometimes hear people wondering why we are fighting in Vietnam . I do n't read much myself . Working full time , I do n't have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys who come back . 1 know that they all think we should be there . That 's wlim I tell people , 110 I imi willing , In helieve the lets . " Vietnam veterans are not numerous in Millers- ' , mg . For one I ! ling , only Iwo or three boys a month are indurrert Somedo not go to Vietnam . N those who , , . iny return only briefly to the town , then go I Lure , back to school or to f Ind jobs that pay better than those available in ! own . " Why do the boys say we are fighting ? " " Well , I do n't recall specific reasons , but I know they think it is the right thing to do . That if we were n't there the Communists would win . " Donna Stone is a 21-year-old . She works in a local shoe factory , stitching shoes , Five months ago she married a boy named Barry Stone who now has served four months in Vietnam . " We got married when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Donna , " hut it was not one of those spur-of-the-moment things . We had been engaged for two years . Barry just wanted to get married before he went overseas . I think about it , the war , more now . I watch the news programs more now . That 's only natural . " " Do you think any differently about Vietnam now than live months ago ? " " No , not really . I do n't think war is a good thing . I did n't think it was then , but I guess we have to do this . Barry says he thinks we have to fight over there , and he should know more about it than I do . He says he has thought more about the war since he has been there . " In Millersburg. among those who support the war for specific reasons , the reason most often given for fighting in Vietnam is strategic necessity . The Communists are an aggressive power bent on the eventual conquest of the United States , ( The Viet Cong , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese . ) We will have to fight them someplace , and it is better to do so along the Mekong than the Susquehanna . Another opinion common in Millersburg is that , strategy aside , the prestige of the United States is at stake in Vietnam . " I am not so certain how necessary the war is , or if we had any business getting involved in the first place , " said Alfrederiilor or else trying to get an appointment to West class I have ever known has at least one repre. sentative . He is a sweet , pure , passionate idealist , Millersburg or anyplace else enrage him , and he is wholeheartedly on the side of their victims . school senior of a type of which every graduating Hypocrites , self-seekers , bullies , scoundrels in country Is N would like to favor our involvement in Vietnam for moral reasons . Broderick Klinger is a high- in a thing of this sort , we have to win it , " " I am thinking about joining the Peace Corps There are also some who favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . If we are I Chubb . " But I like to think my Point , " Broderick said of his own plans . " Those seem like contradictory ambitions . " " I know they seem that way , but I do n't think they are . In either one there is a great chance to help other people . " It is easy , in fact almost instinctive , to grin at this good young boy and give him a pat on the head . But it is also easy , instinctive to forget that many of us were once ( in a certain sense America as a nation once was ) Broderick Klinger , and we carry within us a suppressed sorrow that we have grown too old for this sort of thing . " I was in favor of the war , " said Broderick , " because I think protecting the freedom and independence of Vietnam is worth fighting for , but now that they say this is n't really our aim . I 've got to think everything out again . " The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " they " several Administration spokesmen who announced that containment of Communism was the principal reason for our presence in South Vietnam . I found no one else in Millersburg who followed the news closely enough or perhaps was sufficiently naive to connect his own beliefs , as Broderick Klinger did , to particular statements of a Secretary of State or President . However , it did appear that , like Broderick , others were finding it difficult to base their support of the war on morality . One of these is the Reverend Frederick Bennetch , the young pastor of the Hebron Evangelical United f ( W IIOW page 4.11 Brethren Chin ch . " I in Korea , " says the Reverend Mr. Rennetch , " not as a chaplain . I ca n't recall I had irly particular doubts about my personal role . I eXPeCt haul a sort of indehrine notion Ilcit I was defending my country . But now things seem different , or perhaps I am just different . My instinct is that war , any war is a useless , senseless thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is hard to find an example of it . I waver , depending upon the news , between favoring negotiations and immediate withdrawal , but 1 continue to support our policies because I suppose I feel loyalty toward my country , and do not feel I am well informed enough to withdraw my support on the grounds of private conscience . " I am worried that as a nation perhaps we will come to enjoy all of this too much , our great power , our ability to influence . dictate to other people --  that we will come to enjoy war . It has happened to other people who became so obsessed with power itself that they could not or would not consider whether they were using their power justly or unjustly . Perhaps this is happening to us . Perhaps this is our confusion . " There is a notion that perhaps summarizes the worst fears of Broderick Klinger and the Reverend Mr. Bennetch . It is that for a country such as our . a little war is a good thing . According to this opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity , stimulates technology , provides youth with adventure , keeps the military harmlessly occupied abroad , out of domestic mi chief , and provides a convenient excuse for conservative elements who wish to delay social reform ; and change . In Millersburg you hear only whir- . pers of this argument . It is not put forward as a ! henry one believes oneself , only as one that per haps people in high , hidden places may believe . Stan Bailey is an insurance broker . " I do n't really think there is much question , " Bailey said , " that the war is helping to maintain prosperity , Our industries here in town are not directly involved in war work , but the tool-and-reamer plants supply defense contractors . There are a lot of people in town who go to Harrisburg for the higher wages in defense plants . I would he one of the ' I first to feel the effects of a recession . Insurance is something people cut back on first when times get a little hard . I guess I am benefiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that influences my opinion . I think it will he hard for you to find anyone who says he is for the war because it is good business . It 's just not the kind of thing that is admitted , not even to yourself , suppose . " Stan Bailey 's insurance office is in his home . and on the morning he and I were talking . his son Terry was in and out of the room and conversation . Terry was packing , it being the next to last day of his furlough . He had come home after completing basic training at Fort Benning , Ga. , and would leave the next day . " A lot of the guys talk about it , " Terry said , regarding our war-for-prosperity speculations . " They say they hope it lasts until they get back , so they can make some of the money they 're paying in defense plants . Maybe it is just bull , but that 's what a lot of them think it is all about . " " I am sure there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us , can we afford it , " Bailey said , " but who knows what influence this thinking has on what we do in Vietnam ? " " Some of the weapons we 've worked with you just would n't believe , " Terry said . " But they do n't send most of them over there . just enough to sort of test them out . Why do n't we use all our stuff ? There has got to be a reason . " " Why do n't we use all our stuff ? " is a question that puzzles many more people in Millersburg than Terry Bailey . That a large , powerful . industrial nation can not use its power as and when it wants in and against a small , relatively primitive country annoys and worries nearly everyone . There is a feeling that the military is being leashed for " political " reasons , but nobody can explain what political advantage there is for anyone in needlessly prolonging the war . There being no obvious explanation . devious ones are hinted at  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our policy makers are being influenced by enemy agents . " They can laugh at George Wallace , " said Robert Martin , a Linotype operator , " but you can bet nobody is going to whisper in his ear . He is for America first . " At the American Legion bar , among the old warriors , you can find some who say , " Why do n't they drop the goddamn bomb and get it over with ? That 's what we 've got it ( or . China ? What can China do about it ? " But this struck me as barroom bravado . I doubt that even those who express this opinion at certain times seriously favor I think we should stop fighting in that Vietnam place . I do not want any others to have happen to them what happened to Cleon and to me . It is for nothing . It is not right . " Mrs. Schreiner was one of the four people I met who were unequivocally against the war . Another was Mrs. John Haines , I had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who I had been told was leaving the next morning for the Army as a draftee . She sat with John and me , talking rapidly . often angrily , chain-smoking , looking as if she was very tired of self-control and would rather have just screamed wordlessly or cried . " Why , " she asked ostensibly of John , but really of no one . " do you have to go ? You 've got a good education , a good job . He is an engineer . " " I 'm a junior engineer , a trainee , Mother . " " There are boys in this town I can name who have been out of school longer than you have , or have n't even been to school . Why are they still here ? It 's who you know in this town . If my father were alive this would n't have happened . " " Come on , Mom , " John said with embarrassment . " It 's just one of those things . " " That 's what everybody says . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . " " Well . we are in a war , and somebody has to Fight it . do n't they ? " John asked . " Why not me ? " YU , wit ; 111010fh Why do we 10 ! Ill a wai hi. , this ?

Like lighting cigarettes with dollar bills . If there is n't any reason , we should stop it at once . " There is also a girl who is against the war , a 17- year-old high-school senior named Chris Schorr . She affects an abrasive manner , wears her skirts shorter than most Millersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a hippie . Her classmates tease her about this as they might a girl who was admittedly stagestruck . Adults in town gossip about Chris . " You know , we have our own hippie in town , " a mother told me . " She is a little girl at school . I think her parents work at the shoe factory . She tries too hard at it . I think the other girls think she is affected . " Before I met Chris , I had been thinking about the similarities between how hippies are regarded in Millersburg and witches were in small towns a few centuries ago . And so it occurred to me when I did meet the girl that she was classical witch material . Reportedly the witches usually were restless , imaginative adolescent girls imprisoned in orthodox communities . dreaming of shockingly romantic adventures . One afternoon live girls . including Chris , met me after school . I asked them to tell me what they would like to do if they could do anything . " They think I 'm putting on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut I really would like to go to California and see how it is . I 'd probably be frightened and not know what to do . I do n't really want to do anything so terrible . Marijuana would probably make me sick to my stomach . I 'd just like to walk around and look . You know , I think about walking down a street where everyone instead of being busy buying and selling things , is just singing , and if you feel like it you can stop and sing with them . " The other girls had pretty straight . derivative dreams of having two nice children and a rich . kind , handsome husband with a good sense of humor . While I was listening to them paraphrase old Doris Day movies , my mind and eye wandered . I looked back at Chris , whose tough little mouth was working , and whose eyes were wet . " What 's wrong , Chris ? " " I know I wo n't do it . I 'll just think about it . I 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the shoe factory . " Chris is opposed to the war in Vietnam . because that is what hippies are opposed to . She is a war protester , though she has not yet protested . A man who , like Chris and the two women , outspokenly opposes the war is unique in Millersburg , so far as I know , and I suspect would he a rare bird anywhere . " I am Rubendall , " he introduced himself , " a Christian businessman , taxpayer , World War II veteran . one who is concerned with mankind . " Rubendall and his partner , Miller , operate an odd sort of business , unequal parts gas station , car wash , hardware and electrical-appliance store . Business did not look good and is not , Miller and Rubendall admit , because of competition from Harrisburg chain stores and other factors . But that was not what they wanted to talk about . Miller and Rubendall wanted a third for conversation as bridge fanatics want a fourth . The passion of Miller and Rubendall is speculative discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miff in which everything is ground line with loving care . They treateach other and each other 's opinions with formal respect. , as if they were strangers meeting at a public debate . Miller is the flashier talker , being a funny . profane , analytical man . As regards Viet. - nam hit , position is the more or less official one , and he defends such things as the domino theory , importance of alliances as well as , and much more pungently than , the official spokesmen . " Now Ruhendall thinks differently . " he said . " I think he is wrong , too sentimental . but he 's got some different ideas than most . You 'll find them of interest . " Ruhendall is a small , tubby , perpetually smiling man , the accountant of the business . He is a graduate of the Wharton School of Finance . has a brother who is the president of an old , distinguished university , and is a man of considerable formal erudition , of great wit . How one of his training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas station-car wash-refrigerator store might he the best story in Millersburg , but I did not hear it . " I think , " said Rubendall , " it is a mistake for a man or a nation simply to be against things , no matter how dangerous the thing may be . We must he for things . In this case what we must he for is the perfection of our own society . We have an opportunity to make this nation a paradise on earth . We must devote ourselves to the problems of poverty , education , medicine , leisure , human relations . We have the opportunity , the resources . the knowledge , to do things in this direction which no other people have ever had or may ever have again . We will lose the opportunity , we mock it , if we waste our resources in negative efforts such as Vietnam . We must cease the war and devote the same effort and enthusiasm to making this a paradise on earth . If we do this . no one else in the world will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Rubendall , you have much different opinions than most people in town , Does it make any difficulties , I mean practical ones ? For example , would people be likely not to buy from you and Miller because you feel the war is wrong ? " " I had n't really thought about that . " Rubendall said . grinning . " I do n't imagine it makes much difference , but even if it did I would n't regard it as important . I had a friend , a newspaper reporter . His motto was a Latin phrase that meant . ' Do n't let the bastards grind you down . ' " All collections of what-do-you-think-about opinions , such as this article . are distorted in a fundamental way . They misrepresent the opinion of those who may be the true majority  --  the indifferent . The neutral , even more than the holder of unpopular views , will take pains to camouflage his true feelings . If you ask , " What do you think about Vietnam ? " it takes a truly independent personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few people who in my bones I felt did n't care a tinker 's damn about Vietnam , but did n't care to admit this and so offered some sort of pro forms opinion on the matter . I met only one who did n't care and apparently did n't care who knew it . Andy Johnson is a wiry , muscular . deadly cool 22-vear-old . When I talked to him he was home on furlough . having completed his training as a Green Beret . In December he was scheduled to report to the West Coast and thence to Vietnam . where I assume he now is . I asked him what he thought about Vietnam . " I could n't care less , " Andy said , absolutely without braggadocio or I'm-off-in-the-morning heroics . ' ' I guess there are sonic kicks over there . and the pay works out pretty good for us . A few of us have been talking about putting our money together and getting into cattle ranching in South America when and if we get back . So I 'm sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the rest of that garbage , who 's right , who 's wrong , what are we going to do about il , ItIsv I say , 1 really could n't cure less ? " Andy Johnson hi ithers some pi:I/plc in Millers-burg , more than even a Chris Schorr. the would.he hippie . She at least gives them the sat isfaction of Dimly reacting against the community , Andy doss not For some time he has apparently been unmoved by Millersburg . When he was just a little boy , : a lady told me , " he would go around all sum-mer in just a pair of dirty shorts . no shoes or shirt . He comes from a nice family . He would sit on the street like that just staring at people. - A few years ago Andy left town and bummed his way to Yucatan . Later , instead of going to school as most boys of his class do , to become an accountant or a teacher or an engineer , he went to trade school to learn welding , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The afternoon I saw him , Andy said he was going to spend the last two weeks of his month 's furlough in Venezuela . " I just thought I 'd like to go . I had the money . and anyway . I 've finished oft a car here . and there is n't much else to do . " What 1 think bothers people most about Andy Johnson is that he is proof that as things stand now . the mortal enemy of Millersharg - Millers- burgs. the benign environment- is boredom . I want to w i ? e about this notion because I thought about L Alen while in Millersburg , and often since I left tiie town . Though it is now too late to document it with suitable quotations and statistics , I had the sense that underneath a good hit of the orderliness and tradition of Millersburg , beneath some of the conservatism and the suspicion of the outside world , lay envy and boredom- the feeling that exciting things were happening outstde , things that nobody would dare to let happen in Millersburg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me to illustrate a terrible dilemma of civilizations . The attainment of security  --  comfort and safety  --  is a long-sought goal of our species . Yet when we attain any considerable degree of security there is a taste of ashes about the triumph . Security , as we think of it now . almost by definition makes it difficult to have something else we are always seeking  --  stimulation . If both security and stimulation are natural needs , then neither The Millersburg Way ( the enshrinement of security , the disparagement of all but the mildest s . emulation as a kind of animalityi nor The Hippie Way t the elevation of stimulation , putting down security as vegetablism ) seems to offer an escape from the dilemma . If there is a way out . and very likely there is not , it would seem to be the middle , Hippieburger Way  --  where a man looks outward , without shame , for the security of the benign environment , inward for stimulation . I am going to end this essay by writing about the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it seems reasonable to end with the true end rather than a contrived one . Shorty Campbell is 84 years old . He is one of the partners ho own the Millersburg Sentinel ? but he is no longer active on the paper , being badly crippled with arthritis . It is a hard thing for him , harder perhaps than for most , because his ailment has cut hint off from the two things that he most enjoyed in his life , gathering news of what is happening in Millersburg and poking around the water and shores of the Susquehanna . " So , " said Shorty , in the last hour I was in Millersburg . " I have become a sky watcher . I ca n't look down much , ca n't get out a lot . so I look through the window and up .
