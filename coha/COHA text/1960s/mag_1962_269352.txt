Next only to the match that General Sherman lit on their premises , many Georgians regard the 1955-59 administration of Governor Marvin Griffin as the worst disaster ever to hit the state . In the words of a grand jury , the state government under Griffin was characterized by the " perfidious conduct of state officials heretofore inconceivable to the minds of citizens . " Nearly two dozen people were charged with almost everything except stealing the roof off the Statehouse ; among the convicted were a former member of the state board of corrections , a former state park director , and a former assistant state purchasing agent . Though one educated estimate placed the cost of corruption at $30 million . Griffin 's comment was simply : " Nuts . Just plain nuts . " <P> In the ordinary course of events , it would have seemed that Griffin was through in politics . No such thing . Last week Democrat Griffin was running again for Governor - and was given a good chance of winning . <P> Peashooter . Griffin 's opposition in the September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia ) is not much . Of his four rivals , one is a woman who claims , " I do n't know why Georgia could n't have a woman Governor . Europe has had its queens . " Another is a Bible-quoting farmer-brickmason whose plat form is prayer , but who does n't have one in this contest . Only Carl Sanders . 37. a good-looking state senator , seems to have a chance against Griffin . Sanders has the backing of a host of anti-Griffinites , including Georgia 's key newspapers ( the " Atlanta integrationist press , " as Griffin calls it ) . Sanders also figures to benefit by the fact that Georgia 's county-unit voting system has at last been overthrown by the courts . In years past , state elections in Georgia were decided not on popular votes but on a complex system where by each county was permitted so many unit votes in the ballot box . Invariably , this gave the rural counties a hugely dis proportionate balance of power against the populous areas ; Griffin himself , for example , was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Countering this . Griffin is capitalizing on Georgia 's rising racial tensions . He has threatened to put the Rev. Martin Luther King so far back in jail that " they 'll have to shoot peas to feed him . " To cheers of approval , Griffin castigates " superliberals and one-worlders " who threaten to " trample " Georgia . He praises " our sister states in the South " for their refusal to throw m " the towel of surrender " by integrating their schools , paints a lurid picture of integration in Washington , where " it was necessary to station policemen in the halls and corridors of their public schools , and even this action did not prevent rape , beatings and muggings . " Although Sanders himself is a segregationist , Griffin calls him " a puppet and an amanuensis and a handmaiden of Martin Luther King . "
