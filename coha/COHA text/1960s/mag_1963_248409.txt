ELIZABETH APPLETON ( 310 pp. ) - John O'Hara-Random House ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> Roughly four years ago , John O'Hara abandoned his long attempt to serve up the Great American novel in three-deck fictional sandwiches . It was a good thing , both for O'Hara and his admirers . For O'Hara sometimes seems to know too much about the minutiae of U.S. society for his own good as an artist . He is better in smaller compass . Since early 1960 , he has brought out three good novellas , two normal-sized novels , a book of plays , two volumes of superlative short stories , and now Elizabeth Appleton , an attempt to sum up the life of an American woman in 310 fast-paced pages . <P> To her twice-divorced sister coming to visit her in Spring Valley , Pa. , Elizabeth , nearing 40 , seems the conventionally perfect wife . Dress : cultured pearls and sweaters . Husband : an amiable history professor turned dean and now gunning for the presidency of Spring Valley College . Children : a boy at St. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Privacy . Predictably , this outer , middle-class placidity masks a history of inner whirl-some past , some still to come . Hints dropped to the sister by Elizabeth 's friends , a series of flashbacks , provide Elizabeth with a full set of sexual and social complexes . The mother-dominated daughter of a New York social snob , she has been nudged into a more active life and a less glittering marriage by her democratic-minded father . For years she has tried to live down to her husband 's in come , loyally cultivated the rest of the faculty for the good of his career . <P> But is it all loyalty ? Or is she compulsively turning back to the past by pushing her husband toward the presidency of the college , which he does n't really want ? A little of both , probably . O'Hara does n't say . But when she drifts into an affair , it is with a man of her own class . <P> There are moments when O'Hara seems to be saying you can get the girl out of the Social Register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl . And there are times , in capsule form at least , when Elizabeth 's odyssey sounds like a radio serial that has lost its snap and crackle . But in the telling , it frequently pops with O'Hara 's unequaled expertise as a domestic historian . Tuning in on a bridge game or a couple chatting over the supper dishes , watching a college president pushing responsibility for a nasty school scandal off onto the shoulders of a young dean , he catches dialogue which seems not so much an artistic invention as an overheard invasion of privacy . An early scene in Southampton , when Elizabeth 's mother politely grills her daughter 's not-quite-acceptable suitor at dinner is taut with O'Hara 's unique ear for innuendo and eye for man 's decorous inhumanity to man . <P> Also Topic A. In earlier O'Hara , Elizabeth 's affair might have destroyed her marriage . Now older and increasingly concerned with the final assessments of a lifetime , O'Hara sends Elizabeth back to her husband . Forced to accept the fact that her husband and her marriage are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are both a lot stronger than she thought .
