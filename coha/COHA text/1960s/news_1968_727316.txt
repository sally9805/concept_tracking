Osborne Jr. , a Nashville attorney for Hoffa , the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . . Mr. Sheridan insisted in his testimony he had " loaned " the money to Mr. Vick , although , he said , the prospects of repayment were uncertain . Mr. Sheridan said Mr. Vick was destitute because he had lost his job after he had testified against the popular Nashville lawyer . He said he had lent Mr. Vick the $3,000 because he thought it would be bad for law enforcement if people who testified for the Government were permitted to suffer for it .

According to Mr. Sheridan , Mr. Vick telephoned him in Washington late in 1964 and said he was " an emotional wreck " because Christmas was coming and he had no money to provide for his family . Mr. Sheridan , who had left the Government several months before , arranged for the Justice Department to pay $675 to bring the Vick family to Washington for a visit . Mr. Sheridan , who had been the chief investigative official for the " Hoffa squad " that Robert Kennedy had formed within the Justice Department , said he knew Mr. Smith well enough to call him in New York and ask for the money .

Mr. Davis produced documents yesterday to show that the Justice Department had paid Mr. Vick a total of $1 , - 340.80 for expenses in connection with four visits to Washington . In addition , Mr. Davis has charged that the Government arranged for Mr. Vick to remain on the payroll of the Nashville Police Department for five months without working , after he testified . Gilbert Merritt Jr. , the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee , attempted to show at yesterday 's hearing that Mr. Vick had suffered financially because he had testified against the Nashville lawyer .
