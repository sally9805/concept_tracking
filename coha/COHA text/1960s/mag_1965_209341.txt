Unemployment is an emotional word , and consequently is less understood and more exaggerated than just about any other aspect of the U.S. economy . It conjures up visions of depression , poverty and helplessness for vast numbers of people - and , indeed , it means that for some . The facts , though , do not really fit the fears . Unemployment is not only dwindling steadily but is con- siderably less acute than some statistics make it out to be . <P> Many economists predicted only a few months ago that unemployment would stay high simply because the U.S. work force had been expanding as rapidly as the economy . Now they find themselves surprised by how quickly the situation has changed . From a rate of 4.9% in April , unemployment dipped to 4.5% in July , 4.4% in September . Last week the Commerce Department reported that it fell further to an eight-year low of 4.3% in October - while employment rose to 72.5 million jobs , a record for the month . <P> Productivity Slips . Unemployment is melting primarily because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the labor force . A growth of 31% to 4% is needed to create jobs for all the youngsters entering the labor force ; this year the gross national prod uct will <P> Available jobs are also on the rise because U.S. industrial productivity is not growing as fast as it did earlier in the 1960s . Productivity has been rising 3.2% annually for the past several years ; the 1965 gain will be just below 3% . Why the slowdown ? Increased demand has pushed factories into producing at 89% of their capacity , is forcing them to use older , less efficient machinery and less skilled workers . Shortages of skilled labor are continuing to crop up in many industries . <P> As skills become scarcer , the Government 's economic policymakers are beginning to criticize a trend that they once favored . Says Otto Eckstein , a member of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers : " It is not in the economy 's interest to encourage widespread early retirement . " The Administration is thus splitting away from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , which says that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensions . <P> Between Jobs . While Government economists agree with labor that unemployment remains a problem , they believe that it has been overplayed . Half of the unemployed are simply " between jobs " - out of work for less than five weeks-and a quarter of the total are seeking part-time jobs . Less than 3% of the nation 's adult men are unemployed . What raises the overall statistics is " class unemployment " - joblessness among nonwhites , women , teenagers and the unskilled ( see chart ) . <P> A certain amount of unemployment is inevitable . " In an economy in which 10,000 or more newcomers enter the work force every day , " says Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz , " and perhaps as many more leave one job to go to another , there is bound to be ' frictional unemployment ' amounting to about 2% to 2.5% . There will always be , in addition to this , about one-half of 1% who simply lack what it takes . " Adding up those figures , federal policymakers conclude that a jobless rate of 21% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has advanced halfway toward that goal in the past two years , is now only 1,000,000 jobs short of achieving it .
