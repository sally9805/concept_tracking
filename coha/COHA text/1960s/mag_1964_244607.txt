Corporate jets flew onto the market a few years ago at a time when most businessmen were reluctant to buy such expensive gadgets for fear of irritating cost-conscious stockholders . But improvement in corporate profits and the introduction of new and cheaper jets have allayed much of that fear . Many a president now believes that a rakish new jet is just what his company needs for greater mobility and smarter image . Now the executive jet is well on its way to gaining the acceptance already won by its piston-engine counterpart . <P> The first of the corporate jets - Lockheed 's $1,450,000 JetStar - has experienced such a sudden sales lift that used JetStars now sell for $150,000 more than new ones because of a 15-month waiting period for delivery ; after long-suffering patience , National Steel fort night ago received the 29th JetStar sold by Lockheed to corporate customers . North American Aviation , whose $795,000 Sabreliner followed the JetStar into the market , has sold 25 of the twin-jet planes in the past twelve months . The jet that has attracted the most orders-60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is Aero Commander 's Jet Commander , which sells for $595,000 , cruises at 440 m.p.h. and carries as many as seven passengers . The Jet Commander 's chief advantage : straight wings that enable it to land and take off on short runways . <P> The most exciting of the new jets is the sleek Lear Jet ( cost : $575,000 ) , which cruises at 530 m.p.h. and can outclimb an F-100 fighter plane to 10,000 ft . Builder William Lear Sr. calls it " the fighting businessman 's jet . " He has firm orders for 21 , hopes to start delivery at the rate of eight monthly by year 's end . Among his customers : Rexall , Kroehler and German Steel Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza . <P> A whole flock of new corporate jets in the under-$1,000,000 class are also beginning to take to the air in Europe . Germany 's Hansa 320 last week made its maiden flight , will go into production in early 1965 . Italy 's PD-808 , a joint effort by Piaggio , the maker of the famed Vespa motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test flights in June . Britain 's Hawker Siddeley will deliver its first DH-125 jet to Krupp in August , has orders from 13 more corporate customers . <P> Production has just begun on France 's ten-passenger Mystere 20 ; Pan American has already ordered 40 of these 530-m.p.h. jets , has an option on 120 more . Pan Am will start receiving the planes in early 1965 and will sell ( and sometimes lease ) them in the U.S. and Canada . Clearly , Pan American 's cagey President Juan Trippe , who has seldom been wrong about travel trends , believes that little jets will play a big role in businessmen 's futures .
