Algeria 's Premier Ahmed ben Bella is moving ever closer to complete one-man rule . Last week venerable , ailing ex-Premier Ferhat Abbas , 63 , quit his post as Speaker of the Assembly and handed out a 15-page critique of the government . He was chiefly upset because Ben Bella keeps ignoring the Assembly , even read the country 's new , strongly centralized constitution to a meeting of his own followers at an Algiers movie theater before submitting it to the Deputies . Asked Abbas : " Why should we agree to a constitution that has been prostituted in a cinema ? " Abbas conceded that Ben Bella 's regime is not going Communist but warned that " we do seem to be heading toward a fascist dictatorship . " <P> Though Ben Bella remarks acidly that " revolutions are not made without prisons , " Ben Bellism is not fascism . Critic Abbas was blasted as a " bourgeois spokesman for privilege " by government-run newspapers and drummed out of the National Liberation Front , which he once headed . But he was permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereby joining the ranks of Ben Bella 's other muffled but unharmed opponents , such as Mohammed Boudiaf , who is under house arrest , and ex-Premier Benyoussef Benkhedda , who has quit politics to resume his career as a druggist.
