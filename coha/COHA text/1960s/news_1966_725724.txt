txt A House committee tentatively backed today a bill ordering an end to the airline strike after a flurry of unwarranted optimism that labor and management would arbitrate their differences . The House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee took the step by approving language in two sections of a Senate-passed bill that would order striking members of the International Association of Machinists back to work for 30 days on five major airlines . Harley 0 . Staggers , the committee chairman , said he expected the group to finish woik on the bill tomorrow . The remaining sections of the Senate version empower President Johnson to keep the workers on the job fox 150 days more . No Formal Vote Taken Committee members emphasized , however , that today 's vote was only tentative and that the panel might discard the entire Senate bill tomorrow in favor of a substitute . Some also said it might even be possible to alter the two sections already , approved because no formal vote had been taken . George Meany , president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not pass an antistrike law that he said would hasten socialism and " deliver a crippling blow to the whole American labor movement . " Mr. Meany , in a news conference , also said that he hoped President Johnson would veto any , such bill if it was passed . He said that the President would be acting against labor 's interests if ' he signed such a law . Mr. Meany was careful not to criticize President Johnson , who has neither supported nor opposed the legislation . He agreed that Presidential opposition might help defeat the bill in Congress , but said that he thought Mr. Johnson would have spoken out if he backed the bill . Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz has said that he has no doubt the President would sign the Senate antistrike bill if . Congress passes it , But Mr. Meany said that the President could demonstrate . his opposition by Vetoing the bill , and that he hoped Mr. Johnson would do so . House committee sources said that an amendment woUld be introduced tomorrow to provide for seizure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said efforts probably would be made by some mem , bers to substitute a new bill for the Senate version . The House committee . tenta7 Lively approved the section in , the Senate bill ordering the , strikers back to work for 30 ' days after rejecting , by a vote ' of 14 to 11 , a motion to have the President , rather than Con-1 congress , issue the initial back-to- ' work order . Justification for Action The committee also approved , language justifying a back-towork order on the grounds that the- strike " threatens Substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such .. as to.deprive any section ' of . thei country Of essential traffpoAgii , lion - ; " ' t ' ' 31 ' . That language , which is used ' in the Senate bill , was approved after the committee rejected , 14 to 10 , a motion that would have stricken another statement that " emergency " measures were needed to end the strike . The House committee took today 's tentative action in a closed session a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the union and the airlines ? Eastern , National , Northwest , Trans World and United ? had agreed to arbitrate their differences . Negotiators Questioned The confusion arose after Mr. Staggers , a Democrat of West Virginia , asked P. L. Siemiller , the union president , and William J. Curtin , ' the industry 's chief . negotiator , if they would resume operations under an interim contract and submit their differences to arbitration . Mr. Staggers at first appeared to suggest that the parties should adopt the contract terms recommended in June by a Presidential emergency board and return to ' work while the remaining differences were worked out by an arbitration . His suggestion seemed to impty that ? my arbitration finding would be subject to approval by the union membership , which earlier rejected a settlement approved by its leaders . The Congressman said after themeets . g , however , that his , idea was for the parties to agree among themselves to the term , of an interim contract and then to submit remaining differences to binding arbitration . Such a move would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be undertaken , he said . In any event , Mr. Curtin said the ' carriers would agree to arbitration , Mr. Siemiller said he did not have authority , to agree to arbitration , but that he would put the idea to the members for a vote and tell them it would be better than antistrike legislation ... This led to erroneous reports that Mr. Siemiller had agreed to binding arbitration , and these reports apparently produced . dissent from other union leaders . The union president later , sought to clarify his position : in.the hearing by explaining thatAte " would submit any uuresolvesh issues " to the ' members to see if they would agree to arbitration on those points . But he said that " unless there is agreement on most issues , there is little or no prospect of membership ratification of approval . " Undermining Charged Mr. Curtin then issued a statement saying that the union leader had agreed to submit all unresolved issues to binding arbitration and then had " undermined this effort " by declaring he did not believe the members would agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to accept it . " This indicated that the " union does not desire to end this dispute by voluntary arbitration , " he said . Mr. Meany , in his news conference , said the ? F.L.-C.I.O. was in " total opposition " to an antistrike law because " there is no national emergency " and such a law would erode workers ' rights . The carriers can afford a " much more generous " settlement than they are offering because of record profits , he said , and- earnings of the strikers have lagged in past years . " Anyone who believes in the right to strike must accept the proposition that strikes will at some time take place , " Mr. Meany said , reading from testimony that the House committee would not permit him to make . " It is note enough to believe in - the right to strike in every case except the strike that is going on at the time or the strike that inconveniences articulate citizens , " he added .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
