The Church of the Middle Ages consecrated all art to God 's service-a precedent that the Rev. William Bell Glenesk thinks has a lot of validity today . In the manner of an ecclesiastical impresario , he incorporates everything from jazz bands to barefoot modern dancers in his freewheeling , experimental services at the Spencer Memorial Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn Heights . <P> Ruth St. Denis once danced at Spencer 's Sunday morning worship . Metropolitan Opera Basso Jerome Hines came in to sing Negro spirituals . Last week Christmas Eve services featured a modern ballet based on the medieval legend of the Juggler of Notre Dame . Glenesk , who is a good enough dancer himself to work out with Martha Graham 's company , produced the performance , recruiting dancers from Graham , the New York City Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera . He has even donned a leotard himself to prance through the sanctuary in his own choreographed version of Jacob 's ladder ( Genesis 28 : 12 : " And he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " That Big Clown . " Seeking well-known names for his pulpit , Glenesk has lured to Spencer speakers as different as Theologian Paul Tillich and India 's agnostic ex-Defense Minister Krishna Menon . His own arts-conscious sermons are more likely to refer to Edward Albee than to Cain and Abel . <P> " If God works in dramatic ways , then the ministry must , " he says . <P> A handsome , lithe , Canadian-born bachelor of 37 , Pastor Glenesk was educated at the University of Toronto and Columbia , worked as a professional teacher , actor and social worker before his ordination . He was called to Spencer in 1955 . It was then a staid little parish faced with the prospect of expanding or closing shop . Much to the dismay of oldtimers at Spencer-one of them calls him " that big clown clunking around the church in leotards " - Glenesk decided to make a play for the newcomers in Brooklyn Heights , many of them arts-conscious , church-shy refugees from Greenwich Village . Glenesk has lost some veteran members of the congregation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never before bothered with church . <P> Walking or Crawling . Do jazz and modern dance really have anything to do with the worship of God ? Glenesk believes that any creative art is somehow touched with the divine . Moreover , drama at the altar attacks what he regards as the greatest enemy of meaningful worship : habit and routine . " You should not go to church out of habit , " he says . " I am all for the idea of enjoyment . You should go because it is exciting . One week you can come out walking on air , another time crawling on the ground . "
