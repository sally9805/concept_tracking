THE DEATH OF THE ADVERSARY ( 208 pp. ) - Hans Keilson-Orion ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> Since Adolf Hitler , an outpouring of writing has tried to explain the violence that human beings do to one another . Nagging questions persist : Why did so many acquiesce in Hitler 's evil ? Why did so many Jews go quietly to their deaths when they had a good chance of resisting ? Fiction , rather than scholarship , has supplied the shrewder answers . Perhaps the profoundest explanation to date comes from the pen of a Jewish writer driven from Germany in 1936 and now living in Holland . Hans Keilson 's novel subtly and eloquently probes the ambivalent relation of victim with aggressor . <P> Keilson traces the growth of hatred in his leading character as other writers trace love or self-knowledge . When a small child , the nameless hero gets his first inkling that he has an enemy . In hushed voices , his parents discuss a party leader called B. , a thinly disguised Hitler who is rising to power by attacking a minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority , feels the force of his enemy at school when his classmates shun him . His mother 's love is powerless to help , his father is resigned . But a fable he is told gives him insight into his enemy . It tells of Germany 's Kaiser , who was presented with some elks by the Czar of Russia and tried to duplicate their natural habitat . But they all died , because they missed the stimulation of the wolves who had preyed on them . <P> Initial Obsession . Keilson 's hero comes to believe that he , like the elks , must have an adversary for his own good . When he first hears one of B. 's fanatical speeches , he is enthralled by the depth of his hatred : " No lover can talk more possessively of the object of his love than he did of me , even though he was cursing me . Surely , he was obsessed by me . " The hero is convinced that B. needs him as much as he needs B. : " He was as uncertain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger to himself , he has raised up an adversary , me , and has painted my image on the wall , as the old painters painted their icons with sweating hands when their demon took possession of them . " <P> With such sympathy for his adversary , the hero is powerless to act against him . Though accused of cowardice , he refuses to join his fellow victims in resistance . He dreams of eventual reconciliation with his adversary : " Jubilation , all , all , without distinction , friends and enemies . " But when B. seizes power , such illusions are shattered . B. 's hatred turns out to be barren and implacable , his cruelty an end in itself . " Even hatred can not exist without a drop of love , " the hero muses , " or it is no longer hatred but a cold devastation , a heavy mist across the fields that blots out every path : unachieved creation . " Now that the bond of enmity has snapped , he is at last willing to fight .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
