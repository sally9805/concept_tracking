txt The United Automobile Workers Union and the Ford Motor Company agreed ' today on a new contract patterned after last week 's settlement between the union and the Chrysler Corpo- ' ration . The cost was put at about 63 cents an hour . Union and management negotiators announced the " agreement in principle " in a brief statement issued . at 9:05 A.M. at company headquarters in Dearborn . The announcement came 55 minutes before 130,000 , Ford workers were scheduled to +strike . Walter P. Reuther , the union president , emerged from the negotiations 15 minutes later and said that the three-year contract contained the same basic economic benefits as the Chrysler package plus " some very attractive chocolate frost-ing : , Part of the " frosting " is a Christmas bonus plan that could provide bonuses of $25 to 1$100 a month by Christmas , 11965 , Mr. Reuther said . The new contract will give Ford workers an early retirement incentive , improved pension benefits , higher wages , ' longer vacations , improved in , surance coverage and added relief time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president for labor relaContinued tions , appeared later ' and " said that Ford was " very pleasee-to have what he termed . a " realistic settlement . " - Mr : Denise would not estimate the cost of the agreement , but sources indicated that it was around 63 cents an hour .. Chrysler Strike Averted The threat of a damaging strike against Chrysler , was also averted this morning-when the union and .1 that company reached an agreement covering 7,000 office andtechnical workers . They . - had threatened to strike at 10 AN : - and set up picket lines khat . eventually might have shut down the entire company . Mr. Reuther said that ? he would go to the General : Motors Corporation Monday to seek an " A. la mode " contract superior to the Ford agreement . The union represents 350,000 General Motors workers , and bargaining there could result in widespread local . walkouts and possibly a short national strike . Minor Gains at Ford There were ? , a number of minor gains in the Ford agreement , including a ? bonus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . Ford also provided 1 cent an hour to eliminate wage inequities , which Mr. Reuther said could give 26,000 Ford workers as - much as 5 cents an hour extra . The cost of the Chrysler settlement , the largest money package in the union 's history , was estimated at between 53 cents and 57 cents over three years . The cost would be higher at Ford because of a different wage and benefits structure and work force composition . Ford 's average hourly wage and benefit cost in 1963 was $4.11 an hour . Price Relation in Doubt Mr. Denise appeared to be more relieved over the fact that a strike had been avoided than pleased by the size of the settlement . He declined to say whether it was inflationary or would affect car prices for 1965 , to be announced next week . " I have been telling you that this is a big piece , " he said . " We 've gulped it down and we are going to try to digest it . We will do our very best . " Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must spend several days writing contract language and wrapping up loose ends . In addition , local issues have been resolved at 21 of Ford 's 90 bargaining units , and local walkouts could occur unless those issues are settled . The deadline ? for settling them was extended from today until Sept. 25 . There was also a possibility of local strikes at Crhysler , where tour of 106 bargaining units still had issues outstanding beyond the scope of the national contracts . Union leaders said the expected three of these to be resolved by Sunday , but that a strike was possible at the Newark , Del. , assembly plant . That was not expected to disrupt operations elsewhere . Ford workers , as did those at Chrysler , won an early retirement incentive that will providepensions of up to $400 a month at age 60 , an opportunity to retire when age and length of-service total 85 years and an increase in the basic pension benefit from $2.80 a month a year of service to $4.25 a month . There was also an increase of $1.45 a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an added week of vacation , two added holidays , and fully companypaid group life , sickness and accident insurance for active workers and hospital-medical care for retired workers . Ford workers also won an added 12 minutes of daily relief time , as did those at Chrysler , bringing the daily total to 36 minutes . Mr. " Denise - said about 50,000 Ford workers , mostly on the assembly line , would benefit from this . This indicated Ford might add 1 , - 250 more workers to provide me to relieve those entitled to the added time off . The Christmas bonus for Ford workers was granted in place of a union demand that Ford put 5 cents an hour into a stock purchase plan for workers when the company 's supplemental unemployment benefit fund was paid up . In the old contract , the company put 5 cents an hour into the fund to provide money to help pay workers part of their wages during layoffs . The company was able to stop contributing to the fund when it reached a specific limit . Under the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Christmas bonus fund when the supplemental fund is paid up .
