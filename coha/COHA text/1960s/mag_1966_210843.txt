The Federal Government has new , convincing statistical proof that the nation 's public schools are still segregated - and that the result is inequality of educational opportunity for Negro children . The evidence comes from a new Office of Education survey , 18 months in the making , of more than 4,000 elementary and high schools , 60,000 teachers and 645,000 students across the U.S. It shows that 80% of white children in first grade attend schools that are 90% or more white , while 65% of all Negro first-graders attend schools that are nine-tenths Negro . <P> By almost every standard-teacher training , library facilities , lab courses and classroom quality-separation of the races works out to the Negroes ' disadvantage . Nationwide , in primary grades , there are 32 students in the average Negro classroom , 29 in mostly white schools . In secondary schools , Negro pupils are less likely to have a chemistry or physics lab ; judged by nationwide test scores , teachers in Negro schools are educationally less qualified than those in white ones . Standard achievement tests show that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 1.6 grades behind his white counterpart ; by the twelfth grade he is 3.3 years behind . Although the survey admits that the home is a key factor in developing the desire to learn , it suggests that desegregation does help . A Negro who has studied in an integrated situation for most of his school career scores an average of nearly two years higher on achievement tests than one who has not . <P> For Education Commissioner Harold Howe , who has spoken out sharply against de facto segregation in recent months , the survey represents the factual basis for an all-out Government attack on the racial imbalance of the nation 's schools . Within the next few weeks , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare plans to organize a special section to investigate de facto segregation in Northern states . Legislation now before Congress would withdraw federal aid for a year from school districts failing to desegregate , and would provide $50 million in technical assistance to those that are actively correcting racial imbalance .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
