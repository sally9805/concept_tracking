Bridge to the Sun ( MGM ) is a woman 's picture that sets out to celebrate the glories of interracial marriage but merely manages to prove that it can be as dull as the other kind . Cut and dried from Gwen Terasaki 's bestselling autobiography , Bridge tells the story of a sweet young thing from back-country Tennessee ( Carroll Baker ) who in the middle ' 30s meets and marries a handsome young first secretary ( James Shigeta ) in the Japanese embassy in Washington . When the groom takes the bride back home to meet the folks , she makes all the predictable mistakes : wears her shoes in the house , interrupts when a man is talking , steps into a car before her husband , squeals when a male friend of the family attempts to share her bath . Back in Washington again , her husband works hard to avert war , and when it comes he orders his wife to stay in the U.S. with their daughter . She gravely refuses , and the rest of the picture describes what life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from back-country Tennessee . It was n't exactly chrysanthemums all the way , but somehow what the spectator notices most is the kimonotony.
