In East Germany , terror began to take a grim new form . Thousands of citizens were being hauled before Schnellverfahren ( literally , rapid proceedings , i.e. , kangaroo courts ) for sentencing to the dozens of new " work rehabilitation camps " springing up across the land . To qualify , the victims needed only to be " work shy " or reluctant to volunteer for the army , or merely generally " injurious to the public welfare . " Two workers at a carbide plant in Buna were beaten for failing to enlist for military service , then were hauled before a judge , who noted happily that " they got the fist of the workers ' class for their cowardly statements . " In Leipzig , two members of a jazz club drew 13 and 15-year terms because , as the court put it , they were " stimulated by broadcasts of Radio Luxembourg which transmits mostly music into setting fire to the stable of a collective farm .

The idea is to move them to a safe distance from the sealed frontier in Berlin or other areas bordering the West . Some were actually caught in the act of fleeing ; others are merely suspected of planning to flee , or " spreading unrest . " For all , the penalty is swift deportation to the new camps in the interior , where " work rehabilitation " means sweating in a quarry or a mine from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m . <P> The camps could never hold the millions of East Germans who would escape if they could . To deal with this restive mass , Communism 's wall at Berlin grew ever higher , ever thicker . Bands of Volkspolizei ( people 's police ) strung more strands of barbed wire atop the concrete blocks to stop the desperate dozens of East Berliners who were still leaping over the parapet to freedom ; but to the dismay of officials , four Vopos on a fence-mending detail themselves threw down their tools and took the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers laid heavy new barriers to frustrate daredevil drivers who had discovered a new way to escape . Most talented of these was the 23-year-old worker who last week packed his wife into the front seat of a five-ton dump truck , got up speed along darkened side streets paralleling the frontier , then roared out at 40 m.p.h. to plow through the wall , scattering Vopos and broken concrete in all directions .
