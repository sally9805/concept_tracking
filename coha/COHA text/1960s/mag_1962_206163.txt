Paul ( " Tony " ) Hinkle is a man of frightening versatility . In addition to being athletic director at Indiana 's Butler University ( undergraduate enrollment : 1,900 ) , Hinkle is an author , TV commentator , lecturer and Indianapolis civic leader . A trim 63 , he manages Butler 's baseball team ; to make sure the playing field is in top shape , he plows , seeds and rakes it himself . In the fall he coaches football , and his teams have lost only one game in the past three years . But for Hinkle , these activities are merely sidelines . In the winter he knuckles down to his main job : coaching Butler 's basketball team-year after year , one of the best small-college squads in the U.S. <P> There is nothing small time about Butler basketball . More than 7,300 fanatic Hoosiers fight their way into the Butler gym for each home game , anxious to see the local heroes ambush visitors from the Big Ten and Missouri Valley Conference . They are rarely disappointed . In Tony Hinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one national college championship , gone to the National Invitation Tournament twice , won 447 games against 286 losses . " There is nothing I fear more than going to Indianapolis to play Hinkle . " says Notre Dame Coach John Jordan , whose tough Irish squad took an 83-67 drubbing at South Bend earlier this month . Last week Hinkle 's Bulldogs were riding an eight-game winning streak , have happily whipped such highly rated foes as Bradley ( 80-77 ) , Michigan ( 69-61 ) and Princeton ( 63-58 ) . <P> <P> Refugee from the Biddies . Coach Hinkle freely attributes some of his team 's success to the fact that big-time opponents are inclined to take little Butler too lightly . " We 're easy to underrate , " says Hinkle . " They take one look at the program , and they see that we do n't have a man over 6 ft. 6 in . Why , our starting team only averages 6 ft. 1 in . " Easiest of the Bulldogs to underestimate is Negro Guard Gerry Williams , who stands only 5 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a refugee from Biddy Basketball . But Williams ' scrawny legs are like steel springs . He can high-jump 6 ft. 6 in. , enjoys nothing more than snatching a rebound out of the grasp of a startled enemy giant . <P> A home-town boy , Williams starred in basketball and track at Indianapolis ' Shortridge High School , but was ignored by the big-college coaches who control athletic scholarships . At Butler Williams was an instant success , last year he was the team 's leading scorer , set a sophomore record by netting 430 points . Bothered by a bruised heel most of this season , he still has averaged 15 points a game . At his best under pressure , he scored 30 against powerful Bradley , 26 against Notre Dame . <P>
