txt Washington , Aug. 19 ? The Republican party 's No. 1 House tax bill writer said tonight the tax bill he just helped Kennedy administration forces write should be defeated . Rep. John Byrnes IWis.1 , the ranking G. O. P. member of the ways and means committee , said that as long as the Kennedy administration is unwilling to reduce government spending , it would be " extremely foolhardy " to cut taxes . " I expect to vote that way and to make a speech suggesting that other Republicans join me , " Byrnes told reporters . " I think many of them will . " Reduction for Everybody The ways and means committee began hearings in midFebruary on President Kennedy 's proposal that everybody be given an income tax reduction . It finally completed the writing last week of the biggest tax reduction bill in history with savings to taxpayers of 10.6 billion dollars . But at the President 's suggestion , and on its own hook , it rewrote some major sections of the tax law to recover thru tax adjustments about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cost the treasury . The President suggested the changes to simplify the job of making out a tax return , Byrnes said . But the committee made changes that took a step backwards , making the tax reporting job even more complex , he said . Emphasis on Spending As one of its final steps Byrnes said , the Democraticcontroled committee added a 1 billion dollar a year subsidy to big business by rewriting an investment credit tax provision first adopted last year . The President wanted a tax bill to create more jobs , Byrnes Said " For its stimulating effect , the bill reties most heavily on increasing consumer spending rather than on encouraging increased investment , " he said .
