Rare is the reporter who does not dream of some day writing a novel . Novelist Truman Capote , on the other hand , yearns to report . For a long time he wanted to raise reporting to an art by re-creating some event with a novelist 's insight , sympathy and exactitude . The trouble was , he could not find the right topic . Then one day in 1959 , he was leafing through the New York Times when he noticed a headline , EISENHOWER APPOINTEE SLAIN . He read the story of the senseless killing of Wheat Farmer Herbert Clutter and his family , and he suddenly realized that he had his theme . Why not do a crime from beginning to end ? " A crime would not date , and it would provide an enormous range of characters . " <P> Hardly was the Clutter family funeral over when Capote arrived in Holcomb , Kans. , scene of the crime . He stayed for six months and immersed himself in the life of the community . With his light , lisping voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flat corner of the Middle West , but he made friends easily . " He was just as quick as any man afoot , " says Mrs. Myrtle Clare , a onetime postmistress , who figures briefly in his story . " Just like a flash of lightning , he was here , there , everywhere . " The result of all Capote 's footwork is a report , " In Cold Blood , " now being serialized by The New Yorker . In January , it will be published in book form by Random House . Either way , it fulfills the novelist 's ambition : it turns a routine police-beat job into a stunning study of the criminal mind . <P> Tale of Two Worlds . The work is all the more successful because it is the most suspect kind of journalism : almost a steady stream of dialogue re-created largely after the event . In this instance , the dialogue rings true . All the conversations , Capote insists , were either taken from legal transcripts or from exhaustive interviews of his own . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead , he depended upon his ability to recall interviews lasting two or three hours . He interviewed people again and again , entering the death house more than 200 times to talk to the killers . Eventually , he saw them hanged . <P> In his reporting , Capote contrasts the stolid , generally sunny life of the murdered farm family with the eerie twilight world of the two killers . He limns the small-town Midwest of homemade pies , 4-H meetings and simple pieties . By dramatically re-creating the Clutter family-Father Herbert , who served on the federal Farm Credit Board under Ike ; his diffident , withdrawn wife Bonnie ; their sturdy teen-age son Kenyon ; their engaging teen-age daughter Nancy , the " town darling " - Capote makes clear why a neighbor exclaimed after the murder : " That family represented everything people hereabouts really value and respect , and that such a thing could happen to them-well , it 's like being told there is no God . It makes life seem pointless . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
