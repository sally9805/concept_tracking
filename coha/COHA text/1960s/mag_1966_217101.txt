The French all but invented the modern police force , under the guiding genius of Joseph Fouch , who served the nation 's regimes from the Revolution to the Restoration . He finally retired in 1816 , and no French leader since then has been able to disentangle the mysterious , proliferating **25;4479;TOOLONG of French security agencies . Today France has no fewer than a dozen , ranging from the trench-coated men from S.D.E.C.E. ( Service de Documentation Extrieure et Contre-Espionnage ) to the blue-frocked flics .

He had no sooner alighted from his taxi on the Boulevard St. Germain than he was met by an S.D.E.C.E. agent and two French policemen acting for the Moroccans .
