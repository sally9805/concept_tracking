In 35 of the United States , a boy 's 16th birthday is a mighty milestone : he becomes eligible for a driver 's license . But for the boy of the future , age 16 may be a quadruple milestone-as it was last week for Gregory Potter , who celebrated his birthday by qualifying to drive not only cars , but also single-engined planes , twin-engined planes and helicopters . <P> A slight and bespectacled young man , Gregory arrived at Seattle 's Boeing Field Airport last Sunday with his car license already in hand . The FAA inspectors had obligingly arranged to give him his three airborne tests in close succession as part of Boeing Field 's weekly air show . <P> First came the single-engined-plane test ; aloft for little more than ten minutes , Gregory brought the red and white Cessna-150 to a perfect , gentle stop , shook hands with a newspaperman ( " That boy 's palm was barely moist , " he reported to the crowd ) , and bounded on to the twin-engined-plane test . The red , white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a landing the pilot 's mother called " soft as a marshmallow , " and was welcomed to earth by a drum-and-bugle corps that sounded a fast fanfare . Gregory fidgeted ; a bystander , he said , had fiddled with the plane 's gasoline tank cap , but " there was nothing to worry about , I probably only lost two or three gallons . " <P> Onward he went , this time to wheel a helicopter up and out of view , and back again . A helicopter is a perverse and difficult craft ; a pilot has to use both hands and feet , and even the pros consider them miserable things to handle . " This fellow did a masterly job , " said FAA Supervisor Joe Princen . Said Gregory : " I am probably supposed to have been nervous , but I was n't . " <P> <P> Gregory 's father runs an airplane taxi company , and his mother is an accomplished pilot , as is an older brother . Even his twelve-year-old brother David can fly the family Aztecs , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gregory 's window overlooks the Potter family helipad , and he is now empowered to take out the family chopper any time . This puts him one up on his father , who has not got around to taking that test yet .
