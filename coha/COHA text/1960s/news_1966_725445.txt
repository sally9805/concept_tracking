txt The Federal Aviation Agency 's " fact book " about Government-owned Dulles International Airport promises visitors a 250-room hotel and two office buildings near the soaring glass-walled terminal . But the sites are still vacant . Inside the echoing terminal itself , the men 's apparel shop and the duty-free liquor store have folded . Other concessionaires are being allowed to pay less than the minimum rent . Four local-service airlines whose dates for starting Dulles operations were " to be announced , " according to the June 1963 fact book , still have n't shown up . Clearly , the Washington area 's " airport of tomorrow " is finding that tomorrow is a long time in arriving , certainly longer than the Government evpected . When Dulles opened in November 1962 the FAA predicted it would be handling 2.600,000 passengers annually by 1965- Instead , fewer than 1.000.000 used Dulles last year . and the FAA estimates the airport is operating at only about 20 ' , ; of present capacity . The agency insists that aviation grouth and technological advances such as the supersonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulles by the mid-1970s . " Dulles benefited from the lesson of aviation history that airports usually require rebuilding five years aftei- completiorl , " asserts one FAA official . man who was FAA airport was opened expresses a contrary view . " Hindsight may indicate that Dulles was opened too soon and too far from the city center . " concedes Najeeb E. Halaby. now a senior vice president of Pan American World Airways . The troubles besetting the 10.000-acre airport 27 miles west of the capital 's center likely will be compounded when , starting April 21. -. mall and medium-size jet planes will be allowed to operate regularly at the only other Government-owned civil field . Washington National Airport . along the Potomac only four miles south of the city . The FAA long resisted pressure from carriers and communities to open 670-acre National Airport to jets . " Every pound ( of cargo ) and every passenger that lands at Washington National in a jet is a passenger and a pound that does not land at Dulles International , " Mr. Halaby , then FAA administrator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broyhill , a hose Virginia Congressional district includes part of Dulles as well as National . wishes jets would remain banned from National for two more years ; he sa ' . s one reason for building Dulles was the " dangerous congestionat National , which handled neatly 7 million passengers last year . He has support in the Maryland Congressional delegation , whore members see any curbs at National as a benefit to Baltimore 's city-owned Friendship International Airport , 32 miles north of Washington . While most Congressmen , frequent airline users , would be loath to see National 's convemenee restricted , some on Capitol Hill believe Dulles 's financial plight might at least bring on a formal inquiry into the big airport 's future . Dulles 's net book loss , counting interest and depreciation , is running at a rate of $7 3 million a year . The FAA , which initially assured Congress that the airport would repay its assigned capital cots over 30 years , now figures the pay-back at 35 years , and a former FAA official who played a leading role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might take 95 years . Cab Fare : $13 The biggest handicap for Dulles is its remote location . The 90-minute ride to Washington . much of it through beautiful rolling countryside , compares favorably with the time required to reach the city from such urban airports as Chicago 's O'Hare International and New York 's Kennedy International . What those airports do n't face , however , is a major competitor like National only 15 minutes from downtown . Also , the limousine ride from Dulles costa $2.50. versus $1.35 from National . and the cab fare is a stiff $13 . " Naturally the businessman with an appointment at a Government office prefers being routed to National , " says the vice president in charge of airport planning for a major trunk line . " We 're in the business of selling time savings , " says Edwin L. Colodny . Allegheny Airlines senior vice president for legal affairs and economic research . Allegheny , which serves National but not Dulles , carries its average passenger only 198 miles . Mr. Colodny says . " and if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Washington we 've lost him 50% of his time savings . " The trunk lines have agreed informally with the FAA to maintain 89 of the present 103 daily arrivals and departures at Dulles after National opens to jets ( Braniff International Airways intends to transfer from Dulles its 14 daily arrivals and departures of twin-jet BAC111s ) . What 's uncertain , however , is how many Dulles passengers might be lured to National by the shorter flying times there . A jet flight from National Airport to Chicago , say , could connect with a nonstop flight on to Los Angeles , competing directly with present Los Angeles flights from Dulles . Also , jets at National will mean more seats and improved schedules . Delta Air Lines , for one , now serves National with three daily DC7 flights totaling 231 seats . After April 24 it will replace two of these propeller flights with three DC-9 jets , making four flights and 272 seats . The anticipated addition of one or more " stretched " DC9s carrying up to 90 passengers could improve Delta 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations that have yet to prove their value  --  its own 14 ? ; . - mile limited-access highway to help link it with the city , and 21 mobile lounges to carry passengers between terminal and aircraft parked as much as a mile away . The approach ramps to the $19 3 million four-lane highway deliberately prevent westbound motorists from getting off except at the airport and prevent Washington-bound drivers from getting on anyplace but there . The intention is to avoid congestion  --  but so far there 's been little danger of that . The mobile lounges , 90-passenger buses built by Chrysler Corp. , cost a total of $6.5 million including development expenses . They represent a radical departure from conventional airport traffic-flow techniques : significantly , no other American airport uses them or intends to . " An unproved experiment . " is how Joseph A. Foster . Houston 's director of aviation . describes them . Houston investigated the Dulles design " in great depth " before settling on its onn $15o million design for Houston International Airport due to open in June 1967 " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Government " The purpose of the mobile lounge is to reduce u alking distance for passengers . But the 21 lounges at Dulles require a driversupervisor force of 11 men . And the terminal was built big enough to house gates for 24 lounges ; le.s than half that many are heeded to accommodate current traffic . A less costly alternative would have been to construct a terminal to which loading " fingers " could be added as needed . Houston 's technique for shortening walking distances will be to set its terminal buildings and parking lots in a row between two loading apron , with access provided by a vehicular tunnel .
