THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WHEN scientists disagree over an issue , maintaining that it is not susceptible to scientific analysis , it leaves us feeling curiously free . The other week , we read in the Tinies that at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science a Nobel laureate in physics had urged the government to lay out thirty-eight billion dollars for the construction of a national network of tunnels , which would both accommodate the needs of urban traffic in peacetime and serve as gigantic fallout shelters in time of nuclear war . The physicist , who had recently taken part in a federally sponsored study of civil defense , appeared to be in excellent numerical command of his position . It was estimated that the subterranean grid would save the lives of seventy-five million people in the event of attack ; that because of the subways and all the underground cables and pipes the projected tunnels in New York would have to be dug at a depth of a hundred and ten feet , or nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the Manhattan area hounded by Second and Tenth Avenues and Thirteenth and Sixty-third Streets two million people would be able to find shelter in the tunnels , which would be interconnected , permitting " families to become reunited underground . " But when the eminent scientist sat down other eminent scientists , including another Nohel laureate in physics , rose to dispute him . A big shelter program , Nobel Laureate No. 2 argued , might cause the Russians to devise weapons capable of killing Americans underground , and any such development might upset the level of deterrence lately attained by the Soviet Union and the United States . Tunnels or no tunnels , another physicist said , our dependence on electricity would continue , and who could doubt that a nuclear attack would make the hardships of the recent blackout seem like the good old days ? And what about the birds , a botanist wanted to know . He pointed out that they are peculiarly sensitive to fallout , and that their decimation would enable insects to multiply at " catastrophic rates ; " thus , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day of locusts , figurativelv speaking , had laid waste crops and food reserves . As far as we could make out , the two opposing camps were united on only a single point . It was an important point , though . " The one thing all agreed upon was the immense array of imponderables involved in the discussion , " the Times account read . In other words , we gathered , the boys were just thoughtfully , conscientiously yakking . It appeared that their assertions were the findings not of the laboratory  --  of the scientific method  --  but of their non-professional instincts . By that standard , it occurred to us , we ourself qualified for attendance at the scientific meeting , for non-professional instincts are something we possess in abundance . We experienced a sense of release at the thought , and fell to imagining how we would have conducted ourself among the scientists . We decided that our instincts would have inclined us toward the camp of Nobel Laureate No. 2 , but that we would have argued more instinctively than he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational-sounding points as levels of deterrence , the dependence on electricity , and the vulnerability of birds . We would have got up at that meeting ( we imagined ) and told our fellow-scientists that we simply wanted no part of convertible tunnels . When a man drives off to the office , we would have said , he ought n't to have to wonder , travelling his uncongested underground route , whether the blinker ahead is signalling that an has the right of way . Even as cold is the absence of heat , we heard ourself declaim , so is peace the absence of war , and those tunnels- , learned colleagues , would lump war and peace , draining the character out of each , unifying them into a synthetic zero . Those deep repositories , gentlemen , would beg the question of our cleverness , answering nothing , advancing nothing . They would teach us that war and peace were ordinary , acceptable events , like the seasons , and that their alternation attested merely that there was nothing new under the sun  --  not even our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lottery , its lucky survivors a shattered breed living to dig a tunnel another day . Inmates of Charenton EIGHT times each week , a group of perfectly pleasant , reasonably well-adjusted British actors climb five twisting flights of stairs in the Martin Beck Theatre , settle down at a long , brightly lit makeup table , and transform themselves into a hideous hunch of pathetic , wretched-looking lunatics of the very early nineteenth century . The actors  --  members of the Royal Shakespeare Company playing in " The Persecution and Assassination of Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade " ? wear a variety of ghastly , drab garments that , when seen against the barren stage set , with its benches , showers , drains , water pipes , and bleak brick walls , help to make the play one of the most exciting , and oddly beautiful , spectacles ever put on view in a Broadway theatre . " We have found one or two hooks with pictures of Charenton , " a quiet and thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Shakespeare Company , told us when we visited the makeup table just before last Wednesday 's matinie . " They used to shave the heads for cleanliness , I think , more than anything else . There are a lot of pictures by Goya of lunatics , ton , and we 've looked at a lot of contemporary photographs of asylums . " " Hello , Alan , " said a pretty , cheerful girl , walking into the dressing room in a patient 's sombre gown and sitting down in front of a mirror . " Hello , dear , " Mr. Boyle said . Half a dozen actors were quietly putting on their makeup at the long table , on which were wigs in brown boxes , jars of creams , bottles of spirit gum , hair sprays , paintbrushes , Max Factor Pan Stiks , tubes of Savlon Barrier Cream , a can of Glamour Nail Dry , and  --  at the far end  --  two bright-blue Rayette hair dryers . " I heard the new Bob Dylan record last night , " said an actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Beatle album . " The cheerful girl now appeared to have the top of her head shaved in front and coarse hair sprouting in wild disarray in back . Mr. Boyle told us that most of the wigs were bald wigs  --  flesh-colored plastic caps , which it over the actors ' hair , and to which hair is attached as desired . A bald wig was being created on a skull-shaped Fiberglas wig block near where we were standing . The block , Mr. Boyle explained , was being sprayed from time to time with a plastic solution , which was gradually building up to the proper thickness . " It takes thirty-six hours to dry completely , " he told us . " Then the wig is peeled off the block and reversed , and put back . We make small holes and insert the hair  --  you buy it in London from a hair merchant  --  and knot it underneath . Sit over here , love , " he said as another actress entered . She was wearing a sort of straitjacket . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyle went on . " All the directors want to have at least one in their show . With the old bald wigs , which were made of rubber , you could n't lose the join " ? he pointed to the hack of an actor 's head , where the edge of the cap was supposed to blend with the actor 's flesh ? " without a great deal of building up with mortician 's wax . The edges of these new plastic caps can he blended with acetone , which melts the plastic away a bit , thinning the edge . " He sat down and put on a bald wig that had a repulsive growth of hair hanging down the sides and back . " Alan ! " shrieked one of the actresses , glancing over at him . ( She herself was now bald except for a few random strands . ) Mr. Boyle smiled , and glued the edge of the cap to his checks . " The plastic re-forms later , " he explained as he wiped the glued edge with cotton dipped in acetone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how satisfactorily the join disappeared . " They 're quite comfortable , ton , " he said . " Nobody complains about pressure . " A pinheaded bald girl a few seats away said , " I do find that after eight performances I get a hit pink . " As curtain time approached , the actors  --  grave and self-contained  --  left , one by one , to go down to the stage . V ten the last one had departed , Mr. Boyle , who had taken off his bald wig , said quietly , " I used to be afraid of them , at the beginning . Sometimes they start reacting to their characters before they get on the stage . You try to think of them as people you know , but as they gradually become the characters , you find yourself saying ' There , there ' while you fix their wigs . It used to take the actors some time to get out of their characters after they came off , but they 're able to control it more now . " As Mr. Boyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us that when the play was in preparation , each actor  --  with the help of the director , Peter Brook  --  had selected the particular mental illness he felt he could best represent . " There was a clash , " Mr. Boyle added . " Two of them wanted delusions of grandeur . But they worked it out . " Backstage , the actors , in their asylum garments , were padding slowly and silently about in the eerie half-light , locks of hair dangling from their appar-ently shaved skulls . Mr. Boyle , who was wearing a sports coat and slacks , lunatic to for almost fifty years , could be demolished and replaced by a new junior high school . N'Irt went out to Purchase one bitterly cold early morning last week to take a look at the twenty-one ponies there and at their new rural quarters , at the Blind Brook Polo Club , and to meet Herb Pennell , a five-goal ( outdoor ) , eight-goal ( indoor ) player who is currently watching over them . A raw wind was jostling the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , low row of almost a hundred stalls , with flaking white paint  --  looked forlorn ; the stall doors , bright green , were all shut , and two cats ( a brindle and a gray-and-white ) were crawling in and out wherever they could find a broken board . Light snow had fallen during the night and had stuck to the ground in many places . The grandstand and clubhouse , with a cupola and two bare flagpoles , sat nearby , white and cheerful and empty . Beyond was the vast , flat polo field  --  its grass a tawny olive  --  stretching away to woods , perhaps a mile distant . On the other side of the field , a couple of hundred yards off , was a judges ' stand , with another bare flagpole . A cream-colored car drove up , and its occupant , Herb Pennell  --  a lean , taciturn man with graying hair who was wearing a cowboy hat , a red windbreaker , a white sweater , white pants , and loafers  --  waved us over and invited us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polo season here at Blind Brook runs from June 1st to mid-October , " he said . " The ponies would n't normally come up until April . They 'd he in the Armory now , being worked for half an hum-every day by the grooms . We 're gradually toning them down now . We feed them a little differently ; on a good day like this , we turn them out on their own . kVe 're letting their hair grow hack , so they wo n't get cold . I 've ?

" Ponies THE ponies that always used to pass the winter in the Squadron A Armory , on East Ninety-fourth Street , playing polo three times a week , were all extracted recently and sent into exile  --  twenty-one of them to Purchase , eighteen to Huntington , ten to Virginia , four to New Jersey , and two to Boston  --  so that the old Armory building , where polo had been played been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With Mr. Pennell , we got out of the car , walked to the stable , and entered a plastic-roofed , tar-paper-sided corridor that ran along the front of about twenty stalls . " A couple of days when I was putting this up , and the wind was blowing , I was ready to throw in the sponge , " he said . Inside the corridor it was comparatively warm , richly smelly , and very cheerful . Half a dozen ponies were sticking their heads out over the half doors and looking up and down the corridor . " Hello , there , Buddy ! " Pennell said to a bay with a thick coat , and then he turned back to us . " This one I just got from Oklahoma . She was in the Armory , but she 'd never played , so she had n't been clipped . " He moved to the next stall . " ' These horses all belong to George Skakel or to me . Pepsi , here , was caught as a wild bangtail in the Utah basin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck . " He jumps a little , he plays a little polo . A real pet . Kids in the neighborhood ride him . We used him for refereeing in the Armory . " He moved on . " Polo players are queer , " he said . " A different breed . I would n't go across the street to watch a horse show . And racers would n't care for polo , probably . " Standing with his hands in his hip pockets and looking down the row of stalls , he went on , " A good horse is sixty to sixty-five per cent of the game . They 're worse than kids , though . They get sick , and you have to look after them . When you 're galloping down the field at thirty miles an hour , a good horse gives you more time to think . Disposition is the whole damn thing in a polo pony You want a good disposition . A polo pony should be bold and fast and handy , and have a good mouth . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some imaginary reins . " When you just touch the lines , " he said , pulling hack lightly on the invisible reins , " they stop . " Mr. Pennell opened the top half of a closed door , and a buckskin pony stuck its head out . " I know you bite , " he said amiably , moving back . " That 's why I closed the door . " We asked whether the ponies missed their regular polo games . Mr. Pennell shook his head . " They get a little grouchy , " he said . " But as long as they get their groceries every day , I guess they 're just as happy vacationing . " Did he miss polo ? " I keep busy , " he said , after a moment . Then he added , " I 'd rather he playing . I 'm sick of hanging around . " Leading us past a room that held a large bin overflowing with feed , Pennell entered the tackroom . " I like to fool around cleaning the tack , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ; the opposite wall was slung with bridles . On the far wall were perhaps thirty polo mallets . Pennell took down a couple of brown-handled ones . " These are older than you and me put together , " he said . " They were used by a ten-goal player up in Myopia years ago . " He put the mallets hack and moved to the bridles . " This is a double bridle , " he said . " These are gags . This is a D-ring , This is a full-ring . Here 's a steel Pelham . Here 's a rubber Pelham . If you get a pony that does n't stop too well on one , yea try another . You just keep trying . " He picked up a ball the size of a grapefruit . " Here 's the indoor ball . It 's made like a volleyball . They have a tube in them , and they 're inflated . " He took a couple of gleaming white balls , baseball size , from a box in one corner . " Outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is bamboo . " Both were very light , and were labelled " Gray 's . Made in England . " He put them hack and picked up another ball , this one wrapped in tissue paper , like an orange . " Made in Pakistan , " we read when he unwrapped it . He turned it in his hand for a moment , then put it back . Pennell walked out of the tackroom and went into one of the stalls . " Want to go out ? " he said to the pony inside it  --  a gray . He opened the door on the far side of the stall and led the gray out into the field . The pony whinnied and ran off . Mr. Pennell let three more ponies out , and then stood watching them as they pranced and jumped around on the snow-covered ground . " Go ahead ! " he yelled to a hay . " You gon na roll ? Go ahead !

" We start practicing around the middle of May , " he said , standing very straight in the icy wind , his hands in his hip pockets again , and his cowboy hat tipped forward . He watched the ponies running over the frozen earth . " As soon as the weather breaks , " he said . ?

Miss Moore in Manhattan IN 1929 , Marianne Moore moved from Manhattan , with her mother , to the fifth floor of a six-story yellow brick building on Cumberland Street , between Lafayette and De Kalb , in Brooklyn , and she stayed there , writing a good deal of the most highly regarded American poetry of the period , for thirty-six years . A few weeks ago , shortly after her seventy-eighth birthday , Miss Moore returned to Manhattan , moving into a five-room apartment on the seventh floor of a ten-story red brick building on West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as she was settled in , and one day last week we did . Miss Moore offered to take us on a tour of her new apartment . It turned out that she had only half completed the settling-in process , and we had to weave our way around smallish . mounds of stacked furniture and cartons , garnished with picture frames , hammers and pliers , cords and wires , mirrors , hooks , parcels , and shopping bags . Along the way , Miss Moore pointed out this and that special feature  --  window padlocks , which an older brother had insisted upon ; glass-enclosed bookshelves , containing the Wessex edition of the works of Thomas Hardy ; impeccably ordered filing cabinets ; and clusters of hoarded miscellany chiding herself all the while for " talking like an agent .

" continued , pointing at a closed gift box . " I do n't recommend it . " We sneezed . " Shall I close the window ? " she asked . " One thing about this place . Everything works . " We shook our head , but Miss Moore jumped up anyway and happily closed it . As she returned to our clearing , looking ageless in a blue wool suit and a patterned blue blouse , her long white hair braided and fixed on top of her head with ribbon and tortoiseshell pins , we ventured to say that Brooklyn had indeed run downhill since the twenties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quickly . " Still like it . 1 like the people . But it was n't safe . Cumberland used to be quite an elegant street , you know . There was green grass in the yards . Clinton Hill was perfectly beautiful .

But soon even the bronze eagle in the park was stolen . And , you know , I 'm almost sure I recognized it some time later in someone 's front yard . Things began to hap pen that were rather alarming . Nearly everyone was robbed . Buy a large television set , a radio , an electric iron , some handsome furniture  --  robbed !

" We assured Miss Moore that we had , and asked her opinion of the source of all this crime . " It 's the parents , " she said , without an instant 's hesitation . " They do n't care . Why , I never heard of a baby-sitter in Brooklyn . Listen to the radio : Four children alone in apartment burn in fire . ' Alone . And then we 'd find a woman drunk in our halls .

" Oh , I like those girls , " she assured us hastily . " I met nine women murderers there . Splendid girls . I went down to speak to them .
