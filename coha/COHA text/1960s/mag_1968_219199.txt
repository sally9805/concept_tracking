CURT PRENDERGAST , TIME 'S Paris bureau chief for the past eight years , has been a professional De Gaulle watcher for even longer . He has been covering the general 's troubles and triumphs ever since 1953-and from Algeria to **25;5937;TOOLONG , the job was never tougher than it was last week . <P> For days on end , TIME 'S office was manned round the clock . As Paris shut down and communications came to a halt , press packets had to be driven to Brussels , four hours away , for relay to New York . But when gasoline reserves dwindled , even that link with the outside world became tenuous . Office supplies began to run short , and just getting to work became something of an adventure . The red-rimmed eyes of the reporters filing for this week 's cover story suggested sleepless nights , long hours spent crisscrossing a barricaded city , and the irritating effects of tear gas .

London Correspondent Keith Johnson made it to Paris as fast as he could-via Brussels and a poky rented Volkswagen . He began his new beat with a ten-mile hike with worker demonstrators .

" I always said Paris was a great city to walk in , " said Johnson , " but this is ridiculous . " <P> Judson Gooding , an old Paris hand , left his San Francisco bureau post on three hours ' notice . Getting to Paris , he recalls , was the smoothest part of the assignment . Airline schedules were so fouled up and so many potential travelers had given up in disgust that he found himself the only passenger on an Air France 707 to London . After catching a rare flight to Le Bourget airport , his luck held and he managed to get the last Hertz car available . Then , like his colleagues fanning out from Paris to Lyon to Marseille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear gas and to learn that a press brassard on a coat sleeve would be an open invitation to a mauling from the police . <P> With Prendergast coordinating their efforts in all the confusion , the reporters boosted their normal output of 50,000 words a day to 100,000 . By week 's end , Cover Writers Dave Tinnin and Howard Muson and Editor Jason McManus were working from thorough and voluminous files .
