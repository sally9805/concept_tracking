txt Now the British people know what is demanded of them . They have to accept a reduced standard of living . And not only for their own country 's sake , either . Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins opened the traditional red dispatch box in the House of Commons Tuesday afternoon to bring out what must in most respects be Britain 's toughest peacetime budget . He made high taxes higher . He gave notice of new laws to restrain the rise of the British People 's incomes . He did so against the background of steeply rising prices . The main tax changes are aimed at taking ? 900 million ( $2.6 billion ) out of spending power , Instead of an increase of 1 percent in consumption there will be a fall of 1 percent this year . Motorists are most heavily hit . Annual car licences are increased from ? 17 10s. to ? 25 , and petrol tax is increased by 4d. a gallon to total just on 4s. a gallon . Luxury taxes increased Purchase taxes on furniture , nousenoia utensils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other items are increased . A new 50 percent tax is put on luxuries like furs , jewelry ; and cameras . Taxes on gambling , wines , spirits , and tobacco are raised . For service industries ( like hotels ) the selective-employment tax on payrolls is put up 50 percent . A ceiling of 3.5 percent is put on increased earnings this year and powers assumed to freeze particular wage settlements for up to 12 months . New incentives are given to small savers . But company dividends are also to be restricted to 3.5 percent increases . But there is to be a special tax on the investment income of well-to-do people getting more than ? 3,000 a year . Mr. Jenkins 's aims , like the necessities of the time , were manifold : to halt the spending spree , to cut imports , to reduce inflation , and to make Britain competitive . But above all his aims are to restore world confidence in Britain , its government , its people , and its money . Currencies closer But there is of necessity an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound sterling as the first line of defense of the American dollar . From now on , with the role of gold reduced , the dollar and the pound sterling certainly stand or fall together . And to put it bluntly , there is no strong expectation here that the United States administration in an election year and with the war in Vietnam will be able to bring the full force of its own financial resolution into play until later in the year . This budget , indeed , has as many implications as a porcupine has quills . Besides all this it is rated here as providing the government led by Harold Wilson with its last chance  --  and Roy Jenkins with his first . Responsibility shifts Mr. Wilson 's second in command , George Brown , has resigned . In doing so he has probably written finis to his own career as a political leader . At the same time , some political observers think , he has nudged open the door that leads from No. 11 Downing Street , where Mr. Jenkins now resides , to No. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his government until Tuesday . In a titular sense he still has . But in the public 's eye it is , at least for the present , Mr. Jenkins who has taken over responsibility . It is no longer necessarily true therefore that a budget which is successful in restoring confidence and in rescuing the government also will rescue Mr. Wilson . Britain 's short-term international debts now exceed $2 billion . Its longer-term monetary debts in the form of overseas holdings of sterling bring its total current debt to more than $10 billion . It is literally vital to the British economy , and important to the general economy of the Western world as a whole , that holders of sterling have confidence that Great Britain will operate within its income , reinvigorate its economy , and repay its debts when repayment is required . In the process of adjustment a great deal is asked of all elements of British society . But most , of course , is asked of those whose incomes are lowest . Yes , it 's a tough budget . And it has tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
