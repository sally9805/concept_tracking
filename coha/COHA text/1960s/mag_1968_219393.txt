At 60 , Nelson Rockefeller has served as New York 's Governor for ten years , unsuccessfully sought his party 's presidential nomination three times and , in past weeks , been passed over for two top posts in the Nixon Cabinet . To some , it seemed , his last hurrah had sounded . Last week Rockefeller put a halt to any premature postmortems by announcing that he intends to run for re-election in 1970 . If he succeeds , he will be only the second Governor in New York history to serve uninterruptedly for more than twelve years. * The key to Rockefeller 's decision to run again is his eagerness to show that his $6 billion Urban Development Corporation can effectively rebuild city slums . As one Rockefeller aide puts it , " The sound of the steam shovel will soon be heard in the land . " More immediately , however , Rockefeller faces a fiscal crisis of immense proportions . The 1969-70 budget is likely to exceed $6 billion , leaving the state with an estimated $1 billion deficit . <P> Taxes Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily rising cost of state responsibilities . Previously approved increases in state aid for education , welfare doles and Medicaid costs alone are expected to add $800 million to the New York budget . <P> Painful as it is politically , Rockefeller 's only practical solution will be to raise the sales tax from 2% to 3% and increase the personal income tax , already one of the nation 's highest . Though Rockefeller promised in 1962 not to raise taxes , several levies have been increased . Largely as a result , Rockefeller 's popularity has dropped . <P> The new budget means a tough fight with the legislature and also provides a clue as to why Rockefeller chose to announce his political intentions so early . By declaring now , he hopes to avoid being labeled a lame duck and thereby to achieve greater leverage in dealing with the legislature . <P> Roadblock . He will also have to face considerable opposition to new programs to improve transportation and eliminate water and air pollution . <P> While the announcement indicates the direction of Rockefeller 's political future , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City 's Mayor John Lindsay . At the moment , Lindsay 's popularity in the city is at a low ebb , and the Governor 's office would have been an attractive alternative should his citywide appeal continue to diminish . The . Rockefeller decision eliminates that alternative . Moreover , the mayor would probably have little chance of dislodging fellow Republican Charles E. Goodell from his Senate seat . What ever his prospects in the next two years , Lindsay 's long-range future still looks bright . The possibility of running for Governor in 1974 looms large , and would put him in the catbird seat for a presidential try in 1976 . For Rockefeller , the campaign for re-election has already begun . One of his aides predicted that it will be much like his previous drives- " a lot of dash , a lot of meetings and just a little money . " <P> <P> * The first was Governor George Clinton , who served 21 years spaced over two terms running from 1777 to 1795 and from 1801 to 1804.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
