Between courses , in truly Lucullan meals , the diner may be served a bit of sherbet " to refresh the palate . " Yet in feasting on art , the viewer usually plunges from room to room , and his retinas , unrefreshed between rich courses , cry for cool relief . Such , at least , seems to be the art-gastronomy theory of Jos Luis Sert , dean of Harvard 's Graduate School of Design ; as the architect of a new museum in the south of France , he solves this and a number of other gallerygoers ' problems . <P> The builder is Paris 's Flemish-French Art Dealer Aim Maeght ( pronounced Mag ) , who had long owned a wooded hilltop a mile from Saint-Paul-de-Vence , on the Cte d'Azur , a perfect site for a museum . He consulted assorted architects , who suggested amusing and cavalier plans for a subterranean museum or one soaring on stilts , but he eventually chose Sert . For consultants he enlisted artists whose works he sells : Braque , Chagall , Mir and Giacometti . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a heady collection of modern masters : soon there will be a dozen Mirs , Giacomettis by the ton , Chagalls , Kandinskys and Braques - all from Maeght 's famous collection . The museum will open next year . <P> Light is the most vexing problem in any museum . Sert &; Co. , after long thought , have built quarter-cylinder " traps " that concentrate light the way a radar antenna gathers in radio waves . The effect is to eliminate streaks and reflections . To thwart " artnaping , " that ever-popular Riviera crime , alarms flash and doors snap shut like those in a sub marine if any art object is touched . <P> Sert 's design uses concrete , native stone and small bricks , and his plan stretches the museum along the irregular curves and rises of the hill . Rooms are devoted to works of different artists , and the sherbet is provided by " reposing spaces " between galleries , where visitors can " wash their eyes " of Chagall , say , before attacking Kandinsky . For a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain water caught by gigantic rooftop scoops.
