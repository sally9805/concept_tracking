" The recession is really over . " <P> This was the verdict passed last week by Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon . Both Dillon and Presidential Economic Adviser Walter W. Heller predicted that the gross national product , which stood just below $500 billion in the first quarter , would hit between $520 and $530 billion by year 's end-a prediction very close to that made in the generally gloomy atmosphere of five months ago by FORTUNE . <P> The nation 's businessmen agreed . Assembled in Manhattan for the annual meeting of the National Industrial Conference Board , nearly 1,000 top executives representing a cross section of U.S. industry found the economy rapidly improving . Despite a severe profit squeeze in many industries , said Republic Steel 's President Thomas F. Patton , " the recovery in general business activity is more vigorous than most people anticipated . " <P> From Washington , Commerce Secretary Luther W. Hodges weighed in with news that gave substance to the economists ' projections : in April , new orders and sales of manufacturers ' durable goods each rose 4% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant , personal income rose $500 million in April to set a new high of $410.3 billion . The income rise , which took place chiefly through improved wages and salaries rather than through Government benefits , would have been even bigger ( $2.3 billion ) if the Administration had not artificially inflated the March rate by making early payment of $1.8 billion in G.I. insurance dividends . <P> The Stabilizer . Secretary Hodges ' news pointed up the fact that personal income has become " the hero of recessions , " tending to hold up the economy in times of stress when other indicators are falling . During three previous postwar recessions , personal income dipped substantially less , both absolutely and in percentages , than the gross national product ( see chart ) . In the recession just over , it fell less than half as much as G.N.P . <P> What is behind personal income 's growing stability ? Though each recession has been marked by a fairly sharp decline in income resulting from current production ( 3% in the 1960 recession ) , that fall is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same dividends and interest . Benefit payments , such as unemployment compensation and old-age pensions ( laid-off oldsters frequently retire ) , always increase during a recession . They rose from $27.7 billion to $31.1 billion in the year up to February 1961 . The level of personal income is also buoyed up during recessions by smaller tax collections , since the U.S. graduated-tax system enables people to keep more as they make less .
