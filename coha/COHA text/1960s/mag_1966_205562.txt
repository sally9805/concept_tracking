THROUGHOUT the course of the U.S. buildup in Viet Nam that now totals 350,000 men , there has been remarkably little disagreement between the American command in Saigon and Commander in Chief Lyndon Johnson and his officials in Washington . One excellent reason for this is that all along Johnson has promised General William Westmoreland that whatever manpower reinforcements the general needed in the field , he would get . So far , the promise has been fulfilled : some 200,000 men will have disembarked in South Viet Nam in 1966 alone , bringing the year-end total of American troop strength in the field to 385,000 . <P> But beyond that point , divergence looms between the generals , on the one hand , and Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara on the other . Last week McNamara disclosed a planned " slowdown in our rate of troop deployments " in Viet Nam , " a statement , " explained the Defense Department the day after Election Day , " that does not necessarily rule out a figure as high as 500,000 for the end of 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many of their colleagues in the Pentagon , half a million men falls considerably short of what is needed . Marine Commandant Wallace Greene has plugged for the total with which most privately concur : 750,000 men . <P> They argue that for all the Allied success in search-and-kill forays against the Communists , victories over the enemy 's main-force military units are like pushing water up the side of a bowl . The moment the mailed fist of U.S. power is withdrawn to search out the enemy elsewhere , the water , meaning the Red control of the countryside , runs back . Pacification efforts have largely failed in rural areas because there are not enough Allied troops to leave behind to provide a permanent shield behind which civilian teams can reclaim the peasants for the government . Even should negotiations take place , most U.S. officers in Viet Nam think the U.S. will need to be around for a long time in force to ensure that all the local Viet Cong , from village cops to schoolteachers , are identified by the Vietnamese and rooted out . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 750,000 level do not fault Saigon 's reasoning . Rather they insist that the fragile South Vietnamese economy , already inflation-plagued , can not absorb so massive an additional infusion of Americans . " It would be like putting 2,000,000 men in West Germany , " says one Defense Department official . What is more , and far more disturbing , is that without calling up the reserves or increasing draft levels , the U.S. military simply does not have that many men available for Viet Nam duty . And there , for the moment , rests the debate , which might well affect the outcome of the war in which 5,800 U.S. lives have already been invested .
