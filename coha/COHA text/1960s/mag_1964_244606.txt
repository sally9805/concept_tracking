The U.S. home has become a battle ground - long before husband and wife move in . Americans bought 1,600,000 new homes in 1963 , paying an average of $14,000 each . By 1970 , 2,000,000 new homes a year are expected to be sold , at an average cost of $16,800 . Result : producers of everything from the lowly pine two-by-four to the finest-quality ceramic tile are involved in a fierce fight to win a bigger part of this growing market . The battle was evident last week at the opening of the New York World 's Fair , where dozens of building-materials makers have set up displays to woo the public , from a house of Formica inside and out to one that is practically all glass . <P> Quite a Lot of Gas . At one time , the public did not need to be wooed . The materials that went into a house were dictated mostly by what was most readily available , whether it was lumber , brick or stone ; without question , the plumbing was galvanized pipe , the floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recent years have produced such an array of new building materials that both home buyer and home builder are often confused in making a choice . " There is more competition in the building industry than ever before , " says Earl W. Hadland , merchandising manager of Chicago 's Masonite Corp . " In outside siding , for example , it 's wood v. aluminum v. hardboard v. plywood v. steel . " <P> Most big companies are busy courting architects , wooing builders and using massive advertising campaigns to persuade the home buyers to insist on their products . Makers of aluminum , the fastest-rising among the new sidings , privately ask how long steel clapboard can resist rust . The steel-clapboard men , joined by the makers of a plywood coated with plastic , imply that aluminum snaps , crackles and pops during sharp temperature changes , and that a baseball or a hailstone can leave a permanent dent . The hottest war of all is the advertising battle between the gas and electrical utility companies for the right to provide the heat , do the cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontations among other materials are just as sharp and furious . Long-lasting and easy-to-install copper tubing had just won a victory over galvanized pipe for plumbing when along came cheaper plastic piping . Steel has joined battle with wood over the load-bearing structural parts of the home . Wood and aluminum are wrestling for the right to be in window frames ; steel and aluminum are fighting over outside door frames and sills . Gypsum board for interior walls has proved cheaper and faster to install than wet plaster , but it now has challengers in plywood finished by a photo process to look like expensive paneling and Masonite precoated with wallpaper or imitation wood grain . <P> Some architects argue that such variety among building materials may blight the U.S. with a hodgepodge of ugly , unrelated homes . " We have too much choice without enough discipline , " says a West Coast designer . But in an expanding market , the variety will only become greater . Steel , determined to push its use in homes from 1.5 tons to five tons in ten years , is experimenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aluminum producers are trying to make an attractive aluminum roof , have introduced an all-aluminum vacation cottage . Happily , this gives the all-human occupant that much more to choose from .
