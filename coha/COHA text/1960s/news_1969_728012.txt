txt For every presidential candidate there has to be a beginning . A few reporters , huddled around Sen. George McGovern at a private breakfast , are convinced they heard a starting gun . The South Dakota Senator , who launched a last-minute but unsuccessful try for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 , made these disclosures : ? That he talked to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D ) of Massachusetts in the past few days and was given assurances that Mr. Kennedy would not run in 1972 . " I asked him , " said Senator McGovern , " and he said definitely not . " ? That he has been given encouragement by " Kennedy people " to make the race for the Democratic nomination in ' 72 and that this encouragement has come since the tragedy involving Senator Kennedy . He added that these recent communications involved " key Kennedy people . " There were never those magic words , " I am a candidate , " nor would anyone expect such a commitment at this early date . But the Senator definitely marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of winter an entrant // self as a man who was moving to achieve the nomination . He has strengthened his staff in recent months . He will carry on a heavy speaking schedule . And he will participate actively and heavily in debating the leading issues of the diy . Perhaps , he said , this kind of involvement in the heated controversial issues , such as Vietnam , on which he is a leading " dove , " actually may close the nomination to him . But it was clear from the Senator 's remarks that he intends to challenge the administration continuously and sharply and in a way that will provide the Democratic Party in 1972 with the choice of a candidate who has expressed clear-cut alternative positions on the major issues . Coalition question At the same time , the Senator went on to say that the Democratic Party is " in very serious trouble . " " I am not at all certain we can put together a coalition that could win in 1972 , " he said . Already challenging President Nixon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator said that at the end of seven months , " I do n't give him very high marks . " He provided these specifics : Vietnam ? " This is the most urgent issue , and as far as I can see , there is no real change in our military . The Nixon approach contains the essentials that were present in the Johnson military strategy . If the management of the war is any different , it escapes me . " Asked whether the troop reductions did not constitute a new , different disengagement , the Senator said he was not at all certain it was . " I do n't know , " he said . " The troop withdrawal is tied to three conditions : progress in Paris talks , the level of military operations by Hanoi , and the ability of Saigon to take over the carrying or . of the war . You have to be an optimist to see all these conditions filled . " " What bothers me , " he said , " is that we are not going to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why sacrifice any more American troops in what appears to be nothing more than a face-saving effort ? " I 'd rather see a scheduled withdrawal , getting all those troops out on a set schedule next year . I am not sure what the Nixon timetable is , or whether he has one . " Food-stamp concern Nixon domestic policy ? " Inflation is a big problem . The President is using a tight-money policy which restricts jobs . It restricts the construction business and other businesses that would be providing jobs . And at the same time the President asks Congress to spend all this money for the antiballistic missile . " The President should be given plaudits for his welfare message . But at the same time it seems to be in conflict with early progress we were making on the hunger front . " " The President 's call for minimum federal standards in family support is good , also the elimination of the man-in-the-house rule . But he has put an emphasis on jobs without telling us where those jobs will come from . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator 's main criticism of the presidential welfare-reform package lies in the possibility it may mean an end to the food-stamp program . " I am sending a letter to the President today , " the Senator said , " to ask him to clarify this point and to remind him not to go back on his pledge to Congress that he would put an end to hunger in the United States . " If the food-stamp program for the poor were eliminated by the new program , " the Senator said , " it would be a devastating blow to our efforts to end hunger . "
