The hum of West Germany 's economy has given off some static recently with the ominous crash of several industrial giants , including Automaker Carl Borgward and Shipbuilder Willy Schlieker . Last week another big one swayed perilously close to collapse . <P> Pressed by more than $18.5 million in debts . Industrialist Hugo Stinnes Jr. , 66 , a freewheeling and individualistic magnate who in only ten years has built a diversified $100 million empire in machinery , ships , electronics , plastics , oil , and filling stations , has been forced to sell off some of his choicest holdings to Munich Banker Rudolf Mnemann . At week 's end Stinnes was brought into a crowded Bremen courtroom to answer a $4.5 million suit brought by a German mines association , which is trying to recover special compensations that the association claims were wrongly paid four years ago to one of his holding companies . Loss of the full amount could threaten Stinnes ' cash-shy empire with bankruptcy . <P> Hugo Stinnes-usually referred to as der Junior in German headlines-is the son of the famous Ruhr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be run by his wife and two sons . Hugo worked with his mother and brother Otto to rebuild the Stinnes holdings after World War II , but did not get along with his kinfolk . He set out to build an industrial complex of his own , calling one of his two holding firms " Hugo Stinnes Personally Inc. " to show his independence to the world . But Hugo depended too much on the memory of his father , and drove himself relentlessly to match old Hugo 's accomplishment . Like Borgward and Schlieker , he expanded too fast just for the sake of expansion , building on too narrow a capital base and not watching his profits closely enough . <P> Other German crashes have messily pulled down a lot of creditors , but the Stinnes contraction has so far proved surprisingly neat-thanks to Banker Mnemann . As Mnemann sees it , such firms as Stinnes often get into trouble " all because they let themselves be fooled for months by the greatest enemy which exists for a businessman : hope . " On Mnemann 's advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his immediate need for cash . When that was not enough , Mnemann himself last month began buying what Germans call die Perlen-the pearls - among Stinnes ' manufacturing companies , notably the machinery and plastics producers . Brash and brainy Banker Mnemann is playing an unaccustomed role as rescuer , and not entirely as a Samaritan ; he is making some good buys for himself at distress prices . Nonetheless , his intervention may at least leave Stinnes enough to retire to-and enough to please the creditors-if Stinnes ' lawsuit can be favorably settled .
