enormous pleasure . " Yeah ? Well , one Saturday he gets up , he wants a Pepsi . Where is the Pepsi ? ' No Pepsi . ' No Pepsi ? ' No Pepsi . ' He sees I 'm not going down , so he goes down . A half-hour , three-quarters of an hour . I grab myself a little snooze . I wake up , it 's four hours now . I feed the goldfish , I make a few latkes , I paint the kitchen chairs , I stuff the hassock Morty Zelenka got me from Tangiers , I potchke with my pottery . Cut a long story short , you know when he came back ? Ask me when he came back ? " " I 'll bite . " Morroe showed teeth . " So when did he come back ? " " I forget .

But it was a big coincidence . In fifteen years neither of them had been to Steeplechase . Whee ! Let 's take the subway down , let 's get hot dogs and custard and let 's go on the rides . Oh , he gave her a ride all right . He probably screwed her ass off . " " Ucch ! " said Morroe , and " Whoosh ! Tillie Dreyfus ! You 'd think . . . I do n't know . Anybody could hop into the sack with her . Take my word for it and without going into detail , I had plenty of opportunities . Plenty ! " " Look , kid , maybe he had standards in literature , but when it came to you-know-what it was just a question of what could fit on a mattress . If Greta Garbo came along  --  fine ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly laughed . " Did you hear how he carried on at Bentley ? All those sweet , juicy little things . He came back with a prostate  --  " " Bentley ? " cried Morroe . " Where did he come to Bentley ? " " Manny , Manny Ribalow is up there . They were lookingaround for somebody to give a popular culture seminar and he pushed hard for Leslie . " God almighty , thought Morroe ! From each Leslie had taken and gotten ! Wherever there was a foundation . Wherever there was a grant . Wherever there was a publisher to hand out advances . And he , he himself , out one hundred and thirty-seven dollars . Who would go blocks and blocks to save eight cents on a bottle of shampoo . His heart quickened and a great roaring started in his ears .

Mama , Mama , was this a Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy to Rome . If he had been better in the sciences he would have extracted the calcium from her bones . Once he had forced her to wear a crucifix in bed . Unto her ninth month with Pilar she had worked for him . Her stomach dropping , her legs swelling like hydrants . He had a habit of helping himself to whatever was in her purse . He grudged her an old razor blade to shave her legs . No library would issue him books , so he took cards out in her name and in the name of her Bessarabiangrandmother . He peed in the sinks . He wouldp51go to movies in the afternoon . He would demand all kinds of crazy dishes . He sat in the toilet for three hours at a time . He held on to no jobs . He farted away golden opportunities . He met no deadlines . He could be your best friend and , overnight , disappear like Job 's boils . There was no end to it . There were no words for so many sins and abominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To shut her up , he said , " Let me ask you this . What was he doing in Brooklyn ? Or maybe I misunderstood . Though how can you misunderstand Brooklyn . . . ? " In a firm matter-of-fact tone Inez replied , " I threw him the hell out . " Morroe dropped his eyes as if to spare her . " Yeah , yeah , yeah , I took all his things , I put them in the hall . " " In the hall ? " Morroe 's voice rang . " Oh , you 're kidding ! " " He was going out on a date . I did n't say anything , not a word . I figure , baby , you 're going to play around ? You want dates ? Fine , fine , fine ! You fat little slob , I 'll give you dates . I ran downstairs , I went to all the stores , I got a bunch of cartons . Whatever he owned I put in . I locked the door from the inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear him shnuffling around . He rings and he bangs and he bangs and he rings . He starts howling and calling me names . It 's all right , ' he tells me , tonight we broke up . ' You hear ? We broke up ! ' Then he starts bringing his stuff downstairs . A dozen trips at least . That I feel guilty about . For all you know he got strained , he damaged his heart . "  | " Very doubtful , " said Morroe . " I would guess it was the least of all the contributing factors . " And he began to muse . Leslie should have called me . I would have certainly come down and given a hand . No matter what time , I would have overlooked it . Then a crazy night , like in the old days . Where he would talk and talk , and for all you know we 'd make contact again . And I would have brought him home with me and put him up on the couch , or fixed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etta carried on . I mean it . Suddenly Inez ran to the door , saying , " Good , good , good ! Here 's Pilar , she 's got coffee , we 'll have coffee , it 'll be nice . " She hunted up the sugar bowl ; the sugar was hard , encrusted and stained brown . As Morroe hacked and hacked with the handle of a spoon , Inez told him , " You know he started in to write smut ? " " Hey , now you 're being silly . " An astonished grin spread over Morroe 's face . " I remember what Wilner wrote about his stories . Sure . . . The cerebral is carnal and the carnal is cerebral . ' " " I know what I 'm talking about . He said so in a letter . You want to see , you 'll see . " She launched herself against one of the bookcases and started to drag it from the wall , meanwhile babbling , " It 's behind here . . . . How do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and the lock is no damn good . . . Leslie 's presents . . . " Books began to slide and spill from the top shelves , and though breakfast lay heavy on his stomach , Morroe sprang to assist . " Hold the bottom , " she instructed , fishingwith her hand along the molding . " Push a little more . More . Now give it , like , a lift . " My destiny , myp54fate , Morroe thought , while blood pounded his temples . To shlepp for her . " Okay , okay , okay . " She drew out a wad of paper folded down to matchbook size . " Now you 'll read , you 'll see . " The letter was typed on blank loose-leaf paper ; there were no margins and the ribbon had given out near the end . Morroe drained the sweetened sediment at the bottom of his coffee and sank into the couch . His lips unwittingly moving , he read : DEAR INEZ : So where were you last night ? I called and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV , I told myself . She 's spread out on the daybed , shaving her legs or doing her nails , fressing away on ice cream and pistachio nuts , sprinting , during commercials , to the potty . In our Drawer of Love her pessary lies sealed and dry and talcumed between plastic covers . O , sancta simplicimus ! And what 's doing with me ? Well , 1 ) In four weeks I have copped only one quick feel . Even in my wet dreams I 'm being rejected. 2 ) I have become , in a small way of business , a pornographer. 3 ) I have taken a room in Brighton Beach . Number one I shall charge off to Zeitgeist . Number two  --  number two is the fate of the artist in mass society , the atomization of the individual , the quality of contemporary experience , the triumph of kitsch , the blight spreading over our moral imagination . All right , all right ! One Saturday I 'm passing by Marty Menashim 's bookstore . I wave . He runs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me likep55a warm bath . One of his biggest customers , a textile king who spends almost four hundred dollars a month with him , has a yen to help the young and promising talents . This poor guy , it hurts him , his disc is slipping because I have to teach and write reviews for two and a half cents a word . And he wants to do something about it , he would definitely like to help . All right , but how ? After all , there are the foundations  --  God forbid he should start competing with the foundations ! He has conceived , therefore , the following proposition : He shall be my patron ; I am to write for his eyes alone . So what am I going to write ? Well , it should be realistic and , if it 's convenient , here and there my characters should administera little discipline . Stern , mind you , but nothing complicated  --  no Chinese boots or iron virgins . And , above all , no Jews . Thus , once a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the check . Ten cents a word  --  was there ever such a fee ? The stuff flows , it pours out of me like curses from a Roumanian mouth . And do you know who serves as model , who it is that fevers my fictions ? Give a guess ! Tsatskeleh meineh , you have been housemaid and nun , overseer of a concentration camp , librarian , Hollywood starlet , lady editor , Eskimo woman . You have been ill used by Lascars , private eyes , prep-school boys , embassy officials , London bobbies and French flits , you have made whoopee with Great Danes and been dildoed by Eurasian midgets . Which brings us , by commodius vicarius , to Brighton Beach . On that night of nights  --  and why did n't you close the top on my talcum powder ? It spilled over everythingp56I checked my stuff at Grand Central and wandered , in a state of holy madness , all up and down Times Square . From movie to movie I went , amid the living dead , the sleepwalkers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pina coladas and coconut drinks and the thinnest of Grant 's hamburgers . At Bickford 's in the morning to search the ads . ( Let none say a word against those oatmeal cookies ! ) One , one alone holds my eye . " A very clean room for a nice person . " Here are no complex structures , no big deals , no mishmash . " A nice person . " The phrase holds open a universe of fixed and eternal values , of certainties unfolding upon certainties . I shlubb down my coffee , I make a wee-wee and , forty-two minutes later  --  door to door  --  I present myself to Mrs. Holzberg . But first let me tell you what a country I have entered . It lies between the heel and instep of the great boardwalk that carries you through the promise of Coney Island and beyond , to Sea Gate , watering place of the once rich . Here is a bazaar , a sun kingdom , here there is no humiliation , no indignity , here all things are endowed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can kill you with noise , the fancy-shmancy apartment houses are going under , the bungalows could cave in from a dirty look , the beach is a Castle Garden  --  never mind ! ) Anyway , with Mrs. Holzberg I knew I had fallen into good hands . A few jokes , a Yiddish phrase , and identity was established ; I had stepped off on the right foot . Beforeshe even put out the honey cake she let me know she 'd been on the Yiddish stage , a singer who had played second fiddle only to Jennie Goldstein . Her late husband , did Ip57know of him ? De Hirsch Holzberg . The last of the Yiddish Lears . Even Hollywood had grabbed him , and once in a while he still shows up on an old TV movie . A witch doctor , a mad scientist , a good-natured Indian who begs and begs Sitting Bull not to start up with Custer . The room is in a back-yard bungalow ; the shingles smell a little of flanken , the walls are covered with green oilcloth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But linens like snow , towels upon towels , and over every door a mezuzah . There was a time , Mrs. H. assures me , when she could pick and choose , when people were happy to pay three and four hundred dollars over the summer . Now there 's only myself and , two doors down , her son Chester and his wife , Evelyn . Chester is a big fellow who once did all right for himself in the Golden Gloves and still keeps fit with long hours on the handball courts . Every day he 's nuhdging me to do some push-ups or to pace him while he runs around the block a few times . An intense Zionist ; when he finishes up his dental mechanic 's course he will settle in Israel . He talks of long sentry duty in the Negev , scaling walls , leaping ditches , hand-to-hand combat with Arabs . For which he 'll be more than ready . And he pinches the roll of fat over my gut . Evelyn is a kind of gelaymteh : whatever she touches falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon enter her senior year , the authorities are insisting it 's time she picks a major . Between education and sociology she is going crazy , she is getting cramps . What do I think ? Becauseif she takes education it 's more practical ; she can walk into a job ; they 're begging for teachers . Though she relates better to sociology , and would have received an A for the course if she had not been late with a term paper . She fallsp58bark into the beach chair , spent , inert . She can barely get up to go to the bathroom . But at night  --  ah , that 's another story . Then it 's pound and thump and huff and puff and zing-a-zing-zing . I lie and I listen . Please , I beg , have a heart , take pity . Then I ca n't stand it any more . I rush out of bed and I start scribbling my little stories . Which I shall do in a moment , when I have finished this letter . ( There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an enormous dong . ) And then off , off to the boardwalk , to hang around and watch the kids . Honest , you never saw such kids . Brown and round and mother-loved , fed on dove 's milk and Good Humors . At night they pair off under the pavilions  --  Milton and Sharon , Seymour and Sandra , Heshie and Deborah . They sing stupid songs , an original word does n't leave their lips and , clearly , not one will ever stand up for beauty or truth or goodness . Yet  --  do me something ! I could stay and watch them for hours . I feel such love , I chuckle and I beam , and if it was in my power I 'd walk in their midst , pat their heads and bless them , each and every one . So they do n't join YPSL and they never heard of Hound and Horn and they 'll end up in garden apartments , with wall-to-wall carpeting . What does it matter ? Let them be happy , only be happy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even these : That you have not read my work in three years . That you do not utter little cries in sex . That in company you will not laugh at the second hearing of my jokes . That you have let the Chinese laundry ruin my shirts . Of course , you know how long this burst of love will last ! It 'll start to diminish by tomorrow morning , when Ip59get the first jostle on the subway . By the time I hit the city , by the time I search the kiosks for the new quarterlies , it 'll disappear altogether . Rankin will have a review , Pankin will have an article , Rifkin will have an excerpt from a novel in progress  --  and right away I 'll eat myself up alive . What can I do , nebbach ? Am I the primus mobilus , am I more than a nachshlepper in the order of things ? I 'm not the owner , lady , I only work here ! To love costs , and costs dear . Like my grandmother used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar of schmaltz . Stay well ... . LESLIEP.S . Do me a favor . Send some undershirts . You threw in only a couple and they 're turning green already . Morroe put aside the letter and sat stiff-backed , in a state of arrest . In his thoughts he begged , Leave me alone . I feel disgusted , I want to vomit , I 'm sick and tired of everything . Where do I come to this ? I have my own problems . First thing tomorrow morning I have to start on a new brochure , get a gimmick for the campaign theme . The fund-raisers are pressing and pressing . And there would probably be a showdown with Rugoff , the talebearer , the troublemaker , the Uriah Heep . So what kind of " love , " what kind of bullshit ? Yes , and blessing other kids . His own , though  --  his own he does n't even mention . After some time Morroe got to his feet and said , " I think we should start . Till you get a cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive a little before everybody else . "  |p60But  Ines took hold of his arm and drew him back . She said , brooding , " What am I going to do with his clothes ? IIe used to buy and buy . Sell and you get nothing . You want them ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ! You 'll come later , I 'll put tlieni in valises , you 'll take everything . " " ' They 'd never , never fit me , " Morroe protested . " Remember , he was on the broad side . And shorter in the legs . It would n't pay with alterations and everything . " " It 's only right , " Inez continued , unheeding . " Because he was so crazy about you . Because he 'd always say , this is a real person , a human being , a mensch . " She tightened her grip on his arm , then lunged up and kissed him violently on the lips . The drag of her weight took him off balance ; he toppled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wished him harm , " Inez said , tears running down her face , her mouth fallen , black and twisted . " I 'm scared . Do I have to kiss him when he 's in the box ? That 's how it is in my religion . My mother made me do it once to an aunt when I was a kid  --  the old bitch ! You beg the dead : forgive , take my sins under with you . " " Foolish , foolish , " Morroe cried , stretching out beside her . " I 've been to Jewish funerals  --  too many in my lifetime . And they do n't go through any of that stuff . You 'll see how foolish you are . " He squeezed closer and stroked her hair . " One-two-three . In and out , no big deals . " As if by accident he lowered his hand down and down , till it fell near the ridge of her panty-girdle . Whoosh ! It dawned on him that on this day anything was possible . But suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a quickie , sneaked in the name of compassion . Coolly , without caution , Morroe began to gather up the folds of her dress . And the bell rang . Two short bursts , then a prolonged , tearing peal . " Wait , wait , wait , " Inez cried , deftly stiff-arming him and making for the window . " It 's Falvey . " She flung up the blinds and bent out . " One second , " she howled . " I 'll go to the john , I 'll wash up and I 'm ready . " And to Morroe : " My earrings . Are they too loud ? Eh , as if they 'll even notice . " " Whoa , " said Morroe , muddled and fatigued ; he had broken into a heavy sweat . " What 's the arrangements ? I thought you and I would go together . " " I ca n't talk , " Inez snapped . " He 's double-parked and it 's the beginning of the month . They 're giving tickets right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilar . Whose face , as she came forward from the kitchen , bore the same wise little smile . " Then I 'll ride down with you , " Morroe insisted . " Just let me wash my face , that 's all . " Inez gave a nervous shiver and wagged her head . " No room . Where 's there room ? We have to pick up Falvey 's sister . And her kids , she ca n't leave the kids . We were so close . Could I say no to her , could I say do n't come ? " " No room ? " Morroe croaked . " That 's nice , very nice . You could n't make better arrangements , hah ? " He was ready to say more , much more . But for Pilar 's sake he dissembled his anger . Once again Inez kissed him flush on the mouth , thoughp62he shrank from the contact . She said , " You 'll call up the boys . You 'll let them know . You 'll all come together . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaky legs Morroe followed her into the hall . " You did n't tell me where the funeral is . Tell me ! " he demanded . " You know where Ocean Parkway comes into Prospect Park ? " " I think so . Yes . " " Near there . Parkway Memorial , or Parkway Chapel . You 'll see , you 'll find it . " " I 'm not so sure . Hold it ! There must be at least  --  " But he heard only the knocking of her footsteps on the landing and Pilar 's quick-running chatter . He went back into the apartment and began an aimless wandering of the rooms . Without knowing precisely why , he decided to clear away , straighten up . There was a small carton under the kitchen sink ; into this he emptied some of the ash trays and discarded the coffee containers . He adjusted the blinds , climbing on a chair to do what he could for the fraying cords ; he shut off the lights , he moved the bookcase back against the wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have gone over the rugs . Though he was soon winded and overheated , the effort nevertheless had a settling effect upon him . He rested , smoked a cigarette and rose to make the calls . His voice was pitched low , somewhat strained and unctuous . With each of the boys he dropped into the same phrases : " A little bad news . . . coronary thrombosis . . . not a bit of warning . . . lousy , rotten deal . . . . " In a few minutes everything was arranged ; they were top63meet at Sheridan Square , and Holly Levine would pick them up in his Volkswagen . When Morroe hung up he remained at the telephone table . " Cry , " he muttered . " Now cry a little . " He bent his head and thought of his Uncle Lazar , of the slights he had suffered over the past month , make it six weeks , of Auschwitz and Buchenwald and the six million . But it was useless.  |p64LATELY  , death was a strong consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-eight , with a broad flat face and hair short and black as peppercorns , he loved and took good care of himself , and there were few cravings he could not still satisfy . But though he was no believer in evil eyes , though he was unafraid of making enemies right and left , he could not shake off the notion that somehow menaces were after his life , that he and his cronies , the vigorous , powerful and flashy who questionedGod , man and devil , were going under . True , he had just had a mild scare with food poisoning , and , on a hospital bed where lights and loudspeakers kept you from sleep and the nurses would n't take an extra step ,  |p65it  was no wonder that thoughts grew sour and ugly . But it was really at work that Ottensteen had fallen into his present state . He wrote literary articles for Yetzt , a Yiddishdaily , and one morning , when things were slow , when he was brooding over the person his son Max had become , Shiffman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gottenyu , do n't ask , Felix , do n't ask ! " In the corridor the whole staff was coming together . One of the women had fainted , her head had struck the edge of a chair , and people were rushing for smelling salts and dabbing her face with strong cologne . For Gollowitz , the executive editor , was dead of a massive stroke . He had been washing up in the men 's room , he complained over the quality of the paper towels , and all of a sudden he had reeled and sagged onto the tiles . Gollowitz , who did n't know how to raise his voice or say a harsh word , who had once wept while firing an errand boy . This pen , this voice , this monument , this influence , snuffed out , finished , vanished like a fog . Then , in a few short months , Ottensteen was to hurl clods of earth into other graves . Schlossberg . . . Chaim Posner . . . Mendel Amsterdam . . . . Poets , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be again . Not like his Max , a complainer , a whiner , knowing only how to take and take , pinched and gray already , before he was twenty-eight . No , they were first human beings , laughers , drinkers , whoremasters , and because they could put a few lines down on paper they did n't take the attitudethat the world owed them a living . Touch one of them and you touched a man.  |p66And  now , as he hung up on Morroe Rieff , Ottensteen banged his thighs with tiny fists and in his fashion prayed . " You , hey , You , please , please let up on us . We had our share . " Angry tears approached his eyes , but he quelled them . " You are getting cranky and spiteful . Strange . Like a woman in her change of life . You could n't leave Leslie alone ? In what way was he hurting You ? Such a wonderful boy , such a classy writer . And what kills me is the way You keep hands off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are no good to You and no good to people . Here , right here in this hotel , do n't go any further than that fat lawyer . Katzka . When he has to look at his watch he makes sure to turn his back on you . And Nickie the elevator man . He gets his living from Jews , but the more you shmeer him the more he hates your guts . " Then Ottensteen went on to other reflections . He was putting on his special shoes with the heavy metal arches  --  he would need them for the hard cemetery paths  --  and with his knees locking his face , his belly pressing upward and hampering his breath , he suddenly felt in his heart one great desire : to take the life out of Max and bestow it upon Leslie . All right , it was n't nice , it was unnatural ; other parents carried children on their backs , suffering and sustaining , letting themselves be clawed and torn and stamped upon , without end . But he , Ottensteen , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not say , " You are my son , so I will judge you differently from the rest of mankind . " Nothing doing ! Where was it written that he had to love Max for his selfishness , for the way he antagonized you ,  |p67for  his habit of looking at you so painfully , so angrily , as though every minute you were killing his soul ? Last Friday they had come close to shedding blood . Max had called him for lunch , stammering and speakingso slowly you grew old between each word . He has something in the works , Ottensteen suspected , a fresh piece of business , and it 's going to cost me . But when they faced each other across the restaurant table Ottensteenhad been affable enough , saying , " Nu , sonny boy , kaddish meiner , what 's doing and what 's happening ? " Hanging his gloomy , narrow face in which Ottensteen saw nothing of himself , Max said , " It 's getting quite unbearablein my place , Papa . I do n't think I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the copy editors and loaded some of her work on me . By the time I 'm home about all I can do is lie in bed and watch TV . Of course , I ca n't go near my own stuff . I 'm pooped , I just do n't have the energy . " " Vei , such problems , such a terrible and dreadful cross to bear . " Ottensteen clicked his tongue . " I remember , once upon a time , there were poets who were as sensitiveas you and , maybe , God forbid , as talented , who worked fourteen hours a day in shops . Fourteen ? Sixteen ! Where you had to keep a little water bottle next to you because the boss would look cross-eyed if you shut off the machine a second . And still --  " he tilted his head and tapped his brow "  --  still-1-1 they were n't , they managed not to be so pooped . They did their scribbling , they had energy , they even went out and tried to make revolutions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole6p68glass of water and crammed his mouth with bread , tearingthe soft white center out of the loaf . Then he said , " Papa , we see each other  --  what ? At most , oh , once every seven , eight weeks . And you never let up . You belittle , you keep cutting me down . " He began to cough and stammer . " It 's not my fault if there are no revolutionsto be made . Besides , the poet has a tough enough time today . He ca n't just put a word down and leave it at that , plain , simple , open to all . If he says grass ' he has to make sure he shows off all kinds of history and physics and archeology and myth . He has to keep up with everything . If he ca n't , he 's out of luck , he 'll never get anywhere . Because there are hundreds and hundreds of other young poets who can , who are after the same few pages in the same magazines . On top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They keep you waiting for months sometimes before you hear from them . And they are doing you a big favor to print you , to stick you in somewhere to fill a hole at the bottom of a page . So do n't talk to me about revolutions . " Flinging out his arms , Ottensteen said , " We drop the subject . Only answer one question . To ease a father 's curiosity . " There was repressed laughter in his voice . " Those poems you had in that  --  what ?  --  with pink and green paper  --  " " Serpent 's Tongue . " " Anyway , how is it  --  how is it  --  that a  --  you 'll pardon the expression  --  a cocker like you comes to write a line : Let 's sack the city , tear the lamp posts by the roots ' ? " " Pluck the lamp posts . . . "  | " Because I 'd like to know what it is you have against the city , what harm it ever did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Actually , I was mocking , satirizing the poet 's attitude toward industrial society . " " You do n't say ! " exclaimed Ottensteen blandly as he cut away fat from his meat . " You know , I feel better . I was getting very , very worried . " Then in complete silence they sat and ate , crowding their food . And Ottensteen kept wondering , " When , when ? " Any minute he 's going to spring something . The way he sucks on his lips , the way the legs are moving , like he has to go to the toilet . He does n't know how to get around people . Even as a kid , the same way . From the minute he walked into the class the teacher had it in for him . He noticed Max stooping and scribbling on the back of an envelope and he said , " What , what are you doing there ? Why do n't you sit straight , nice , like a human being ? " " That 's how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I send out a dozen at a clip and I have to have some kind of system , since it 's embarrassing if the same poem goes to one magazine twice . " He handed over the envelope . " On one side I put the names of the poems and on the other side all the magazines . I give every magazine a letter and every poem a number and as soon as I mail a poem to a magazine I put the right number alongside the right letter . " Ottensteen went , " Tsooh-tsooh-tsooh , " and , after a longp70look at the envelope , said , " I 'll advise you something : send this away to print for a poem . As is ! " Max retrieved the envelope . His jaw grew slack , his eyes lidded and he uttered a bark of senseless laughter , like a distraught parrot . " I guess to the next person it could seem . . . " He faltered , puffing out his cheeks in so repulsive a manner as to make him look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his nature , chose that moment to reveal what was in his mind . Without preliminaries , he let Ottensteen know he had decided to go back to school . There was no getting away from it : he would be a hundred times better off teaching . Six or nine hours a week were not forty . To say nothing of tenure and vacation and sabbaticals . But you needed a Ph.D . No matter how well you were known , no matter how much you 'd published . Plus two thousand dollars . At the very least . Aside from what he himself would earn from a part-time job . Because he would still work ; he was quick to point this out . When the two thousand dollars came up Ottensteen started to interrupt . He let Max finish , though , and reared back in his chair , staring at him serenely . Presently , he said , " You wanted your own place , I helped set you up . You wanted Mexico , it was Mexico . You wanted Paris , I financed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little in the way of returns . So without argument , without raising a voice , I tell you leave der alte Ottensteenalone . " With a moistened fingertip Max was carrying crumbs from the tablecloth to his mouth . " You gave me twelvep71dollars a week , " he managed to bring out . " Not twenty . Boy oh boy , when it suits your purposes  --  " " Excuse me . Twelve dollars a week for close to twentysixmonths is not money . " And Ottensteen flung down his napkin . " He thinks I piss and shit thousand-dollar bills . No , no , sonny boy , it does n't come that easy . For a few extra bucks I stand on my sick feet and I lecture an hour and a half to the Hadassah ladies and I spend anotherhour answering their brilliant questions . " He formed his lips into a cupid 's bow and simpered , " Mr. Ottensteen , my Zelda wanted me to ask you about Philip Roth .... " " You have it , Papa , " Max said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Who denies ? " Ottensteen laughed at his own irony . " You spend it , too . But on strangers , not your own . " " What , what 's this ? " said Ottensteen , screwing up his eyes so that they completely disappeared . " Elaborate a little . Because I smell , like ... " " Drop it , Papa , drop it . You know what I 'm talking about . " Ottensteen opened his hands in a movement of denial . There was a pause ; then Max looked at him searchinglyand said , " All right . Essie Meltzer . How much does she cost you ? I 'll bet plenty . And not only her . You send the two boys to camp and you lay out  --  why , a small fortune  --  " " Oh , is that so ? Is that so ? " said Ottensteen , astonished. "  --  to straighten their teeth . I know . I also go to Dr. Kolodny. "  |p72Ottensteen  's voice broke as he shouted , " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really so different when mother was alive , " Max said , once more puffing out his cheeks . " You had money for the whole world . Ottensteen the big shot ! The heavy spender ! When he comes , he comes like a sport . Oh , but when mother wanted  --  needed  --  a new wintercoat , what a scene , what a cry of poverty . Yes , and even when she was sick , when it was a question of two weeks or a month at most , you debated a hundred times before you wrote the check for a private nurse . " With a thrust of his little arm Ottensteen cracked Max across the face . He said , " I was n't too crazy about your mother and I like you even less . " In the sudden stillness of the restaurant Max 's cry hung like a curl of smoke . He jerked his chair away , raised his own hand , then let it fall limply at his side . " All right , " he said , dully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you know what I wish you ? What mother had . No more , no less ; I 'm being fair . " And he walked rapidly away , while Ottensteen , for the benefit of the waiter , whistled a little tune between his teeth . So it was no wonder that as he descended in the elevatorwith its dark paneling , its stifled light and rich red plush , Ottensteen saw himself in his coffin . His bankbookswould help irrigate the Negev ; his shoes , in plain brown paper , Max would get . By special messenger . And since he was a sport , he would throw in whatever troubles he had not finished up in this life . P73On his way out he checked with the desk for mail and messages . There was nothing , and he handed over his key to the clerk , Sobiloff . Who hissed and pointed to the elevator . Turning , Ottensteen saw a bunch of young girls in white uniforms , most likely from the beautician 's school on the second floor . " Ummmm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where are the youthful energies , heh ? That 's how it is , Mister O. When you 're a boy , you say , Oh , did I have myself a good screw ; when you 're middle-aged you say , Oh , oh , did I have myself a good meal ; and when you reach our years it 's Oh , oh , oh , did I have myself a good crap . " To which Ottensteen , standing rigid as brass , made reply : " Sobiloff , I 'll give you information . You 're a dopey man . An idee-yut . A big horse 's ass . " And linking thumbs behind the small of his back , his paunch upthrust , he strode slowly into the killing sun . " The Bronx girl , " said Barnet Weiner , poet , critic , contributor to the literary quarterlies , " is different from the Brooklyn girl . " And inchwise , on elbows and knees , he began to make his way across the bed like one covering a commando course . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rested : eyes filled with morning fluid and sediment , sighting along navel and big toe at the flaky imprint of a moth on the bedpost . " The Brooklyn girl is tough , independent , " he continued , " a terrific little dresser . In contrast , her Bronx counterpart will permit Momma to wash her underwearP74and iron her blouses till age thirty-five . Or sex , take sex . The Brooklyn girl is frank , open , she wo n't make you feel like a murderer if you squeeze her tsitskies . " Drawing a Kleenex from under the lean pillow , Myra Mandelbaum blew her nose and blinked at him with lamentingSad Sack eyes , her thin pale features coiling into a mask of infinite endurance . Which stirred him even more deeply against her . And he said further , " Yes , but the Bronx girl , after a year of Carnegie concerts and New School lectures , becomesreceptive , in her various apertures , to all manner of diddling and fingering . When you plead with her , when you pant with passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves and ruining your health , she will only adjust her suspants and sneer , So why do n't you see a doctor , then ? ' " Her eyes wet and brimming , Myra Mandelbaum demanded , " Tell me ! What did I do and what was so ter-rible ? " Weiner turned mute . " Tell me ! " she persisted . And she yanked at the stockingsthat lay in elephantine folds about her ankles . " BecauseI ca n't take it from you any more , you mad bastard , with your fake sociology . " He replied " Gaah ! " and raised himself again for a swift assessment in the chiffonier mirror . It was all he could do to hold down a sob as he remembered his photo on the dust jacket of New Critics : 1944  --  the hard strong features holding back easily the encroachment of Semitic melancholy , the springy black hair needing ap75trim , the mouth soft , full , delicate , even with that cocky cigarette stub . Now he was bare on top , his scalp the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left him fallen in the cheeks , his nose was broadened , veined . And he had published nothing in years . " Gaah ! " he said again , recoiling in blind shock from his image . " I was willing to put up with anything . I might have overlooked the little coat with Persian lamb sleeves , the rhinestone jewelry , the Helena Rubinstein compact .... " He pointed a prophetic finger at her . " I could have found it in my heart to forgive the fact that we had cohabited  --  say , two point five times a week and five months , which makes it roughly , conservatively  --  gaah , maybe sixty times before you could be prevailed upon to stay the night . " " Was it my fault ? " said Myra Mandelbaum in a small but staunch voice . " Because my hair is oily and I have to wash it every few days and you have such hard water ? " He got up , teetering a little on his feet . " But you 're clever , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , shortener of my life and devourer of my days , your Bronx peasant cunning showed you where I was vulnerable , where to put in the grijjies . " With thumb and forefinger he clamped down on her long chin and waggled it back and forth . " Where did you get that gall , that effrontery , that chutzpah before ? Where do you come off with that ass-heaving , that moaning and groaning , that ooh-ing and aah-ing ? " He shut his eyes and went through a pantomime of shivering and ragged breathing . " Oh , baby , baby ! I love it , oh I love it , I love it ! " Then , P76serenely , " Where is the style , the sense of structure ? Are n't you aware that the anticipatory it ' heralds a deferredsubject ? Gaah ? " A lewd smile of complicity split wide over the face of Myra Mandelbaum . " Wise guy , " she said , " big shot . He forgets I took a few psych courses in my time ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of his hostility . Yeah-yeah ! Because I refuse to be a masochist . Because I refuse , in this heat , to ride an hour and ten minutes on the subway to his mother 's house when it 's positively not appreciated , when I get from her only digs and needles . " " Gaah ! Digs and needles ! She 's crazy about you . She sees ketchup is on sale , two-for-something , one bottle goes to you . She grinds by her own hand top round for your stuffed cabbage . She saves little jars so you can take home apple sauce and first-quality chicken soup . " He began to rock and sway and beat his breast . " Stuffed cabbage , my ass . She talks a good meal , your mother . But all I ever got from her was hard-boiled eggs . No , no , no  --  excuse me , I wo n't lie , I wo n't distort . Becauseonce , once upon a time , she actually did open a can of sardines . " " Stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings . " He returned to bed , fitting his soles against her soles so that they reclined like a pair of pornographic bookends . " Box after box . Shnorred , with cunning and craft , from tough-minded Cousin Schmeilick . " " Boxes ? You case , you nut , you miserable liar ! Three pair , three lousy pair . And seconds , to boot . Before I even had the tissue off , in my hands , they fell apart . "   " Shah , shah , " he comforted , stroking her instep with his big toe . " And by the way  --  once is a joke and twice is a joke . But I 'm getting sick and tired of her cute little habit of calling me Mary Murphy . Or asking me do I know what Yom Kippur is . . . . " " Gaah , that , " Weiner crowed , " that 's nothing . You should have known her when she was on top of her form . A name for everyone . Did I tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did . And Momma could n't stand him , even before he became a big-time hotsy-totsy critic . She called him by one name and one name only . Pishteppel . " " You know something ? You 're losing money . You ought to write her up for Reader 's Digest . " " Do n't be churlish , girl . " He rolled over onto one elbowand with his free hand plucked the elastic of her garter belt . " One hour we 'll spend with her . Come ! Tops , an hour and a half . " Myra Mandelbaum blew her nose and told him , " Turn purple . " " She has sour cream . She has pot cheese . " Myra Mandelbaum feigned sleep . " And onion rolls . The Bronx girl loves onion rolls . " " You 're starting again ? " " Onion rolls . " " Once and for all you 're going to learn . I 'm going to teach you a little respect for  --  " " You 'll lick your fingers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She 'll cut up a cucumber . " " Turn blue ! " " Be nice . " And Barnet Weiner began to pet her breast . " Ah-ah-bay-bee . " She slapped away his hand and cried , " Nothing doing . " He groped again for her breast , crooning , " There and there and there . Whose young Jewish intellectual is it ? " " Do n't bother me . " Yet her body was arching , her knees dividing . " Whose ? " " Mine , mine ! Unwillingly . . . . Grudgingly . . . . Mine . " " And who has talent ? And who has promise ? " " You and you . " " And who will do the definitive piece on Lawrence ? " " You and you and you ! " she ground through her teeth . Then gently , almost abstractedly , he entered Myra Mandelbaum , heaving as she heaved , plunging as she plunged , matching thrust with counterthrust . And though he worked in feverish haste , he saved breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only an hour . . . " But before her answer came the phone was ringing and ringing . At the sixth ring Myra Mandelbaum gave in , pulling and tipping over the night table so that the receiverfell neatly into his hand . Before it was even at his ear he made out the idiot voice of Morroe Reiff . " BarnIgotsumbanewsBarn ... " To own a car in Manhattan is like towing a camel across the Sargasso . It is a terrible weight to bear , ap79stupendous obligation , an absolute commitment , a piece of absurdity . No day goes by without unforeseen trouble and hidden expense ; it will give you no rest . You must pay through both nostrils for insurance , maintain a small store of dimes for the meters , walk blocks and blocks to move it before eight in the morning . Vandals will strip your aerials for zip guns , your emblems for belt buckles , cranks and kooks will paint " Jesus Saves " on your windshield , police will find an excuse to ticket on the first and thirtieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will box you in . Snow trucks will lay down special salts to corrode your undercarriage , pit your chrome , dull your finish . In the end the car is a metaphor for man 's fate , the blind unalterable fact against which he rages in vain , the setting of his limits , the definer of all his terms , the objective correlative of the possible ... . Such were the thoughts that battered the spirit of Holly Levine as he darted an uneasy glance out of his window . When he had gathered the nerve he rapped on the glass and gave a lusterless smile to the bunch , the collection , the host of kids perched and prancing atop his frail Volkswagen bumpers . " Hello-oh , " he sang , and " Ah , ah-ha , fellahs . . . . " One , one only took notice , with a look like a swift kick in the testicles . To him , Levine called , " Keep an eye on the car , will you do that , sport ? Okay , paisan ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspiring lightly , his teeth on edge , his ears freezing  --  a trick of nerves , a throwback ( for this plus a recent instance of ejaculation praecox he blamed his analyst 's too-long vacation )  --  Levine paced his den , his study , his writing chamber with slow steps . Then , byp80devious ways  --  tamping down the shavings in his pencil sharpener , giving a just-so twist to his gooseneck lamp , swabbing an ash tray , squirting the lightest of oils into his Olivetti and a few drops of Windex on the plate glass of his desk  --  he regained a measure of repose . He sat , let one more jittery moment pass , and with almost closed eyes picked up a file card and peered at his crabbed writing . Cold Warmeaningfulmeaningful and **25;4862;TOOLONG swarm teem burst with bearthevitalburstof commentary  --  ironic , self-satisfiedOpen Society , Closed TerrainFrom the n of " Terrain " Levine began a spiral , let it rise and rise , halted it , subdivided it , modified it into a lyrical rhomboid enclosing THERMONUCLEAR . From the R of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg , a cradle , a seal butting a ball , the ball enclosing " corruption " and " decline . " Then with a blue pencil he filled in every other letter . Then with a red pencil he filled in the rest of the letters . Then over each i he placed a dot , worked the dots into perfect little circles , and these circles he filled in also with blue and red pencils.  |p81Then  from the lower left corner of his desk he took up a book of paper matches , he twisted off one match and , with utmost delicacy , leaving the head intact and no end frayed or split , peeled it into four parts , and each of these parts he peeled into four more parts . Then , then Levine judged himself ready . So , sighing frequently , his eyes tied to the keys , Levine typed , fitfully typed : Certainly , Professor Gombitz ' essays , gathered together for the first time , yield pleasure of a kind , but a pleasure increasingly tempered by the realization that Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ah , nice , " he muttered aloud , his nostrils palpitatingat the ease , the verve , the easy verve of that " Certainly " as it pushed the sentence along to its little climax . A bit of warmth returned to his ears , and he all but cheered as a wild rush of phrases stormed his mind : " the pressure of impulse ; fierce and abrasive ; polished and supple ; merely to assert ; keened edge ; blunted perception ; living stream ; dry watershed . " He thought , Poor Gombitz , and at once had visions of irony acting on coincidence to throw together the two of them . Between or after classes their heads would collide over water fountains . Their elbows would nastily rub at adjacent urinals , they would identify each other 's shoes under toilet stalls and behind library stacks . By the parking field they would race without quarter for the last spot . Under chapel spires Gombitz would shake a palsied fist , he would thumb his nose . But in afterthought he saw graciousness , mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiveling to face him . He would say , with rueful smile , offering his charm , " I am sorry I did not like your book better . " He would quote Wordsworth : " I have endeavored to look steadily at my subject . " He would quote Goethe : " Against criticism we can neither protect nor defend ourselves ; we must act in despiteof it . . . . " Later , but not much , friendship would flower like a Chinese bloom in a water glass . They would swap scholarlyjournals , talk of herbs , tobacco blends , bird life , compare dissertations , chip in for a hot plate , Earl Grey tea , Scotch shortbread , lighter fluid and flints . His acknowledgement ( " I should like to express my particulargratitude to Dr. Horace Gombitz for his careful readingof a bulky manuscript and for his many cogent questions and observations " ) would blur the old gent 's eyes . In time , in good time , he would inherit first editions of Edith Wharton , a colonial breakfront , two hooked rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clam pie . Certainly , Professor Gombitz ' essays , gathered together for the first time , yield pleasure of a kind .. . All at once Levine was curiously disappointed in that " Certainly . " Chill , detached , bleak and glacial . It expandedwithout being open , absorbed without responding , offered insurgence but no heresy . It was a dim figure in the carpet , a face behind the curtain , a fly trapped in amber . It was a pain in his balls . With hatred of self , then of Gombitz , he sneaked in the " Certainly " between " time " and " yield " ; it made stone of his ears . He would have settled for the spot after " kind , " but the droop of the extra comma fatigued him . Using red pencil he tried : An essay by Gombitz will clearly yield . . . and : Surely , essays such as these must certainly yield .. . Using blue pencil he tried : An essay by Gombitz will surely yield . and : Surely , essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to the refrigerator and tightened all jars , twisted Handi-Wrap around half a tomato , two scallions , a tarnished wedge of Swiss Knight , and with moist toweling wiped a ketchup bottle and a butter dish . Then he went to the stove and with a wire brush painted Easy-Off into the oven and put scouring powder , steel wool and dry paper toweling to the jets and burners . Then he went to the garbage pail and lined the bottom with aluminum foil , and with Scotch tape fixed a plastic bag to the sides . Then he went to the sink and stooped amid the pipes and set up a milk carton that it might be handy for coffeegrounds and grease . Then he went to his bookshelves and at the bottom of the vertically stacked Kenyon Reviews found the oneP84Playboy and , though fighting not to , shook out and inspectedfrom many angles the center fold . Then he sat . Then he took up his match again and peeled four more perfect strips . Then he hummed , hummed and clapped hands to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , " Trilling . . . Leavis . . . Ransom . . . Tate . . . Kazin . . . Chase . . . " and saw them , The Fathers , as though from a vast amphitheater , smiling at him , and he smiled at them . And he typed , with a smoking intensity he typed : Of course , Professor Gombitz ' essays , gathered together for the first timeTaking a relaxed position in his chair , Levine warned himself not to be too pleased . Still , withal , nevertheless , the " Of course " was a piece of the greatest good luck . The linkage , the irremediable coupling of the small syllable and the large  --  Bloom and Dedalus . " Bloom and Dedalus , " he murmured , " Dedalus and Bloom . " It warmed his ears. ... yield pleasure of a kind .. . This was muted yet menacing : mutedly menacing . He was all in favor of letting it be , but nonetheless tried out and was deeply affected by : ... yield a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough no-nonsense mind was at work here , here at work ? Not , certainly not Fendel.  |p85He  would gnash his teeth . Rosner would be displeased . Greenfeld would be enraged to fury . Tabak stunned . Wilner  --  Wilner would positively cholish. ... but a pleasure increasingly tempered .. . Levine drew back , desolated at the thought that he was not , by any means , the first man to use " increasingly tempered . " Fool , plaster saint , whited sepulcher  --  would any know the difference , he asked himself . He gave unequivocal answer : Only you , Levine . And let it stand . He was pacing about , every so often peeping at his Playboy , when he suddenly stiffened and with his every blood cell listened to what drifted up from below : the wild thrashing of many voices , the whoops of mean laughter , the cadence of cheers and razzing , the pummeling , as of bone upon skull , the clank , as of hubcap hitting pavement , the wheeze , the wheeze and sob as of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as far as he dared . His neck craned , his elbows lacerated by the stone ledge , his entrails crowded toward his chest , and choking somewhat , he had the impression that his car was gone . For a few dreadful seconds he debated between one great powerful shriek and a quiet stroke . But then tears of deliverance sprang to his eyes . And he waved and showed a happy face to the troop , the mob , the horde of kids who bounced balls off his doors and fenders , who tried his locks , who tormented his windshield wipers and his side-view mirror . And to him , that one , that mass man , that totalitarianp86type , that momza , Levine said a hearty " Hi , guy " and " That 's the ticket ! " And a moment later , while freshening his bathroom with Air-Wick , Levine gave thought as usual to the idea of a garage or a lot at least . But he was determined to meet and master the city on its own terms , to defend his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit and nerve intact against the inexorable megalopolis . Besides , he did n't want to spend the money. ... is not altogether his own man .. . Once more The Fathers smiled at Levine and Levine smiled at them . And his underlip was still curling , his teeth still bared as he hopped up to silence the phone . His first thought after talking to Morroe Reiff was of annoyance with Leslie ; he must now , now he must go elsewhere for entree to The Naysayer . His second thought was shame for his first thought . Then he poured talcum under the arms of a once-worn sport shirt , whisked clean a lightweight suit , washed with Tide-and-water his desert boots , and dressed . Then he closed and locked all his windows . Then he turned down his refrigerator from five to three . Then he set a fresh paper match on the lower left-hand corner of his desk . Then he made a mental , then a written , note to restorethat first " Certainly . "  |p87FEELING  EMPTY and ill used , Morroe Rieff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watching Jack Delaney 's electric horse leap the neon stiles when a man came reeling through the thick of traffic and sprawled out under the shade of his legs . Almost at once Morroe was flanked by a crowd ; from the benches and the subway stairs people yelled advice or made wisecracks . And though he had little heart and no stomach for it  --  in the office he kept jealous guard over his soap dish  --  Morroe stooped and forced himself to slap the bum 's cheeks , saying , " Get up , there ! Do n't you want to get up ? " To those nearest he grunted , " I 'll tell you , he does n't look so good . Drunk or no drunk . "  |p88The  bum turned his dark swollen face toward Morroe . He gave a gap-toothed grin , he opened his eyes , made a wild effort to focus and shut them with a huge sigh . A thin stream crawled along the cheap stuff of his pants and down his broken shoes , widening out along the curb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'll open his collar . See , notice how it 's choking him . . . . " Morroe spoke clearly , quietly , with an impressive air of competence . He called to someone to fetch him a newspaper , and when it came he cushioned it neatly under the bum 's head . Then a cop came forward , laying hands on shoulders and elbows and thrusting roughly . " Come on , come on , " he chanted , " let 's go , folks , let 's take a walk . " He scowled , he threw out a " Jeez " and a " Crap , " he nursed the tip of his club . Yet he did not seem to mind that only a few drew back . " Up , up , " he ordered the bum , playingto the crowd . " We 're going to make it . We can do it . For me , little buddy . Try for me . " And he squatted on huge haunches , turning toward the gapers his hearty beefeater 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . " Say , how about an ambulance ? " Morroe spoke up , straining forward . " Maybe he 's an epileptic . Maybe he 's in a coma . You ca n't be sure . " But the cop only gave him a sideways look , putting him on notice that it would be dangerous to interfere , and Morroe concealed his annoyance . Now the bum coughed and heaved and jerked and cried like a patient who has become immune to anesthesia . He nestled against the curb , so that the cop , to getp89at him , went on all fours , crouching until their heads almosttouched . " Friend , hey , friend , do n't make me get rough-rough , " he pleaded , thumbing back one of the bum 's lids and engaging the lusterless eye . " What have you got against me ? Do n't you like me ? I like you . Hey , little angel , hey , sleeping beauty . " Next he grabbed and hauled , holding up all the while one macelike fist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grating , provocative pity . " I like you . Honest to God , I 'm trying to give you a break . Only you got to give me a break , little friend . I 'm your pal , you be my pal . " " Mommy ! " the bum squealed . Whereupon the cop , wasting no more time , gave his jaw a good bang against the curb . Then he clamped a hand like an electrode on the top of his head and raised him by the short hairs . " Now , button your fly , " the cop instructed , shaking his club at the dark gap . The bum burst into tears . " This minute , Bumhead . " Lacing fingers , the bum made a fig leaf . " You want valet service ? " said the cop . He stamped his foot twice , as though scaring off a dog , and moved in fast upon the snarled zipper . Then the bum let out a high , soulless , unreasoning roar . He kicked , he spat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skimpy arm came down upon the neck of the cop . Who seemed to gasp , not at the blow so much as the idea of the blow . He turned toward Morroe and whispered despairingly , " Son of a bitch . . . You got to be a son of a bitch . . . . "  |p90He  grabbed the bum by the waistband of his loose drawers as with the other hand he cracked him across the face . They wrestled furiously for a moment , till the cop , using his bulk , carried him forward to the ground , trappinghis head and punishing him neatly over the kidneys . When the bum was thus quieted and made mild the cop took him by the hair , jerking his head back on his neck , then bowing his back , then bringing him up . And for no good reason dealt out a backhanded slap that opened up the bum 's lip , saying , " Wait , little friend , I 'll show you what my good arm can do . " From the buzzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , in a mild piping voice . " You 've made your point . He had enough . Enough already . " " Take a walk , " the cop told him , gripping Morroe 's shoulder and applying pressure with a fat thumb . " Not with the hands , " said Morroe , reeling back . " Not ... with . . . the . . . hands ! " He squared himself , resolute and ready , then and there vowing to join a gym , to work out at least twice a week with medicine balls and weights . But the cop was already crossing the street , steering the bum toward a chainedoffsubway entrance . " Know what he 'll do ? " Morroe met the slitted eyes of a dark Mafia type who seemed to speak out of some secret knowledge . " He 's not going to no fuckin station house . He 's gon na give him a Chicago rubdown . Ribs , gut and dick . " Imagining how this would be  --  the cop doing his cop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones would give like a cheap pencil  --  Morroe 's heart picked upp91a rough beat and a light of hatred entered his eyes . He said , " I want to see that . I want to see him just try . " With a crazy rush he started into the street and after the cop . " One minute " he cried huskily . The cop stood still and studied Morroe silently . Then , pinning the bum to his side , he started to walk off . " I said wait a minute . . . . " Morroe circled the cop and moved his shoulders up and down like a wrestler . " What 's happening ? You 're bringing him in , preferring charges ? Or what ? I mean ... " " Take a walk , Charley . " " I 'm talking to you , officer . " " You gon na get the hell away from me ? Because I do n't give a shit . You 're wise , I take ya in . For blocking traffic . " " Do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting so tough ? You want , take me in . I 'll have a thing or two to say to your superiors . " If he forces it , Morroe thought , I 'll put up a fight . But shame was bluntingthe pure edge of his hatred , and he began to regret that he had not hit out blindly before , when hands had first been laid upon him . " Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , " the cop chanted . " Come on , four eyes ; walk away , four-eyed jerk . " And he hefted his club delicately and blew at the tip . " Somebody , I want somebody to give me a pencil , " said Morroe , casting a glance behind him . " I 'm going to make sure about his number , I 'm going to mark it down . " The crowd drew a few steps nearer ; a bald , stocky man , cautious and worried , flung Morroe a stub , saying , " You can keep it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the cop had a hand over his badge . " I want that number . Let me have that number ! " Morroedemanded , searching his pockets for paper and bringingforth an ill-used snip of dental floss and two salt tablets . The cop laughed , as if at the greatest of jokes . And Morroe hoarsely declared , " There was a four and a two on your badge . The rest I 'll check  --  do n't you worry . This is not . . . " He was going to say something like " Hitler 's Germany , " but held back and finished off with " . . . a police state . " " Goombye , comrade , " the cop grunted , pressing a palm against the bum 's back and moving him inexorably toward the subway stairs . " Take a good look . . . . Our defenders . . . guardians ... one of the finest . . . " Still more ferocious phrases rang with a nice ring in Morroe 's mind , but the cop was already beyond hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of physical violence ( how dangerous is the human being , how a touch or a jostle , a look or a word brings him down with the lowest of the low , the meanest of the mean ) , Morroe resumed his post among the pigeons . Two kids passed him , sucking cups of grainy ices . Looking around , he saw a runty Italian wheel his cart near the fountain and dip a scoop into the water that ran sluggish and with a smoky glint . In no time a line had formed , and Morroe joined it . " Lemon , " he called out , frowning , " you got any , or pineapple ? " And he pressed closer , to see for himself . As he did so he was elbowed aside , and a man said , " You got a line here , where you shtupping ? " " Excuse me , " Morroe haughtilyp93replied , not bothering to turn . Then he heard the man come out with something like " These Yidlach ! " Despite this , Morroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his jacket was lifted and he got a stingingpinch on the behind . Wheeling swiftly , he clutched at an arm . And , with a wild pipe of glee , saw Barnet Weiner . " Hey ! " cried Weiner , " People 's Hero . Shtarke . Benya Krik . " " Then you saw ? Whoosh , I 'll tell you something , I  --  " " He would have rendered you like a chicken . " A trifle sullenly , Morroe said , " Maybe . He had the height and weight on me , of course . But I used to put on the gloves at City . I can handle myself . " " Maronne ! " And Weiner spanned Morroe 's biceps with mock reverence . " Whoosh , stop , come on , nut ! " Morroe began to grin . " Hey , ices . How about some ices ? " " So you are buying ? " " I 'm buying , I 'm buying . " " So I am having . " " Two large lemon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cups so as to leave plenty of air at the bottom . The stuff was second-rate , oversweetened , but he welcomed it after that spicy breakfast . " Eat , eat , " Weiner urged , as they headed toward a bench . " It costs enough blood . " Then , with a chiding gentleness , " How is it you never called back ? I waited and waited , only the phone booth was getting crowded . " " Sure , get away . My big friend , my ass-hole buddy . Who called last ? Remember ? You were going to come ,  |p94we  were going to prepare  --  chopped liver , sour tomatoes , big fat specials . Sure , and you 're still coming . " Oh , you two-faced hypocrite ! You crap artist ! You phony baloney ! Morroe reviled himself , even as he worked Weiner over . Who wanted him ? Who needed his visit ? To suffer his shafts at the lobby , the carpeting , the teakwood stools and the marble-top coffee table ? God bless him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about him . But from a distance . They found a shady spot commanding Seventh Avenue , where they could keep their eyes open for Ottensteen and Levine . From time to time Morroe studied his watch or went to the corner and scanned all approaches ; not a sign of them . " We should have been halfway there already , " he told Weiner , who was concentrating only on the ices , his tongue systematically burrowing into the crevices of the torn cup . Whoosh , thought Morroe . Look , look at him shlubb away ! Eyes bulging , spittle flying ! Go figure him out . You read his prose and you think you 're in the presence of absolute intellect . Inverted and ironic , finicky and fastidious . He did articles on modern dance , he used to correspond with Gide in French and call him Cher Maitre , and I 'm not positive but I think once or twice he wrote the Art Letter for Horizon . Only to look at him  --  pure bulvan . He was on the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weiner seized his jacket , crying , " Quick , quick ! The one on the left ! " Two girls flashed by , high-breasted brats , white and pink and tender.  | " That little tochiss . I could bite into it like a piece of hot pastrami . " Making no answer , Morroe deliberately fixed his eyes elsewhere . Weiner continued his rapturous ogling till the pair were out of sight . Then , pulling himself erect , in a suddenchange of mood , he raised a clawed hand , as though against fate . Somehow , to Morroe , at least , the wrinkles between his eyes and under his closely shaven neck seemed ludicrous ; he looked like a Baby Leroy ambushed suddenly by middle age . At last Weiner said , " Gaah ! " And Morroe answered , " Whoosh ! " " It still does n't register . Leslie dead ; it 's like a Jewish joke . Any minute I expect him to come schlumping along . You know how he used to walk . . . a little bubbe loaded down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him perfect , " Morroe cried wonderingly . " A bubbe . . . Like he 's going to offer you a glass of tea or a lox wing , maybe . " Weiner laughed and laughed and fell into a fit of coughing . He sighed , wet his lips . And then , strangely deadpan and formal , said , " Tell me . When you called .. . before . I was n't clear . Gaah , where were you exactly ? " Perplexed , Morroe frowned and looked away . He finally said , " Inez . Where else ? I 'm positive I mentioned it . Though , of course , by the time I called you I did n't know whether I was coming or going , I could have  --  " " Speak up , boy ! I 've been meaning to discuss with you that morbid City College whine . "  | " Inez , Inez , Inez ! " Morroe twisted around and shouted into Weiner 's ear . " And I 'm sorry if my education was n't fashionable enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for me . I deserve it . It 's coming to me , " Weiner gave out in rich singsong . " BecauseI took you into the group . Because I raised you from a middlebrow . Because I gave you your first copy of Partisan Review . Because I weaned you away from the art films , showed you the difference between the Western as mass myth and mass rite . " He was smiting his chest . " You know .. . " Morroe floundered for the proper pitch of righteousness . " There 's a time and a place for that crap . You 're not sitting across a cafeteria table . " With a " Shah ! " and a " Shush ! " Weiner forestalled argument , saying , " When you 're right you 're right . Only  --  " And he fell into an attitude of deep brooding . "  --  I 'm a little surprised . I did n't realize you were with Inez . " " So ? " Weiner gave no sign he had heard . " So ? Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he said , " In other words she gets the news and right off the bat she contactsyou .... " " Right , right . Therefore . . . " " Therefore nothing . Therefore she shlepps you from all the way uptown when I live  --  what ?  --  three and a half blocks from her . That 's all . " What is he so sore about , Morroe wanted to know . BecauseInez called me first ? Well , he could have had that honor . With the greatest pleasure . The way he fumes andp97pouts . Really , I let him get away with murder . Saying he , he brought me into the group . That remark I absolutelyshould have taken him up on . But he answered very mildly , " You ought to know Inez by now . " Weiner let out an affirmative " Gaah ! " " Does anything ever come easy to Inez Braverman ? " he continued . " Are things ever simple for her ? She could be going downstairs to the A and P and before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In darkest Africa . Why ? To get in touch with the old woman who used to do her windows . " " Ye gods ! " Weiner cried , almost with a sob . " Look , listen who 's telling me about Inez . He 's telling me ! You think she 's something now ? Hoo-hah , then you should have been in the group when they were living on Leroy Street . " " When I met Leslie they had just moved . Just ! " " In which case , " Weiner pounced , " you must surely remember Kaplan ? " Morroe bowed his head . Then Weiner 's hands flew up in an epic gesture and he stamped his legs and blinked his hot dry eyes . " The whole world has dogs , " he crowed . " Big and small , cute and ugly . After all , what can you say about a dog ? Four legs , a head , a tail and a wee-wee maker . Right ? But you 're dealing with Inez . And Inez goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is a moron for the little girls . Who has been carried off in a paddy wagon as a consequence of once , or once too often , playing doctor with Zelda , nine years going on ten . Whose dog re/mains yet in the cellar , taking food from no man 's hand , making outcry by night and by day . Meanwhile , what do I know ? I 'm going up to their place . Innocent , open . I have just sold a little piece , I feel like celebrating and so I am bringing a salami from Schmulka Bernstein . I ring . I hear a Come in . ' I open the door . I start walking through the foyer . When it is upon me . Made crazy by the salami smell . Drooling all his juices over my socks . Clamping paws over my knee and rubbing away like a subway queer . It , it ! The abomination ! Kaplan ! " " Who names a dog Kaplan ? " said Morroe , fighting down a surge of despair as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know . You should recall it . " Weiner 's voice was kittenish , but by the arch of his brows and the span of his mouth he seemed to announce how much longer and deeper ran his memory of the Bravermans . " Leslie 's parable . Marcus Is Always Willing . ' About the Jewish intellectual who goes to the Midwestso he should feel alienated . Where he has this line : It may well be that God is listed in the telephone directoryunder the name of Kaplan . ' " " I read it . It just so happens , " said Morroe , a shade roughly . " You do n't want significant detail ? By you is the qualityof experience strictly nix ? Very good . Anyway-y-y  --  " Weiner stretched the word as with a shredding tissue he wiped his mouth , his neck and each stubby finger  --  " anyway , Kaplan was the single most disgusting thing I have ever seen in my life . And I throw in , for good measure , Tessie Lepinsky , the crazy girl on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen custard wentp99under the Steeplechase Pier with me two months after my fifteenth year to heaven . Picture ! Part spitz and part spaniel . With a nose like George Arliss . With a bark that could chill mother 's milk and grow hair on palms . Also , you think you could just open a can for him ? Bald . For Kaplan , it was nothing less than boiled spring chicken . Pullet he would n't go near . Let it be summer , the middle of the afternoon . Leslie is finished with his classes , it 's a nice day , he 's feeling lebedig . A good time to knock off a quickie , no ? Zip-zip , he 's in bed with Inez . Hutz-hutz , she 's mounting the pillows . When all of a sudden there is a yap and a yip . Kaplan is climbing in between them . He is lying on his back . He is wriggling his dwarfish legs and his tongue is going like a metronome . Nor will all their blows and buffets budge him . Gaah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gets worse and worse . Every time they want to make whoopee he sets up a scream and a holler . He snarls , he shows his teeth to Leslie . He chews up his books . All right , let time pass . Calendar leaves exfoliating . Pilar has been born , an easy delivery . Leslie is taking Inez home from the hospital . Kaplan is waiting by the door . He looks up , he sets eyes upon Leslie 's tender little bundle . And his spirit gives out . Slow , grieved , majestic , he takes one last leak on Leslie 's jockey shorts , he toils up the stairs , he 's on the roof . And without a farewell , lets himself tumble the five and a half flights . " Then Morroe whistled and laughed immoderately . " Are you finished ? " he said . " Or you 're planning sequels ? Bride of Kaplan ? Feigenbaum , Son of Kaplan ? " " Maybe I embellished , " Weiner conceded . " Thep100chicken  --  okay , so you could fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't swear he went all the way up to the roof . But for the rest  --  " he actually crossed his heart  --  " may I forget my grounding in the New Criticism . May my landlord install an inside john and demand a professionallease .... " " Meanwhile , " cried Morroe , jumping to his feet , " it gets later and later and we sit here like dummies . What do you say I call Holly and you call Ottensteen ? " " First of all , " Weiner told him , bowing his head and assuming a mild rabbinical manner , " it stands to reason they 've started out already . Therefore it follows we wo n't reach them . And then , let 's say we leave here , we go to call them and , ut-ut-ut , the second we 're dialing is the second they arrive . " " I 'm going to take one more look . One more ... " And this time Morroe darted into the center of Seventh Avenue , peering into the fiery mouth of midtown till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he returned to the bench Weiner was proffering another cup of ices . He waved it away with a " Whoosh ! " To which Weiner made reply : " Gaah ! " " Forty-one . When you think of it . . . " " It fits in with everything else . From all sides we 're getting it . " " True , that is so true . " " And wherever you look they 're taking over . You know what I mean ? " " I know . Oh boy , do I know , " Morroe responded with all his might.  | " The middlebrows . The fats . With their grants and their fellowships . " " Do n't knock them for that , " Morroe reprimanded . " Leslie got his share . " " All right . Except there was a difference . He was no tsatskeleh , Leslie , he was in certain respects far from being trustworthy  --  and some other time I 'll tell you a little thing he pulled on me  --  but he had . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Weiner spoke with a gentle glow in his eyes . " He did n't want it , he did n't ask for it . But he had it . The way some people have B.O. " " Two days he could spend over a sentence . " " Because he had such respect for the printed word . Unbelievable . A guy who must have published  --  gaah !  --  an easy two hundred pieces in his time . And he 'd have a conniption , a nervous stomach , every time a set of galleyscame in the mail . " " So ? So what did it get him ? " Significantly , Morroe patted himself on the chest . On the left side . " All alone  --  that 's what I ca n't get over . A guy who could call up six people when he wanted to take in a movie . " " Is n't that funny ? You should mention movies . It happensLeslie was the only person I would go with . Bad movies , especially . And always in the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into the screen . " Weiner paused , then turned and pressed upon Morroe 's knee . " They 're after us , boichick , they 're after us . " And Morroe with a heartening rush of feeling , nodded and nodded , and thought , " He 's one of my own kind.  |p102We  're on the same wave length . He and the boys . I forgetsometimes. " 7'o Weiner , he said , " Soon . . . when this is over .. . Etta and I were talking . We 'll have a party . All the boys . Everyone . A real wild night . " And he would perhaps have said more if , at that moment , they had not spotted Holly Levine cutting a dangerouscurve around a bus . " Hey vaglio ! " screamed Weiner , while Morroe beckoned and waved . But Holly , intent on the business of parking , took no notice.  | " KEEP GOING . . . . That 's good . . . . Back . . . Back .. . More ... More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now cut sharp ! " There was the buffet and clash of bumper against bumper . " Any more orders ? " said Levine , clasping hands over the wheel and turning upon them a look of barbarous abuse . " Did n't I tell you cut ? " Weiner poked at Morroe . " What did I say ? " Morroe waved him off , and in a voice smothered by hoarseness said , " In case you do n't know , we 're waiting and waiting and waiting . Where the hell were you ? "  |p104But  Levine was paying no attention . As if in prayer , he lowered his head , fumbled with the gear stick and shot halfway into the street . Then back and back he inched the car , chanting like a muezzin over the infernalengine grind , " Slow and slow and slow yet and fine fine okay you 're okay fine and in . IN ! " " A classic parallel park , " he informed them gravely . " A m'chyah , " Weiner cried . " If you could write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Morroe and the door , saying , " Gaah , let me sit with Holly , okay ? Since I was a kid . . . carsick . . . They had to take along a vomit bag for me . " " You can sit , you can sit , " Morroe told him , gesturingexpansively . Climbing into the back , though , with the sealed windows and the baking upholstery , his stomach lurched . Every part of the car seemed to press in and weigh upon him , and he was half-maddened by the lack of air . Soon his handkerchief was too wet to deal with his face any longer . He said , " A little room . Please , ca n't you make a little room ? A person can die here . " " Certainly , certainly . " And Levine began to pull and probe under his seat . " Good gosh , " he chortled , " there are fourteen  --  fourteen !  --  different ways to adjust these seats . Tilt and rake . In addition to which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal boat . " He made a final elaborate adjustment . " There . There we are . Cross your legs . See , see ? No banging of the knees . And support , true support from these springs . " " Not bad , " said Morroe , feeling as far from comfort as he was from the equator.  | " And now . . . now . . . " Levine clapped hands lightly , " now let 's have , engage in , some good conversation . Make significant dialogue ! " He winked broadly at Morroe . " How have you been ? And how is . . . your wife ? " " Etta ? Oh , Etta 's fine , fine . " Jerk , pompous jerk ! Morroeinwardly called him . What 's the matter , you ca n't remember her name ? It escapes you ? You should choke on every dinner she ever fed you . Retroactively . He groped for something subtle and infinitely malicious to say . But by the time he had dredged the past and seized upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll drive you home "  --  Weiner had begun to pinch Levine'scheek and grab at his shiny black hair . " Look , take a look at him ! " Weiner groaned . " You pascudnyak , lose a few hairs already , get a day older ! " Pleased and a little incredulous , Levine pulled away . " Honest to God ! " Weiner patted and patted his own few hairs . " It 's unbelievable . With that dimple yet . The truth , tell the truth , does n't he remind you a little bit of Vidal ? " " Vidal ? " Morroe pretended to peer closely at Levine . " Yeah , yeah . . . definitely . . . Izzy Vidal . . . his father used to have the chicken-plucking concession at the EssexStreet Market . " " Or Tony Curtis , " Weiner persisted . " An avant-garde Tony Curtis . " With a benevolent chuckle Levine said , " Well , now , since you speak of , mention , the avant-garde , I shall pass on a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though allowing them time to take notes . " You are ,  |p106ah  , aware , gentlemen , that for some fifteen months Portent has been hunting , seeking an , editor . " Weiner 's nostrils grew wider . And Morroe snapped , " We 're aware , we 're aware . " " Very well , then , " said Levine , slowly stroking his ears . " Now , please bear in mind the fact that thirty-two , yes , gentlemen , thirty-two top names were considered . My own among them . It would seem , however , that someone  --  and , ah , let him be nameless  --  someone on the publications committee had the impression I was a wee , wee bit too partial to Leavis . It goes , of course , without saying that Leslie was out of the question . Unreliable , not quite the hearth-and-home type . The same reason you "  --  he indicated Weiner  --  " were turned down . Coupled with your rather . . . spotty list of publicationsduring recent years . " " So who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give a hint ! " " It would do no good , " said Levine firmly . " I have the greatest respect for your wit , your essential grasp of the absurd , but  --  " " Shah , shah ! " cried Weiner , and " Gaah , gaah ! An idea is coming , a picture , a picture is forming . " He halfraisedhimself in his seat , then sank down again . " No and no and no ! I would say it , I would utter the name , only I 'm afraid it would mean the final refutation of God 's existence . " Giggling , Levine beat a little tattoo on the horn . " Brrr ! " said Weiner , doubling up and hugging his belly . From his mouth there issued burps and growls and a high lyric wheeze . Then , in another voice , a voicep107strangely high and uncertain : " B-b-b-but Leslie . . . the p-p-plight of the Am-muh-muh-rican intellec-ch-ch-ch-ual . . . does n't it g-get you sometimes ? In the d-d-dark night of the s-s-soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Him not ! " Morroe reared back and stamped his feet like a frightened horse . " None other , " Levine affirmed . " Bruce Siskind . And may I say , Barn , " he added in a dry lecturer 's tone , " that in acuteness and perception , in inflection and pitch , you have surpassed even your take-off on me last New Year 's Eve . " " Vei ! Vei-vei-vei , I 'm sick ! " Weiner hollered . " Bruce Siskind ! Remember what we used to call him ? The name Leslie , alev hasholem , gave him ? " " La Pasionara ! " Morroe screamed out . Clearing his throat , Levine announced , " He has asked me for a piece . Well , not a piece exactly . More an omnibusreview of some Nathanael West-iana . Now , I am momentarily , at the moment , overcommitted , but you , Barn , you ... " " Gaah , gaah ! " Bugging his eyes and slowly passing a stiff hand along the length of his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should give him the satisfaction of calling ? So he should play big-shot editor with me ? He can cock so ! " And he broke into hacking and sputtering . " Furthermore , I once . . . it was n't nice , even I have to admit . . . but I could n't resist . You wan na hear ? " Levine cackled . Morroe whinnied . " Well , I 'm coming home from my mother 's houseP108you remember when she broke her hip  --  and from shoppingand straightening and up and down the stairs with bundles , I am pooped . So instead of the express I grab a local , and even then I barely get a seat . One station goes by , two stations , three stations , and I 'm beginning to get this feeling . Like I 'm in the presence of evil . Sure enough , I begin to hear , from right behind , that terrible , unmistakable Siskind laugh . Choopie-bar-choopie ! ' I give a look and he 's sitting there , like a Modern Library Giant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it going , Brucie ? " Oh , ' he tells me , I am doing a piece on Melville . ' And without a what 's doing , what 's new , how 's your mother , he immediately gives me the lowdown on how what 's all along been fucking up Melville criticism is that nobody knows anything about fishing . Then he offers me a Chiclet . One Chiclet . He says , Do you know , chaver , I have n't chortle-chortle , choopie-bar-choopie , gotten or been laid in nearly three months ? ' Then  --  God forgive me , but he was begging for it  --  he starts telling me how tough it is for him to break in another nookie , how he 's tired of having to make up reading lists for them and giving out all kinds basic instruction in literature and art and on what really went wrong with the Bolshevik Revolution . All in all he 's irritating me , he 's working on my nerves . First I figure  --  gaah !  --  I 'll kid him along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somethingmarvelous and mysterious happens . Brucie , ' I say , I have someone definitely in mind . Except I got ta know  --  you like big tsitskies ?

It takes him from Eastern Parkway to Brooklyn Bridge to cover just the destruction of the Temple . Then I order him to make a muscle . She 'll like you , ' I tell him . Especially those pectorals . ' And I really start in . Mind you , from one word to the next I 'm not sure I 'm making sense . Also I feel mean , low , contemptible . Only I ca n't stop . Like when you start eating polly seeds . Lie upon lie . I invent a girl . Shoshana Shunra , by name . A special agent for the Israeli secret service whose mission is to kidnap Bernard Baruch , David Sarnoff and maybe Jacob Blaustein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy Poland and that way , that way , get a foothold in Eastern Europe . I warn him , though . How he will be dealing here with a very tough cookie . How during the Sinai campaign she beat two Egyptians to death with a Mogen David she herself welded together from a pair of captured gasoline drums . And I 'll tell you something else : the more he doubted , the more I believed . Why , when he cocked an eyebrow at a little detail  --  I claimed she had a Turkish lover who taught her the secret of unendurable pleasure indefinitely prolonged  --  I got up from the seat and I was ready to walk away then and there . Till he apologized . Wheedling and groveling . No , no , please , Barney , he did n't even want to see the snapshotI made believe I had . I finish up with her generosity . After all , did n't Ben Gurion himself hand her a blank check , she should have what to hire a couple gunsels ?

Onlyp110it belongs to Fat Gittel , my appetizing-store lady . Then a week passes and the whole thing has left my mind . Till , suddenly , three , four in the morning one day , the phone rings . I pick it up . Am I crazy ? Because it seems to me the party on the other end is saying C-c-c-carp . ' Followed by W-w-w-whitefish . . . sturgeon . . . **26;4889;TOOLONG . ' Then a snatch of Hatikvah . ' And when I start to bang down the receiver it comes floating , gaah , vile , vicious and vulgar over the ether . Choopiebar-choopie ... Choopie-bar-choopie . ' " " Oh , God ! Oh , God ! " Levine seemed to gather all his energies for the assault of laughter which spun him , weeping and shrieking , into Weiner 's lap . " W-w-w-whitefish ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Morroe , after looking at his watch , cried , " Choopie-bar-choopie ! Choopie-bar-choopie ! " " You have ruined me , " whimpered Levine . " Ho-ho ! I have a pain over , in the area of , my liver . Ha-ha ! W-ww-whitefish ! " Teeth set in a sadist 's grin , Weiner said , " C-c-c-carp ! " Too spent to laugh , they sprawled in their seats like sunbathers . Till Weiner , the first to come to himself , flipped out a " What else is new ? " " There is a possibility . . . " Levine pressed his right side and blew a tormented breath , " . . . well , a strong likelihood , that I shall be giving a popular culture course this fall . From Little Nemo ' to Li'l Abner . ' " A stir of unbelief went through Weiner . " Something wrong , Barn ? " said Levine , with a suddenp111tightening of his lips . " You are , ah , perhaps , displeased , old sport ? " " I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Except . . . " He scratched behind one of Levine 's ears . " Gaah , I do n't know . Is that for you ? Is it , like they say in the quarterlies , your metier ? " His color deepening , Levine answered , " My piece on John Ford has been twice anthologized . Twice ! " " Granted , granted . Your grasp of the gap between low-middle and high-middle culture  --  perfect . Your cinematicdepth analysis  --  I do n't think I would want better . But when it comes to comic strips and such  --  unh , unh , man , you doan know shit ! " And Weiner shook his head in the slow mournful rhythm of an old darkie . Levine pursed his lips , as though sucking through a straw . " Maybe I 'm wrong , " Weiner placated . " Maybe I am being less than fair . In which case , answer me this : Who used to say , in moments of Angst , Golly Moses , I got the whim whams all over ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Levine looked around as if for applause . " Don Winslow of the Navy  --  his rank ! " " Commander ! " " Now the nemesis of Bim Gump ! " " Wait , wait ! She wore a veil . . . she would always drug him . . . MADAM ZENDA ! " " And the protectors of Daddy Warbucks ? " " Punjab , " Levine said , delightedly . " Punjab and the Asp. "  | " The Rinkeydinks , " Weiner came back , relentless . " Who and from where ? " " From Winnie Winkle . ' The club . And there was Perry , the little brother . And there was Spud . . . . There was Chink . . . . " " And who else ? " " That 's all . " " That 's all ?

" Weiner mumbled , squashed and submissive . Beaming , Levine braced himself . " I . . . want . . . the . . . name . . . the name of .. . THE GREEN HORNET 'S DRIVER ! " Quietly , without fanfare , Levine answered , " Kato . " Then , drawing Levine 's head down and dragging it from side to side , Weiner murmured , " Ah leben uff der kepele !

Ever shall our team be champions , Known throughout the land ! Rah rah boola boola boola boola ! Boola boola boola boo rah rah rah ! Have you tried Wheaties ?

" Levine chanted foolishly . " Felix-el , Felix-el , what 's doing and what 's new ? " cried Morroe in a rush of good feeling . " You really want to know ? " Ottensteen said , telling him with a frown that he would not be happy with the reply . Morroe gave a submissive shrug . " Because what 's doing is that you 're a big yolt . What 's new  --  what 's new is you sent der alte Ottensteen on a fool 's errand to Washington Square Park , where , on his sick feet , he had to stand for thirty-three minutes by the clock until he realized he 's dealing with a party that has very few brains and no common sense . That 's all . Period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square Park ? " Morroe trumpeted . " A mistake , " Weiner said . " It happens . " " What then ? " demanded Morroe , consumed with the injustice . " Naturally , naturally . . . the tension of the moment ... the bearing of bad news . . . " Levine was all moderationand easy affability . " And now let 's give Felix room . Let 's make him comfy-cozy and let us get started . " In a broken voice Ottensteen said , " Do n't put yourself out , please . For der alte Ottensteen you 're not going to have to bother . " " Gaah , Felix ! Felix , gaah ! " Weiner grabbed Ottensteen'sarm and drew him half in through the window . " Honestly , I am surprised and ashamed . " " You 're surprised ? " With both fists Ottensteen knocked away Weiner 's hand . " You do n't need to bep115surprised . And when it comes to shame  --  der alte Ottensteenis n't ashamed . Der alte Ottensteen is a simple , simple person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how to hate . Thusly , when a Sholem Asch turns M'shimid and no-good bastard , he do n't talk to Sholem Asch . And if the Germans kill six million of his people  --  his people  --  he do n't ride in German automobiles . " " On the face of it , " interposed Levine , " flawless logic . And yet . . . " He pretended to puzzle over the point . Ottensteen peered at him as though through frosted glass . He said , at length , " There is an old , a very old saying : Who is a hero ? He who keeps down a wisecrack . ' " He wheeled and strode away , his pants bellying at the knees , his feet , in the high orthopedic shoes , turningout . " Shema Yisroel , " said Weiner . " Let him go , " said Levine . " Whoosh , please , call him back , " Morroe exhorted them . " Aw , look , he 's older , he 's been sick . Call him back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sick , sick ! " Weiner answered him coldly . " He 'll outlast all things , all systems . He 'll  --  " But Levine had already started the car , working wheel and gear stick in abrupt jerky movements , racing for the corner and jumping the light to scrape the curb alongside of Ottensteen . Who played dumb at the insistentcroaking of the horn . " Felix ! Yay . . . y . . . y ! Ottensteen . . . n . . . n ! " With the last air in his lungs Morroe cried into the confusionof the street.  |p116Cu|p|ping  his ear , Ottensteen went through an elaborate pantomime of looking and listening for the voice . " For Leslie . Is it nice for Leslie ? It 's not nice ! " Slow , stooped , as though hindered by underbrush , Ottensteen trod to the car . He said , " Only for Leslie . " " Only for Leslie ! " Then they moved and maneuvered and half-lifted Ottensteen into the car . " A wonderful little automobile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they used here only the finest human skins . The finest ! " " Felix , Felix , " Morroe scolded mildly . " Yoishe . " " No more , " promised Ottensteen . " No more . Leslie already it ca n't help . " " Does anybody else feel hungry ? " Weiner asked plaintively . " I had almost no breakfast . " Before they could reply Levine had broken into a fit of giggling . " Hoo-hah , " he gasped . " I ca n't stop it . Help me . . . . Aidez-moi ! Oh , choopie-bar-choopie , choopie-bar-choopie ! "  |p117As  THEY CLIMBED THE BRIDGE to Brooklyn a train groundby with steel sounds , throwing grit and sparks . On the upgrade it labored , lagged , fell behind , and when they drew even Morroe saw a man raise a hand in silent greeting . He touched his forehead stealthily , holding the salute till his gaze was drawn elsewhere . To a face that somehowmade him feel his heartbeat in his teeth and enraged him to fury . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , after a short tormented time , it occurred to him . The complexion , the beefiness , the look of command . And the way the fellow reclined , spreading over more than his share of seat . Why , put a badge and ap118gun on him and you 'd have that cop from before , so free and easy with his hands ! And in this state Morroe saw other resemblances . As though , say , a half-dozen faces were allotted to each man 's life , and these , suffering only the changes of race and style and tribe , follow him through every place and condition . So never mind if that little gent by the window wore a hearing aid and a pince-nez ; give or take a feature , this was his father . Two cars down his Uncle Lazar opened and closed a small carton . And gross and mountainous in a housedress , Etta laughed at someone beyond his vision . While Landau , his boss , held a thermos jug and beach toys and danced a little girl on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what a butterball , what a set of healthy cheeks on her ! She waved , or seemed to wave at Morroe , and showed off her little play suit . Melting , he clapped hands at her , banged the window , made funny faces . For which he drew the wrath of Ottensteen . " Stop the jiggling , " he was told . " You do n't sit still for one second , you 're getting me dizzy . " Swaying and swaying on the wire-mesh surface , with the wind beating like wings on the sun-roof folds , they made the descent to Brooklyn . Where Morroe got the momentary notion that the sun was hidden , the air a good ten degrees cooler . So a fish must feel , he thought , as it leaves its native water . They passed a movie house . Posters from his father 's time . The marquee flashing only half its bulbs . Then a Spanish grocery , with green bananas . Then gypsies , mocking and mimicking behind a storefront . Then a block of sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Under an el they turned against four-way traffic , punishing the tires . And again a turn . Into a country of churches . Minarets and cupolas . Angel armies over the doors , and every kind of Christ . The little shepherd smiling with prissy mouth . The athlete , powerfully muscled , trained for the burden of the cross . The Negro-headed , with his crown of thorns like a sharpy bowler . The wise-guy son , cool to his Mother Mary . The anatomist 's cadaver , eviscerated , drained . And left and right , what cemeteries ! The bitter green pallor of the trees . The birds , like clusters of fruit , weighing them down . The gates and the padlocks upon them enormous , as though to keep the dead within . Now sickly pink housing projects . Brand-new , still with ground to be filled in . But already , bedding on the terraces , beach chairs , strollers and shopping carts blightingthe lawns . Now the Cantonese Gardens . Even at this hour , a line outside , three deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Dairy , now Congregation Agudah Anshri of Flatbush . Now the Byzantine archway of Maidstone Arms , thirty minutes ( 30 ) , from Manhattan , convenient to all subways and shopping , still chce. three and threeand-a-halfroom apts. , gas included . Now hedgelocked one- and two-family houses . Lethargic sprinklers . Kids gumming zwieback in wading pools . A profusion of nameplates . M. Bardash , Dental Surgeon . J. Willis Grunebaum , Podiatrist . Gilbert Frankenthal , M.D. , Hrs. 9-11 , 3-5 . Patents , Contracts , Eugene Himmel  --  Att'y at Law . By appointment only , Dr. Milton Lee Margolin . Suddenly Weiner , in throbbing sepulchral tones , de/claimed , " Who knoweth Brooklyn ? Stranger , oh , stranger , I answer you . I will answer you that only the hungryheartedmanswarm , the dreamers of dry dreams in the wind-spanned womblocked avenues called Pitkin and Church and Neptune and Ocean and Blake and Rogers and Tilden  --  " Then his eyes flickered and he smiled wanly . " Gaah , you know what ? " " What ? " they cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that instead of turning off FlatbushAvenue Extension , we would have done better going straight and through the park , where , I think , somehow , somehow , you can pick up Ocean Parkway . In short , chaverim  --  " A groan went round the car. "  --  we are a little , little bit fahrblunged . " " Our navigator , " fumed Levine . " Brooklyn-born and Brooklyn-bred . The boxball champ of Brownsville . " " That 's right ! " Weiner proclaimed . " But who ever left Brownsville ? I was twelve before I  --  " " Your fault , " Levine flung over his shoulder to Morroe . " It behooved you , it was your , ah , prerogative to obtain detailed instructions . " In an ugly voice Morroe demanded that the car be stopped , that he be put off at the nearest subway station . He was restrained by Ottensteen , who said , " This . this is America . Here you get lost , thank God you 're not in a desert , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ask like a mensch , you 're put on the right track . " " A gas station , " Weiner suggested . " With a nice rest/room . Because I do n't know about you guys . . . . " And he started to squirm . " Good , good , I can fill her up , " said Levine , relaxing . " But only Amoco , " he warned . In low gear they began to cruise and cruise , and the labor of the engine was like a repeated drawing upon Morroe 's heart . His foot had fallen asleep ; moving it , he knocked against Ottensteen 's shoe . Receiving a knock in return . With interest . His own cry was lost in Weiner 's " I wan na go . . . oh . . . oh ! I hafta ! Honest ! " Then , half a block ahead , Morroe glimpsed a gas station . But Levine refused to stop , saying , " Too small , much too small . . . They do n't sell enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poison to one 's valves ... " Near an old station wagon he pulled up and lightly beeped his horn at the rosy Germanic-looking lady inside . She had on a narrow fur piece ; its little beast jaws gaped open as though from great pain or rage . " Say , oh , say , pardon me , " he called , swishing his arm , " but what would be the best way of , ah , reaching Ocean Parkway ? Ocean Parkway ! " She stared long at them . And clutched the fur piece like an amulet . " The Parkway . . . Ocean Parkway . . . " Levine sang , blinking , straining forward his smooth schoolboy face . Ring-cluttered fingers glinted . And the window was rolled up against them . " So , so many Hamans , " said Ottensteen when they got going . " So many Hamans and only one Purim . " Again now Morroe pointed out a gas station . A bigp122one , with many pumps , with a truck at that very moment making delivery . Snippily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they must wait for an Amoco . " From the same hole in the ground , " Morroe replied . " Into the same pipe . " " Murderer ! " hissed Weiner despairingly . " Enemy of mankind ! " Grudging and graceless , Levine nevertheless gave in . He downshifted , he signaled with blinker , then profusely with hand , and gently , gently , eased out for the wide U turn . There was no noise and next to no impact . There was only the taxi looming close , mountainous , shutting out the colors of the day with its hot reds and yellows . His mouth warped , his eyes immense , demented , Levine began to sigh and whimper and flail his arms like a dreamer . " Ah . . . ah . . . " he brought out . " Fuggin-bastard ! " " That expression , " Weiner began to speculate . " Not since junior high . Not since Frankie Esposito  --  " To Weiner , Morroe said , " Shhh , shhh . " And to Levine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you carrying on ? Whoosh ! Over what ? Nothing happened . You 'll get out and you 'll see it 's nothing . " Levine shut his eyes and pressed the lids as if to blind himself . A fright went through Morroe , and he considered first a few smacks across Levine 's face , then a hard shaking . Instead he put the back of a hand to Levine 's forehead and in a little voice he said , " You want me , me to gop123out , to see and let you know what 's what ? You want ? " One eye opened , spun helplessly like a wheel in a rut . And Levine spread his arms as though in benediction . Squeezing and forcing with his shoulders , whacking his head on the windshield , Morroe got himself past Levine and into the street . After him came Ottensteen , who began to stomp around and around the car while he worked them over . " Der alte Ottensteen , what does he know ? He 's stubborn , he 's opinionated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , buy , buy German cars . Oh , boy , he 's happy , he 's overjoyed . And he says  --  and how he says , Good for you , good for you ! ' " Quicker and angrier grew his steps as he gave them to understand that even from the grave Hitler would deal them blows , now and forever . And meanwhile Morroe looked over the damage , which could have been worse , but was bad enough . Mercifully , he said , " Whoosh , a dib here and a dab there . One side of the bumper  --  and what do I know about cars ?  --  you may , may just have to get it straightened . Then the signal light . . . the bulb is gone . That and the left-rear hubcap . The total , the entirety . All in all , how much could it possibly cost ? " A little revived , Levine grunted , " It 'll cost . . . . It will cost . " " You should make sure it costs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soak and soak him . A penny , that 's all , one penny for every grain of sand in Eretz Yisroel . " Then an enormous quiet settled upon them as the cab driver , taking his time , padded over . He was on thep124short side , but of broad , stocky build . Gold crowns showed up in his one-sided bite , his hair was plentiful , black and tufted like Persian lamb , and a mishealed scar aggravated the flesh over his button eyes . There was a spring and a weave to his walk , and he held his hands chest-high , as though sheltering himself from punches . Immediately Morroe cast him for the brute order , a foulmouth , a roughhouse artist and a dog in his heart . Up close he put a dead butt to his lips . Then he slouched against a fender , blew on his knuckles and to nobody in particular said , " You Jewish ? " His legs braced to spring , Morroe answered for all , declaring that he owed him no accounting , that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuhshamed ? " " Find out from me ! " shrilled Ottensteen . " From der alte Ottensteen ! " " That'sa boy ! " the driver cried with a rejoicing smile . " Now lemme tell yuh something . " Grave again , he leveled his brows at Levine . " I do n't know what kinda Jew you are . Maybe you fast all day Yom Kippur , maybe you do n't miss a Yiskor for your Mom and Dad . Or maybe you look at it the way I look at it . Yuh figure , wahah , it 's all a crockashit . Next to economic factors what caused all the war and made all the hate ? Religion . Right ? And what 's religion ? Oi-oi-oi and singsong ? Crap , that 's crap . It 's making the other guy feel nice inside . It 's treating him like he 's also a person . Right ? " " That 's how I look at it , " said Morroe . " Very , very nicely put , " said Ottensteen . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p125And  something stopped me . . . something . . . " Levine was half-sobbing . Then the driver lit his butt , saying , " I 'll show you my kinda guy . I have a boss , a ginzo  --  though he speaks a great Jewish . Ver geharget , shwartzer , baitzim , pupek , and he even knows " Eli , Eli " ! So a year and a half he keeps promising , I go to Italy , you get a present . ' So he goes and I get . Can you see ? " He bent forward and a large silver medal swung free of his flecked sport shirt . " Saint Francis . I need it ? Like a sty in my eye . You get another person , no character , he 'd say , That 's a helluva chutzpah . I do n't give you no Mogen David , what are you asking me to go against my religion ? ' My kinda guy  --  he wears it . He figures , let every day be BrotherhoodWeek . Not to hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's religion . Right ? " " License and registration , " exclaimed Levine , stumblingwith weakened legs from the car . " License and registration . " Making his face dangerous as he spit away his butt , the driver said , " Jocko , you got mazel . Why you got mazel ? Because I feel good . I feel good , for three reasons . " He ticked them off on his rough-skinned fingers . " One , my Milton is gon na bellhop at Scaroon Manor . Where even a busboy comes home with fifteen , eighteen hundred . Two , the next four-and-a-half rooms in my building I absolutely get . Three , my wife gave herself the Reader 's Digest cancer test and she felt a little lump in her breast . All week we 're praying they wo n't have to cut . Then yesterday we see the biggest man at Mount Sinai . Einfeld . Thirty dollars a first visit . So what ? Some/times a penny is a dollar , sometimes a dollar is a penny . Right ? He squeezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doc , do n't enjoy it too much ! ' In a second he knew . Goodbye and good luck , ' he tells us . It 's only a swollen gland . ' " " Never mind , never mind , " said Ottensteen . " You did absolutely right , you should watch over a wife . " And Morroe gave out a sound of confirmation , adding , " With things like that you do n't kid around . " Meanwhile Levine scribbled and scribbled on old envelopes , growling under his breath the name of the street , the position of traffic lights , the nature of his damage , the time of day . Suddenly he rose on his toes and whistled and hissed with a dry mouth . A patrol car slowed , then dodged around the corner . In a towering rage he cried , " Ah , ah , they certainly saw me ! Never mind . I shall call the nearest precinct . Or better  --  still better !  --  take this stupid moron down and make a citizen'sarrest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver . Who , mildly protesting , inquired , " Whaddaya getting steam up ? For what ? WhaddamI a stupid moron ' ! " " My nomenclature offends you ? " Levine laughed mirthlessly . " That 's . . . too . . . fucking . . . bad ! " " Y'hear ? Hey ! " The driver entered his plea with the others . " I walk over a gentleman . I do n't raise my voice , I do n't lift my hand . And right away  --  fuck ' ! " " License and registration . . . license and registration . . . " " You got time , Jocko . You 'll wait . "  | " Now . " " When I hear apologies , Jocko . When I get some human relations . " Levine , setting his teeth , said , " This minute . " The driver yawned , folded his arms and made muscles bulge . " Vehicular homicide . " Levine 's glance wandered off cunningly . " Is n't there , is there not , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver clicked his tongue . With clasped hands and raised shoulders he parodied confusion . Then awe . Then fear . " You find this comical ? " Levine blared . " You think I 'm not serious ? " " What I think ? " the driver asked almost mournfully . " What I think is . . . you 're a putz . P , U , T , Z ! " " Gaah ! Not nice , " cried Weiner , charging out of the car and grabbing hold of them . " One intellectual should call another intellectual a putz ! " " Because I 'm not a professional , " the driver all but wept , " that 's why he opens a mouth on me ? You wan na go blind in an eye ? That 's how I wanted to hack . EightyeightsI got in all my regents , except once  --  " " He 's nobody 's dope , " Ottensteen avowed . " I 'll bet you , I 'll give a guarantee , he would n't buy a German automobile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave my Pop water in the blood . So I should n't have it too good . So I should leave school and sell Eskimo Pies up and down Coney Island . So the cops should lay for me under the boardwalk and dump out my dry ice . "  |p128Relentless  , inflexible , Levine droned , " License and registration . . . license and registration . " " What am I asking ? I do n't ask sympathy . Only respect . Only that I should be spoken to like I 'm a mother 's child . " As though spitting hairs Levine said , " I should respect you ? You go into me and I should respect you ? You are a psychopath  --  you sonofabitch ! " " He wants a pregnant lip ! " the driver cried out , shovingLevine . " He 's cruising for a bruising ! " But Weiner stepped forward , drew the driver 's arm taut against his side and leaned his weight upon him . " Gaah , do n't be a Shmohawk , " he muttered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with The Syndicate . He runs with the Trilling bunch . " Though he snorted and pulled impressively , the driver reflected on this for a moment . " So what ? " he protested finally . " I want , I go into that candy store , I call up Izzy Farina , he comes down in ten minutes  --  ten minutes . He took on tougher for me . To hell with it . That 's not my kinda guy . Like when I had basic at Fort Meade there was this hillbilly , Armbruster . Before he got drafted he did n't know how to flush a toilet even . He knew only he did n't like Jews . He 'd call me Yankel . ' Once is a joke , twice is a joke . The third time I warn him . Respect ! ' The same way I tell your putz pal . A buddy I had from New York , he wansa handle him for me . Julie Liss  --  he used to be a lifeguard . And he was built . Powerful ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wait and I hold myselfback till the last night , till we 're shipping out . And I say , Armbruster , let 's go to the latrine , let 's take a peep129together . ' So he gets up , he goes . So I give him a little lesson in human relations . So I nearly tear his head off . You know what I say to him when I finish ? I say to him , Now I wo n't get sore . Now you want , anytime now , you can call me Yankel . ' " Then Levine scowled and swaggered and thumped his chest . Then he lowered his brow and drew in his neck and went , " Buh-buh-buh . Buh-buh-buh-buh ! " " Again ! " the driver ordered , shouldering Weiner aside . " You should do that once more . Just once more ! " " Ah , buh-buh-buh . And once again , buh-buh-buh-buh , " Levine bayed lyrically . " No communication , " brooded Weiner . " Between the arts , no communication . " " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stamping dance and throwing short stage punches . " You take off , remove , the watch . " " When you take off the ring I take off the watch . " " Holly , hey , Holly ! " Morroe sought to distract . " I 'm looking at the hubcap again . You know , it 's barely , barely touched ? " " The fists , the fists , right away with the fists , " said Ottensteen . " Jewish boys ... " " You 're chickenshit , " the driver told Levine . " Chickenshit . Ah , buh-buh-buh-buh , " parried Levine , with a grimace of self-congratulation . " Take off the ring ! " " You want me to take it off ? That is what you want ? " And Levine gave it over to Morroe . " All right . All right , ratbastard . " But Weiner heaved against them , saying , " Why notp130fight , sort of , with open hands , slapping like . Stomach is five points , face counts for ten , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it in P.S. 182 . " " Very good , wonderful ! " Morroe burst in . " This , now this appeals to me . A little friendly boxing . " It was then the driver struck . A clumsy overhand smash falling high upon the nose of Levine . Who , immediately squirting blood , charged in nonetheless , yelling , " That 's the last one he 's getting off , from me ! The last one ! " From somewhere inside his jacket there was the sound of a seam splitting , his tie was lashing his face and one shoe had slipped down his heel . Both feinted clumsily . More by accident than skill Levine scored on the driver 's cheek ; at the wet smack he dropped his hands and gasped , " Pardon me ... " " Ibitmytunk , " the driver roared huskily . " Peroxide , " Morroe suggested . " One part peroxide to three , make it four parts water . A gargle ... " Dead white , the driver blundered against Levine . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a dumb sign , emitted a noise like gagging and plunged in . He hooked an arm around the driver 's neck and kicked and butted with deadly intent , taking fist flurries in the belly . The driver lifted him off the ground , seeking to slam him against the car . Levine hung on as Weiner " heeyahed " and " wh000eed " and pounded an imaginary Stetson . Suddenly his nose gave a short burst of blood . He sniffled and spat and let go . Without much spirit the driver grabbed , held and clinched . He caught at Levine 's tie , forcing his headp131down . While Levine , falling to one knee , hung upon the driver 's belt buckle , yanking his pants askew and exposingthe wide elastic web of his jockey shorts . " You cocksucker , let go my belt ! " the driver demanded . To which Levine replied , " Let go my tie , you lousy fuck , I 'll let go , release , your belt . " And now Weiner rushed forward . " You had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . You got it out of your systems . . . . So it 's all over . . . . Make nice . " Levine relinquished his hold . The driver followed suit and , doctor-like , touched Levine 's nose . " Did we need this ? " he chided . " Foowa ? For the insurance companies ? For monopolated capitalism ? " " Go , go ahead , " said Ottensteen . " Who told you stop ? Spill some more Jewish blood . " Through the folds of his staining handkerchief , Levine insisted that he had always been an easy bleeder , that , objectively and appearances notwithstanding , he had given , returned , as much , fully as much as he had gotten . " He 's okay , this boy . " Along ribs and shoulders and biceps the driver felt Levine . " I got gloves in the house , you 'll come over , we 'll work out . " And one by one he had them promise that before the summer was out they would arrange to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish for fluke and flounder in the waters off Sheepshead Bay . Next he made a ceremonious exchange of license and registration with Levine . He spread out also his army discharge papers , his social security card and a B'naip132B'rith newsletter . He hinted , then he gave absolute guarantee , that from this scrape Levine would lose nothing . Did Levine have a lawyer ? A specialist in accident cases ? If not , he recommended Coniff , on Court Street . Coniff the Goniff . Out of a cracked sidewalk , a rusty nail , a cigarette burn , a piece of bad wiring , he mounted claims for thousands . Let two A &; P shopping carts collideand a son went through medical school . " Heaven and earth  --  and swindle , " said Ottensteen . " I was contemplating a new bumper , " mused Levine . " Moey meets Izzy  --  " Weiner chuckled and sputtered "  --  Moey meets Izzy and he says , Izzy , hey , Izzy , so howwas by you the fire ? ' And Izzy says , Shah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the driver asked , " Whaddaya have to make em Izzy and Moey ? That kind you find everywhere . By all races and faiths . " " Poor taste , " Morroe hastened to say . " He 's one hundred per cent right , " Ottensteen insisted . " I imagine I should check the wheel alignment , " said Levine . " These things can be tricky , unpredictable , they  --  " " Putz , hey , putz ! " The driver clasped Levine around the shoulders and gently scrutinized him . " Tomorrow you see Coniff . Let him take care . Let him aggravate . " Suddenly he threw himself into a trot , launching lefts and rights all the way to the cab . And puffed back brandishing a bottle of Imperial . " For human relations , " he said . " For everybody to be a mother 's child . "  | " From your lips to God 's ear , " said Ottensteen , the first to drink . Next was Weiner , showing off with three long pulls at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently invoked the name of Leslie and swallowed down his share . And more.  |p134THEY  WERE NOT yet safely past the hot and heavy traffic of Grand Army Plaza , where three times Levine had stalled , when Weiner began to carry on . Like one who mounts a pulpit he mounted his seat , tilted crazily out of the open roof and shattered the air with a " Gevald ! " So perched , he smiled down upon a Cadillac pink as a healthy scalp and cried , " Love ! God is Love ! " The driver , a narrow-faced , florid person , answered him , " Hit the next lamppost , dog ! " " Vomitface , hey , dutyhead ! " Weiner rubbed a " Shame ... shame , " on his fingers , staggered and fell back to the seat . With great effort he turned toward Ottensteenp135and Morroe and whimpered , " We must love one another or die . Die . . . die . . . Yi-dy-diddle-dy . . . " A numbness over his tongue , a dark confusion in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our gang ... Our gang ... " While Ottensteen , swaying , slowly swaying , sang : " Ich bin ah mommeh  --  Aber vee iz mein kind ? " " Hey , man , " said Weiner , snapping his fingers and bugging his eyes , " dat , dat dere 's a mommeh ? " " He a mommeh ? " In an atrocious falsetto Levine responded to cue . " Dat wot ah heerd him say , neshoma . " " Well , den , you answer me a kashe , man . " " Well , den you put it to me , zeeskait . " " Well , of dat dere 's a mommeh . . . " " Dat , dat his contention .... " " Well , den , where his kind ? " Then , whoosh ! Ottensteen hiccuped , flinched and burst into shameless tears . " One Leslie . " Ottensteen kissed his fingertips . " One only Labeleh . " " A ' riginal . " There was a gummy tension in Morroe 's breathing and he was having trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a style , a poynview . " " Definitely , definitely , " Levine concurred . " A secondarytalent of the highest order . " Ottensteen took Morroe 's hand in both his own . He opened it , he studied the palm as though for signs andp136portents , and he said finally , " In Silver 's Baths I warned him . Like a person gets a flashing , an intuition . Like God turns der alte Ottensteen into his mouthpiece . I said when we were getting undressed  --  I said , Labeleh , please , please do n't take insult if I should tell you something . But I want you to make it your business to go about losing a little bit of weight . The doctors , the experts , warn every time about heart and weight and pressure . And for your size you are carrying around an excess . Gedenk . Gedenk , gedenk , gedenk ! ' " He put aside Morroe 's hand and honked like a goose into his handkerchief . And Morroe sank back , a daffy smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he allowed himself to faint a little . His body was at rest , yet he felt as though he had been clubbed to death . His lips were still , yet he felt he was screaming . Against that rancid , sour thing , that abomination rising like smoke in the depths of his breast . The languor that could not be borne , the torpor that was dragging him far out and past all caring . Leslie , he begged , intercede for me . I am no big intellect . I am no bargain . I watch too much television . I read , but I do not retain . I am not lost , exactly , but still I am nowhere . I am the servant of no great end . I follow the recommendations of the Consumer 's Research Bulletin . But do me this favor , anyway . Keep them off . For they hem me in from all sides now . They wait deep in the dark . They put in my mouth the taste of darkness.  |p137They  set grief and despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , they get me all balled up . When I turn my head or open an eye they will rip me with tooth and claw . They will throw me from awful heights . They will drown me in a drop of water . They will put me in a grave . And then he got a whiff of far-off ocean . And then a kid cried , " Heygeddaball ! Ladymissus , byafut ! " And then a splash of heartburn . Which he welcomed . Which he gave in to utterly , thinking , Let it be my payment , let it forestall worse , let it only dispel what hangs over me . Over us . And he woke himself . And he looked upon the boys , and for an instant felt love , such love that it was beyond sustaining , and something inside broke for them . " Our gang , " he muttered again . " Our gang " But they were busy telling old tales of Leslie . How on Gandhi 's death he had given up meat and sex , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself before a Sutton Place building and unto the eighteenth story screamed , " Ma , throw me down a nickel ! Ma ! " How at a writer 's workshop in Utah he had lectured , with copious readings , on Lorna Doone . How he had made them play the Dostoyevsky Game , where they would one by one confess their most shameful and sordid acts . How he worshiped the White Goddess . How he was immersed in the destructive element . How he wouldp138indulge himself with chromatic harmonicas , classical guitars , Borsalino hats , meerschaum pipes , tropical fish , Swiss chocolates , Bing cherries out of season . And racing deeper and deeper into the heart of the park , they spoke of their last moments with him . In a fun shop , where he had bought a fake dog turd and a Jimmy Dean mask . At the Everyman School , where he had lectured on Celine : The Pornography of the Absolute . Up and down the streets of Williamsburg , seeking out Hasidim , who had fled from him as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morroe started to say , then bit his tongue . But he could not hold back the recollection , though it drenched him with shame . Last January or February , whenever it was , Leslie had barged into his office and dragged him down for a long lunch . During his busiest period . During the middle , make it the peak , of the fall campaign , when the fund-raisers followed you into the men 's room and hustled you from the stalls . Leslie , between grants , had asked about jobs . But Morroe knew of nothing . That was the truth , the honest truth , though his distracted , peevish air might have seemed a rebuff , the mark of a small spirit . Also , he had insisted , perhaps a little pointedly , on going to Hector 's Cafeteria . Figuring he would most likely be stuck with the check . And he had been , too . " Look , look ! " Ottensteen turned on him . " Der id-yutt ! " " Shah . Shahshahshahshahshah , " Morroe whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Leslie , What did you want and what did you expect ?  |p139That  you should be the boulevardier , the free spirit , the late riser , and I the workhorse of the world ? Why ? BecauseI ca n't write a review or a little story ? Did that make you the only one with special needs and moods and a claim against the world ? Whoosh ! He expelled an enormous sigh and his head , sliding along the seat , flopped to an uneasy rest near Ottensteen 's shoulder . " Nu , flaming youth ! " cried Ottensteen . " Big shot drinker ! " Yet he smiled and stirred and gave up an inch or two of comfort . Now there was a lake , looking cool and green and radiant , as if reflected in enamel . Now horses galloped and clopped and sent dust minglingwith the steam of their dung . Now the wind carried monkey-house gibber and the ripping snore of lions . Now children , multitudes beyond tally . And the din , the infernal din . Like an army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , it hampered his breath and made his teeth ache at their roots . And out of the general tumult some cries came to him as though from the furthest reaches of pain . " Harry , he 's cheesing , Harry ! " " You spit on the bubbee ! The bubbee you spit on ! " " Make a siss ! " " Do n't , DO N'T DO N'T DO N'T open a big mouth ! " " Go nice to Uncle Al . . . . Nice , Nice ! " " Everything by her is no and no and no ! " " Walk over and hit him back ! "  |p140Now  there was a burst of benches and trees , then only benches , and the park rushed to a sudden end . " Alert , attention , keep watch everyone , " Levine instructed , like a nervous scoutmaster . " Any moment , any block now ! " Ottensteen , with a dour squint , said , " What a section , what faces and types ! That one there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistant manager of the world ! " But Morroe , broken-backed , dripping sweat , gave a low growl and pointed . And beyond his finger was the chapel , a little diamond of a building , its canopy silkywhite , with broad green stripes and fringes like a prayer shawl , its stained glass orange and black and blue like the inside of a flame . Upon the runner of rich red carpet a lion of Judah was embroidered ; the copper handles on the double doors were molded like the tablets of the law ; even the young maples that lined the street seemed trimmed and pruned to the shape of menorahs . " Yoi ! " rumbled Ottensteen , shedding more tears . " It 's a dream , it 's a farce , it 's make-believe . " And coarsely he began to berate God , calling Him old whore , assassin and two-faced hypocrite . Then Levine sounded his horn and shouted " Whoopee ! " For there was a spot , a perfect spot , right in front of the chapel . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foyer they beheld only a skinny little man running a damp rag over the mirrors and Venetian blinds . He was far from a youngster , and one eye was clouded by cataracts . Yet he seemed happy for the work ; whatever he touched gleamed.  | " Is it on already ? " Ottensteen asked , shuffling his enormous shoes on the cork floor . " Too much you did n't miss . I 'll show you in by the side , you should n't interrupt the rabbi . " Along a curvy corridor he led them , down three steps , three more , then past stacks and stacks of folding chairs . He said , " Where the drapes are , go straight . Otherwise you could end up . . . never mind where . " They walked dumbly on . But suddenly he called them back , waving some black stuff at them . " Here is strictly semiorthodox . Here you have to have a yarmalke . " Imperious , autocratic , Ottensteen replied , " To me it 's a nonsense , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double nonsense ! " " Reshpec ' . . . " Morroe declared . " I want to see how it looks on him , " said Weiner . " Let 's see ! " He snatched one and mounted it like a college boy 's beanie upon Ottensteen 's head . " I have an iron no ! " Ottensteen informed him , pluckingat the yarmalke . But Weiner clamped his hand upon it , and they were swaying back and forth as Levine came hurrying up . " Does anyone have a tissue or a clean handkerchief ? " he asked in panic . " I think my nose is bleeding again . "  | " GAAH , IT 'S SO CROWDED . Did you ever expect such a crowd ? " " They most likely ran a notice in the Yiddish press . And from his family alone ... " " Whoosh , I see his father . Is n't that his father ? " " Where do you see ? " " Way , way up front . In the straw hat . Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's going to faint . " Two rows down an elderly gent wearing a white duck jacket twisted around , tapping and tapping his lips . And Morroe mouthed " Excuse ... " The rabbi , a large moon-faced man with bifocals and only the smallest of beards , then said , " Please rise , thep143entire congregation . " While he prayed in swift sonorous Hebrew , ushers passed bunches of booklets from pew to pew . Presently the rabbi made a sign to sit . " Open to page four , " he instructed , " where the print is big . " He read , " Extolled and hallowed be the name of God throughout the world which He has established according to His will . And may He speedily create His kingdom of righteousness on earth . Amen . " He was answered , " Praised be His glorious name unto all eternity . " Above all others the voice of Ottensteen soared . " You know who the rabbi must be ? " whispered Weiner . " That must be Leslie 's cousin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Levine waved the notion away . " I say yes . " " What are you talking about ? From St. Paul ? " " Schmuck , they have planes . He  --  " " Sharrup ! " hissed the elderly gent . The rabbi now took a step away from his lectern and looked intently at the coffin , as though seeking a cue . He nodded vigorously four or five times , after which he said , " Bereaved family and friends , we live in a time , a generation , a society when it 's supposed to be not nice to bellyacheover the pain and trouble of living . Feel , but do n't cry , take punishment , but do n't show . Keep everything nice , neat , under control . And no details . How was the day ? ' says the wife when you go home . A day like a day , ' you tell her . Never mind that where you buy the paper every morning you got shortchanged . Never mind that you had a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave you a terrible sour stomach , or on the elevator going down the boss said such a cold good night . Nobody is interested in the routine and the petty . Like in the movies or the television a person might say , I feel hungry , I think I 'll go eat , ' and the next thing you see him smile and take out a cigar and say , Oh , what a good meal I had . ' Who cares in case he had to wait ten minutes for a table , and who wants to know that he found dirt in the napkin ? Or if he 's supposed to die , how does he die ? I assure you , dear friends , you do n't see him in a hospital with tubes sticking up his nose and getting needles and painful tests and doctors coming back and forth for the consultations . He cracks a little joke , he closes his eyes , and goodbye and good luck . Better than that , how many times  --  how many , many times !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and with tears runs to the mother . Mommy , Mommy , I hurt myself . ' Poor thing , what it gets is not a kiss and a cuddle , but a sock across the face . All right , you have to teach not to be a wild Indian and to cross a street looking on both sides . The Talmud says , Blessed is the hand , no matter how hard and heavy , which instructs in a good thing . ' Except here , what is the mother 's purpose and principle ? Only to show the kid it should keep everything inside . It should have one tough face for everything . That 's today 's living , and everybody is a Humphrey Bogart . " " He 's making a production , " commented Weiner . " Definitely overblown , " murmured Levine . " A golden mouthpiece , " Ottensteen declared . The rabbi coughed , and in the cough his next fewp145words were swallowed . " . . . life and death . . . " He hacked and rasped and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Life and death no one cares about like they used to . I remember once upon a time you celebrateda birth and you mourned a death , and in between you recognized , clear-cut and simple , you were growing older , you were aging and dying every minute . A religiousJew would have his burial cloth , his shroud right next to where he kept his tallith . This way he was remindedthat he had no written agreement with God , that he could n't guarantee today what he would be tomorrow . And when he went people would carry on , the oldest and the youngest , and no one was ashamed to make a scene and no one withheld himself . Nowadays  --  nowadays they ca n't wait to bury and forget . You dass n't spend an extra second , you dass n't say an extra word . Rabbi , please go easy , my wife has sick nerves .... " Rabbi , you should n't be insulted , but do everybody a favor , make it quick , simple and quick .... ' " Humbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts of his mother . He had been roller skating when she died , and they had called him in from the streets . His father , made vicious and a little crazy for the moment , struck out at him because he had been slow to answer . But Uncle Lazar dodged between them , taking the blows upon himself with folded arms . Till his father , shamed , in tears , reeled to the bathroom and bolted the door . Then Uncle Lazar took his hand and led him to where his mother lay . Neighbor women were wetting her down with sponges and combing and braiding her hair . " Gop146give a kiss , " said Uncle Lazar . Locking his breath and closing his eyes he bent to her , feeling a stir and rise , an emanation under his lips , as though from the last atrociousassault of a pain which had not yet consumed itself . Then he gulped air and opened his eyes just enough to see ; and in the blurred moment he saw in the face of his mother the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon found nothing , really , to surprise him , nothing prodigious occurring in his heart . It was as though he had been made to see her often dead , only now more clearly than at any time before . They took him next door later and fed him . Each woman ran in and out with different dishes and forced upon him favorites and specialties . There were eggs and onions browned in chicken fat . There were cold pickled fish and sweetbreads and tiny meatballs in sweet-andsoursauce . There were celery and olives and red and white radishes . There was brisket of beef to which clung onion shreds and barley . There was seltzer and every kind of tonic and soda and boxes of ginger snaps and chocolatewafers and Fig Newtons . He had eaten and eaten with a gusto hunger alone could not explain . Down to the last strand of soup green . Sucking the centers out of the marrow bones . But what a thing to recall ! What a stupid thing ! When the name of their old street escaped him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the body is telling you every second how you have it too good . " The rabbi 's voice prodded the edges of his thought.  | " Did you look a little too long and with too much pleasure at the grandchildren ? Take a few palpitations . Did the wife pick up a nice bedspread and covers for the couch ? Let her have a low back pain . Did you get a particularly first-class haircut from the barber ? Here , here 's a cavity , or a little piece off the bridgework . Did you get a perfect fit in a cheap suit right off the rack ? Pay for it with acid in the stomach and a trifle too much albumen and sugar in the blood . Did the father-in-law send a postal from Miami and a box of mixed fruits ? Give him a stone in the kidney , a swelling in the prostate . " Saying this , the rabbi meditated silently for a while , pressing and grinding against the lectern in a way that must have been brutal against his bones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagging pocket , patted his mouth and said further , " Talk to the body and you talk to an enemy . Argue and backtalkwith the cop on the beat and the good God in heaven , with the hoodlum who wants your money and the murdererwho wants your life . Kid it along a little . Promise how you 'll take better care of it , staying out of drafts , no lifting and bending , avoiding spicy foods . You 'll cut down and you 'll build up . You wo n't go in on Saturday , you 'll take more taxis , you 'll think a hundred and ten times before you raise your voice or climb a little flight . Plead with it . Tell it how you 're special and unique , a person who likes one soap and not another , who has to get himself into a certain posture before you fall asleep and ca n't bear if the newspaper is n't folded your particular way . Never mind , never mind , says the body . I 'm not interested . With me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood vessel , a deficiency in the heart , a spot on the lung , a swelling on a gland , an abscess they ca n't heal . When I get impatient , when I get irritated and give the say-so you 'll be only a thing . I 'll push , you'llfall . And where you fall you 'll lie .... " Weiner smirked . Levine giggled . Ottensteen clicked and clicked with his tongue . " Felix , can you see ? " said Morroe . " From where you are ? By the coffin , on the right  --  is that Inez ? " His voice waning , his intonation altered , the rabbi said , " In the commentary of Rabbi Menahem ben SolomonHa-Meiri he tells us that even though  --  even though punishment full and final is handed out in the world to come , still in all every person and individual gets a taste and sniff of his punishment in this world , in this life . Why does he say punishment and not reward ? He says punishment because all who are born are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a judgment . Whether you like it or not , nobody asks . For every little action and every little thought , also for what you did n't do and did n't think the Almighty will weigh and measure . In this world , in this life . You have to expect it , you have to live with it , on top of your other troubles . That on the Day of Judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat you 'll be called up . Either to everlasting life or to such a shaming there 's no imagining how terrible . " Morroe softly asked , " Can you see ? Can you make out ? Is that Inez ? " " Leave me alone , " said Ottensteen , wiping tears away . " With my sick eyes . "  |p149Item  by item , the rabbi listed the punishments of the sinner . The long-dead and the unborn would have nothing to do with him . He would seek to confess his wickedness , but he would grow dumb . At the gates of Gehenna imps would afflict him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull him from the right and from the left . They would turn him into a snake and cause him to shed his skin . He would become as a leaf , shivering in the wind . In his heart would be unbridled desire , but no way to appease it . Thirty times thirty times would his seed be cursed . By kin and next of kin unto thirty times thirty generations , who would chant the Chapter of Curses . He would be sent forth as a dybbuk , and his name added to the Book of Evil . All this and a lot more through eternity , till the end of days , and only after the battle of Armageddon , when the ram 's horn would blow and there would be drums and dancing in the street for the Messiah . " For such reasons and others which this is not the place to go into it 's common sense that a man ought to do whatever he can to get everlasting life . He has to please God , and there 's no one way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that you pleased in only one way ? Some do it by teaching , some do it by learning , another by fasting and still another by eating . Which is why the zaddik of Lublin used to say , Everyoneshould see what way his heart draws him to , and then he should choose this way with all his might . ' Bereavedfamily and friends , in my opinion  --  and I do n't say it because it 's the occasion  --  the too-recently departed was such a person . "  | " Hey , man , " murmured Weiner , " duz you go ' long wid de za-deek ob Lo-oh-balin ? " Behind a handkerchief Levine replied , " Uh-uh . Ah pussonally follows de teachins ob de ma-ha-geed ob Vilna . " And the rabbi continued , " He had very high moral and intellectual qualities which gave him an interest in everything and in everything a desire to ex-cel . Where there was a subject he came across he would read up  --  this I myself testify . About certain parts of Jewish customand history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any argument he could hold his own . His father tells me he used to write away to all the congressmenfor pamphlets and little packets of seeds , and that he once got a letter signed by Senator La Follette and a special pass he could use when he wanted to come to Washington , D.C. From nothing he made little airplanes . Before bar mitzvah he went into a newspaper contest on why we need the League of Nations and he won one of the top prizes . There was even a scandal ; they found out his age , that he was such a kid , and they did n't believe . His parents had to make a special trip with him down to the office and sign statements he was the author and he got absolutely no help . In the libraries he became a terrible nuisance . They kept him because of rules only in the children 's section and he would pester grownups they should get him books he really was n't permitted . From what I understand he also had an interest in chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he might have made a name  --  " But he had no grounding in the social sciences , Mor/roe was thinking . Philosophy he was very strong on , especiallylogic , and literature goes without saying . But in history I could buy and sell him . " We should n't think of him as only a book reader . He was a New York boy , an American boy , a boy from our century , and being such means Babe Ruth and the KatzenjammerKids and Tar-zan of the Apes and chewing gum and bad marks in conduct and talking fresh and not paying attention . When he wanted he had a marvelous head for Talmud Torah , except that he very seldom wanted and gave the rebbe trouble . He would get moods and not want to dress up , though his parents provided him the finest clothes . Instead of carrying a briefcase he would tie around his books with an old belt , and he lost expensive fountain pens , special compasses for arithmetic , mufflers and gloves . Things like that . He reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the father , whose feelings he hurt by his criticism of everything . They would have fights because his father got enjoyment from reading the News and the Mirror and was n't happy that the unions got into his shop  --  " Whoosh , come on , what shop ? Morroe wrinkled his face at this . They always have to embroider a little . He peddled buttons , threads and trimmings , the old man . I know , I remember , because Etta gave him an order . And he worked right out of his house. "  --  bear in mind that he was in knickers yet . One time his father told him , Boichick , if I 'm an exploiter then what are you , since you eat and drink from my exploiting ? ' The result  --  the result was for two days he tookp152in his mouth nothing but pretzel sticks and water . Till the father , being a father , naturally could n't stand it and went and brought him home records and a really expensiveset of  --  " " Murderers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising pitch . " He 's breathing ! What are you doing to him , murderers ? " " No , no , no , " the rabbi said , rapping lightly on the lectern a few times . " You must n't , I , I tell you you dass n't . You wet his grave , you do n't let him rest easy . " Even so , a sob cracked his next sentence . " He had  --  " He took time to blow his nose and fiddle with his yarmalke . " He had a clear mind , and maybe too clear . There was nothing he would let pass , nothing he would be deceivedby . In a minute he could make people think they did n't know who they were , that they did n't tell the truth or show their true feelings or try to live in a worth-while way . He wanted they should be . . . critical , they should look to see from where their feet grew . He was an underminer . It 's a special power which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because it 's not appreciatedand can do harm . Hey , hey , ' people would tell him , what do you want from us , what do you expectfrom us ? Leave us alone . We can barely lift our feet and you 're telling us to be Nijinskys . We 're grateful they do n't throw stones at us and you 're telling us to go start revolutions . We whisper shah and you bellow gevald . We say yes and you say no . Leave us alone . Go away . Realize who you 're dealing with . Bear in mind we 're kleyner menschen who have nerve only to ask for small things . Our God is the God of kleyner menschen , a civil servicep153God , a God of professionals . Our concerns are his concerns . That the apartment should be painted every few years . That the slipcovers should fit . That we should be able to furnish homes for our daughters and offices for the sons . That when we cut velvets they should n't order cottons . Leave us alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know too much . . . . " Levine sniffled , squirmed and mumbled , " Kch-kch  --  " Weiner answered with the dry barking sound of a seal . " I 'm trying to fight it , " said Levine , tittering . " I'mtrying , I 'm trying ! " " Do n't give in ! " " Burning , burning , " Levine muttered ferociously . " Jug Jug . . . Da dayadhvan . . . Stately plump Buck Mulligan ... " " Good , good ! Gaah ! Fight it , bubbele ! " " It 's going away . . . . It 's going away . . . . It 's passing now .... " " All gone , bubbele ? " " Almost , almost . . . I 'll tell you when . . . . " " Now ? " " Thank God . Now . . . " Then Weiner , softly , sneakily , muttered , " Choopiebar-choopie . . . Choopie-bar-choopie . . . " The bench began to rock . " C-c-c-carp , " went Weiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle gargling came out of Levine . He pinched his cheeks and bit down on his tongue . His body jerked ecstatically . " Rat bastard ! " he wheezed , while Weiner , with clasped hands , played dumb . " Big stink ! Lousy fuck ! "  | " Quiet down ! " said Morroe , as loudly as he dared . A little stream of laughter inside him welled , bubbled . He strove against it with black thoughts . Of the school nurse who had sent him home because of nits . Of tribes who slit the heels and tendons of the dead , that they should not rise and run from the grave . Of the ancient condom his father had spotted in his wallet . Of the Titanic sinking and the Hindenburg aflame . Of Lowenthal , his dentist , whom he did not fully trust . Slowly , slowly he was composinghimself . When Weiner fractured him with a " Choopie-bar-choopie ! " Two or three faces turned toward them . Then an usher padded over . Then Morroe felt itching and burningand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck  --  he was n't sure which . His eyes rolled up into his head ; in a moment , another moment he would pass out . " Enough ? " said Ottensteen , his fingers crunched like a trap on Morroe 's right ear . " Beast , savage animal ! " A small , almost infantile groan escaped Morroe . His glasses slipped down and teetered at the tip of his nose . He wailed softly , " Felix . . . They 're falling , Felix .. . Felix , heylookatheybreak . . . " " Get blind , " replied Ottensteen . " And dumb . " He administeredone more protracted pinch and let go . As Levine , swollen with mirth , quietly rolled from side to side . The rabbi meanwhile rumbled on , saying , " The averageindividual does n't learn how to see or to be curious . Things go into his mind just so far , just so much , to such and such a point and place and there it finishes.  |p155He  does n't like to be surprised by life or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ripper , show him your big knife and he 'll answer , Mister , pardon me , I get off the next stop . ' However , with the departed who we now remember you had a great , a remarkable interest in people and phenomenon . I recall very fondly how some years ago I met him by the library when we both had a little time to spare and how we walked around and then went for a bite . What a delight it was , what a pleasure ! The way he saw the city , the streets , the way he had himselfopened to the least little thing ! Here he saw a tree , he knew it by name . There he noticed a woman walking with a funny dog and he pats and plays with the animal and before we walk away finds out whatever there is to find out about the breed , how smart they are , what they like to eat . In no time he was her best friend . And that was n't all . I 'm with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what ground we did n't cover ! The different type elevators they have . The way big buildings are made so they are able to take the shocks from subwaytrains . Where you go if you want to get books reboundat a reasonable price . How you should break in a pipe . What to look for in a pair of new shoes . The swollen profits in drug supplies . Also the way Jews lived under the Romans . Also the inventing of clocks . Also the greatness of Winston Churchill , and his feelings about Jews . Also Joe Louis , Fatty Arbuckle , Bertrand Russell and I think the future of Israel . We went then to eat . A place I never noticed though I used to be in the neighborhoodthree times a week . Everyone  --  everyone there knewp156him and he knew everyone . The counterman , when he saw him walk over , must have gained ten pounds . We , we wanted to order the corned beef , but he gives us a wink and makes a motion toward the brisket . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss saw him he could have been fired then and there . With potato salad I do n't think he punched out on the check , plus sour pickles  --  " " I am hungry , " Levine proclaimed . " I could go some Chinks , " Weiner replied . " Ain ' dair sumpin else you 'd pre-fer , neshoma ? " " What dat be , man ? " " W-w-w-whitefish ! " Short high giggles were pried through their lips . " Was he doing it for show ? " The rabbi made the words softly . " I would personally doubt it . I would say he had a temperament that was a giving temperament and believedthat giving returns giving and love returns love . Of course , it is n't such a desirable thing in business , and from such an approach he did n't exactly swell up his practice  --  " What does he mean by that practice , Morroe wondered ? Unless , the practice of literature . And why does n't he mention something , a few words about the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason at all he starts a conversation with the cashier . He was buying a pack of cigarettes and when she hands him the matches he says to her , Is n't it strange  --  is n't it strange how I should buy a pack of cigarettes in New York , in Manhattan , and I should getp157with it a matchbook from a bank in Chicago ? ' Now , whether because there was a line of customers , or whether because she thought he was getting fresh , she did n't answer and I felt hurt for him . Because here also he was trying to give , and like with so many things in his life he did n't know where or when . He , he wanted to be part of her existence , to leave her with a deep idea , but he probably only upset her and threw off her fig-uring . " " Oh , oh , positively ! " Morroe was saying to himself . " Leave her with a deep idea ! ' Right away ! " The rabbi meanwhile turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue . After a long instantof thought he said , " I have already talked more than I wanted to and maybe more than I should . But I notice here how I had a few important , significant points to bring out which would give us a better understanding of this fine person to who we pay horn-age . Children and family I have written down . An item I should cover . All right . In my profession I go into quite a lot of houses and I ca n't get used to what I see . Parents have children and expect the children to fail and disappoint them . Parent does n't know child , child does n't know parent . Whatever you do for them is wrong . If you blew on their baby cereal , that was no good . You gave them too much protection . If you held back and did n't blow they also blame you . Because they 'd burn a tongue . What you want from them is never what you get from them . You 're afraid to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them everything and nothing , and what you ask for isp158never what you want . You put on them the necessary oil and talcum , you train them to habits of personal cleanliness  --  " " Do you really feel for Chinks ? " Levine wistfully asked . " I could go some egg foo yun , " replied Weiner . " I could go some good moo goo gai pan . " " Because there are four of us , and with four people ... " " Gaah , we order different dishes , each one different , then we mix ... " " His wife , his good wife told me something which sheds very nice light on the man and father he was . When his older girl was three or four she got into rages for almost no reason . You could n't stop her , you could n't control or discipline her , and they were afraid she would do herself harm . One day  --  one day she carried on worse than ever . For no reason . He tells his wife to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Then he takes the maydele in his arms and carries her up to the roof . He puts the blanket around them both , he cuddles , he caresses . He says , You 'll make a yell and I 'll make a yell . Let 's see . Let 's see who can do louder . ' So the maydele starts in and he starts in . She makes a yell and he makes a worse yell . She kicks and slaps , he pretends to kick and slap . She runs wild around the roof , he runs wild after her . She begin to sniffle , he sniffles . She makes a funny face , he makes a funnier face . And ut-ut-ut , she laughs . A little bit of a laugh . He hears , but he pretends he does n't hear . The maydele gives him a little hit , as if to say , Notice me , pay attention ! ' So he hugs her . Hep159gives her a love bite while she laughs and cries , although more laughs . They climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent , a castle , an automobile , a magic airplane . Look , look , ' he says to the maydele , see the sun , see how nice . Let 's both together breathe the sun down , down into our tummies . ' How is that possible ? How do you breathe the sun down ? She wants to know , the maydele . By throwing out the chest , he instructs . By closing the eyes . By saying , Sun come into me , sun let me swallow you . By pretending you never knew beforewhat it is to breathe , that now is the first time . She obeys , she enjoys . Next , he and the maydele breathe down a cloud , and another cloud , and a wind that 's blowing . Then he tells a story and she tells a story . He makes up a sun song , she makes up a sun song . She wants a kiss , he wants a kiss . She says , I love you , ' he says , I love you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Togetheron the roof , under one blanket . This was the kind of man and father he was . " Once more the rabbi searched his pad , telling the people this : " I had written down here a certain quotationwith a very important point which I ca n't seem to locate . How he for who we hold such high regard was like in a certain story where the hero is walking and he sees that a little animal is being mistreated and he stops off to give a hand . It turns out , of course , that the creatureis what they call a genie , and this genie rewards him  --  a ring , a locket , a charm  --  making him free from what you and I are not free from . That is , cash , the getting of cash , and the hardness of the getting . Also material things , property , strict obedience to the authori/ties and satisfaction with what life is supposed to provide , even when it is n't enough . Like I mentioned before , this made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and all . But if we have no room in the world or in our hearts for special cases , then whose fault is it ? That 's all I think I 'm going to say . " He next instructed all present to rise , and he recited : " Praised and glorified be the name of the Holy One , though He be above all the praises which we can utter . Our guide is He in life and our redeemer through all eternity . " He was answered : " Our help cometh from Him , the creator of heaven and earth . " Now fierce hot light washed the chapel . Now organ notes soured the air . Now lines were formed , then one line only , and the many ungainly steps jiggled the coffin on its wooden stand . Do they show more than the face , Morroe was thinking ? Probably just the face . And what do they need so many flowers ? And perfume , I 'll swear they 're piping in perfume . Unless . . . in this weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " someone ahead commented . " Who picked out that tie for him ? " Piercing the heart , Morroe recollected . Only where did I read it ? How before burial a doctor would come and he would pierce the heart with some instrument and draw a few drops of blood . For what ? Against vampires , maybe , or werewolves . And so he neared the coffin , resolving not to look , but looking anyway . At the tie , with its foolish stripes ofp161many colors . At the little flecks of pure white powder on the chin and in the creases of the neck . At the delicate way the head rested against the satin cushion . Then , then first Morroe sensed the beginning of tears ; he leaned forward , peering and peering into the coffin , into the face which wore an expression of gentle courtesy , as though in excuse for causing grief and inconvenience . It was only when Weiner had whispered " Schmuck ! " and " Schmuck ! " again that Morroe recoiled and saw that he , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A " WHOOSH ! " Morroe plunged into the crowd and was carried along . Above the dim notes of the organ he heard his name . He played dumb , though some woman from behind kept pointing and motioning and giving him baffled looks . Then he spotted a men 's room and bulled his way through . It was choked with people ; he could n't even get near the sinks . Suddenly a booth opened up and Morroe , without asking , marched right in , banging the latch and flushing the bowl again and again till the growls of anger and abuse abated . Much longer than he needed to , he perched on the alien toilet seat , his head back against a curve of cold pipe , his hands turned downward , his knees stretching his pants out of shape.  |p163Half  in turmoil , half numb , he caught all kinds of conversation . " He 's got his hand out all the time . You ask him to say a Yiskor for you , it 's fifty dollars . " " When he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when I 'll ride out to the cemetery with him in one car . " " He was never a normal personality . A normal personalityis not going to set fire to his mother 's bathroom curtains when he 's a big boy already . " " ... and I do n't like a doctor who does n't listen . Insteadof hearing me out he keeps saying , Frankly , I 'm puzzled ; frankly , I 'm puzzled . ' .. " They themselves use those expressions to each other . Like you could call me a kike and I would n't take offense . Listen to our Charlotte some time , you 'll hear how every other word out of her mouth is That nigger . ' ... " " I dreamed about birds , and birds are always unlucky for me . " " I was trying to get free service ? Since when ? I spoke to him like a friend , I said , Counselor , you think there 's any point in starting a case ? " Ask your lawyer , ' he snaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him : 0i , bist du a chuchim ! ' " " Everybody respected his learning , and if it was n't that he could n't relate to people , the members were all set to vote him their rabbi for life . " " This polly is flying around the house , fast , crazy , and it 's much bigger than it should be and we 're all scared and your Aunt Sylvia .. . "  |p164Suddenly  Morroe was aware of an eye filling a chink in the door and transfixing his own eye like a spear . A rattling began , and drops of water and green liquid soap splattered him . " Bubbele , hurry up , make it snappy ! " Three or four balls of toilet tissue floated down . " We 'll wait for you outside , bubbele . Outside ! " Girding himself , with only a skimpy rinsing of his hands , Morroe went forth amid the still-dense crowd . Up the flights and down the flights , once more through the zigzag corridor , around the draperies , past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed , gagged , fainted as he blundered by . " Pull down her skirt ! " someoneyelled , and the yell was joined by wailing and by the hollow whir of the loudspeaker system and over it a lush singsong : " Will the immediate family go gather at limousinenumber one the chauffeur is waiting just immediatefamily will you please only the immediate family . " At length he entered the chaos of the foyer and beheld the boys . Under the banked Israeli flags , by the double doors , where there was no avoiding them . With eyes cast humbly down he came forward . " Hi , guy , " said Levine . " Welcome , stranger , " said Weiner . " He 's smiling , " Ottensteen grunted . " He 's enjoying himself , der idyutt ! " Then Weiner showed a fist and Levine showed a fist . " Odds , " said Weiner . " Evens , " said Levine . And circling , slowly circling Morroe , they gave him mean twofingeredsmacks on the back of his head . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hurt someone that way ? "  | " It 's an ancient ceremony , " Weiner explained . " It 's the exorcism of the schmuck . " " I 'm a schmuck ? " " You are the archetypal , quintessential schmuck , the homonunculus of all schmucks . " " If I 'm a schmuck ... if I 'm a schmuck , you 're a moral hypocrite . " Other words stirred within him and warred for a place on his tongue . But Ottensteen waved his arms about , compellingsilence , and said , " So ? So where do we go and what do we do ? " " We should make some calls , " said Weiner . " Is n't there somebody we can call ? " " By all means and definitely , " Ottensteen returned blissfully . " Try  --  try number one New York . " Then Morroe lumbered in again with , " I 'm a schmuck . Sure . " He tried to show how strongly he was in charge of himself , but his face kept playing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that at one time your favorite name for me was Morroe Schmuck . That 's right . You 're hot-shot intellectuals , you publish here and you publish there , but you could take lessons in . . . insight . To pinpoint , to pigeonhole  --  that you know how to do , you 're really good at that stuff . You get hold of one viewpoint , one attitude about a person and you crucify him . " He stared into his palms as though seeking stigmata . Weiner exploded a " Gaah ! " Ottensteen said , " You misled and you misdirected . You fixed us up . " " Furthermore , it was no accident , " Levine ventured.  | " As the Marxists were fond of saying , it was no acci-dent . " " No ? No , what then ? " cried Morroe , his heart pickingup a rough beat . " Tell me , I want to hear your brilliantpoint , the way  --  the way you structure this . Becausea statement like that , it 's significant , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Critics are fond of saying . " His injured gaze held steady . Levine , with a total neutrality of expression , observed , " We know , from Fenichel , of the varied and ingenious mechanisms operative in the expiation of acute hostility . The original impulse must , ah , be subverted , warded off . How ? By an unconsciously purposeful forgetting , by a peculiar characteristic vagueness in relation to time and place . Mind you , I deliberately eschew all moral judgment , all effort  --  " " Bravo . Yippee . " Morroe softly applauded . " Not just plain hostility , but acute hostility . You first-class shit ! I did more for Leslie , shahresinpeas , than all of you put together . Anytime . He was n't afraid to come to me because he realized , he knew , he would find an open hand and an open heart . " Up into his injured gaze multitudes seemed to swim , myriads , swarms and legions marched from all the ages and kingdoms of man , carrying off his books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their fine stone jugs , giving him postdatedchecks and notes to cosign , coveting , using , hinting , taking advantage , shnorring . Though he winked conspicuously to the others , Levine said nothing . " Furthermore , " Morroe muttered , " I would say you'rep167in the wrong kind of analysis . Yes , I would say you 'd be getting greater benefits from urinalysis . " I 'm a slow starter , Morroe thought , his scalp prickling with pleasure , but if I have to I can give one for one . And he was preparing another shaft when an usher appeared , saying , " Do n't block the door fellows , please , be nice , the fire inspectors are handing summonses right and left . " Grudgingly they moved into the street , Morroe hanging back a little , declaiming , " Acute hostility . Sure . Purposefulforgetting . That 's right . But what can you expect from one who did n't happen to regard the Progressive Party as a vital center , a third force ? Who , ah , failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what was that brilliant , terrific phrase ?  --  ' the , ah , fructifying conscience of the intellectual . ' " " A complete distortion , a pathetic invention , " Levine snorted over his shoulder . " Which I shall take from whence it comes . From whence it comes ! " Ottensteen , meanwhile , shied away from them and latched on to a policeman who was directing traffic with a long flashlight . Were there other chapels , parlors in the neighborhood , the vicinity ? For he had to meet his sister , a highly nervous , sickly person , and deliver into her hands a forgotten envelope containing important prescriptionsand railroad tickets . No , sir , the policeman could n't say ; this section was all new to him . Old , paunched , short-winded and stiff , he explained that he himself lived in Staten Island , that he was from a private outfit , not the city . A relief man , paid by the hour , called when he was needed . Swishing around , Ottensteen aimed for three veryp168old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and crabbed like Hebrew letters . Them he told , in a swift sputter of Yiddish , that his burial society , long unhappy in its dealings here , had instructed him to look around , to see if he could get a better price , a more convenient location . Could they suggest and recommend ? One hid his eyes in a handkerchief . One suffered a coughing spasm . One spat three times . He next spoke to a chauffeur , a Negro with the height and reach of a Watusi warrior . Who would not hear out his tale of a misdelivered steamer basket . Who turned sharp-eyed and testy and said , " Din see no basket , doan need no fuckin fruit . " The peanut man knew of nothing . A young couple could not help . Though the husband claimed to have once been Ottensteen 's waiter at TiawangaLodge . Long since burned down and rebuilt . A girl from the office pointed out the director . But he , bawling out the ushers for their arrangement of flowers , their placing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whereupon Ottensteen waddled to the nearest limousine , flung open a door and bade all passengers to shift over , scrunch in and make a place . Before the boys had moved he was straddling the runningboard like a Keystone cop . By the time they got near he was one hand and half a foot inside the limousine . He was thrusting children from laps . He was sprawling upon thighs and flanks and bellies.  |p169He  was spilling change . He was moaning , and over the moans voices chimed : " Who sent for him ? " " Take a train , you nutsy you ! " " Keep hands from the next one 's child ! " " Goodbye and good luck my stockings ! " Then the boys leaned their weight on him and pulled him in slow stages from the limousine . " Only for the ride , " Ottensteen begged . " Only to the cemetery for the kaddish . " But they grabbed and hoisted and drew him along on scuffing heels . " All Jews  --  all Jews are brothers ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Weiner . " We 'll go through the Classified , " said Levine . " Under parlors , chapels , halls . " " A vital center , that 's right . A third force , sure , " said Morroe . " Yisgodol , vyiskodosh , " chanted Ottensteen . " A funeralis a funeral ! " In this fashion they crossed the street and entered what was open . A small candy store with boxes of empties piled everywhere , with globes of colored gumballs , a penny scale , gauze-covered chocolates and fixtures and displays from the year one . Kids were lounging around , big , smooth , fair , overdeveloped lumps spending heavy on frappes , charlotte russes , jelly apples , fudgicles and other rich stuff . And , in Morroe 's view , acting awfully nervy , taking too many liberties ; using the magazine rack for a public library ; walking blithely behind the counter andp170helping themselves to seltzer , to cracked ice and matchbooks ; talking smut ; piling three and four into a phone booth on one call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeten and unsweeten , to add sprinkles , bring straws , wipe away . His father would have used fists on them , even the ammonia-filled water gun hidden against holdups . They sat Ottensteen down at a round wooden table and catered to him . Weiner massaged his scalp , fetching overjoyed shivers and throat noises . Morroe , with paper napkins , applied a passable cold compress  --  though Ottensteencalled him golem , yolt and humanity 's menace . Levine went for aspirins , and when Ottensteen had swallowedthem Weiner said , " Take something else in your mouth , Felix . Build up strength . " " I had a very , very bitter and tragic life . They put it on television , it would crack the tube . " " Let me order , let it be my treat . A malted . Gaah , not just a malted , but a float . With a Melorol on top . " " Miss-tah . " The candy-store lady leaned over her fountain . " Go fifteen years back . Go twenty . Find me President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell you Melorols . " " Two sisters HIAS could trace to Warsaw , then fartig . Another one got cholera whom I did n't hardly know , although I keep dreaming she 's calling up from the Bronx to ask about Momma 's lavalier . That was Chinkele . My little brother Itche Mate I was close to , in fact , the only one he would let feed him . Because I did n't watch him better he got scared by a big dog that belonged in the next village . And he died of fits .... "  | " You want , Miss-tah , I think I have Eskimo Pies . But I do n't recommend in a malted . I 'm not trying to sell . " " My wife had only one pleasure , to write away for soap samples . A girdle you could n't get her to wear , and she was n't normal in her monthlies . She used to put oilclothon the table and then newspaper over the oilcloth . Where there was a bank she hid an account from me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a week , but the refrigerator smelled bad . If it had only one scallionshe still would n't defrost .... " " Today salesmen do you a favor to write an order . Plus everything is twice the price and half the size . " " My son takes from me like a blind horse . He never carries his own cigarettes . In camp I do n't think he won a medal . The way Catherine the Great took lovers he takes courses . He 's twenty-seven and I think he plays with himself . " And Ottensteen let a tear fall atop the fountain suggestions . " Gaah , an egg cream , Felix . To please me . " " Maybe  --  maybe with a cookie . " They ordered egg creams all around . The candy-store lady , after her fourth trip , lingered by the table , twisting a chocolate-stained rag . She eventually said , " When you take at the fountain an egg cream , is regular twelve cents . When you want at the table , I got to charge fifteencentminimal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She flopped the rag at some kids . " They sit and do n't spend . " " Principle is principle , " said Ottensteen , drinking heartily.  | " But just try , you 'll see how for the three cents , I put in extra milk . " " Someone who has integrity . " A belch stretched out Ottensteen 's last syllable . " Very nice . " " It 's my character . I wish I could be like some businesspeople in this neighborhood , on this block . From the piece of wax paper they try not to give you they buy apartment houses . " " You have to look far and wide for integrity . " " You might never come into my store again , but it 's in my character to act to you like I would act to a steady customer . " " You take today 's cleaners , " Ottensteen rose , helped himself to a Mallomar . " They do n't go inside the cuffs . Barbers , the average kind , never learn their trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what 's in your chop meat  --  " " Osher , " Levine called out , cracking the spine of a Classified , " affiliated with M.

" I think it 's the 0 family . " "  --  Ober , 01fine , 011atoroff  --  " " Otts-otts-otts , " said the candy-store lady . " We have time to know from these concerns . " "  --  Osher we had  --  " " I think the goyim live longer in general . "  |p173Then  Morroe , studying his glass as if for signs and portents , said , " Miss , maybe you could give us an idea . Or put us on the right track . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottensteen . And he trapped the candy-store lady 's hands in his hands and he related how many years back there had been a young cigar maker , a burning socialist . His boss , respecting his work , had one night singled him out , asking if he would mind staying later in the loft to fill special orders . He gladly obliged . The hours passed , the work went nicely . So , stretching out on the bench , he grabbed a quick snooze . When something troubled his sleep . He shuddered , he woke himself , and got the shock of his life . For dripping blood all over his bench stood Milk Eye , the gangster . He who was tender to pigeons and dreadful to people . " Hide me , " says Milk Eye . " Where have I got to hide ? " For answer , Milk Eye picks up a knife . One , he will murder . Two , he will mutilate . Three , he will murder and mutilate . Long after Milk Eye 's " Two , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . Too shaky to talk , he points . Where he points is the open fire-escape door with two mattresses airing . Sweating bitter lemons , he lays Milk Eye between them , a sandwich . Then he lays himself over the sandwich . Taking a relaxed attitude . The next minute they come . Two overgrownIrish gangsters . Who beat his face like a tambourine . Who suddenly beg his pardon : he should please , please excuse their roughness and gruffness ; it was their way of showing affection . Let him point , only point , to where Milk Eye hides and he would get handsome presents . Temptation shakes up his socialist youth heart.  |p174What  is Milk Eye , and who needs him ? But something , something inside cries , Whore , hypocrite , sellout artist . Since when  --  since when is human life not precious ? And he gives a firm , though courteous , No . Whereupon blows fall . All his forces fail him . Back on his sick feet , he washes away Milk Eye 's blood and does what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , exit Milk Eye . Passes a week to ten days . Sure enough , he who gets no mail gets a lawyer letter . Present yourself to a certain customtailor for high-class suits . Next , another lawyer saying , Come sign papers . You will be nicely taken care of , the lawyer tells him , you can look forward to great expectations . Passes eight months to a year . Checks . More years , more checks . Now from his newspaper desk the young cigar maker gets rumors , but only rumors , about a new Milk Eye . That he has become devout . That he has moved to Flatbush . Then , then the young cigar maker goes to Atlantic City , New Jersey , to write up a highly important conference . Where he reads in a newspapera small-print item : " The officers and board of Goldzweig Institute mourn their beloved associate . . . . " Immediately , immediately he sets out for the funeral . Over parkways and under tunnels the special limousine rushes . Brooklyn , Flatbush . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries on a hopeless search for the small-print item . ( By nature an organized person , he has , alas , forgotten to jot down where the services are set . ) He tries stores and stands , tramping the immense avenue blocks . But no appeal , no amount , will get him the editionhe seeks . Finis . Fartig . The story ends . Only for one finishing touch . If she has so far not surmised , let thep175candy-store lady now meet the young cigar maker . He , himself , Felix Ottensteen , staff member of Yetzt . " You are that Ottensteen ? " The candy-store lady positivelyblushed . " Also N. J. Felix in the magazine section . " " You write very , very nice little articles . Interesting . Especially when you knock . " " Today what 's to boost ? " And Morroe , with a fixed flat voice , said , " The more I think , the more I 'm positive . We should stick within the 0  --  " " Schmuck , " whispered Weiner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eye had children ? " the candy-store lady inquired . " Only a crippled wife . An intelligent , highly learned woman who kept a strictly kosher home . " " Otts-otts-otts , " went the candy-store lady as she stomped off to sell and serve . Returning , she brought back halvah and haunted eyes , saying , " It 's no good . I take to heart too much . " Ottensteen 's sigh fluttered over every living thing . " Like with Phillie the cake man . He delivers me the last one and if I tell him , Phillie , Phillie , I need service , I 'll cancel by you , he tells me what he pays to keep his boy in a retarded home . It 's no good . " Ottensteen went on record that in business heart was a hindrance . " You look at my counter , you see boxes and jars for every disease . God spare us , I have no room for stock . "  |p176Ottensteen  hoped her counter would be so crowded for the next hundred and twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get aggravated . It 's no good . It 's why I 'm on a salt-free diet . " The candy-store lady extracted from her apron a crumbly cracker . " After sweet halvah I take plain Uneeda biscuit , " she shyly confessed , then said , " You asked across the street ? " They had definitely asked . " I would try then Nostrand Memorial on Nostrand Avenue . How you go is you go to Nostrand , down Nostrand , down till you come to Kings Highway . You come to Kings Highway you turn , you look , you notice a Barton 's  --  " " Write down ! " Ottensteen glowered at Morroe . " I want to see you making notes ! " "  --  you watch for an appetizing store , where if you want you can take home their potato salad in an insulated bag . Then , two doors away , Nostrand Memorial . Ca n't miss . " Levine rose , a hand stretched toward Morroe . Who , preparing a smile , a few kidding words , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , " Levine acidly said . " I shall want a dime from you . " Though incensed , Morroe came up with change . Thinking : I wish on you what you wish on me . " They buried my brother-in-law , God spare us , that 's how I come to know the place . In your life you never saw a brother-in-law and sister-in-law should be so close . Every day in the morning he called me like clockwork . Hello , Princess , how are you , Princess ? ' " The candy-store lady 's stomach suddenly issued a statement of sorrow.  | " I start thinking about him , right away I have to take Turns . It 's no good . " He , himself , der alte Ottensteen , believed in and lived on Turns . Weiner cited the human condition . " Information , " Levine was saying , " one moment , Information . Your purpose , your , ah , function is not to correct my pronunciation . Nostrand is of Dutch origin and I gave it the long Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God spare us , he 'll have his yahrzeit , and we made up that the whole family should get together whatever it costs and take a special New York Times notice . They had in mind a professional to write it up , but I figured let me try , let me do it and have the pleasure because I loved him , I was special to him , I was his princess . You want , I 'll recite , you can criticize . " It would be their pleasure , their pleasure and privilege . The candy-store lady climbed out of the drapes and loops of her apron and , after a few silent seconds said , " Goes like this : Poretz , Mandel Hirsch . One long sad year without you . Words are inadequate to express what is in our hearts . Each day brings thoughts of you . We miss you and live on in your dear , dear memory . " She entered her apron again . " Tell me , Mr , Ottensteen , if you think I should drop out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ottensteen kissed his fingertips . Weiner begged for a copy . " I realize that , sir . " Levine cupped and stroked the phone 's mouthpiece . " Sir , sir , I am not trying to give you a hard  --  "  | " I had some fight over it with my cousin Ida . It 's not fancy enough . It should say , instead of in your dear dear memory , " in your green memory . ' So she 's bowing out and is having them plant a tree for him in Israel . " "  --  B , R , A , V , E , R , M , A , N , Leslie , and I am grateful . " " Spite work , pure and simple . You look at families , you do n't have to wonder why there 's war in the world . " " Whoo , whoo hoo hoo , " Levine yapped at them from the booth . " Underway . . . finishing up . . . calling somebody over . . . " Weiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put me on . Do n't forget . Do n't hang up . Let me say hello . " His teeth clicked . His chest rose . His eyes filled with love and fear . He reached toward the phone , but Levine snapped the door shut and wedged his behind against it . " Come on ! " Weiner flung himself against the booth . " Pummeonasec ! " Levine blithely gestured and talked away . " Otts-otts-otts , " went the candy-store lady . " Open up . Oppenuppasec and do n't fu kid around ! " " Miss-tah , do n't start me trouble with the phone people ! " " Doucement ! " yelled Levine , with the door half-open . " I happen to have Minerva Turtletaub on the line . " A light seemed to switch off behind Weiner 's face . He seated himself and to an empty glass said , " Skinny Minnie , that 's a fine howdoyoudo . Since when , gaah , since when was she such a good friend to Inez ? " " Why I gave an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get arguments . They sent a mechanic who claims I mistreat the equipment . Ah Poilisheh . " " Furthermore , was n't there some story that they were supposed to be on the outs on account of when Minnie went to Europe she would n't bring back a Swedish cuticle scissors for Inez ? " It was an Italian sewing machine , Morroe ached to say . Or an English bike . In any case , some difference ! " I 'm sure she 's a Stalinist  --  the bone structure , the complexion , the general way she carries herself . Gaah , maybe not a Stalinist , but certainly Stalinoid . " Then Levine danced out of the booth and gleefully announced that all had been arranged . Easily , flawlessly , but with fanatic attention to detail . If they hurried , it was not at all impossible to make the service , or a portion thereof . If traffic slowed or trouble came and they could not make the service , the procession would definitely be held up for them . If they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could nevertheless be joined at certain clearly designated streets . If they could not make the service , missed the procession and blundered among strange streets , a lookoutwould be posted near the big cemetery gate . If they could not make the service , missed the procession , blundered among strange streets , turned at the wrong gate , let them seek out the plot and the grave . If they could not make the service , missed the procession , blundered among strange streets , turned into the wrong gate , came upon the plot but found all mourners long or lately gone , they were to assemble , with selected nearest and dearest , at the apartment of Inez . Stopping first ,  |p180since  it was on their way and they must pass , to bring two pizzas , large , from Donadio 's . One all cheese , one cheese and anchovy . They rose and made a path through kids and empties . Morroe , to avoid a kid , skidded on an empty . When he dragged himself up he felt a hunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slowly , slowly he tested . Whoosh ! The fragment of a filling , no older than the month . Only God can help me , he reflected and , though mortally tired , he got set to lunge , smash through any obstacle , and sprint to a subway . But Ottensteen checked him at the door . " Buy something . I want to see you buy and give her business . " He bought : Jujubes , Charms , Sight Savers , Mary Janes , Hopjes and a soap eraser . His change he fed into a cerebral palsy box . The candy-store lady then shucked off her apron and said gently to Ottensteen , " Next time we come together let it be for celebrations . " To which Ottensteen made reply : " Let it be a world for all Jewish children . " " Let Israel be strong and have it good . " " Let the rich get a little poorer and the poor get a little holier . " " Let there be a Roosevelt and a La Guardia to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key for every lock . " " Let it be we should never , never need , but what we need , God should give us . " She was still talking as they left the store and fell inp181step behind Levine . Who glowed with plans of how , to the pizzas , they might well add black olives and head cheese , red peppers and prosciutto  --  a half pound , sliced thin , would be sufficient  --  and whatever else was suited to the preparation , the essential fixings and makings of an antipasto . Ottensteen proposed a good coffee cake , saying , " When I come , I come like a sport . " Morroe , his tongue immersed in pollution and decay , began to limp . Weiner , popeyed and nearly gagging on the words , said , " Gaah , all of a sudden she 's an ass-hole buddy to Inez , all of a sudden she 's in charge of arrangements . " And he blurted out the story of what once befell Inez at the hands , though not exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Inez , six and a half months gone , was at a natural childbirth class , Skinny Minnie had paid Leslie a visit ; how she had found him with the page proofs of a hotsy-totsy Naysayer piece  --  " The Containmentof Politics " ; how she had caught three grievous typos ; how Leslie , from a sense of obligation , an onrush of gratitude , had put a hand or two under blouse and skirt ; how Minnie , true-blue , and palsy-walsy , had begun for his benefit the performance of certain labial labors ; how in the midst of these labors a rude and aggressive outcry had been forthcoming from Inez , early by twentyfiveminutes ; how Leslie , springing up , working fast , had fashioned a bludgeon from his page proofs ; how with this bludgeon he had smashed Skinny Minnie again and again over the head ; how with each smash he had hissed , " What are you doing , you dirty thing ? "  | " A marvelous boy , " said Ottensteen . " A power and a force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead , Weiner let it be known that no part or process of Skinny Minnie was without affliction . That three times foreign bodies had been found in her Fallopian tubes . That her nipples were inverted . That her septum was deviated , her sinuses clogged , her ankles pronated . That the wealth and strength of her body hair defied electrolysis . That her breath could sour pickles . " Pish-posh , " said Levine , negotiating a scrupulous Uturn . Then Weiner maintained that Skinny Minnie was basically bad ball . " Bad ball , buh-buh-buh , " remarked Levine . Red now behind both ears , Weiner cited her fantastic economies . She would steal aspirins from a friend 's medicine chest , sugar cubes and napkins from restaurant tables . She went to special stores for day-old bread . She bought damaged canned goods at discount . She got her newspapers from subway seats . She used the cheapest cuts of meat . " Never you mind , " said Ottensteen . Who happened to think she was a cute little individual , a wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handle a tease . And though modern in all else , a highly religious girl , a strict keeper of the Sabbath . " In this , I must concur with Felix . " A sweetness settled over Levine . " Her orthodoxy , at any rate . Which almost , ah , burned us both alive . You see , it was her mother'sP183yahrzeit and somehow the candle tipped over on our sheet . . . . " " Well , well , well , " said Weiner , clearing a rough spot in his voice , scratching away at eye , ear , nose and throat. " ... and there were certain times , certain special holidays , when she made herself absolutely taboo . But on , ah , Simchas Torah , there were definite compensations . " " Well , well , well . No wonder the girls eat you up at one greedy gobble . I mean , gaah , the formidable combination of popular-culture expert and cocksmith . " Weiner bared his teeth like a Mexican bandit . " But in one thing  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocksmith by the popular-culture experts or the biggest popular-culture expert by the cocksmiths ? " Levine invited contrast with Weiner in either area or field of endeavor . And , trembling a little , Weiner demanded the name of the Phantom 's dog . " Would that be  --  " Levine pretended to ponder "  --  ah , Wolf ? " " The Shadow 's girl friend , " Weiner shot back . " Heh , heh , " laughed Levine . " Margo . " " We 're with the Shadow , we 'll stay with the Shadow . I am after , I am waiting for the name of the little fellow who drove him around . " " That was Moey from Brooklyn . He was always being asked to report . Report ! The Shadow hissed sibilantly . ' " " Baseball Joe . He was left-handed or he was right-handed ? "  |p184Levine  , in a mellow mood , said , " A worth-while question , mon vieux , albeit revealing you as a somewhat stealthy little rascal . For Baseball Joe , as all perceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah , a switch-hitter . " " Richard Wentworth . To a chosen few , to an intrepid little band he was known as ... " " The Spider . Whom I tend to think of as the forerunner , the progenitor , of the hero as apocalyptic re-deemer . " " We 'll go to best friends . Who had a best friend Wrangler ? " " Tom Mix , " said Levine , as though it were a benediction . " Who had a best friend Black Barney ? " " No doubt you are expecting me to say Buck Rogers . Then I will say Buck Rogers . But under protest . Because long , well before Black Barney entered the scene , Dr. Huer was on hand . As a matter of fact he , he 's the one who rescued Buck Rogers from a state of suspended animation , then fixed him up with a flying belt . And if you had rescued me from a state of suspended animation I would consider you my best friend . " " You are so wrong  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By a slight quiver Weiner showed that he was shaken up . " But I have broad shoulders , let it pass . Let it be radio . Let it be Hop Harrigan time . Hop Harrigan . He 's coming in , he 's zooming down , he 's getting ready to land , but he first has to radio the announcer . What does he have to radio the announcer ? "  | " Pilot to navigator , " murmured Levine , " ah , pilot to navigator . This is Hop Harrigan . . . coming in . " " Coming in ! Coming in ! " Weiner grated . " Gaah , with expression ! With tahm ! With total immolation of self ! " His voice took on a venomous , wheedling tone . " Now the Thimble Theatre . Popeye . He had the Goon named Alice and the Jeep named . . . ? " Levine , his face under stress , was silent . " I 'll give a hint , a real clue . " In the whites of Weiner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same name as a certain schwartze action painter what kicked , literally kicked , Minnie out of bed because she wanted him to do the windows . " " Action painter ! Buh-buh-buh ! " remarked Levine . " Yagivupp ? " Levine demanded that his old bias against Popeye be taken into account , his inability to relate to the Thimble Theatre . " Right now ! " cried Weiner . " Right now if I called my mother up and she dragged herself over to the phone with her hip , which they got metal spikes in , and I said to her , Momma , God bless you , what was the name of Popeye 's Jeep ? ' the answer would flow from her lips . I bet even  --  " his hand pounced on Morroe 's thigh  --  " even bubbele here would know . " Morroe 's reply was , " A schmuck can not be expected to know the name of Popeye 's Jeep . " Then Levine issued his challenge . " Bogart . " " Bogart , " affirmed Weiner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been featured but not starred . By the intersection of Nostrand and Church Avenues he had named the horses of Tom Tyler , Bob Steele , George O'Brien , Hoot Gibson , Ken Maynard and Buck Jones ; nine books by Albert Payson Terhune ; the four Boy Allies ; the three Battle Aces of G-8 ; and five more movies wherein Bogart had been featured but not starred . By the intersection of Nostrand and Newkirk Avenues Weiner had named seven books by H. Rider Haggard ; fourteen by Edgar Rice Burroughs , exclusive of the Tarzan series ; and eleven movies wherein Porter Hall had been featured but not starred . By the intersection of Nostrand Avenue and Kings Highway he had named twenty-seven Mickey Rooney movies exclusive of the Andy Hardy series ; nine movies wherein Harold Huber had been featured but not starred ; and hummed the themes of " Myrt and Marge , " " Lum and Abner " and " Vic and Sade . " By the Barton 's he had named the original Dead End Kids . By the appetizing store he had named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starred . And at the chapel , where two full blocks of cars waited and the air shook from the turning of all their motors , he had named the eight greatest stage shows of the New York Paramount , the role Bebe Daniels had taken in Forty-second Street , and the technical advisor for Hell 's Angels.  |p187HE  COULD OFFER no proof and there was little point mentioning the fact , but Morroe was convinced that the Inez he had last laid eyes on wore taffeta , not silk , open toes , not pumps . The next minute , though , as he began to tally and take stock of the other mourners who milled around the cemetery gate in muted meeting and greeting , he was confounded by greater peculiarities . So that he cried to himself " Ye Gods ! " and " Whoosh ! " There was dark Milton Ragner , Milton the unworldly , who had slashed his wrists in a tub of warm water because he could think of no way to get rid of an old mattress . There was Ozzie Waldman , Ozzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave away nothing , not even a piece of information . Meet him after a visit to his mother , ask him , " Ozzie , where were you ? " and he would say , " I saw a woman . " There was Ethel Landsberger , big and shapely and elegant , from the Landsberger Parking System people . She hunted with falcons , she was hot for writers and spent thousands to print her terrible verse . Always in upper case . REMEMBER NO SUCH THING AS IT IS/ FORGET WHAT IS ONLY AT ALL . There was Gideon Pfeffer , the big Latin America specialist . He knew five or six languages , he made special trips for the State Department , he could hold his own against Sidney Hook . But he was without charm . He blew matches out under your unlighted cigarette and never bothered introducing you to people . There was Edgar Segal , Edgar the macher . Where there was a magazine , he was on the free list . Where there was a forum , he was on the platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made the third . There was Maurice Salomon , the editor of Second Thoughts , with his Robespierre profile . He had the air of the oldest of men , as if he had been through the Hundred Years ' War , taken down Sacco and Vanzetti 's last words and seen all movements turn into failure and fiasco . He would be twenty-nine , make it thirty , on his next birthday . There was Arabelle Talbot Harrington , looking as if she should be fingering a rosary or stamping library cards . Oh , Leslie had a great story about her : how late , late one night at the Devereaux Colony , she paraded nudep189around the grounds and screamed up into the main guest house , " Will one of you please come down and fuck me ! " There was Cordell Nash . His family had streets named after them and got private audiences with the Pope . Yet all his friends were Jewish . He loved to make jokes like , " Pour me a goyische kopp of coffee . " There was Irving Sklare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Irving Development " because he was a city planner . Every third word out of his mouth was " environment . " There was Leslie 's sister Amelia , fatter than ever , and Lemkuhl the druggist , and there were Colin Bewley the translator and Selma Raab the juvenile editor and Portnoy the veterinarian and Mordecai Roth of The Naysayer and Horace Spiro of Portent and Inez ' old maid Margo and Danny Sherman the gagwriter and Harvey Korn the sociologist and many others Morroe knew barely or not at all . Momma , what a crew , what a collection ! Who had summoned such numbers so late ? Where do you reach them ? And by what means ? Were there six Inezes working the switchboard of the world ? I am in the presence of mystery , Morroe thought , and his gums began to torment him . For a wild moment he had a flash of Inez , a lightly leaping bird shrilling , " Come , come , come ! " from window to window , or dancingup the city and down the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right , was lecturing Selma Raab , the juvenile editor . " Chaval Al De'ovidim . " Three times he repeated the phrase . " You 'll see it on a lot of Jewish stones . To translate  --  to translate I would say , Alas ,  |p190maybe  woe or sorrow for the lost who are never forgotten . ' " Weiner , behind him , had hold of Cordell Nash . Whose choked laugh was already beginning to burst quietly . " And the pool is emptied out , completely empty . And he 's soaking and splashing , splashing and soaking . And the manager tippy-toes over and he says , How are you , Mr. Shmollowitz , and is everything to your liking ? ' And he answers him , Tun-derful , vun-derful . Now if I only had some money ! ' " And Levine , in front , had linked arms with Maurice Salomon and was saying , " I see , then , not a piece which would definitely pigeonhole Leslie  --  though the , ah , culturalconfigurations have a critical bearing  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all reappraisalsare retrospective . Leslie Braverman : the Comic Vision , ' or The Comic Vision of Leslie Braverman . ' " Kronk ! Creaking and swaying , crunching gravel , with pale radiance of lowbeam the hearse , from a devious path , intercepted their path and lumbered ahead at walking pace . Showing the blunt end of the fine wood coffin . Laminated like a scroll . Silver handles and silver screws . Where my friend is laid . Who could polish off , at one sitting , six bialystocken and a half-pound of Novia Scotia lox . Whoosh ! A fat raindrop spattered one lens . Another exploded in his hair . Storm or sun shower ; the day had lacked only this . He saw three clouds move upon each other , collide and merge . To become a bust of Goethe . A dogfightp191between angry little Spads . An Etruscan warrior . Officer Pupp getting set with his club . Then only the club . Then the sun renewed its thrust . A squeeze at his armpit . A scent of camphor stick and lilac water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , determined her look . Like a protest marcher . But a great body , and beautiful that long thick dangle of Indian-black hair . He had had her , very nearly had her . In the Biblical sense . " Isawimonlylarswake , " she said . " Sawfultuffdeel , " he answered . Leslie 's living room lighted by candle stubs in colored glass . A party of parties , by its own right a being and a becoming . Where no drink went stale , yet none were seen drunk . Where no ashtray was out of reach . Where platters of marzipan cookies shone with a toytown brillianceand fresh bowls of potato chips and salted peanuts were magically generated . Where all seemed of one kind and one heart , yet each was what he himself wished to be : warmer , wiser , wittier , calmer , surer , more playful , capable , energetic , potent , attractive , straightforward and sensible than in life . Where scholars who had mastered Kant and Hegel , dour young poets and senior fellows in schools of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imitated James Cagney , Charles Laughton and Bette Davis . Where the heavy-footed danced flamenco and the poorest of singers sustained impossible notes . Then Leslie had cried , " Lummir aller tanzen ! " And Inez had cried , " Tanzen , tanzen ! " Some went " Bim-bom-bim " and some went " Day-doi/doi . " Some put foul or foolish words to the melody . Some paired off and some stood alone . Some unhooked and some unzipped and some kicked off shoes . Some pranced like cheerleaders , some like goats and centaurs . Some seemed to be pulling fish nets , some to be treading grapes . Some formed a circle and he , Morroe , with galloping heart and soaring spirit , was of this circle . Then Leslie had cried , " Give ! Be open ! Be whole ! Make contact ! Kiss , kiss ! " And Inez had cried , " Kiss , kiss , kiss ! " Out went the candles . He called , " Etta , oh , Etta ! " in mock Dagwood Bumstead tones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down gladly upon a strange lap . He felt : not rage , but righteousness . He thought : All right for you my girl , all right . Goose and gander , tit and tat . An eye for an eye , a feel for a feel . Let your whoopee sanctify my whoopee . So he whirled , both arms flung out as if awakened from innocent sleep . Embracing first Deena Adler . Then Sandra . Although with highest hopes , how presume that she would swing her body into the embrace ? That from prune ' and prism ' pecks she would unleash a kiss to burst shoelaces ? How imagine that she would lead and he dumbly follow outside , upstairs , to the roof ? Kissing and grabbing , ducking clotheslines , skirting sprinklers and ventilators and other hazards . Excitement boiling up in him , Morroe made ready for a night 's small fun : a bunny-swift entrance , a coupling and a gracious uncoupling . Followed by a few words of humble gratitude , maybe the sharing of a cigarette . Hep193would within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthology or a ceramic medallion bearing the inscription " Hopi soit qui mal y pense . " On the card one bold letter , underscored : " M. " So making free with her ungirdled behind , he had cautiously suggested here and now . She went along with the now , but balked at the here . A hotel ? She was not strongly for hotels . Would she be averse to her place ? In Queens , at the end of the line . And on the premises a mother with bladder trouble . He had somewhere spotted a baby blanket . This , plus his jacket could serve . Since puberty 's onset she was allergic to wool . Then , then an act of God : the wind which buffeted and chilled blew suddenly against their legs an abundanceof newssheets . Making haste , Morroe scooped them up , spread them out and on hands and knees coaxed Sandra to his side . She knelt , while he whispered thickly , " I like my body when it is with your body/ It is so quite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew away . Had he offended ? No , he was very sweet , but in the kneeling she had torn her garter belt . He promised another . And began again , " I like my body when it is with your body/ It is so quite new a thing/ Muscles better and nerves . . . . " He had weighted her skimpy panties with clothespins and was seeking her when the sound of heavy steps shriveled him . The iron door inch by dreadful inchp194opened , spattered weak light on them . A figure came forward , breathing vapor  --  a man . Sandra whimpered ; Morroe , frontier midwife , gave her a clothespin to bite . He pictured : some terrible-tempered janitor ; a tatooed arm ( blue anchors and red roses ) swinging a mop handle ; a kick in the ass from an army surplus boot . Or wait , wait  --  he broke into a hot , then a cold , sweat  --  a cuter prospect ! No janitor this , but the first of many from Leslie 's living room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head Leslie begging , " Do n't stop for us ! " Coarse laughter in the wings . " Rieff ! Rieff , Rieff , Rieff , Rieff ! " A little dog sniffled him . " Curse you , you bitch ! " whispered Morroe as it presented fluffy rump and broke wind a foot from his face . He prayed it would do no worse , but it did . On top of which the man was stamping around and around in the pitch-dark , holding endless conversations with himself . Saying things like : " Gentlemen , please remove my name from your mailing list ... . I am an old and desirable tenant . . . . Beyond question an injustice is being perpetrated . . . . They deliberately cook cabbage and cauliflower so that the smell will drive me out . . . . Despite everything I held the door for them when they carried bundles . . . . " Also he sang : " This is the SymphonyThat Schubert wrote but never finished .... " And " Oh , wild rose , MacDowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bawling out a low-flying plane ( " Climb , fool ! Pull up , I say , up , up , up ! " ) as they fled . Near Leslie 's door they stood quietly for a while . Till Sandra told him that though she had lost a garter belt she had neverthelessgained a friend . He was glad . Would he in the foreseeable future call ? He would certainly call . Because what had been between them had been lovely and spontaneous and , in its way , the highest kind of chastity . Chaste it had been . Let him take her number at the office . On a piece of scrap he doodled seven matchstick men . Her office had two Sandras . Let him be sure to ask for the one from Queens . On one matchstick head he doodled a crown . In the cab later he and Etta had wordlessly engaged each other like two gladiators , then like children playing doctor ; in the elevator she was already loosening her clothes and fumbling at his ; in the hall he crooned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them . " ThankGodnorain , " Sandra now said . " Salweedneed , " Morroe answered . And craftily , imperceptibly , he copped a feel of himself . Woe . Woe and whoosh ! You are a swine , he told himself , you are abnormal and definitely off your rocker.  |p196Then  to trick his blood , to divert its current , he emptied his mind of everything and he let only the vastest concepts filter back . Power , State , Society , Creator , Preserver , Universal , Silurian , Mesozoic , Jurassic , Commonwealth , Empire , Republic , Pain , Terror , Mob , Legion , Caste , Class , Labor , Rome , Egypt , Byzantine , Arctic . But he could not entirely hold off Slap and Tickle , Soft and Downy , Small and Tight , Bibble and Bobble , Whip and Feather , Armpit and Navel . " How are you walking ? " Ottensteen 's hand was between his shoulders , poking his back . " It 's a revulsion to watch you walk , you walk like a sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mercy , mercy ! " Morroe whispered . And he concentrated his gaze on headstones , vaults , crypts , monuments , markers , mausoleums , his thoughts on the dead . To them , them , he made silent address . He said , What can I tell you and what do I know ? Your certainty , my problems . We got over the Depression , we got over Hitler . Skeezix is married and has hands full with the kids . My life is n't really connected to anything . Discount houses are very big lately . Likewise mutual funds . Likewise paperback books . Likewise tolerance , brotherhood , human relations , intergroup harmony . Your names and mine at the foot of one page . Now whole families can charter special planes for Israel . We 're beginning to see Jewish faces in banks , though not so many . I get very little personal mail . Either people are more nervous lately or there is more to get on their nerves . We are losing India . Black princes from Africa eat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p197but  not the day after . Everybody seems to have good taste . Bus drivers are becoming more vicious . Macy 's has gone downhill . Likewise the big movie houses , the Modern Library series , wrapping paper , pencil sharpeners , kitchen matches , Nedick 's orange drink . I have as much in common with the men who rule me as I have with the Gracchi . Big names appear for Jewish causes . Somewhere I read that it costs $3,500 a year to be poor . Comedians are very sad and keep breaking in with , " Seriously , though , folks , seriously . . . " Smilin ' Jack is married . Warner Baxter , Richard Dix and Warren Williamdied . Jack Benny is still big . No one talks anymore about Winchell . I do n't think you missed too much . Honestly .. . A dark silent relief enclosed him . A bird worrying a worm delighted him . A shimmer of green poplars , make it evergreens , filled him with reverence . To a fat fly he gave the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yielded right of way . To Leslie he promised , I 'll cry for you . How I 'll cry ! I 'll turn your insults into anecdotes , your mishugass into myth . I 'll write off the hundred and thirty-seven dollars . Likewise that badger shaving brush and the Miriam Beard History of the Business Man , out of print and very scarce . He altered his gait to a sturdy martial rhythm . He opened the bottom button of his jacket . He tuned in to the boys . To Ottensteen , who was saying to Selma Raab , " More than you realize he took to heart . Once , once on a Sundayp198he looked pale and green and very strange to me . It was hurting him , he was personally suffering because that minute and that second one-third of the country was watching Ed Sullivan . " To Levine , who was saying to Maurice Salomon , " We must first determine whether we want memoir or critique . If memoir , it behooves us to go easy on the bold and baroque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us then , or it then behooves us , to find in his work what I like to think of as , ah , the double image  --  that which is , at once , symbolic expression of our time and tragic protest against it . Moi-meme , I favor the memoir-critique . The former lending tension to the latter , the latter lending irony to the former . " To Weiner , who was saying to Cordell Nash , " He loved my mother 's split-pea soup . True , he did n't mind her sweet and sour cabbage and he was partial to her honey cake . But he loved her split pea soup . Every Thursday my mother sent along the jar , the big jar for him , and every Thursday he would walk in . First he would look . Then he would handle it , like it was the Holy Grail . Then he would turn the cap , soft , slow , easy , thread by thread , and he would sing a little . **28;4945;TOOLONG . Gaah , soft , slow , sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make sure it did n't overheat , it did n't boil away . And he would sing a little . **34;4975;TOOLONG . And he would eat and while he ate he would explain to me . That food , good food was the warp and woof , the blood and bone , the spirit and substance , the very essence of Judaism . Then if there was time we 'd go out and look for pussy . "  |p199And  Morroe continued his reflections , and his mind gave birth to warm feelings , good impulses , worth-while projects . He would keep in touch with Inez and take her to the best , make it good restaurants for lunch . He would fix her up with somebody from the office , a decent , modest , genuine person like Morty Shulman who would dote on her , take pleasure in her strange ways and go gently with her into a pleasant menopause . He would show an interest in the little girls , treat them to Radio City , the Statue of Liberty , the Hayden Planetarium and F. A. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it please God he would be , he would try to be .. . a true mensch . But then he went Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! And Fuck ! Shit ! Pee ! He hopped , heavily hopped . Pain . Exquisite pain between his toes . From pebble , shoe nail or wrinkled sock . He left the path , stepping over a thick flower bed , momentarily oppressed at the accidental murder of a few blossoms . With his hands he instructed the boys to bear with him , to seek no explanation now , to trust his judgment , to rest assured that he would soon catch up . After which he trod gently among the too many graves and plopped on a low marble bench , grateful to the giver . ( " A true friend and life-long adherent of the ideals and aspirations of the Workmen 's Circle , " said the stained scroll . " One who was happy to serve his departed brothers and sisters as Secretary-Treasurer , then as President . Anonymous . " )  |p200There  , shaking out a shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moving wind and the blue and vacant sky , his sighs fogging his glasses , Morroe fell in love . With Goldie Bromberg . Barely thirty . Dead these thousands and thousands of days . Gone in a more mortal time . Outlived by half a depression , a whole war . Who , he asked himself , falls in love with a dead girl ? The boys are right , one hundred per cent right . You really must be a schmuck . Yet he pushed his face to perhaps a yard from her chipped little gravestone and stained his eyes on the tinted snapshot ( fading , it seemed , even while he watched ) . Dark , dark was Goldie Bromberg , the hair pulled back in a bun , though a few lively ringlets had escaped , a nose long enough but made passable by a tilt , a pair of old-baby eyes heavy with reproach , full lips parted and somewhat insolent ( a big mouth , a tough tongue , had once called her mother " old bitch " ) . He invented for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hefty hips ( she was sensitive about them ) , an overdeveloped chest ( at fifteen she had outgrowna rich aunt 's brassieres ) , a tendency to sweating ( two and three times a day she changed her undies ) . What might have been Morroe made memory . Crossing gloomy years he landed in Siberia ( Prince M , redeemingher harlot 's soul like a pawn ticket ) , then Vilna ( a wonder-working rabbi ordering out her dybbuk ) , then Auschwitz ( she sneaked him SS slops to keep his pitiful bones together ) , then settled , reluctantly , for thep201Catskills . For five days and nights at Blau 's Star House , limousine service from Times Square , modified Americanplan , a good place for friendly professionals . He , a substitute in the junior high school system  --  three times a glottal g had cost him a permanent 's license  --  she , fresh from commercial courses , keeping books ( two sets ) for the manager .

On the second night he tried out some verse ( 1 like my body when it is with your body ... ) and instructedher in political economy ; she quickly grasped the labor theory of value . On the third night his hands got sexy , but her " Please do n't . . . " nearly stopped his heart . On the fourth night she made him sign what she had that afternoon typed : " I , Morroe Rieff , do promise Goldie Bromberg faithfully that if , as and when she lets me do what only one boy did before I will see her in the city ; " and allowed him ten minutes of free play with a breast . On the fifth night he begged for satisfaction , she for time . To sublimate , they sang till his last possible limousine . Before boarding he gave her Engels on Capital ; she gave him her red and white graduation album . ( First comes love/ Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Five minutes in the city he called person-to-person , talking to her for two dollars and seventy-seven cents . Come Friday , her mother was serving him cold soup and warm soda , her father had ears only for the radio , her kid brother beat him at hand wrestling . A long nine weeks later , the wedding.  | ( It took him three embarrassing tries to smash the wineglassunderfoot . ) The caterer charged him for three empty tables . The waiters kept back half a case of whiskey . A fat cousin from Cleveland made a speech , told jokes . ( " I got here a special telegram to the groom . The telegram says , and I quote , I did n't get in last week . Stop . You should only have better luck tonight . Stop . Signed , Alfred Landon . ' " ) Alone at last , Goldie fled his embrance . The ceremony 's excitement , she explained , or a misreading of the calendar ; the same thing had happened to her mother . Ten , make it eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breech birth , assbackwardas he would be in all things . He cried when Morroe went near , he ruined Goldie 's breasts , he retainedtoo much water and his first teeth gave promise of costly orthodontia . But sweets he loved , also fatty foods . ( A thyroid condition , the doctor pooh-poohed . ) At age two they put him on a pony for a picture ; he fainted . At age four he hit and spit , feared dogs , birds and bicycles , suffered nightmares , but could tell time and rattle off the Pledge of Allegiance . At age six he was breaking both arms , chipping an anklebone , reading 3B readers . His little poems were the talk of the school . ( As I went in the street one day/ I saw some children play/ To play with them I thought will be/ The nicest thing that ever can be . ) At age eight he made three BMs a week , tipped the scales at seventy-one pounds , bungled his kites , could not skate even on one skate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote his own speech ) he drownedp203in rough Rockaway water . ( Irony of ironies : Seymour could swim with the best ! ) Goldie ate out her heart , grew sick from the diet . ( A little bicarb and get someone for the windows , the doctor pooh-poohed . ) After the first exploratory she dreamed often of dead Seymour ; he was in the street calling , " Throw me down a cruller ! " or with Mrs. Roosevelt in the White House , showing off his Palmer penmanship . After the second  --  so it should n't be a total loss they removed her appendix  --  he bought Goldie a quilted bed jacket , he told her how clean he kept the house , how nicely he took care of his meals and needs , how in two weeks ' time they would be watching Kay Francis and John Boles . When her pain permitted , they sang radio songs . ( " Ramona/ The missionbells are calling you/ Ramona . . . " and " Every night I hear her croon/ A Russian lullaby . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bleak House , skipping big chunks . On the rainy day before she died he wrote out and signed what she dictated : " I , Morroe Rie t , do promise Goldie faithfully that if , as and when , without hurting my health , I will miss her and always think about her . " Five , make it seven months later , he married an assistant principal ; they lived on his salary and banked hers . With a sob , Morroe stirred , crammed his foot into his shoe and rose unsteadily . Then he squatted , and slowly , systematically got to work . He pulled up handfuls of weed and grass from around Goldie 's grave . He gathered twigs , and with the sharp end of one twig speared leaves . He arranged and rearranged the pebblesp204so that they might spell her name ; at D he ran out . He used the teeth of a tiny pocket comb on bird droppings and his handkerchief on her poor snapshot . Although the stooping posture fired an old neuritis and spots like giant sperm bombarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barehanded , he stripped away moss and mildew . With blunt , tireless strokes he tamped down Goldie 's shabby coat of earth and beheaded a last wretched weed . The marble bench he lifted off the ground and carried five steps away ; let it not rest so heavy on her feet . What was left of his comb he scraped and scraped against a lousy kid 's scrawl . What was left of his handkerchiefhe flicked at a vagrant grub , sending it elsewhereto turn butterfly . He bade goodbye to Goldie : Goldie , goodbye . Goodbye , Goldie . Likewise , Seymour . Then he took a short run and sprang over the flower bed , nearly breaking his ass . Back on the path he looked right and left , high and low , even shooting a glance at the top of a tall tree , but saw only cemetery . He began to walk , picking out the freshest set of tire marks to follow ; near the main gate he finally caught up with an ice cream truck doing good business . Making haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty and so quiet he heard his own choppy steps and the wash of his blood , deep , dangerous , as if an animal spoke through his skin . A squadron of geese ( crows ? ravens ? ) dove out of the sun and honked him : Schmuck ! Schmuck ! Schmuckschmuck schmuckschmuck ! Whereupon he broke into a jog , then a trot , then a gallop , and it seemedp205to him , while he covered ground and went nowhere , that his hair was thinning , his cells altering , his forces failing , that the world was aging and turning cold , that somewhere an assassin had moved to the center of a crowd , a child been born to punish the race . For a foolish moment he considered setting fire to leaves and sending smoke signals , but he had no matches , let alone blanket . When his roundabout route brought him past Goldie 's plot he froze and a little cry leaped out . And with his whole spirit Morroe called upon the Ribono Shel Olam , constructing an arthritic old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than enough ! he half-pleaded , half-commanded . Let him only see the end of this day and he would dedicate himself to a life of service and good deeds ; he would pay the balance on his U.J.A. pledge , plus a fresh ten dollars . Although awaiting the bleeding of a rock , the floweringof a dead twig , he finally made do with a wind-blown tissue . Where the hot little gust took it he went , till the path parted ways . Instinct said go left , Morroe disregardedthe advice . A few gnats ( mosquitoes ? wasps ? ) immediately rushed him , raising a beautiful blister on the fat part of his lip . He scaled a railing , pushed through a straggly shrub and took shelter near the granite pedestal of a bronze-tinted statue . David pluckinga lyre for half a dozen frisky lambs . One of which gave Morroe a nasal " Shalom . " He cringed , sucked air , and was on the the verge of prostrating himself . When from around the pedestal limped a big sloppy stoop-shouldered woman wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers . She scanned him with the dark-red gaze of an abused bear . At last , she cleared her throat and wheezed , " Hahbrukkenbeskitt . " Morroe mildly told her that she must have the wrong party , that he had done her no injury . Further , such language was unsuited to one so high in her descending years . Bobbing her head and with finger commanding attention , she pantomimed stooping , the pain of stooping , lifting , the impossibility of lifting . He turned out his pockets to show no change , but she would n't take notice . " Vei iz mir , " she mumbled , " mir iz vei , " and clasped one of his hands between her own , coaxing him slowly along . On the other side of the pedestal he saw a big wicker basket loaded with goldenbrownsalt-dotted pretzels . He made up his mind not to buy and waved her off . Wailing , " Gottenyu ! " she sold him on another look at the basket . " This ? " He pointed to the cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue and nails . " This is where all the trouble is ? The tzoo-riss ? " " Hahbrukken beskitt , " she said , all smiles . He patiently explained that the handle was hopeless , beyond repair , a lost cause . " Nisht kenn ficksen . " She grasped the basket by the width , then by the length . She tugged with one hand , then with both , and when it would n't budge she whimpered and tottered . " Ah , ah-hah , " Morroe cried . He now understood.  | " Without a handle no good . No grip , no . . . purchase . Too schwer . " " Schwer . " " You want , you want me to lift it up for you ? Ich zoll li f ten ? " " Rachmaniss . " He grabbed and yanked and almost lost his balance . Pretzels spilled off the wooden pegs . A splinter pierced his palm . His eyes ran . His joints cracked like gun shots . His body shook like a wet dog . He tried three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the basket was unbelieveably heavy . As if it lay undersea , fathoms deep . " Lady , " he cried , " lady , what is in here ? " She said , " Tzooriss " and broke into sobbing . He dried his hands . He spread his legs . He sank his knees . He tipped the basket against the platform of his left hip . He worked the handle across his back and shoulders and under his right armpit . He braced , he sank his knees a little more , he rocked , he slowly rose , and the basket rose with him . " Here , " he rasped , " here . " With mouth and brows he signified to the old girl that this was the limit of his good nature , that while he wished her only the best she must now take over . But she had already turned away , limping fast . He stumbled after , in a husky voice calling , " Whoosh , whoosh , lady . Dei . Dir . Eich ! "  |p208He  got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he bellowed , using up the rest of his voice . " Come take . Take ! Nemt ! " She shed upon him a look full of love . Cursing her in his heart , Morroe wavered into motion again . After a few steps sweat trickled down his forehead and beneath his arms . After a few more he had a parched throat and butchered ribs from the bumping basket . Three , then four strides ahead , the old girl paced him , making good time . Dust billowed up behind her , causing him to sneeze a great wracking sneeze . He was about to tell her that she could at least reach into his pocket for tissues , but the Yiddish fled his mind . Anyway , he soon had other troubles . For under the right armpit he was itchy , and the fingers of his left hand were puffy and red . Then he heard the sound of cracking wood . Then he felt the handle very slowly slip its mooring . Then in a tormenting arc the basket swayed one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his moan brought the old girl scuttling back . " Mazeltov , " she cackled mirthlessly . Morroe 's impulse was to cast a coin and try a fast getaway . But half a good turn , he estimated , made him less than a mensch . So he restacked pretzels and tried coming to an understanding with the old girl . He brought out that he stood ready anytime to do a favor . " Jewshartz , " she beamed.  |p209He  was , though , neither truck nor horse . " Hatruck .. horse . " " Fehrt , " she corrected hoarsely . He believed that two sets of hands were needed here , at the very least . " Tzvei . " " Ah kronkeh kidney . " He was not in the best of health either . To her he looked fine . At this he wished her a cordial " Gut yonti ff " and took off . She wrestled him back . " Habedboy ! " she upbraided . Though she kept pinching and squeezing his fingers he firmly refused to go through life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She wet him with tears , but conceded . At his " Whoosh ! " they lifted the basket from opposite sides ; it rankled him to see how smoothly and swiftly her side was airborne . When he had used up his second wind she was still on her first . And the limp , where was her limp ? She who had been lame as a Turk had all of a sudden speed to burn . He asked how far he must yet go , how long he must be thus burdened . " Vie lahng ? " " Zum train . " Had n't he seen a nearby bus ? He had seen such a bus . " Hahbus . " With such a load they would close doors in her face . " Antehsemiten . " Then she put on speed . Then he matched her pace.  |p210Then  he could no longer match it . Then he dropped into a panting walk , thinking , This is n't fair ; after all , she 's got sneakers . Then she too slowed down , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mournful quietude of many eyes . And comments from all sides rained in his face . " When she dies he wo n't have to feel guilty . " " He 's doing the right thing . " " My Ronnie would also be so devoted ! " " I respect him for it . " " Keep a mother with you how long you can . " " To look at him he does n't even look Jewish . " In no time the old girl was set up and selling . " Hadime ! " she cried . " Take fahadime ! " Morroe , at his end , made it three for a quarter . " How about a bag ? " a woman asked . " Put in a bag . " He told her no bags . Another customer claimed she had said one but he had given three . " Vei iz mir , " he wailed softly . " Mir iz vei . " There were mutterings by some that the pretzels were dry and old and had his flavor . " Rachmaniss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was that had soured the smell of one pretzel . He said , with a thick tongue , " Tzooris . " Soon he lacked nickels . After another flurry of customers he needed pennies and dimes.  |p211Minutes  later he was altogether without silver . He turned to ask the old girl for change . " Change ! " While she was counting and recounting Morroe just happened to notice a fat baldy sticking his nose among the pretzels and squeezing the life out of them . Before he could open a mouth the nervy character had mangled two pretzels , sampled from another and , without buying , blithely walked off . Incensed , Morroe gave chase , hissing " Goniff ! " and " Chutzpah ! " and scanning the ground for something to hurl , though the walks were crowded and he had a wild arm . For twenty yards , make it twenty-two , he kept the cranium in sight . But he had suddenly to stop . To blink . To shut his eyes as it came straight at him : a dazzle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and a few blinks later he squeezed into focus two Yeshivah students , maybe young rabbis , caressing , embracing , while sun played on a pair of glossy red beards . But then he spotted the cranium and was on his way again , chuckling a dirty chuckle , burping from the murderous excitement of what he planned for this character . How he would sting him , strip him of dignity , bring him low , put him down with a strident , " Hey , Baldy ! " He zigzagged , he closed in fast and stretched out a hand like a cop stopping traffic . When he was yanked by the coat tail and hauled back , one leg widowed in the air . As best he could Morroe turned himself around . And there stood Ottensteen . Likewise , Levine and Weiner . " Constraint , " said Weiner . " Forbearance , " said Levine.  | " Schweig , " said Ottensteen . Morroe heard himself say a dreamy " Oh , hi . . . " " I 'm not interested and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coattail . " But if I was interested  --  " And Ottensteen flung him to Levine , who flung him to Weiner , who flung him back to Ottensteen , who started him walking with soft little punches to his behind. "  --  and did n't mind some aggravation I would ask how , how it is that you are my own personal Moloch Hamoviss . I would try to find out why you decided Felix Ottensteen is in your way and should n't remain on earth . I would be also a trifle curious to hear where you were that you are so dirty and what exactly you were doing that you are so out of breath and red in the face . Then . . . " " When you 're getting a hernia , " Morroe softly said , walking with an awful hobbling motion , " how do you tell ? " . . then I would n't wish you harm . Everything should be all right , everything should be very nice and the way you like it . With maybe one exception ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it two lefts , left and right ? " " Left , left again at the Horwitz plot , but half-right at Kaplan , " said Weiner. " . . . you should start to roll a little bit . And once you start rolling you should n't be able to stop . You should have to go from bed to . . . " " A pretzel ? " said Levine . " I am enamored of those pretzels . " " Who can get near on that line ? " said Weiner.  | " . . . bed and from house to house , from street to street , from town to town , from lakes to rivers and rivers to seas , from up the hills and down the hills , from around the mountains and between the mountains , from cold places to hot places ... " " Vei iz mir ! " Morroe started to say , but changed insteadto " Wait and hear ! " " . . . from every wood and every field , from where they have only night to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hands of Titus , from where you 'll twitter like a bird to where you 'll bark like a dog , from where you 'll be fatter than a barrel to where you would n't even have a shadow , from world to world and between worlds . . . . " Ottensteen snuffled grimly and sighed as though he had been weeping for hours . Then he said , " Nu , what happened ? " " What happened ? " Morroe halted in mid-step . " You want to hear what happened .... " Levine said , " It 's Horowitz , not Horwitz . " Weiner said , " Call me pisher for an o . " " Well , what happened was . . . " There were ups and downs in Morroe 's voice , and he shivered like a somnambulistshocked out of sleep . In slow motion he searched his pockets , came up with Sight Savers , peeled one off and began to expressively clean his glasses , as if to say , See , I am coming up with a Sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning my glasses . ' He next worked dental floss between each and every tooth ; on the third time around a barefaced lie flew into his mind . And limping forward , one arm cleaving the air , the other frozen over his heart , Morroe told all that hadp214lately befallen him . How while only a moment and a step away from his fellow mourners  --  he had even hissed and snapped fingers to catch their eyes  --  a funny thing happened to him . How he had been hailed and halted . How an old man , no taller than five feet , had tipped his worn black bowler at him . How the little fellow had tremblingly inquired if he was Jewish . How he had next put to him other questions : Was his father alive , and his mother ? Did he live with his father ? Did he see him and visit him ? Was his father one who knew his way around a synagogue and how to wear a tallith ? Had his father  --  to whom he sent regards  --  taught him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , looking like he was internally bleeding , whispered his shame and sorrow . How for the unveiling of Klonsky 's stone the Society was lacking one to make a minyan . How he , himself , the recording secretary , had sent out postcards where he needed letters and letters where he needed telegrams . How for five , make it ten minutes of next-to-no trouble , nine pairs of lips would recite Morroe'smerits into God 's ear . And Morroe told further how he had given way to the little fellow , how where there were nine he had made the holy tenth . How with the baring of the stone he had begged nine pardons , but friends would be wondering . How a shopping bag had materialized , and how from this shopping bag slivovitz and honey cake were taken . How he was put on strict notice that nine sets of feelings would be hurt if he refused a sip and a snip . How with plenty , make it enough time , he had scooted off . How en route , in medias res @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had suffered a dizziness , a wooziness , an upset in his stomach . How a kindly caretaker had turned over his john . How there he relieved himself of all he had that day eaten , and more . How feeling , even so , as miserable as man has ever felt , yet worried for the worries of his friends , he had ventured out . How in this state he had been set upon and ill-used . For quite some time the boys gave Morroe rapt attention , and though he looked passable he felt a vague presentiment of panic . But just when he revised one or two details  --  the little fellow sprouting a few inches , the hat a regular fedora , at most a brown derby  --  Levine spoke up . " Do n't , ah , do n't disregard the likelihood of a virus . " And Weiner , arching the back of a hand around Morroe'sbrow , " A definite hundred-and-a-half , a possible hundred-and-one . " " You stop off at a fruit store , " Ottensteen put in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , you stuff yourself with citrus . " ' Morroe 's spirit expanded . In his shy and goofy way , under his lashes , he gazed at the boys . He was that minute ready to die for them . Or at least to do them big favors . He thought , They may not respect me , but they like me . He also thought , They wish me no great good , but they would n't want harm to come to me . And then they went up a little rise . And then they went down a little incline.  |p216And  they bore right . And they bore half-left . And the fine warm spray of an alabaster fountain was blown upon them . And there was a children 's plot with little sun dials and a soft blue ark and stone beasts and birds and fishes in the grass , and they passed beyond this . And there were family plots for Blaustein , Engel , Danzig , Applebome , Barchoff , Schneierson , Nass , Lowey , Diamond , Kratter , and they passed beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one they entered . And Morroe moistened his lips and braced his shoulders and took down some deep stiff breaths . And it came to him that so he had often entered Leslie 's living room . And then Levine ran a finger over the flap of Morroe'sleft pocket and over his left sleeve . And Levine said to him , " What is this stuff , this substance ? " And Levine further said , " It , ah , feels like , it has the consistency of . . . " And Levine touched finger to mouth and softly spoke this word : " Salt . " First called up to the graveside was Maurice Salomon , who had this to say : that Leslie 's mind and temperament were sternly moral ; that it had been his role , his unique function in both fiction and criticism to deal with matters and circumstances which the American character  --  pluralistic , fragmented and debauched by commercialismp217would not readily admit to consciousness ; that he had confronted life not with the armor of bias or the cant of dogma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that he undertook to tell us what it was for the individual to be alive at this moment in history ; that he had conceded nothing to the times , but had over and again borne personal testimony that IT IS and I AM ; that because of the vigor , the purity and passion of this testimony  --  the moral thrust  --  he claimed our attention . Next spoke Arabelle Talbot Harrington , and she lauded Leslie as teacher , as one who delighted in instructing and who instructed by action and example . It gave her great pleasure to remember now that some years back she had been entering a cafeteria with Leslie ; and suddenlythere had stepped forward a derelict , an outcast , a human discard , a representative of the urban underbelly : a bum . He had begun to exhort them with his whiskey-ruinedvoice . No , not for a handout , but a loan to be paid back in proper course and due time . You see , Mac , Lady . . . a dishwashing job . . . a week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . served in the last one , Mac , Lady . Thereupon Leslie had handed over a quarter . And with gravity and gentle ceremony he had proffered an old bill stub bearing his name and address and advisedthat he would look for payment in an early mail . Arabelle had later chided him . Why the pretense ? The farce ? Was he so new to the City , to such small swindles ? Having been fool for the quarter , must he make himself more fool with the bill stub ?  |p218And  Leslie had said this , and this is what Leslie had said : " With the quarter I found my own humanness ; with the bill stub I restored his . " Next called was Ottensteen . His arms folded , his head low , his gaze turned inward , he said that though he was just now too filled up he would anyway do his best for his dear and very good friend . And he reminded all present , in case they did n't know , that in the Passover Hagadah , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Children of Israel in forty years on the desert , there was after every single item the word Dayenu : It would have been sufficient . If , for example , God had just sent manna but did n't bother handing out the Ten Commandments  --  Dayenu . If He handed out the Ten Commandments but did n't see to their drinking water  --  Dayenu . And similar , and such . This word , this Dayenu now stood written on his mind . So . . . if Leslie had been only a highly intelligent person and not a writer  --  Dayenu . If he had been only a writer of stories and did n't bother with his articles  --  again , Dayenu . If he had written his articles and did n't have his outstanding personality  --  once again , Dayenu . If he had this personality and did n't like people  --  again and again , Dayenu . If he had just liked people and did n't have on them an influence  --  Dayenu and sufficient . If he had just had an influence and not been sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sincere , sincere but not sweetAnd many minutes later , though he was choking on a Dayenu , Ottensteen was eased , gently eased away fromp219the graveside , and there came forward the folksinger , Leroy Gillman . Who said that though he was non-Jewish , though he was a Negro and not too familiar with the observances , he felt it properly right to sing ; because that was the way of his people and he knew no better way to let a heart speak . What he would sing had been meant as a farewell , a goodbye for a certain prince hundreds of years back ; it was now fittingly natural for this prince of a guy . He accordingly sang : " Bonnie Charlie 's now awa ' Safely owre the friendly main ; Mony a heart will break in twa , Should he no come back again . Will ye no come back again ? Will ye no come back again ? Better lo'ed ye can not be , Will ye no come back again ? " Even after Leroy 's last note went pining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four diggers ; even after they had set it on that evil-looking contraption and jacked it up , and it hung and then slid into the pit ; even after he flung his handful of dirt ; even after the shovels flashed and chipped and smoothed ; even after Leslie 's little father shouted out , " No man should live to bury a son ! " ; and even after Ottensteen , Weiner and Levine bawled openly , Morroe held back . Shithead , he labeled himself , horse 's ass , peculiar creature . You could cry when the planes shot King Kong off the Empire State Building . You could cry whenp220Wallace Beery slapped Jackie Cooper and then punished his hand . You could cry when Lew Ayres reached for that butterfly . But even so , nothing wet came from his eyes . From somewhere a glass pitcher was produced and Ottensteen took charge . " Rinse , shlimazel . A Jew must n't go from the cemetery unless he washes off . " The water he dispensed sloshed over Morroe 's cupped palms and miserably wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth but muttered only a mild " Whoosh " ; small penance for Klonsky and the nine . Anyway , the trousers at least were drip-dry . So he blottedhis hands on his tie , then discreetly peeled off the soaked sock and gave it a burial under his heel . While thus engaged his eye chanced to fall on Inez , who seemed to be acting in a mysterious way . She was cutting in and out and back and forth across the plot . She was bounding from one group to another . She was winking and blinking at Hal Essrig even as Phil Houseman had her arms trapped . She was flashing a significant look at Leo Munich even as Gary Lehrer whisked grass from her hem . She was putting her lips to Pearl Frey 's ear even as she rumpled Millie Penn 's hair . She was tapping her shoe against Jack Marrin 's shoe even as she hugged and squeezed Norman Falk . She was using Francine Zober 's lipstick even as she mouthed a secret syllable for Arabelle Harrington . She was kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three fingers , make it a whole hand at Jim Newman . And then , though Morroe momentarily lost sight of her and would have sworn that when last seen she had been ten graves away , Inez was standing before him and the boys . To him she said , " Why did n't you bring Ellen , baby ? I was looking for Ellen . " To the boys she said , " You boys are like family , so I do n't have to ask . Do I have to ask ? Will I see you at the house ? I 'll see you ! " " I would love to , " Ottensteen said , " and I was looking forward ... " " Do n't tell Maurice . He asks where you 're going , you 're going to Otto Popkin and you 're going to get the key he has to Jane Finkel 's cellar and you 're going to take Leslie 's old volley ball set over to Al Zackerblud. " " . . . but certain parties saw to it , they made sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting pains and right now all I can tell you is . . . " " Forget about the pizza , sweetie , we 're not going to have pizza . We 're not not having pizza , but we 're not havingpizza pizza . I have marinara sauce , I 'll take the marinarasauce , I 'll put it on English muffins , it 'll be good , good , good ! " " ... I 'm oysgamitched . " And Weiner said he was pooped . And Levine said he was fatigued . And Morroe said nothing , only opening and closing fingers to indicate that the decision was not in his hands.  |p222But  by and by they had it all settled , and with the help of Inez they had worked out these arangements : let Ottensteen feel better on his feet and he would telephone Weiner . Let Weiner hear from his mother that all was well and get Ottensteen 's call then he must telephone Levine . Let Levine find a quick and easy parking space and thus be home to answer then he must telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must telephoneInez . Let Inez find herself without English muffins , then she must remind Morroe to buy and bring . Let Morroe , having no fever and getting no reminder from Inez , play it safe and pick up English muffins anyway . Then with a " Good ! Good ! Good ! " and a " Fine ! Fine ! Fine ! " Inez was on her way again . Morroe , caught by an impulse , bolted after her . " Listen , Inez , " he said . " Inez , listen . If tonight I ca n't . . . if we do n't . . . I 'll definitely call . . . be over . . . coming week . " She hollered back that she would make a dinner . And warned that he would be unwelcome , that he would be thrown out and on her shit list forever if he arrived without Eileen . As they neared the main gate Levine 's eyes turned glassy . A white spot appeared on the tip of his nose , a fine dew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kicked at a pebble , but missed . He walked around in tiny circles . He went " Umumumum , " and " Ahahahah . " He escapedp223Weiner 's grasp , then Morroe 's and after a short run skidded to a stop alongside a green Chevrolet . Addressing the running board he said , " Sir . . . ah , fellah . . . friend . . . " It took some time to unlock Levine 's bumpers from the Chevy 's bumpers , and in the process Morroe got himself a beautiful cut from a rusted license plate . He was dabbing it with his last tissue and squeezing to bring blood when the pretzel lady passed by . From what he could see she was practically sold out.  |p224IN  A SECOND-RUN HOUSE Off Times Square Morroe ate pretzels while watching a revival of King Solomon 's Mines . Suddenly Leslie , wearing a pith helmet and short pants , shlumped out of the jungle . Hey , hey , what are you doing there ? Morroe wanted to know . Here ? Here I 'm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look shorter ? How come you look so short ? How come ? How come is I said schmuck to a witch doctor ! He sprang from his seat to follow Leslie into the brush , but found himself in The Informer . After betray/ing Leslie he treated half of Dublin to egg creams . The rest of his twenty quid he tossed to herself , Inez , then had second thoughts . But she would n't give back the money . They struggled ; while they struggled Seymour huffed and puffed out of the fog . Rollerskating kids pursued , chanting " Fat , fat , the water rat . Fifty bullets in his cap . " He chased the chasers , yelling " Antehsemiten " and awakened to Ottensteen 's huge voice in his ear . " Your grandma should one night pine for you and decide to come down and pay a visit from heaven , and she should want to kiss you and you should drool and dribble on her the way you drooled and dribbled on me . " " Eifelsleep , " Morroe said through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up , " Ottensteen retorted . " Plenty old enough ! " Levine , beeping the horn , cried , " Ah ah , here now , for goodness sake . I deem that definitely out of order . " Weiner put in a " Gaah ! " and in a breathy voice said , " Felixel , not nice , Felixel ! Considering the circumstances . . . . Where we come from . . . . " " I was very tired , " Morroe burbled . " I was very tired and the engine noise must have relaxed me , plus with the top open it 's quite pleasant , and I dozed off , which shows you how I must have been tired for me to doze off like that , because in trains , in the most comfortable berths and roomettes I barely close an eye , I come away a wreck , and insofar as I dribbled and drooled that shows how I had to be very tired , since whenever I 'm tired I sleep with an open mouth , and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to salivate throughp226a gap , an opening in the bottom molars . You can see . You want to see ... ? " Twisting his mouth , he introduced a finger among his teeth . He waited till Ottensteen had taken a leery look , then said , " The glands  --  the salivary glands are very highly overactive . My dentist maintains that in all his practice he never saw anything like it . He calls me The Gusher . " With one hand Ottensteen slowly stroked and knuckled Morroe 's neck ; the other he rolled at Levine and Weiner in a gesture of mutual faith and hearty fellowship . " You should know already  --  " He cleared up a huskiness in his throat . " It 's not since yesterday you are dealing with der alte Ottensteen . You should realize he ca n't be honey to one and to another vinegar . He is far , very far from perfect , but this he is : he is true-blue . He ca n't play a role . He 's not two-faced . He does n't split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , not a sch-sch  --  " " Schizoid , " ventured Morroe. "  --  schemer . He opens a mouth , he falls on people , he makes them feel like two cents . He 's not happy doing it , but he does it . And if he opens a mouth on the person , the person should be able to see that der alte Ottensteen is driving at something , making in his special way a point . And what is his special way ? His special way is to hit and bark , to bark and hit . And the person should be able to understand that the hit is a love tap and the bark is a blessing . He should understand and appreciate . " " You do n't have to worry , Felix . I see these things . I 'm aware . " Knuckle by knuckle and finger by finger Morroe slowly broke Ottensteen 's grip on his neck . " Youp227would be surprised at how I know what goes on , how nothing gets by me . All right , I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I miss very little . Really . " He repeated the " Really , " holding it on his tongue like a Lifesaver , staring and staring into the rear-view mirror till he had trapped Levine 's , then Weiner 's eyes . " A big mouth  --  definitely . A mean mouth  --  possibly . A spiteful mouth  --  maybe . But a dirty mouth  --  " a handkerchiefflitted around Ottensteen 's eyes  --  " a dirty mouth der alte Ottensteen does n't have . You do n't hear him broadcast to the world that he can get it going and keep it going even when it 's after change of life . He tries to behave with a delicacy , a niceness , a . . . finekeit . And there 's plenty people his age and younger who do n't have finekeit . Take for an instance a certain Yiddish poet , a highly , highly eminent , you could say a genuine giant . This is a big name and you do n't need to hear it for the purposes of this conversation . Nahum Bimberger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking kindly across at him , Weiner answered , " Gaah , Holly , who cares ? It 's where you prefer . Whicheversuits you , your convenience . " " I have absolutely no preference , Barn . " " In that case , " reasoned Weiner , " I say take the bridge . Take the bridge and save the quarter . " " You are being silly , Barn , and I am surprised at you . Did anyone hear me mention anything about money ? Do n't mention the thirty-five cents as a factor and do not get me angry . " " Who says money is a factor ? What I 'm saying  --  Ip228am saying do only what 's best for you . Never mind going out of your way . I do n't want to take you out  --  " " Barn , bridge or tunnel , tunnel or bridge , I shall be happy . Tell me the route you , ah , chaps prefer . Tell me ! " " There 's two for downtown and two for uptown , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll cast a deciding vote . I 'll say tunnel . Tunnel ! " And Morroe was hanging over Levine 's seat and waving a dollar . " Here . " He let the wind blow the bill near Levine 's face . " Please . " He tried to slide it into Levine 's shirt pocket , but there was no pocket . " Take . " He began to tease and tickle Levine 's fingers with it . " Please . . . My pleasure . . . Courtesy of the road . " " NO ! No and no . " " I feel like it . Holly , if I did n't feel like it  --  " Morroe was tunneling through to Levine 's palm . " Do n't , do not get me angry , Morroe . " " I 'll let go and it will fly , fly away . One . . . two .. . two and a half ... " " Ah , ah , now I am getting angry . " " Use it in good health . " Slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then closed about the bill . " In the best of health . " " I am taking it because you are pestering and distractingme and are therefore liable to cause an accident  --  " " God forbid ! " Morroe gasped. "  --  but you are going to get change . I charge you , Barn , you . . . Your responsibility . . . Change . . . You must remind me . " " Oh , oh ! Whoosh ! I am veh-eh-eh-ry worried aboutp229the change ! " Morroe slapped himself on the cheeks and made believe he was gnawing his fingers . Silence followed . Then Ottensteen , using his lowest voice , said , " Maybe you 'll let der alte Ottensteen finish up Bimberger ? " " Absolutely . All ears , " said Morroe , looking avidly into Ottensteen 's mouth . " I am listening , Felix , " Levine sang out . " J'attends . " " Gaah , go , go ahead , " Weiner rushed in . " Finish him up .... Bimberger . " With tiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behind . " For a long , long period der alte Ottensteen did n't bother with Bimberger . How come ? Because one night he came over the house , he ate a dinner and after the dinner der alte Ottensteen excuses himself . He takes an aspirin and a little snooze . Suddenly  --  all of a sudden a geshrei , a gevald ! A pogrom in the living room . On bare feet and sick feet der alte Ottensteen runs over and he sees  --  he sees Bimberger has a hold of his late wife and is feelingher and carrying her in all her weight to the sofa . " He momentarily glanced down as his last snip of jacket emerged . " Hello , friend Felix . " l am not your friend . ' Why are you not my friend ? " Because you are a pig , a louse and a slob and you are behaving along dirty lines . ' Define a little your terms . " How should I define when you do n't even stop when I 'm talking ? " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing only because I 'm a good Jew ? " How does what you are doing make you a good Jew , you pig , you louse and you slob ? ' " Ottensteen dug around and under Morroe and plucked out a button.  | " Friend Felix , you do n't remember what the great Rabbi Isaac said ? Said Rabbi Isaac : From the day when they destroyed the Temple , from that day a good Jew can get pleasure from sexy intercourse only when he commits a sin . ' " Working thumb and forefinger between Morroe'ship and thigh , he deftly withdrew a thread . " For years , bad blood . The room and the restaurant Bimberger went into der alte Ottensteen left . Until finally and eventuallyder alte Ottensteen went over , he put out a hand and he said  --  he said : I do n't make up with Nahum Bimbergerthe pig , the louse and the slob . I make up with Nahum Bimberger the man , the master , the mind who gave the world once Meine Gruener Betler . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Life is far too short , " said Levine . " You sometimes have to look away , " said Weiner . Minutes went by . There was skimpy conversation : Levine , his manner anchored solidly in humanity and warmth , wondered if Weiner might stick a warning , a cautionary hand out to facilitate the changing of lanes , and Weiner wondered if Morroe might not take upon himself the task of checking the rear , and Morroe wondered if Levine might not put aside his sweet but stubbornyen to accommodate and deposit the boys at some place central and convenient . From Ottensteen generous comments sprang out : What the Deutscher wanted to build they knew how to build . . . . For the person who wanted a nice little automobile it was a nice little automobile . . . . Where you needed support the seats gave support . . . . He understood there were plenty , plenty around in Israel.  |p231And  then he came down with a fist on his knees . And then he put his head in his hands . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a thing of little worth . And then through a full nose he caroled , " **41;5011;TOOLONG ! " And Morroe chimed in with a " **31;5054;TOOLONG ! " And Weiner unloosed a , " Gaah , **28;5087;TOOLONG ! " And Levine went , " Merde-ah , merde , merde , merde , merde , merde alors . " Ottensteen said , " Should I tell you a secret ? Let der alte Ottensteen let you in on a big secret . The whole existenceis a joke and does n't pay . It . . . does . . . not .. . pay ! " Morroe said , " I wonder sometimes how people are able to get up in the morning . " Weiner said , " Why is life like a glass of tea ? Nu , so it 's not like a glass of tea . " Levine said , " La , ah , vida es sueno y los suen " os suen " os son . " Various postures were assumed : Ottensteen slumped in a way that made his suit seem three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near his crotch ; Levineworked his nostrils as though smelling smoke ; Morroestroked an invisible beard , then a neat little goatee . " Maurice Salomon told me  --  " Levine had to stop and deal with a shakiness in his voice . " Maurie mentioned that he would like to make the next Second Thoughts an all-Braverman issue . "  | " Wonderful . Wonderful , wonderful , " said Morroe . " How can they go wrong ? " Ottensteen wanted to know . " Far wrong they can not go . " Weiner endorsed the idea with a " Gaah ! " and , noddingand nodding , said , " I 'm not too hot on Second Thoughts . I mean , I 'm as good a realpolitiker as Maurie  --  Christ , I broke with the Trotskyites when I was fourteen . Fourteen ! Before I even got laid  --  so I do n't need him to tell me , that little kahnackeh , that atom bombs are dangerous . But . . . for Leslie . . . for Leslie I 'd write for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a way an assessment , but not  --  " "  --  ah , Barn , that , ah , Barn , has already been spoken for . One might say ... committed . " "  --  altogether an assessment . " " You , ah , might do well to try it out on the Mizrakh Monthly . Personally , I see it , I very definitely see it in the Mizrakh Monthly . The lead piece . I have only to call or drop a quick note to Rabbi Lippman and you are all set . Virtually in print ! " " Let me . Let der alte Ottensteen make the call and drop the note . " Ottensteen held up two fingers , one twisted so hard around the other that blood left both . " Here is how we are , Lippman and me , one to the other . To my say-so he pays strict attention . " " The Mizrakh Monthly , " Weiner whispered , his words all furry . " Who reads the Mizrakh Monthly ? I think once in my chiropodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me assure you , Barn , in certain circles and many quarters it is influential and well regarded . "  |p233Weiner  answered nothing . And some moments later Ottensteen spoke , " Now nomore Leslie . No more Labeleh . No more postcards : DearMr . President , when you are making up your cabineton me do n't count . ' No more rush-rush to where they areplaying the Marx Brothers . No more Toilet Thoughts . " " You remember those , gaah ? He would carry in anotebook , a little blue notebook and a pencil whenever he had to go .... " " Whoosh , wonderful stuff . Wonderful , wonderful . " " The comings and goings , the tos and fros , the back and forth of his mind . The stray thought pinned on a point in time . Myself , I recall with affection this one : The agonies of Auschwitz and Buchenwald were foreshadowedwhen the first Jewish housewife laid hands upon the neck of the first pullet . ' " " From his Taft Cafeteria period , " Weiner reflected . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Or the poignancy , the power and poignancy of : I feel sometimes like a bird who has not migrated in time . ' " " My favorite , you forgot my favorite one , " Weiner chided sadly . " I like shiksas , but I do n't like their brothers . ' " " That 's good , that 's quite good , Barn . " Levine cackled a bit . " But I happen to prefer God , ah , grant me the compassion , when I see a small man , to lean over and whisper to him . ' " " Take a guess where he produced that . From where the inspiration came . On der alte Ottensteen 's  --  " P234But Morroe , holding up his hand like a schoolboy , broke through with , " Excuse me , only I do n't get it . " " WHAT ? " Weiner swung a grumpy glance at him . " What do n't you get ? " " Never mind , " Morroe countered , heavyhearted . " ForgetI  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll have dealings with der alte Ottensteen . " " I snapped ? " Weiner whimpered . " What then  --  I snapped ? " " Here , here ! " and " Now , now ! " Levine said , with authority . " As far as I could make out , Barn , you did not snap . Still , there was to your tone a , ah , peremptory quality , a rather truculent edge which might well have given Felix the impression of a nature somewhat less than affable . " " See ! ' cried Weiner . " You see , Felix ? " " Meanwhile , " Levine was saying , " I believe Morroe had a point . Let us hear now from Morroe . " " Tiss , whoosh . . . " Morroe tried for light laughter , but it came out sinister snicker . " I forgot , practically , " he lied . " Oh , well . . . It was the pullet one . That one I do n't get , or if I get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . " What 's to get  --  " Morroe was aggressively aloof  --  " I do n't get . " " So , so ? " " Nu , that was n't a snap ? " " The point I 'm making is this . Thi-hiss is my point . . . . " Morroe had a sudden moment of pure absolutemindlessness ; he stopped to watch his thumbsp235beat each other . Next he thought , for no good reason , th at Latin , Latin would be in order ; and he wavered between coitus interruptus and nolo contendere before making do with non sequitur . " It 's a non sequitur . " " Not nice ! " Ottensteen cried out . " Should n't say ! " " As a matter of fact , " Morroe grabbed at an insight , " It 's not only a non sequitur , it does n't even follow . " " Where Leslie wanted it to go it went ! " Ottensteen allbut wept . His hands mounted on his thighs , his eyes grown big , Morroe said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does to a pullet to what they did in the camps ? You 're going to tell me Leslie went through a little vegetarian phase . Okay . But . . . chickens and men , whoosh ! " Morroe made as though to rest his case , then added , " And after all , since when is a kitchen sink a crematorium ? " That , that was good , he thought . The way I was able to drive in with that last point . From Ottensteen he got a nip on the cheek . From Levine a " Well played ! Well played ! " From Weiner , a gracious " Gaah ! " A good half-minute went by before he said , " You do n't think I was being too negative ? " They were surprised at the suggestion . " Because I think it would n't be at all a bad idea  --  it would be a terrific idea !  --  if they could put into that issue ten , make it twelve of his Toilet Thoughts  --  only with a different title  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ! Who has to box it ? A column rule allp236around , and each one set off with a two-line initial . And maybe this is not the time and I 'm not such a marvelous expert on layout , but if Maurie wants  --  only if he wants  - -  let him call and I 'll give him a little idea about the typography . But only if he wants .... " " A column rule , ah-hah . " Levine nodded toward Weiner and Weiner nodded toward Morroe . " And twolineinitials . " He nodded to himself and paused , seeming dazed by the windfall . And Morroe was all ready to inquire if anyone wanted a Hopje when Ottensteen said heavily , " What  --  what is the answer ? " To which Weiner made reply , " You know , that 's a good question . " He giggled and lowered his head as though expecting to be kissed by Ottensteen . " A good question , " he repeated , but Ottensteen had his hands teetering over them , shaping destinies . " Boys , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was met by strict attention . " For Leslie  --  for Labeleh we would want to do , only we can not do . " Small sounds of sorrow rippled through the car . " If I asked you , Boys  --  boys , cut off for our good friend a few of your years , donate a piece of your health  --  ' " He would not have to ask twice . " So what is it we would want to do that we can do ? We would want to do what we can do for the wife who is become a widow , for the children who are become orphans ... "  | " The older one is a little snotty , " said Weiner. " ... so der alte Ottensteen has come up with and conceivedan idea . Not an idea  --  say , a plan . All right , more than an idea and less than a plan . To understand , you need to understand the principles from which der alte Ottensteen operates . His principle is this  --  this is his principle : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " He gestured at Morroe like a band leader . " Let 's hear how you have to go ! " " You have to go , " Morroe told him , " like a sport . " " Nicely put . So . . . the plan is a fund . The fund should be for the girls . For later on . For an education . For an out-of-town school . For their little expenses when they get older . For the bottle toilet water . For the pink-andwhitestationery . For a good-looking valise to carry . You do n't know  --  you do not know how important a valise is to a young person . But der alte Ottensteen  --  " he had out his handkerchief  --  " knows . He  --  he remembers how he walked through his young years without a valise . How at age eleven and a half Jacob Riis sent him to a camp for sinus and he had to knock on the neighbors ' doors they should please do him a favor , maybe they have a shoppingbag not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . printing ! " Submerging under his handkerchiefhe blew , blotted and came up all business . " If a fund is going to be a fund calls for a name . Remember  --  requires number one it carries mention of a fund ; number two , it carries mention of a particular person ; number three , it carries mention of a particular purpose . Therefore I got in mind to call it  --  " He raised his palmsp238at Morroe . " Let me hear what I got in mind to call it ! " " We should call it , " Morroe told him , " The BravermanMemorial Fund ! " " Correction , correction please , " Ottensteen brightly said as he made love to Morroe 's shoulder . " The Leslie Braverman Memorial Fund . " Levine beeped the horn : two longs and a short . Weiner clapped hands . Ottensteen spoke again . " If a fund is a fund calls for one more thing . One more thing is vital and essential . What am I talking about ? In what particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular thing is . . . " And warily Morroe spoke the word : " Money . " " Celt ! " Ottensteen 's eyes moved and glittered as though following a dancing dollar sign . " Capital ! " Weiner said , " Good thinking , Felix . " And Levine said , " No funds without capital , Felix . " Then Ottensteen came back with , " So far  --  then so far der alte Ottensteen can safely say a ... " He got two " so goods " and a " wonderful . " Then Ottensteen alternately moaned and chuckled , and over his head a balloon seemed to rise , to hover , and in the balloon bulbs glowed and asterisks were ingested by question marks . He hummed " Cocktails for Two " and made it something cantorial . He hummed something cantorial and made it " Cocktails for Two . " And Morroe was somehow not surprised when Ottensteensaid , " Into five hundred , four goes how many times ? " And he was not surprised when a silence developed.  |p238And  he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , ah , not the money , Felix . . . " and Weiner with , " Gaah , it 's the money , it 's the money ! " And he was not surprised when Ottensteen put him down for the first hundred and twenty-five dollars . But his heart rose and sank , flooded and emptied when Ottensteen said , " Next week has to go out a special mailing . Dear Friend  --  Dear Friend of Leslie Braverman , we who compose and represent a special committee , an interested group , beh-meh-shmeh , and so forth . Has to go ! " . With a throb in his throat Morroe said , " Felix always writes a good letter . Always ! Even his postcards have  --  " " And what about releases ? " Weiner was asking Levine . " Ah , ah , " said Levine feebly . " But they , alas , require a highly special skill in the writing , a sense of the essential , a grasp of the fact as fact . And for such as we , engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not so-ho-oh special . Honest , with a little common sense anyone . . . all right , not anyone . . . " Morroe 's arms closed in to encompass only half the world . " Brochures ? " Weiner speculated . " One , one brochure ! " burst out Morroe . " And one even you do n't really  --  " " Stationery ? " Weiner was asking Levine . " By that you have in mind ... ? " " Paper , Holly . " " To hondle with the suppliers , to go around to the printers  --  is that for der alte Ottensteen and his sick feet ? "  |p240Weiner  said , " Lists . " " Letterheads . " Levine 's sigh could have snuffed out candles . " The compiling of lists . . . " " The designing of letterheads ... " " The choice of a type face . . . Bodoni ... Delphian . . . Century Expa-ann-ded . . . Futura . . . Futura BOLD ! " " The myriad colors , the myriad of colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peacock Green ... " " Peacock Green ? The day you use Peacock Green is the day you wave bye-bye to der alte  --  " " Black , black , black 's the best thing ! A nice neutral black ! " Morroe practically rose in his seat . " Maybe , maybe a reflex black ! " " Let me tell you people  --  " Ottensteen pressed Morroe against his side  --  " we got here an iron head . " Through his teeth Levine said , " While we were fumblingand fluttering  --  " "  --  he gets it first try ! Thwuck ! " Weiner punished the air with a judo chop . " Whoosh-ure ! " " One has the impress of a perception fine-tuned , a  --  " " Right away ! " "  --  sensibility at ease in the market of the common-place . " " Oh , every day . Every day ! " " And how about that he has a good heart ? " Accompanying himself with an imaginary fiddle , Morroehummed " Hearts and Flowers . " " Ah guten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And fifteen , make it twenty minutes later , while he grinned his shy and goofy grin , Morroe promised the boys that within a week the first solicitation letter and the first release would be in the mails ; that within ten days he would line up an executive committee , and the second letters and second set of releases would be in the mails ; that before the end of the second week he would write and plant small notices in the Sunday book sections , in a selected list of the journals and quarterlies , and a follow-upletter would be in the mails ; that in the middle of the third week a final follow-up and a thank-you to the first contributors would be in the mails ; that if direct mail proved a disappointment by the fourth week they might well give thought to a per-plate dinner . Not that it 's a craft , his mind told him , but you know your craft . It also told him , You are being had . So I 'm being had . You are being snowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . You need it ? It 's my nature . But still in all , when Levine took the bridge and made no mention of his dollar , Morroe was sore , he was a little bit sore . Coming out of the phone booth Weiner 's lip trembled , and one side of his face , a nostril and an ear were tinged apricot.  |p242With  gravity , with utmost yearning and sorrow , he announced , " I rang and I rang and ... " Like a bullet-gutted movie gangster clinging , but just barely , to life , he fell into the car . " ... I rang . " " She could be where she could n't answer on the minute , " Ottensteen cheerily said . " A son is only a son , " Levine comforted , " but a call from Mother Nature . . . " " Momma would answer , " Weiner said . " She would answer . " In his far-off gaze he seemed to be watching her leap from operating tables , vault subway turnstiles , jimmy locks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She realized she needed a container of milk , a quarter of a pound of butter , wax paper . She ran down and in that minute  --  in that second , whoosh ! " Weiner shook his head . " Cold cuts , a roll ? It 's Sunday , it 's hot , she did n't feel like cooking , preparing .... " " She did n't feel like cooking ? She did n't feel like preparing ? " " Then I 'll still say milk . Can a person  --  a person can never have too much milk in the house . " In 1938  --  " Weiner 's apricot tinge heightened , subsided , heightened , stayed heightened  --  " in 1938 she ran out of ketchup . But , all right . It 's modern times . Automation , nuclear power , she could n't carry , they forgot to send . She 's having a good day on her hip , she 'll go down . She wants to pick up an item . So where ? Therep243is , gaah , Irving Number One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who kisses her hands when she walks in , is closed on Sunday . But Irving NumberTwo  --  Irving Number Two who is open even on Yom Kippur she would n't go into if he gave her a million dollars and a jar of instant coffee . Because , gaah , though she went to his daughter 's honor roll party , though she rang bells to send him customers , though I used to have to take home his jumbo brown eggs , though he 'd knock on his window if she forgot to give him a Hello Irving , though he visited her three times when she was in traction , he sinned . He failed her . There is a store full of customers , she walks in with two deposit bottles , he picks one up , he says to her , This one I will positively identify as not my bottle ! ' Since then . . . from that day . . . gaah . . . " Ottensteen said she had had a right to spit in his face . Morroe wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levine said das Ewig Weibliche . Then Weiner sat a moment longer . Then he made an effort to rise . Then he abandoned the effort . Then he clamped a hand over his mouth , as though restraining an impulse to vomit . " She went to a neighbor , " Morroe began again . " She realized she was out of milk , she went to a neighbor and just that second , just those few minutes . . . " He sighed , implying vast ironies and coincidences . " She 's looking for the super , " said Ottensteen . " Tillp244you find out where they are , till they come to a door , till they put away the bottle  --  you know when you have to deal with the schwartzes . . . " " Heh-heh , " went Levine . " You could have been all along misdialing . I recall that , ah , Ruddick , in a fairly recent paper , cited the fantastic prolix of lapses to which the ego succumbs under the impress of extreme anxiety . Sometimes , ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Weiner cried . " I 'm just understandablycurious . " He put a finger on the windshield and traced a cross , then converted the cross into a shaky Mogen David . " Naturally , naturally . " Levine started the engine . " But now for home . Home , old sport . " " The best place . You 'll go upstairs , you 'll squeeze yourself a citrus  --  " "  --  and I am willing to bet by that time  --  whoosh ! " "  --  by that time  --  " Weiner was converting the Mogen David into something phallic  --  " she 'll be reaching me . She 'll be burning up the wires . " But three , make it four blocks from his building , he began to fidget , to scratch madly at his face . And within a half-block of his building he had panickedLevine into a short hard stop , had made for the inside of a bar , had emerged moaning " Gaahsoutoforder ! " and had broken across the street for another bar . Then his face , big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun roof . " I 'm getting a busy signal ! " Then he was moving leisurely against traffic.  |p245Then  he was inside the bar . Then he was waving and whistling , waving and screaming , " Busy ... still ... " Then he was back in the bar . Then he was over the sun roof , his loving glance lighting upon each in turn . " You know what ? " He got two " whats ? " and a " comment ? " " She was by Irving Number Two . " " Am I smart , " demanded Morroe , " or am I smart ? " " They made up . " " In that respect she 's like der alte Ottensteen . He also ca n't hold a grudge . " " She has eggs for me . And pot cheese . " " The pot cheese around my way  --  whoosh-echh ! " " I 'll bring . A pound for you , a pound for Felix , a pound for Holly . You 'll all have . And as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for only a second . " ... I 'll have her make her split pea and barley soup . " They hated to impose . " What kind of impose ? I 'll tell you what . I 'll . . . tell .. , you . . . what ! " He gestured as though offering a toast . " On Thursday the Griffith is starting their RandolphScott festival . Coroner Creek and Frontier Marshal . We 'll make a night of it . First we can have the soup , or we can go first and then , gaah , have the soup . " Either way would suit all . " So it 's definite ? " All asserted that it was definite . Yet Weiner had taken no more than six steps fromp246the car before he turned and spoke through the megaphoneof his hands . " Should I check anyway ? " Three times Levine beeped the horn , and three times more . On the way to Ottensteen 's Morroe mumbled that they had made excellent time , that he had been wrong in advocating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves money and time . But Levine played dumb about his dollar . One hand stroking the other , his face acknowledging sad truths , Ottensteen crooned , softly crooned : " Rai-rai-rai-rai-rai Rai-rai-rai-rai-rai Rai-zai-banjo on my knee . " And he took hold of Morroe 's sleeve and Levine 's collar before saying , " Boys  --  boys , it 's no good . It 's definitely not good . " " In a way , " said Morroe , " it 's the system . " " Vuss fahr ah system ? " " The nervous system , " Morroe foolishly cracked , " the transit system ... " But Levine diverted Ottensteen with , " All things are water . " He added , " Ah , according to Thales . " " You do n't say ? That 's what he said ? That 's how he put it ? All . . . thing . . . are . . . water ! " And Ottensteencried , " All things are gall ! All things are acid ! All things are . . . pishachts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own cuffs ,  |p247teetering  on the running board , Ottensteen was out of the car . He slammed the door and used the same sweep of hand to flick a finger at Morroe . " You are going to soon make a certain stop . That stop is going to be  --  where is it going to be ? " " That stop is going to be at a store . " " You 're going to buy in the store an item . That item  --  " "  --  will be a nice citrus . " " And with the citrus you 'll do what ? With the citrus  --  " " I 'll squeeze juice , or I 'll eat it as is . " And without a goodbye , Ottensteen turned . Paunch upthrust , thumbs linked in the small of his back , with crisp short steps he entered the hotel . He could be seen all the way to the elevator , where he stood facing the rear ; when last seen he was still facing the rear . " Whoosh , " said Morroe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . . . to buy a few cents ' worth of citrus ... can I ask them to change twenty ? " " Ah , " Levine waved down his scruples , " definitely , definitely . " " I 'd say come up , " Morroe told Levine , " but ... " ... my wife ca n't stand you , he silently declared . " I could n't , ah , anyway . " Levine 's intonation was charged with the irony of one plainly intended for better things . " Were you here since we fixed up ? Did you see what we did ... ? " " . . . spacious . And all rooms off the foyer. "  | " ... to the closets . Where do you get closets like that in the Village ? " " Never , never . " " I ran wiring in myself for lights and for a little fan that goes on when you open , automatically . Myself ! Not that I 'm so terribly handy , but when you start with the electricians . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how bored he is , Morroe thought , he 's practicallyturning black . Oh , oh , my , that little twitch of fatigue , that petulance on the lips . Screw you , mon vieux , tough shit , old sport ! And he droned , deliberately droned , " When it gets cooler I plan scraping the floors myself . They have those places where you rent the machineand all the attachments . Lately , I even service my own air-conditioner . The manual that comes with it gives you all the instructions , so I do n't have to be at the mercy of those . . . yuks . I pull it out , where it says oil I give it two drops of oil , I vacuum the filter and the coils , along the window I put fresh weather stripping and that special insulating stuff , and there  --  there 's your servicing for the year . " " Well , now , " said Levine cheerily , " I think I envy you . And your air-conditioner . " A second later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be so easily serviced . " " Hmmmmmm ? " With base pleasure Morroe dissembledconfusion . " Serviced .... The biological usage . " " Titter , titter , " said Morroe . And , " Guffaw , guffaw . " Nothing further was said by either of them . Morroe , sniffing in , sniffing out , groped for something more subtle , something implacably malign , a word that would poison , **26;5117;TOOLONG and waited while they nailed closed the coffin , and carried it outside to the wagon for the five-mile trip to the cemetery . There was a band now , a five-piece band . They looked pretty tired because they had been playing at a dance over in Mill River , but they took a few quick drinks and swung into place behind the wagon . Their feet crunched on the frozen mud and the mules snorted and grumbled , but they played their saddest marches : " Garlands of Flowers " and " Westlawn Dirge . " The trombone and the trumpets lifted clear and sad in the cold morning air , the drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way along the rutted road . The men had gone out the day before and cut pine branches and spread them across the muddiest parts so the wagon with the coffin and the band and the first of the line of marchers got across dry-shod . But the branches sank farther and farther into the mud , and by the time the end of the procession came , the puddles were as deep as before , only now they had bits of twig and broken stalks of pine sticking up in them . Those in the last of the line had to make their own way , had to jump across or clamber up the low slopes on each side , slipping and sliding on the icy rocks . Margaret was among the last , with the smallest of the children who could walk on their own . She hitched up her skirts and jumped . The children chattered and clambered around . And all this time the drum kept a steady funeral beat . The graveyard was only partially fenced by a single strand of barbed wire , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no bushes and practically no grass grew . The sandy stretch stayed clean and open with only the gentle drift of pine needles across it . There had been no burials for quite a while ; the graves had all sunk into gentle rises , smoothed by the rain . Most had no headstones ; a few still had their wooden ones , cut into the rough outline of an hourglass  --  they would soon fall away . Two or three had been covered with cement poured into wood molds . In thep101cement , under a pane of glass , was a colored picture of the dead . Margaret remembered one : a young man standing stiffly , hand in coat . A wedding picture for a grave ... . It would be over there , the east corner , Margaret thought . I do n't have to see , I know it 's there , with the name and date scratched under it . . . . But nobody does that any more . All they did now was outline the grave with white stones , set that wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts on the top .... Every grave had them . Cups , and glasses turned purple by the sun , and china animals  --  dogs and cats , and a broody hen or two . And plates . Lots of plates . Most of these stood on two-inch-high spires of sandy mud , jutting out like mushrooms from the grave . The rain had given them that form , and the plates that sat on that thin rain-carved stem were called Death 's Cups . If you touched one , old Death himself would come riding after you on his white horse with a long tail that rattled in the wind because it was made of little finger bones ... . There was a black smear around the open grave . To lighten their work , to thaw the first inches of ground , the diggers had built fires there . They had not watched too carefully because the flames had left their bounds , spread through the strand of barbed wire , and run up a young pine tree . Soot and ash lifted and hung in the air as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the drum thudded slowly . Margaret felt her skin quiver across the back of her neck . There were the grunts of men bearing the coffin and the squeak of ropes . Abruptly the drum stopped . For a moment there was n't even a wind . Then there was a scuffle at the grave and the wailing began again  --  a dozen or more voices this time , high-pitched , echoing off the tallest of the pines , shaking the buck vines that twisted high overhead . Somebody had jumpedp102into the grave and they were pulling them out . Even women who did not know how to wail the way the old ones did were screaming softly now , with a slow breath-like rhythm . The preacher began a proper hymn as he picked up a handful of mud . He dropped it into the grave , letting the sandy grains trickle between his fingers like sugar , savoring the feel of the earth . He moved aside , gesturing with a swing of his arm . Then there was shuffling as everyone pressed in to drop other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus save , " the preacher sang at the top of his fine voice . Margaret noticed a couple of black crows circling high up in the clear sky , watching . What do they think ? she wondered . Whatever do they think ? A couple of men picked up shovels , and the dirt filled back in with a rush , whispering as it went . The preacher finished his singing and said something , briefly and softly . Margaret did not listen ; his grave speeches were all the same . Then everybody shook hands , and kissed cheeks . The oldest women and the musicians got in the wagon for the ride back . The trace chains clanked and the mules plodded out . As they passed , Margaret noticed that Elfetha Harris , the youngest of the dead woman 's granddaughters , was covered with mud . She had jumped into the grave . Now she sat wiping her eyes , looking less and less sad with each turn of the wheels of the wagon . She always jumped in , Margaret remembered . When her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child that had been born a cripple , and her husband 's father  --  it was part of every funeral , Margaret thought . They started the walk home . The short winter sun , deep in the south , showed afternoon . The rutted stone-littered road climbed a rise , narrowing as the woods darkened and pressed in at the crest . It was there , lurking in the darkness of a grove of pecan , sweet gum , and persimmon trees that Margaret saw her great-grandmother again . She beckoned but Margaret did not stop . She beckoned again , and Margaret told her : " Quit bothering Inc . You got your grave to lie in . " The ghost stood stock still and watched her . Margaret said :  | " We threw in the mud and I threw in my handful and we covered you up and you got to stay there . " " Flesh and blood , " the ghost mourned . " I buried my blood with you , " Margaret said recklessly . " I 'm using only the other half now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainter against the bare tree trunks . " Go back to your grave , " Margaret said , " and quit pestering me . " She turned and walked on , hearing nothing from the trees on top of the hill behind her , not even the stirring of a breeze . The rest of the funeral lasted for the next three days , but then funerals for the oldest people usually did . It was as if the old people had left more to mourn , despite it being in the course of things that they should die . Infants and children were buried quickly and it was all over . Margaret wondered about that . A mother mourned a child , for sure , and a father too . And maybe a brother or a sister , but not many more . It seemed strange . . . when they were the ones who were n't supposed to die . Margaret shrugged . Things came in a certain form and that was all there was to it ... . She had gone for a walk , leaving the crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , climbing the slopes until she got to the open stretches of clear pine and hickory , vineless and brambleless . There was another funny thing about funerals , she thought . They let you see people you would n't otherwise see one year to the next ... people who only came for important funerals . Cousin Mary 's family , for instance , from over Twin Fawns way . That was twenty-five miles of bad roads straight north , toward the rising hills . But they were cousins , first and second and third , and so on , and theyp104had a duty . So they came , just the way they had this time . And there were always new people with them , not counting the babies . Men who 'd gone North to work and come back , not finding a job or not liking the living there . Families who 'd been in Mobile and had finally come home , cash in the sock . New wives and husbands that the cousins had gathered . This time there were five people she had never seen before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came back from Cincinnatiand went to farming again with his father because cotton was bringing near a dollar a pound and it was worth your work . ( Margaretrecognized them easily : Tobiases all looked alike . ) There was Grover Kent too  --  she remembered him as the boy who 'd bummed his way over to Port Gibson and joined up with a circus there . He 'd come back with a hernia that gurgled and bulged when he took off his truss  --  he did that to make the children laugh . And there was Roger Ellis , a short thin man who 'd married Elfetha Harris 's widoweddaughter . He 'd broken his hip working at a gin in Memphis two years before and it mended crooked . He was the one carried a banjo with him . Could he play it now ? .. . Margaret shrugged . It was getting cold and she turned to walk back . Roger Ellis was sitting on the porch when Margaret got home , in the warm corner where the thin sun reached , the same corner where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there before . Like there was a fence around it , Margaret thought . But now there was this little man , grey-haired , with a tiny mustache , chair tipped back against the wall , playing his banjo . He was singing too , very softly , an old blues . Margaret did n't know its name , if it had one , but she recognized the one line that repeated in it , and she liked its soft sad sound : long lonesome home . She stopped on the edge of the porch by the steps and listened . She shivered and it was n't so much from the cold as from the sad turn of the melody : " Who chop you cotton when I 'm gone ? "  |p105One  or two people looked out the door , some came on the porch to listen to him . " Roll me a pallet on your floor , oh yes . I 'm leaving for that long lonesome home . " Margaret shivered again . She saw it all . The generations of weepingthat had been done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel it all , feel the pulse and the heartbeat in the banjo chords and in the gentle light voice that sang across them . " Going where those chilly winds do n't blow , oh yes . " Margaret felt herself grow big and bigger until she stood way above the house . So tall she could look down the chimney and see the soot-blackened inside . So tall she could look down on the pine trees growing at the very top of the ridge that sheltered the house from the north . So tall that she could see way up and down the river , following it in its twists and turns , through its willows and its birches . Following it southward , looking down on even the huge river birches and the water oaks , following it all the way to the Gulf . . . . She could feel too , great like her size . She could feel the earth move under her feet , breathing slowly as it passed from seasonto season . She could hear the sound the stars made in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body grew great and full , and she thought , I 'll never be put in a box and lowered into the earth . I 'll never grow old and watch the veins on my hands begin to work their way out of my skin ... . It was funny , now , the way all the inner workings of old people moved to the outside . Their muscles and their sinews got hard and ropy and hung on the outside of their skins . Their veins rose up , so where you had n't been able to see them before you could see them now . There were little blue ones that appeared on the forehead , jagged like a saw blade , where the skin had once been smooth . There were others like cords wrapping their way across the backs of hands ,  |p106and  along legs . And pulses turned up where they never had been before . The throat one now , you did n't even know it was there , until one day you saw it , naked and exposed , pumping your blood for everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , Margaret thought . I wo n't ever get old and I wo n't ever die . I could n't ... . She saw that the women had come out of the kitchen to listen to the singing . They crowded out and stood in a raggedy line across the porch , all of them wiping their damp or greasy hands on their aprons . They were all wearing print dresses , their best ones , the ones kept specially for funerals and weddings . Those always come together , Margaret thought . Why would that be ? One was life and one was death and nothing could be more different , but they always seem to fall together . . . . There was Cousin Hilda now , and the youngest of Robert Stokes 's boys . They had slipped out to the barn just last night , and Margaret had huddled back and pretended she was n't there and pretended that she had n't seen or heard . It was then , in the dark ammonia-clouded barn , that she felt the first real tug of longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been Hilda . It was the tug , the pull , the first time .... She cursed herself and men , and hated her body for what it would do to her . . . . She ached all over with the effort and the struggle . And in the morning she felt like she had chopped cotton for days ... . Margaret looked at Hilda now , standing on the porch among the women , and she saw how slight and shapely her figure was , even under the two long raggedy sweaters . How she carried her hands in front of her , a gentle manner , almost pleading . How soft and unmarkedher face was in the harsh winter daylight . Except for the dark circles and the sleepy eyes . Margaret glanced down at her own hard angular body . Fit for the wood lot or the fields . Clumsy and out of place in a kitchen . With a man . She turned away , near to crying.  |p107The  following day people began leaving , the Twin Fawns group first , because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rutted yard and watched them load up . Roger Ellis , who was driving one of the two wagons  --  a bright blue one with a small young mule in the shafts  --  looked down suddenly , directly at her . " Morning . " She did not answer . The mule twitched its ears at the circling deer flies . " You favor you mammy , " he said . " Might be , " she said . " She was a right pretty woman . " Margaret felt herself blushing with pleasure and hated it . " I got no mammy , " she said . " Leastways , I always heard I took after my daddy . " She spun on her heel and went into the house , carrying her tall broad body defiantly.  |p108THE  short hard winter passed . Fine early-spring rains began , light delicate ones like fog or smoke , that dusted the surfaces of houses and trees and earth  --  the gentle ones . The sun shone fitfully , the sky was an even light grey , and the ground warmed every hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands flat on it , seeing whether it gave or took away heat . It was only a thing to do . They knew before they started that the warmth of the ground would pass into their hands . They could almost feel the earth begin to breathe . Those whose fields were high began to break for their cotton and peas and corn . People in the bottomlands waited for the floods to come , to cover their fields with rich black silt brought down from the north . For them , early spring was a time of rest , almost like the winter had been . It was the last bit of slack they would have until the end of summer , those short weeks when the cotton was making and there was nothing to do but wait for it . Margaret no longer huddled in her hollow tree . She could walk anywhere , warm and comfortable now . She counted off the signs of spring as they passed in front of her eyes : the grass pinks were blooming up in the damp pine woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meadows , and in the deeper bogs pitcher plants raised their greenish heads in search ofp109flies . The swamp azalea appeared , white and pink . And the flame azalea , with tiny flowers like glowing coals . And the sweet shrub , hubby blossoms , whose dark flower was the color of a woman 's nipples . Margaret counted the mild days , waiting . She saw the river , which had been rising steadily all the last month , top its low bluffs and inch across the land . Finally , she saw the thick heavy clouds boil over the horizon and the heavy hail-spotted rains begin . These hard falls  --  tempests , old people called them  --  sent the creeks boiling white along their courses , ripping up trees and rolling rocks , tumbling along the drowned bodies of animals under a thick lightning-streakedblack sky . Margaret helped her family move out of the house , load everything on wagons , cover them with torn tarpaulins , mold-spotted , and drive them away . The crates of chickens and the first of the spring calves riding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound calves and the nervous calling of the cows softened and blended in the steady falling rain . Margaret waited until last , until Abner Carmichael was ready to leave . He looked over the house carefully , checked the cables that anchored it to the nearest trees . He checked his small barn too . He had knocked almost all the lower planks out of those walls and tied them securely to the rafters . The flood water would flow directly through  --  across the dirt floor  --  and unless some very large object smashed into it , the building would stand . Margaret watched him finish and turn to leave . The water was already at the lower side of the dooryard and this was about as late as they could get mules and wagons out . She watched his grizzled head look from one side to the other , as he plodded away , putting his heels down hard against the ground , as old men will . She waited for him . Though he seemed surprised to see her , he said nothing , and they walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet as they climbed out of the river bottoms and overtook the slow-moving wagons and the plodding stock . It would be three or four weeks before they could go back . They spent the time in different ways , in different places . Sometimes with cousins . Sometimes in abandoned barns or houses that they had located during the winter . Sometimes they all stopped . Sometimes only the women . Most times , though  --  as this year  --  they all moved directly to the high pine woods . They turned their cattle to graze in the balds , the little high meadows , flower-covered and lush this time of year . They themselves lived in shelters of pine branches and made fires of the cones . The high sandy ground carried off the water almost before it fell and they were dry and warm . The only things that bothered them were the fierce sudden thunderstorms that ripped the sky and struck into the pine stands , splitting the tallest trees open , singeing their needles into dancing sputtering fires , like a child 's sparkler . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground  --  fire devils , some people called them  --  running across the open ground , zigzagging and darting , bright as fire , bright as burning hell , until they smashed into a tree and ran up the trunk and exploded with a puff at the top , leaving nothing but the smell of burning and the charred marks of their course . After a while the rains stopped , but no one in Abner Carmichael 's household moved . The river would continue to rise for many more days , long after the actual fall stopped . Margaret sat at the door of her shelter - she had built one for herself and lived in it alone  --  and dropped pine cones into the little fire . She did not need it ; the weather was very warm . She did it because it gave her something to do when she was thinking about her mother . She was trying to remember what she 'd looked like . All she found in her memory were the worn pictures she had seen so often before . They were n't very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . And where was she ? .. .  |p111Margaret  made herself stop thinking of that . Finally , she forced herself to study the pine cones she held in her hands , the tapered cones of the longleaf pine . She was grown now herself . She was seventeen . Most girls that age were married . Lots of them had a child or two . They would n't be crying over a mama . Margaret looked out across the misty pasture where a single blackand-whitecow grazed . I been coming here ever since I was born , she thought . This spot or another like it . Every year since I been born . But this one here , this is the last ... . She stopped , startled . She looked around , half expecting to have discovered somebody else had spoken those words aloud . Now that they were said  --  or thought , which was the same thing  --  they seemed true enough . But she was afraid of prophecy , and its connections with the devil ; her heart beat much faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be the last year . Knowing that , she looked at everything more carefully . The first sweet-smelling tall flowers of the greenfly plant . The pipewort , the moss verbena . The blue flowers of the pickerelweed in moist overgrownbeds of ponds . The reddish curled lips of the skunk cabbage . And milkweeds , tall and purple . Jacob's-ladder , poking its way betweenpine needles . The ginseng with its tiny purple flower , whose root , people said , was good for making love . Yarrow , lacy-leaved and fragrant . The poisonous Indian weed . And the sweet-tasting honeysuckle . Four-o'clocks to string on a child 's necklace . And whole fields full of wild pinks , brilliant and glowing in the sun . And the little animals that rustled among them . The snapping turtle catching flies by the rubbly edge of a pond , splashing into the water at the slightest noise . The box turtle lumbering into its burrow . And the snakes . Kick aside a fallen pine and you were sure to find a bull snake , blotchy grey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sizes ; when you found one , you called the childrenp112together and stoned it . And all the others , the milk snakes and the the black runners and the green snakes and the corn snakes and the rat snakes . There were so many , when you thought about it , so very many . Margaret wondered : There a lot of things I do n't have no names for . Plants and varmints both , that I ca n't call by name . She was alone the whole day , watching , looking , going wherever she wanted and as far as she could walk . The stand of pines the family was sheltering in now , it was a kind of narrow strip running up the side of the rising sandy hills . If she went very far in either direction the land changed rapidly . Hickories began to appear , and scrub oak , and soon she was in a dense wood of holly and beech and sweet gum and water oak and dogwood and sweet bay , buck vines lacing them all tight together overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecan , and she noticed their location carefully , in case she should come this way in the fall after a hard frost when their fruits would be ripe . She found streams , too , ones that the flood season had n't seemed to touch . Most were very small , a trickle over a sand bottom . She drank their leafy-tasting water and ate the wild watercress from their banks . She found a large one , down in a gully , almost out of sight in a clump of sweet bay trees and wild azaleas . This one was older ; it had cut its way through the sand and had even channeled its way deep into the rock . She stood looking down into the opaque smooth-flowing water . By the far bank , no more than five feet across , she saw the quick flick of a sunfish . He would be good fried , she thought automatically . And then : Why am I always eating , always thinking of that ? Why does it take so much trouble to keep your stomach full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly walked the quiet water in the lee of a fallen rock . Water bugs twitched their way about the surface . She knelt and looked at her reflection in the water that flowed half an inch below the rock shelving . She studied her face ,  |p113heavy-lidded  large eyes , full mouth , ears that were too long . She spat and the white froth sailed by her cheek . Another water-walker , caught in the flow , spun past , long legs skating feverishly . Margaret cupped some of the water in her hands ; it was perfectly clear . She drank , and it was much colder than the other streams . She dipped in her arm , groping for the bottom , found none . She stood up , dragged over the fallen branch of a magnolia and thrust it down , pushing against the little current . It did not touch . Margaret pulled it out , tossed it aside . The creek must not have had a bottom . She walked on . There were a few very early blackberries , small and sour before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face crinkling at their flavor . And it be right strange , she told herself silently , the way things come in their seasons . The way they appear and go each year at the same time , without never a mistake .... And the way people come . And me , I am here now , but I wo n't be next year . And where will I be ? I do n't know the answer to that any more than I know why berries have their seasons and the persimmons only ripen after a frost and a rattler is poison and a king snake is n't . And why a milk snake sucks the cows dry and a hoop snake puts its tail in its mouth and rolls down the road when the moon is small . . . . And there be reasons for all of those and causes too , only I do n't know them . I do n't know anything . . . . I do n't know what Mobile looks like , only what Grover Kent tells about the docks and the bananas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the stories people bring . And I never seen the ocean . . . . All I seen is the cotton fields and the rivers , flood and dry , and the way pines move in the wind , moaning . She began to walk back to the place where her family was stopping . Thinking : I wo n't pass here again . Maybe for a long time . Maybe not ever . Watching carefully , looking carefully . To remember . She entered the stretch of pine , and passed her way among them ,  |p114weaving  silently , playing that she was a ray of light or a wind . Shapeless , formless , smooth , passing ... . She slipped into the shelter she had built for herself , a bit away from all the others , and , tired by her long walk , stretched out under it . And listened to the sounds . The bells of the cows . The games of the children , their reedy voices raised in the singsong chant : " Here come Johnny Cuckoo .... " Whatever did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything clear this morning . . . . Not even words which were supposed to . The children went on chanting in a raggedy chorus : " I come from being a soljer , a soljer , a soljer , I come from being a soljer on a dark and stormy night . " It was a silly song , Margaret said to herself . As silly as the moaningsounds Katy was making ... . Margaret opened her eyes and glanced across the clearing . Katy was walking slowly up and down , arms across the shoulders of two women . She seemed to be laboring in earnest now , Margaret thought .... Margaret closed her eyes again . Katy always labored hard . Her babies were always born with long mashed heads that they kept for the first months of their lives .... She was taking on now . Her moans were interrupted by screams . So that was why , Margaret thought , the men had disappeared . It was supposed to be bad luck for a man to be too near a birthing . I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds go right straight up into the open sky . Then , because she was tired , she fell asleep . When the ground finally dried a bit , they began moving back to the bottomlands . The men went first , to start the plowing . They were ready to plant by the time Margaret and the other women arrived.  |p115They  also had replaced the rock foundations and levered the house back on them . The women had the inside to clean , the mud to scrape and slosh away with buckets of water . When they were done , they brought the beds and the bedding from the wagons . The old men built the mud-and-moss chimney . The children swept the yard , and took the dead animals ( possums and rats and squirrels ) and carried the bloated bodies down to the river and tossed them in . The stove went back into the kitchen while they were hammeringthe lower boards on the barn . They were ready for another year . Spring passed into summer , shimmering with heat . Endless , workfilledunmarked days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hot days when the cotton was making , when there was nothing more to do until the bolls swelled open and full . Then it was time to start dragging the long sacks up and down the rows in the crouching , sweating weeks of picking . Imperceptively the nights cooled , and the mornings . Margaret noticed the change as she carried the washing over to the baptistry behind the old church  --  a long walk but the water was clearer than the river . Margaret had never liked the smell of river-washed clothes , and they always took on the muddy color so soon . It was on one of those cool early mornings  --  she had left the house long before it was light  --  washing her clothes in the clear creek water , that she met William Howland . At first she did not think he was flesh and blood . She had not heard him come , had not heard the crinkle and crunch of the ground under his feet . He just appeared , not far from her . She often saw things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to her and sometimes they only stood back and looked . Sometimes they were friendly and sometimes they scowled and warned her away from places they were guarding . Sometimes shep116recognized them and sometimes they were people she had never seen before . Sometimes , they were n't even people . They were just shapes without a name , like a breeze if you could see it . Or they were animals . There was a chicken , a big red rooster , that she saw everywhere . It seemed to follow her for days at a time . So when she saw a tall heavy blue-eyed bald man in the morning fog , she was not surprised . He was one of many ... . For the first minutes she talked to him , she was sure that if she put out her hand , she could *each right through him . Then she began to realize that he was solid , and she felt disappointed . He was real . She sat down abruptly . Almost crying . " You sick ? " he asked . She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ails you ? " She shook her head again , and he sat beside her , and talked for a while . She heard his words but she did not bother to listen to them . Not for a long time , until she had gotten herself used to this new situation , then she sharpened and focused her ears again . " So there 's one thing sure , " he was saying . " I got to get myself a housekeeper . " She looked down at her hands folded in her lap , big hands . " And I reckon it 's got to be somebody young , account of it 's no easy job . The house needs lots of work , you can see that from what I been telling you . " I were n't paying any mind , she protested silently . He was waiting for her to say something . " Why you tell me ? " " You might want the job , seeing it 's open . " She lifted her hands and held them out in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " she said . " I been figuring on that . "  |p117Last  spring . Spring past . That day she found the persimmon trees and saw the sunfish in the creek that did n't have a bottom ... . " I been knowing I would . " " What your family say ? " " Got none . " " Not a mama ? " He frowned , unbelieving . " She been gone . " " A while back ? " " She never come back from looking f t. my papa . " He chuckled . " I heard tell of things like that . " " My papa was white . " William Howland hesitated . Finally because he had to say something , " I do n't mind , " he said . " I got nobody to ask . My grandpappy , he be glad of the room in the house . " William rubbed his face , feeling very tired , hearing the stubble of his beard grate in the quiet morning . " If this here is New Church , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she seemed much smaller , fragile almost . She did not raise her head to look at him , the way a white woman might . She did n't act at all like a white woman . As for her having a white father , he did n't believe it , not with the color of that skin . But lots of gals said so , and you had to let them have the comfort of it , if there was any . " Look now , " he said , " you go back and talk to your people and tell ' em where you going , and then you come over to my place , if you still want to . " How could anybody that tall , he wondered , look so delicate just because she was sitting down ? Then he saw that she was n't sitting , she had folded herself into the earth . Her weight and size had passed into it . She perched , suspended on the very crust . " That 's the way to do it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stop another deep feeling that was beginning to botherp118him , a tensing of muscles he had forgotten about . " It plain would n't be right to expect you to go rushing off when it ca n't help but be a surprise to you . " " No , " she said . " You ai n't used to people walking out the woods and offering you a job . " " It do n't surprise me , " she said quietly , in the light even voice that was so hard to remember . " Nothing that happens surprises me , ' cause I know it ahead of time . " He gave a quick laugh , and reaching down , touched the top of her head , briefly . She still did not look up . He walked away , feeling her eyes follow him the whole way up the stream , where he picked up his shotgun and coat , all the way until he disappeared into the woods . Margaret sat and stared at the wasps crawling over the damp surfacesof her laundry . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only I did n't know what shape you 'd have . And maybe that 's what the chicken meant , and the shape I saw yesterday in the branches of a hickory tree , the one that was bluish white and made a sound like an old-fashioned harp . They were telling me that something was about to happen . They were telling me and I was n't understanding what , beyond that there was something coming ... . She glanced up at the sun through the pine trees . It had hardly moved . No more than half an hour had passed . Unless the sun was standing still . . . . No , she thought , it would n't do that for me . It would do it for kings , but not for me . . . . It was real time . And it had n't been very long . She stood up , put her washing under her arm , and went home . As she walked , she looked carefully , every which way , in every patch of shadow and light , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no sounds , there were no movements . Nothing followed her . The signs had been telling her and now they did n't have to any more . There was nothing more to say.  |p119She  nodded to herself . As she went , she began to whistle . She no longer had to watch and listen . That same day she packed her things . She took the fancy apron her mother had left her , and she put all her possessions in it : her combs  --  the red one and the black one with the fine teeth  --  the snakeskin bag of Indian charms that she had never dared open , a couple of arrowheads that were lucky , a stone with a hole bored in the middle that was lucky too . She put in her pair of shoes and her good dress , the green silk one . Then she went looking for her grandfather , to tell him . It took her a couple of hours to find him . He was resting his team of mules in the shade of a tupelo tree . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late-fall day bothered him . He was squatting under the light , spattered shade with his chin resting on his knees , and he was breathing heavily . How much longer has he got , Margaret found herself thinking , before he gets to see that long lonesome home of his ? Before there wo n't be nobody sitting under that tree ? Before all there will be of him is a heap of mud in the graveyard , and not even too much of that ? We 'll remember him , she thought . For a time , a little time , before it starts slipping away from us , and we wo n't remember hardly at all . Then we 'll be dead too , and that 'll be the end of him , for good . And is n't it funny , she thought , that it takes two generations to kill off a man ? . . . First him , and then his memory . . . . And what would it be like to be dead ? To be in the ground , with the Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he a ghost , haunting with the ghosts of your people , drifting through the dark pine woods , drifting between the cypresses of the swamps . ... And what did you do , and what did you think when you were dead ?  |p120She  looked down at Abner Carmichael . He was staring with his eyes open but he did not seem to see her . As if he were halfway there already ... . She touched his shoulder . He turned his head slowly . " I come to tell you I was leaving . " He did not move ; she wondered if he understood . " I got to go . " He nodded . His dark skin was beaded and reamed with sweat . " If somebody , they ask for me  --  " And who would that be ? Nobody . Nobody , but maybe one . " If somebody comes asking , like my mama , maybe ... " The old eyes , hooded like a bird 's , slipped open and looked at her . She held her own face steady . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . She gone to work on the Howland place and she do n't expect to be coming back . " He did n't look surprised . " Nothing for you to do here , " he said slowly . " You got to be moving on . " His voice wavered off absently . When she was littler , Margaret might have hugged and kissed him . But that time was past ; that time was gone . She was n't a child any more and there was nothing for her to do . So she only turned and began to walk away , steadily , unhurriedly , knowing she had a long stretch ahead . Behind her , her grandfather said abruptly : " It 's hot and I 'm miseried . " She was n't little any more . She was a woman grown , and making her own way . So she kept walking , leaving him to his old man 's ache , and his old man 's dullness . For a while the landmarks were familiar . Then she passed into country she 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hand to hand as she went . Not hurrying , not stoppingp121either . She had brought nothing ; at first she did not miss food . She felt light and strong and drifting . When dark came , she slept in the woods along the road , curled up on the leaves and the pine needles , shivering a bit in the night cold . In the morning she felt her hunger , sharp and demanding , so she chewed a few pine needles and a couple of pieces of bitter grass . Once she stopped to ask directionsof a woman feeding a flock in her dooryard . Margaret smiled at the funny bobbing walk of the chickens . They 'd had their toes smashed to keep them from running away . The woman , heavy-bellied with child , answered her politely , while she stared at the unfamiliar face . " From New Church , " Margaretsaid , and watched the expression harden . Indian blood was n't a good thing , and the New Church people had always kept pretty much to themselves . Margaret moved off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she wanted to talk to somebody . She was n't lost . She only needed to follow the road until she came to the white-painted house on the fourth slope up from the river . She recognized it at once . She turned off the road and climbed the rutted , gravel-crusted footpath that cut across the weedy fields . She found herself in a dusty silent yard . Slowly she looked about her  --  at the higher ridges to the north , at the Providence River almosthidden behind its thick trees , at the sagging barns and the cluster of sheds off by the pasture lots . She walked around the house , searching . She found a family of cats , yellow and white spotted . And she found the kitchen door under the sheltering frame of the back porch . Without hesitating , she pushed through the sagging torn screen . The kitchen was empty . She walked through the dark rooms of the lower part of the house , as far as she dared , as far as she could without opening any closed doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she went back to the kitchen . She waited a little while there , sitting at the big center table . Then she waitedp122outside on the back steps , sitting in the sun , body curled over her legs to stop the aching of her stomach , her black skin sweating gently into the heat of the afternoon . William Howland came home just before dusk . He left his wagon by the barn , unhitched his mules , turned them into the lot . He closed and fastened the gate  --  moving slowly , weighted down by a day 's dust  --  and climbed the hill to his house . He 'd come half the distance before he even lifted his head . As soon as he caught sight of her , he began to hurry . She sat perfectly still and waited . " My God , " he said . " I plain was n't looking for you so soon . " She did not answer . She followed him inside . " You walk here ? " " Not far . " " From New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called . The sound echoed around the house ; no one answered . " You have anything to eat ? " " No . " " Not at all ? " " Not today . " " My God , " he said . " Ramona ! " And to Margaret : " You got no cause to do that , child . " " I did n't have nothing to take , " she said simply . It was true . " Ramona ! " he shouted , out the back door . " I did n't see nobody , " she said , " and I been here a while . " He ruffled his lips in a half whistle . " She be coming by for supper . . . but you ca n't wait none that long . " He walked over to the great wood range , black and sticky with grease . He opened a couple of pots and looked in . " She cooked it anyhow .... " Margaret sat down in a straight wood chair , her stomach cramps making her weak-kneed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in a moment he was standing beside her , and there was a hand on her shoulder . She laughed , ashamed . " Bitter grass make you lightheaded some-how . " The hand was pulling her to her feet . " Go get a plate  --  I ' 11 get it  --  and eat something , whatever that is there . " Outside a man 's voice shouted : " Will Howland ! " " You feed yourself , and when the old woman comes in , tell her to come see me . " " Hey , Will , " the man outside roared , " where you want your hog molasses ? " " Take you time , " William said , " do n't fret . " So she sat in the kitchen alone , eating quietly . She listened to the voices of the men outside , and then she heard the trace chains clank as the wagon moved . Her hunger eased , she looked around the kitchen . It was a large room , at one end the greasy black range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was a brick fireplace , tall enough for a half-grown man to stand in , black with years of use . Over it was a heavy scrolled and carved mantel . Over that , a long musket and a powder horn , slung crosswise . Margaret let her eyes run around the room a few times . Gently , inquiring . She finished her plate and shoved it away . Slowly she got up and poured herself a cup of coffee from the blue enameled pot on the back of the range . Holding the cup in her hand , she looked down the room again , into the black open hole of the fireplace . It was as familiar to her then as if she had always lived here . When the old woman Ramona came back , Margaret stood up politely , waiting . The old woman looked at her , shifting the wad of snuff from her lower lip to her cheek . " I seen Mr. William already , " she said . " And I got to open a bed for you . " Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared open earlier . They climbed a wide bare stair , its dark rail chipped with years of use ; they went along a dark hall that smelled strongly of new paint . At the back of the hall , next to a small low door , was a tall mahogany armoire with mirrored doors and a heavy flaring crest on top . The key was missing and there was no handle ; Ramona simply pried it open with her fingernail , yellow and hard as horn . Inside the wardrobe was lined with smooth swirled bird's-eye maple , but someone had put shelves across it , in the space where clothes might once have hung . They were not new shelves , because the unfinished wood was already darkening , but they had been put in crudely . They rested unevenly on strips of wood . Ramona hunted through the piles of cloth , pulling out one sheet after the other , shaking her head and putting them back . She found one finally . She took it out , and held it up . There was a rip down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour to find a pillow and a blanket that were raggedly enough . Then Ramona tucked the lot under her arm and opened the low small door . It led to the ell at the back of the house , directly over the kitchen . It must have been the oldest part , for the rooms were smaller and the ceilings lower . There were two rooms here , one leading into the other . They were musty and stuffy , and the mattresses on the beds had been rolled up and covered with newspapers . Ramona put down the sheets and started for another door on the far wall . " Goes to the kitchen , " she said . " You come up and down this way . Lights there . " She yanked a cord and the single naked bulb hanging from the rafters overhead snapped on . " You get enough supper ? " " Yes 'm , " Margaret said . The old woman started down the steps , groaning and wheezing . " Mr. William , he say I got to ask if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said again.  |p125Margaret  did not feel tired , though her legs ached slightly from the long walk . She ran down the stairs , avoiding the eyes of the old woman , who was now warming supper at the stove , and got the broom she had seen in the corner there . She ran back up and opened her windows , all of them , so that the cool evening air came pouring inside . She brushed down the walls and chased out the spiders , and swept the floors . She unrolled the mattress and put the sheet on it . I got to fix that rip tomorrow , she thought . It was the first sheet she had ever had . At home they always slept on the bare ticking . She stood in the center of the room , studying it . And it also looked familiar to her , though these two rooms were as large as her grandfather 's house . She wondered why she did not miss that more . After all she would be alone up here , and she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told herself , it was n't any differentfrom being alone outside , and she had done that lots of times . All at once she was tired . Very tired . She began having trouble standing up , and she weaved from foot to foot , as she slipped out of her clothes . Downstairs she could hear the old woman rattling pans and dishes in the kitchen , and singing under her breath . She had forgot the light . She got up slowly and pulled the cord . In the dark she stumbled back to bed , slipped under the unfamiliar blanket . And naked in a strange room , she fell asleep . William Howland had been busy . First there was the hog molasses , and then he decided to have a look at the new smokehouse that they were just finishing for him . Then , because he was thinking about it , he walked down to where the wallow was , and looked at the hogs , fat and lumbering and filthy . He was satisfied . When it got cold , which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog sticking . With the great boiling tubs of water set in the yard , and four extra men brought up from town .... He liked the smell of a smokehouse.  |p126He  liked to take care of the fires himself , just to be sure that they were banked correctly . A slip could ruin a whole season 's meat , and he was a particular man . He turned and began his trip back to the main house , noticing the new light in the window of the ell over the kitchen . That would be the room Ramona had given Margaret . He wanted to stop , but he did n't let himself . Damn-fool thing for a grown man to stand staring at a light .... He kept putting one foot in front of the other , steadily , until he got to the porch . And then it was easy to open the door , call to Ramona , and go to supper . " Let her help you , " William Howland said when the old woman asked about Margaret . " Got to be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snuff flutter at the word " child " and he chuckled . " She 's kind of big , for sure , but she 's not old . . . . Anyway seems my sister was telling me just a little while ago that the house needed some extra hands . " " She come out New Church , " Ramona said . William shrugged . Those people had a bad name among Wade County Negroes . As a matter of fact , they did n't usually come down this way  --  and that made it all the stranger , this girl 's coming to work for him . William remembered again how he had first seen her washing clothes , and how the Alberta story had come popping into his mind . She seemed more like that , somehow , than like somebody who 'd come out of the flooded bottoms and the piney uplands of New Church . She was around the house for a week before he even saw her again . Ramona must . have been giving her things outside to do . He was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pruned , and that somebody had been working inp127the herb garden his mother had put in years ago . It had n't been tended since then . The mint ran out of its bed and spread its roots across the adjacent yard . The thyme , once planted along the walk , had crawled over the stones and eaten them up . The rosemary formed large stiff bushes bristly with spiky shoots . A single enormous clump of chives lifted its seed globes through the crushing weight of the creepers . Margaret 's fingers pulled out the weeds inch by inch , the red earth lay torn and startled under the sun . When the garden was finished  --  ripped naked , forced back to its proper bounds  --  and there was no more , Margaret went hunting for fruit to preserve . She did not know these woods and fields , but she learned quickly . She was used to finding and taking whatever the country had to offer . At New Church foraging was something that older children taught younger . So now , Margaret came home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pears . And lines of glasses cooled on the window sills . One afternoon she rooted in the tangle of the vegetable garden , and she brought out pumpkins and acorn squashes , sturdy things that had survived their neglect . William saw them heaped on the back porch , glistening yellow even in the shade , and he wondered why he had not thought about them for all these years , them growing out there under the tangle of grass and creepers , year after year , season after season , with only deer to nibble them . They looked right pretty piled there , he thought , pumpkins and squash and the bumpy ornamental gourds that somebody had planted  --  somebody forgotten now . Toward the end of the first week , he came across her , sitting at the kitchen table , under the hanging green-shaded lamp . He 'd worked late that day . First at the spring house : the new pump ( the one his sister had ordered in time for the wedding ) was giving trouble . He 'd still been tinkering with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his food . When he finished with the pump , he still was n't through . There was one more thing to do : he had to go to the mill . All that day there had been small tornadoes about , sudden funnels dropping from the low puffy black sky  --  he 'd been watching them . One , he thought , had passed dose to the mill . He 'd have to see . He 'd have to be sure that the winds had not damaged the building or the stones  --  they were both old and brittle . And so he went , hunched over his horse 's back against the blowing rain . He checked the building carefully and thoroughly by the yellow light of his kerosene lantern ( only the main house had electricity ) . The mill was secure . The winds of the afternoon had cracked a window , no more . William stood for a quiet while looking at the great stones that were getting harder and harder to find these days , when almost nobodyground their own meal any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scurry of the mice and the small animals who always lived in any mill . He sat on the floor , tired and thoughtless , resting in the shelter of the roof , waiting for the sky to clear . So it was near ten o'clock when he finally unsaddled his horse and climbed the slope to his house . He saw the light in the kitchen . It could not be Ramona . She would have left long ago for the house she shared with her husband and her old-maid daughter a quarter of a mile down the road . William Howland walked across the yard , noticing through a gap in the eastern clouds the outline of the Bear . He saw the bright starry shape clearly . Head down , tail up , it had always looked more like a skunk to him . So few people watched the stars any more , he thought . His uncle now had been able to tell the names of every constellation as it lifted itself over the shelter of the trees . He stepped quietly to the back porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( always in his mind he called her Alberta and correctedhimself now ) . She had greased her hair and pulled it straightp129back , pinning it flat to her head . He saw the twin tendons of her bent neck , the same delicate arch that he had noticed when he stood up to leave her by the creek in New Church . It was strange , he thought , standing on his porch in the chilly night , how she changed . Sitting she was a child , delicate , uncertain . When she walked , she moved with the stride of a country woman , long steps , arms hanging motionless at her sides . A primitive walk , effortless , unassuming , unconscious , old as the earth under her feet . She was sewing , William noticed , but not very well . He had seen his sister whip the needle back and forth through the material , quick , deft , sure . Margaret sewed slowly , pulling the thread out to its full length after each stitch . She did not know how , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the chance to learn over at New Church ... . The bend of the neck , the slow clumsy stitching  --  he caught his breath , aching , as the sight of poverty always hurt him . If she wants to learn , he told himself , I 'll get somebody to teach her . If she wants to learn ... . He went inside . She turned her head slowly at the sound of the door . " Just me , " he said . " Go ahead . " She folded her hands over the material . He glanced at it . He had seen that flowered cloth somewhere . . . . Yes . His sister had bought it to make curtains for the hall upstairs . This must be the remnant . She did not say anything , so he asked : " You 're making curtains ? " " No , " she said . " No . " " If you want to learn , " he said , " I can find somebody to teach you . " My grandmama showed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dry . " I be all right if I can remember me what she say . " Her voice always vanished like smoke on the air . He felt uncomfortable . " Whatever you want . " He went to bed . And only the aching tiredness of his musclesp130pushed him to sleep . He kept wanting to stay awake and listen . To be sure she had finished in the kitchen and come safely upstairs to bed . It was Sunday  --  its bright warmth carried an edge of winter in the yellow sun and the hard blue of the sky . The fields were deserted and so was the dirt road . Ramona came plodding along early in the morning and fixed dinner and left it on the back of the range . She was the last person to pass by . Sundays were like that , empty . No one moved about . Some of them  --  the good people  --  had been to church and were now home resting after their heavy Sunday dinners . They sat on their sunny porches in big cane rockers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch boards beside them were sweating highball glasses with their slivers of ice . And the other people , well , some of them would still be out on Saturday-nighthunts , shacked up back in the woods , beside a fire , drinking corn likker straight from the jug . And some others would be fishing , dozing over their poles among the willows . William Howland sat alone on his front porch and mended traces , a glass of bourbon and water by his side . When he had finished with them , he got out his guns and his cleaning rags and brushes and went over them carefully . He even took down the old long rifle from the kitchen wall , the one that had belonged to his great-great-grandfather who 'd drifted down from the Tennessee hills with it over his shoulder . William Howland always kept it clear and clean and oiled . He did n't dare fire it . He did n't have the ball and he was n't sure of the charge and he did n't believe the old barrel would hold together anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he finished that  --  and it was just like any other Sunday  --  it was time to go down for the milking . Oliver Brandon was alone at the barn  --  nobody else around on a Sunday . William helpedp131whenever he was n't going out to supper . He enjoyed it , even the three-times-a-day milking schedule of full summer . He liked the smell of the cow 's flanks pressing against his cheek . He liked the way the teats felt under his hand , the way the milk pulsed under his fingers , he liked the feeling that his hands had a life apart from his body . When he was through in the barn , he got himself supper in the kitchen , walking up and down , prowling around among the cupboards . This particular Sunday he found a mouse 's nest in the large china tureen at the top of the deepest closet . ( He remembered the tureen , though it had n't been on a table since his mother was alive and only rarely then . It belonged to the Lowestoft service his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped the cover on and carried nest and mice to the back yard and flung them out . As he came back inside , he heard the wooshing swoop of an owl 's wings , and he nodded to himself , satisfied . He hated animals and vermin in the house . He would have to talk to Ramona , he thought . She was getting unusually careless . He went into the living room , and under the light of the goosenecklamp he began the newspapers and the magazines he had been too tired to read during the week . He still kept glass and bottle close at hand , and as usual at Sunday bedtime , he was quite drunk . He had been drinking steadily most of the day . He put down the last magazine , snapped off the lamp , picked up the liquor , and began his trip upstairs in the dark . He did not need a light . He knew the rooms so well . No piece of furniture had been shifted in all the years he had been living here alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents were alive . . . . His parents . He stopped for a minute and thought about them , the way he had n't for years . He stood in the dark hall and looked across the living room to the bright squares of moonlit windows . It seemed he could see them sitting in the humps of maple rocking chairs by the big fireplace  |p132They  always had sat there . . . . His mother . Crocheting by the hour , filling all the tables with centerpieces , all the beds with spreads . There were even crocheted curtains at the bathroom window . His mother had stopped everything else and done them especially for that room , when they first got inside plumbing . She crocheted capes and gowns for all the babies in the county , white and black  --  and William smiled to himself in the dark  --  the same pattern over and over , only the ones for black babies did not have the three tiny ribbonbows stitched on top . . . . William took another swallow from his glass . Poor old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows of ribbon . You had them . . . . You did not . . . . And that was your whole place in life . William was not the first to notice the significance of the ribbons . His father pointed it out to him one day , shortly before he went off to Atlanta to read for the law . " Damn silly thing , but just plain like her . . . . And you was to tell her , she 'd throw a fit right at you . " His father chuckled , contentedly . " Should have your women spoiled , " he told his son . " Leastways Howland women is always spoiled . " It had been his mark of manhood , his wife 's soprano giggles , her great penchant for collecting cut-glass and rose-flowered Haviland china ... . William turned away from the dark parlor . But across the hall , on the other side , the door to the dining room was open , and he saw his parents again , in there . Saw them sitting in the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was bare and empty and dusty now . They were sitting right where they had been the day of his wife 's death , that afternoon when he had come and told them he would need to have the tomb . The laughter was gone ; they were two old people , shivering , paralyzed with fear . And it ends like that , William thought . The gaiety and the pride in fear and death . William closed the dining-room door , shutting them in there . He would work again tomorrow and be too tired for such thoughts.  |p133He  began his slow drunken climb up the steps . He dragged his hand heavily along the rail , and his fingers passed over the charred spot that dated from his great-grandfather 's time . One evening bandits came upon the house ( there were a lot of them on the trace at that time ) . They caught and killed the youngest daughter  --  found her asleep in bed , in the room that was now the kitchen  --  kicked her to death on the brick floor . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , and were cooking their supper when that William Howland and his four grown sons and their slaves came back . The old man stayed behind to put out the fire and tend the broken body of his youngest . The rest of them drove the robbers into the canebrakein the dark and killed them there , one by one as they wallowed hip deep in the swamp .... The railing had been one of the things that the fire had charred . They kept it to remember by . Generation after generation . When they enlarged the house , they added theold railing to the new stairway . . . . To remember by .... Killing and death , William thought as he rubbed his fingers across the charred rail , those were the things you set yourself up to remember . And the others went to their graves unmarked . He 'd told Abigail the stories , all the stories he knew . She 'd listened of course , but how much would she remember ? Women never took those things too seriously . His sister Annie now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd simply forgotten everything before the time she married and moved to Atlanta . Even the long days of their childhood . How they 'd hunted tupelo honey and found the bobcat 's young in an old eagle 's nest ... . His lips were numb . He must have had more to drink than he thought . He put his knees firmly into the business of lifting him upstairs . Sometimes he felt the age of the house , felt the people who had lived in it peer over his shoulder , wondering and watching what he was doing . He felt them now , like mice in the walls , voiceless and rustling . It seemed to him too  --  tonight especially  --  that he couldp134hear their breathing , all of them , dozens of them , breathing together , deep and steady , the way they had when they were alive ... . He dropped down on the bed , not bothering to take off his clothes . And he chuckled to himself . He had been listening to his own raspingbreath . No more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg and pulled off the heavy boot and tossed it into the far corner of the room . It made so much noise that he stopped and listened , startled . He was thinking about the other boot when Margaret came in . He 'd left his door open . By the moon which slanted bright and low through his east windows , he noticed her standing just inside the room . She was wearing a nightgown of a familiar flowered material , high neck and long sleeves , a bit like a choir gown , he thought . " I scare you with that noise ? " He was surprised at the huskiness of his voice . " I can take the other one off , " she said . And she did , standing it carefully by the side of the bed . " If you was n't so young , " he said , " I 'd offer you a drink . " " What you read down in the parlor ? " " Huh ? " he said . " The papers . " She sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pattern of her nightgown . He recognized it . " That 's what you were sewing on , the other day in the kitchen . " " I found it , " she said . " It was right clever of you , " he said . " Reach me my drink , child . " She handed him the glass . He shook his head , and reached across her to get the bottle . His unsteady hand brushed her breast . It was n't until the hand had come back with the bottle in it that he realized her nipple was hard and erect . He put the bottle down on the floor beside the bed carefully , in case he should want it later . He wondered if she 'd been waiting all these nights to come be/cause she had n't had a nightgown . He started to ask her . But there was something  --  she had her hair pinned back and she was studying her own hands  --  that changed his mind . She seemed small and fragile again , and for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the bend of the neck that did it . It was so exposed and patient . She bore him five children , all told . Three of them lived , two girls and a boy.  |p139I  came ten years later , my mother and I. The two Abigails . Mrs. Abigail Howland Mason and Miss Abigail Howland Mason . Coming back home . We came on the overnight train from Lexington , Virginia , to Atlanta , and we had to wait around a couple of hours there . For some reason or other  --  I suppose she just felt too awful  --  my mother had n't told her Aunt Annie , so there was nobody to meet us . It was just us two waiting in the station , which was stifling in the summer heat , just two of us sitting on the hard benches not far from the stand where a man sold oranges and newspapers . Like I said , we had to wait around for a couple or three hours for the local  --  Number 8  --  to Madison City . You could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her getting tireder and tireder . I guess she had n't slept very much on the Pullman the night before , and it even looked like she would n't make it down the long flight of steps to the tracks . But once we got on and settled in our seats  --  in the dirty coaches that still carried spittoons in the far corners of them , where luggage was always falling out of the saggingp140racks high over your head  --  she took off her hat and put her head back and dozed a bit . I hung out the open windows and chattered to myself . First I talked about getting my head cut off by passing poles and an occasionalboxcar on a siding . Then I tried to see how much I could rememberfrom the last time I came this way . ( We had visited my grandfather every Christmas since I was old enough to travel . ) " I came here when I was three months old , " I told a cotton field full of pinkish blooms . I have been here all along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " And to prove it I chanted out the names of towns along the way . Actually , I did n't remember much more than the string of names . Because a year is a long time at eight and from one to the next was an immense distance . I could n't even have told you what my grandfatherlooked like . I suppose my talking bothered her , because my mother opened her eyes and patted the bun of hair at the nape of her neck back into place and looked at her watch and looked out the window and sent me down the car to ask the conductor exactly where we were . We were then three and a half hours late and we got steadily later . It annoyed my mother , though she should have known better . That train was always late . There was some trouble with a switch just out of Opelika , and then we waited for a fast freight . There was trouble with a hot box that took an hour to fix . And the signals were wrong for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me finally was : " Please , child . . . you 'll have to be good if I 'm to travel with you alone . " I fell silent after that , remembering all the things I had been told . That my mother was n't well , that I must not disturb her . That my father was gone , for years anyhow , and I must help her just as he had . When we got near our stop , the conductor woke my mother.  | " Thank you , Mr. Edwards , " she said . He took our baggage and piled it ready on the platform . When we felt the grating as the brakes began to take hold , he shook hands with my mother . " I am right proud to have Will Howland 's daughter home again . " She smiled at him . She was n't a pretty woman , but she always looked radiant when she smiled . " I 've been gone too long , Mr. Edwards , " she said , " but I 'll be staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did recognize my grandfather , after all . Right then and there the first part of my life ended . And the second began . Sometimes as the years passed , the hot dusty country years , I found myself thinking back to the first part , to the smooth green college town . And wondering if it had happened at all . I rememberedso little . The clean light mountain air , evenings when your nose would just shiver with the sparkle in it . The smooth roll of the campus and the columned buildings . My father walking off to teach his class in the mornings , leaving a thin line of pipe smoke behind . The way leaves fell in the fall until there were great bright heaps on the ground ( they do n't do that this far south ) . I remember a small town , all brick and narrow streets , shabby-looking . It had been burned in ' 63 when the whole Valley was fired . There was only one house left standing , way on top of the highest hill in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its row of white columns  --  but a real old one . It had been used as headquarters during the war because of its great view . They were supposed to burn it when they left , but they must have forgotten . . . . There was also a river , down between sharp banks , a trash-littered river . I saw them pull a body from it one day , when I had gone to fetch something from the grocery . A couple of fishermen dragged it out , one by an arm , one by a leg . I remember it was a Negro , I saw the dark skin clearly , and it was naked . I remember too that my parents were n't getting along . You could feel how stiff they were to each other sometimes . Often as I lay inp142bed , I 'd hear their angry voices through the closed doors . And her eyes were red for days on end . Maybe that was the reason my father was so anxious to go back to England when the war started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over to my mother , until she dabbed at her eyes openly . It was about going to meet Armageddon . He went of course . The week before he left there was a great deal of partying  --  for him , I guess . I had never known them to go out so much . Then he was gone , and my mother , silent and redeyedagain , went about the business of moving home to her father . Once I was back in Madison City , it seemed I 'd never been away  --  the flat cotton fields , the tangled pine uplands , the stretching swamps were home . I had no personal memory of the place  --  not very much anyway , but everybody assumed that I would have an atavistic one . And maybe I did . Within a single day I felt that I had always lived there . My father was gone ; I never even had a letter from him . ( My mother did , but she did n't talk about them or show them to me . ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People always called me the Howland girl , and it was hard to remembersometimes that my real name was Mason . Whenever I 'd go calling with my mother , making a little procession up somebody 's front walk  --  my mother first , then me all the ladies greeted us the same way : " Why , my dear , it 's the two Howland girls ! " We were Howlands and we were living where the Howlands always lived . I forgot my father , there were so many other things . He had n't forgotten , though ; he tried to see me once after the war , he came back to the country just for that , I guess  --  but by then it was too late . And now , today , I do n't even know where he is . I do n't have any address . I do n't even know what country . He is gone as completely as if he never existed . Sometimes I feel that my grandfather was my father . And thatp143Margaret , black Margaret , was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feelings all mixed up . She was his wife , only she was n't . She kept house for him and the law said they could n't marry , could n't ever . Their children took their mother 's last name , so though they were Howlands they all had the last name Carmichael . The oldest was Robert . He was a year older than I , tall for his age , very tall ( he 'd gotten his mother 's height ) . He had red hair , and his freckled skin was fair . At first glance you would not have thought he . had any Negro blood . But if you looked sharper  --  and if you were used to looking  --  you could see the signs . It was the planes of the face mostly , the way the skin sloped from cheekbone to jaw . It was also the way the eyelids fell . You had to look close , yes . But southern women do . It was a thing they prided themselves on , this ability to tell Negro blood . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact length of gestation . Blood and birth  --  these were their two concerns . In the South , most people could tell that Robert was a Negro . In the North , he would have been white . After Robert there was Nina , a couple of months younger than I , so she would have been almost eight that summer we came back to Madison City . Then there was a gap of three years : that child had died . Then there was Crissy , Christine . Both girls were fair , with red hair like their brother 's . Their other blood showed in the shape and color of their eyes , in the waxy pallor of their skins , in the color of their fingernails . And how did I know ? Because I 've spent my time sitting on porches on a sunny dusty afternoon , listening to the ladies talk , learningto see what they saw ... . They taught me my Bible lessons the exact same way . And to this day I am very good at spotting signs of Negro blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . It 's a southern talent , you might say.  |p144Funny  how memory is . There are places  --  months and years even  --  when I can not recall a thing . There are simply blank spots with nothing to fill them . And I have tried . Because somehow or other I convinced myself that if I could just remember  --  could have all the parts  --  I would understand . And even so I ca n't . I 've lost it somewhere . I can remember coming to my grandfather 's house . I can remember that one particular train ride , out of all the others . But I ca n't remember what I thought of the house . And of that first night there . I ca n't remember what I thought of Margaret and her children . Maybe I did n't think of them at all . I do n't remember when I figured out that Margaret 's children were also my grandfather 's children . Not even that . I suppose it just came to me slowly , the way things seem to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull for that . But bit by bit , fraction by fraction , a thing impinges on me , inches its way into my mind , until by the time it is full-grown I am quite used to it . I suppose that was the way with the children my grandfather and Margaret had together . By the time I knew , by the time I understood , it was as if I always had . No one told me . I 'm sure of that . I do n't know what my mother thought , but she never said a word . She always pretended to believe that Margaret 's children had just come . Maybe that was what she had in mind when she told me all the old Negro stories about Alberta . Her children , now , had just come to her , without a father . They had just come sneaking into her body when she was asleep in the soon of a foggy morning , come sneaking as gently as the dew that dripped off the tips of the pine needles . Her children had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tops of the highest ridges where there was nobody but some noisy jaybirds to hear her panting in labor . There were no more children for Margaret . The last had been born  --  and died  --  two years before we came , so it was n't until muchp145later , when I was a grown woman , that I found out Margaret , unlike Alberta , did n't go away up on the ridges to bear alone . She got on the train and went to Cleveland and bore them in a hospital there . That way their birth certificates did n't have the word " Negro " on them . The first time I ever heard any talk about Margaret 's children , it was a little girl in my class at school  --  third grade or so  --  a blue-eyed girl with frizzy blond hair that her mother put up in papers every afternoon . It was a sniggering remark , and all I could think of was : Sure , I know . But I could n't let her get away with it , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A couple of days later , I poured a half bottle of India ink into that fuzzy scalp . And a week later I managed to work a large blob of nail polish into it too . It had dried before she noticed . You could see it shining through the thin hair . I was n't startled , I was n't hurt . Somebody had just put into words what I had known for a long while . Margaret 's children did n't go to school with us , of course . They went to the Negro school four of five blocks away . We did n't even go in together . Some mornings my grandfather drove me  --  if he had business in town  --  and sometimes Oliver Brandon did . Oliver had worked for my grandfather from the time he was twelve , at one job or another . He was in his forties now , and he could do just about anything , from doctoring sick animals to tinkering with the cars , and in those days cars needed a lot of tinkering . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruts in the road . Cars were n't common in our part of the country . Not with the depression thick and heavy still . I suppose there were a dozen of them in town , no more . The horses were still scared of them . But every morning I drove into town to school  --  barely two miles by the direct road , but nearly five the way a car had to go , keeping to the best of the graded roads . It took me almost as long as it did Margaret and her children . They went by wagon , a new one thatp146handled easily and would n't tire the mule . Margaret drove them every day , along with any of the other Negro children who wanted to go . In bad weather she 'd be bundled up in an old waterproof of my grandfather 's and the children would be crouched down in the bed of the wagon under their tarpaulins . In fine weather they 'd ride up on the seat beside her . But they went . Every day . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throats and general aches , and spend long lazy days in bed , playing tent with the quilt . My mother did n't object . But if Margaret 's kids complained , she paid no attention . Robert whined for days about being sick , before he broke out in fiat blotches of chicken pox . Margaret let him stay in bed then , but she 'd pushed him too hard , because he caught pneumonia and almost died . You could hear his strangled wheezy breathing through half the house . You could even hear it over the noisy gusty spring storm that was roaring outside . My grandfather , with Oliver Brandon , went to fetch Dr. Harry Armstrong . They stomped into his hall , rain pouring off them both , and my grandfather shouting for him at the top of his voice . " My gracious , Cousin Will , " Miss Linda Armstrong said from the parlor , " he 's only just stepped down to the cellar to see about the rats . " She was a pretty girl , and a bold one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to do . " Would you like to talk to me for a while ? " " Go fetch him , " my grandfather said to Oliver . " Cellar door 's off the kitchen . " " Why , Cousin Will , you are in a hurry , for sure . You got somebodysick ? " " I would n't be likely to come yelling for a doctor if I had n't . " " Oh my now . " She had straw-colored hair and large brown eyes and fine-shaped breasts . He looked unimpressed . " You grown up , Linda , " he said . " I can remember you in pigtails. "  |p147Oliver  came back with Harry Armstrong . The three of them bundled into raincoats and went off , and Linda scurried down to the drugstore during the next pause in the storm and told everybody there that the Howlands were all crazy . She often spent evenings talking in the drugstore , after she gave her father his supper . She liked company , and somebody always brought her home . My grandfather did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the road out of town , and driving steadily on . Harry Armstrong just shook his head , unbelieving . " God damn it , Will , you get me out on a night like this for a nigger kid ? " " Looks like , " my grandfather said . " You said it was little Abby . " " No I never , " my grandfather told him . " You figured that your-self . " " Jesus Christ , " Harry Armstrong said . " I got to be thinking of my practice . " They hit a washed-out rut and yellow water sprayed out like sheets on all sides of them and ran through cracks in the windows . The car rocked and skidded , but stayed on the road , and they spun their way through a patch of loose gravel to a hard surface again . Oliver Brandon pulled out a cloth and began to wipe up all the water he could find inside the car . Harry Armstrong rubbed a splash off his face and went right on . " God damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry , but I got to figure what your damn-fool trick 's going to cost me . " " I 'll pay you , " Will said flatly . " When people find out I treated a nigger kid , what kind of a practice do you reckon I have left ? " " To hell with them , " my grandfather said . They were still squabbling when they got to the house and went inside . Harry Armstrong took a look at Robert , and gave him some codeine to make him feel better , and aspirin to bring his fever down ,  |p148and  whiskey to keep him from sinking too low . Since he did n't know much else to do , he left Margaret there and came back to the kitchen . We were waiting , my grandfather , my mother , and me . " I reckon I 'll be going home , " he said . " Have some supper , " my grandfather said . Harry Armstrong shook his head . " Thanks . " " You did n't have none at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some right enough . " " I 'm telling you you 're staying the night . " Harry Armstrong stared at him . He might have had a lot to say if my mother had n't been right there . He finally just sat down with a whistling sigh . " What I ever do to you , Will ? " He turned to my mother . " Abigail , your father has plain done me in tonight . " She looked at her father and said nothing . " Staying all night to treat a nigger kid  --  ai n't a patient I got will stand for that . " My mother 's delicate face got hard and worried . " He 's right , Papa , " she said . " We should have thought of that . . . . Cousin Harry , it 's little Abby that 's got chicken pox . " She looked at me , thoughtfully . " I can see the spots , child , go to bed and the doctor will come right up . " I gaped at her . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you 're spending the night because your little cousin is so sick . Nobody would mind , that . " " No , " he said , slowly . " We 'll keep her in bed for a few days or a week . " " Hey , " I said . " In your room , then , missy . " My grandfather chuckled again . " Have some supper , Harry . " " Anyway , " my mother said quietly , " Margaret will be very glad to have you here . She 's worried frantic over the boy . "  |p149And  that was another thing . My mother liked Margaret . Maybe because Margaret had everything she had n't : size and strength and physical endurance . Maybe my mother was so sure of her own position that she could n't be challenged by her father 's Negro mistress . And maybe too , maybe as simple as this : my mother was a lady and a lady is unfailingly polite and gentle to everyone ... . Before I went to bed that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water by the kitchen fire . He 'd stopped complaining , even . He looked in on Robert every hour or so all night long , drinking steadily in between times with my grandfather . In the morning Robert was better , so maybe some little trick of his had made the difference . I spent the next week in my room , and my grandfather got me all the books I had been wanting : The Swiss Family Robinson and Kidnapped and Jo 's Boys . I had a fine time , reading and watching the rain on the window glass . I never had liked school . Though a lot of people knew about it , that story never got out . When I really did get chicken pox , we called it a second case of measles . Robert got up after three weeks in bed , and walked around on shivery uncertain legs . He was so pale and thin you kept thinking that you could see right through him if he stood in the sunlight . By the time he was able to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started . The next September he went off to boarding school in Cincinnati . He was eleven then , and he never came home again , not until he was long past a man . But that 's another part of the story . Money was tight those depression days , but my grandfather managed to keep Robert away at school and at camp , and off on one visit or another . It must have been very expensive for him then , but he did it , because the boy was his son , the only one he had , and because Margaret wanted it so . Margaret never visited him , and he never came South . She wantedp150it that way too . Once every year , usually during the slack in the middle of the winter , my grandfather would get on the train and go North to see how he was making out . And of course Robert wrote to his mother  --  the one letter a week that the school required . I remember other letters too . I remember my grandfather padding stocking-footed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) into the living room with the mail . My mother selected one particular envelope and held it up to him . " You see , Papa , unopened . " She tossed it into the fire . " That 's what I think . " I noticed it then , and noted it , but did n't think about it . Now I wonder how many letters from my father went unread , that flared and shriveled and turned to crinkly ash in the living-room fireplace . The days went rattling by at a good fast pace . There were n't many people around but there were lots of things to watch and see . Lots of them . Like the great canebrake below the house , down by the edge of the river . I remember the enormous rattler some men found down there , thick around as my arm , head smashed by an ax . The man who 'd killed it brought it up to the house to show , and there was still some life to it , some movement . All the dogs slunk off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecan rubbed against the boards of the house . Faint squeaky brushings , the ghost noises that peopled my dreams . . . . The way a hunting pack sounded , the carefully picked voices . And the men 's faces flushed and red in the light of the pine knots . Back-country hunting , on foot , with lots of whiskey . . . . The way cattle sounded when they were turned into a dry corn field .... The sweet-bitter smell from the windrows of the first haying ; the crisp clean odor of the later stacks when you slid down them . . . . How the land looked under the moon , soft and sweet like water , even the rocks gentle and tender in the light . The bones of the earth , old people called those chalk white out/croppings . Where the giants were buried , where earthquakes had thrown up their bones . . . . How the frost looked lying heavy and blue as mold at night on the roof , on the ground .... A chicken hawk caught by a shotgun blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dogs into bits of bloodied fur . . . . And over and over again , animals straining in birth . Cows in the pasture lots , an occasional mare in the shelter of the barn . Cats under the porch , backs arched and crouching . And the hounds  --  they whelped in the kitchen with Oliver watching over them , and my grandfather putteringaround the house doing all the things that had needed doing for months and that he had n't ever got to until then . His heart was in the dogs . He did not really like cattle ; he raised them only because there was money in it . He had good stock , he took good care of them , and he never enjoyed a minute of it . When , now and then , an animal died , he and Oliver checked to see what happened . Sometimes it was a fall . A few of the pastures had sharp rocky drops down a slope : cattle lost their balance and tumbled over , and they starved with a broken leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung loosely on their bodies . You could tell too when they died of snake bite : just that leg was swollen while the rest of them was perfectly normal . When they were swollen all over , why , then they had died of poison : lambkill , or sheepbane , or Jisson weed , or one of the poisonous creepers . My grandfather would give the hide a kick , wrinkling his nose at the smell . " Damnfoolcreatures , " he 'd say , " know what 's poison and they still eat it . " He thought the cows and steers were stupid . But he really hated his bull . He had a fine one , a beautiful monstrous ring-nosed creature , who lived in a special lot down below the peach orchard . He was injured when a bolt of lightning struck a pine under which he was sheltering during a storm , and he had to be destroyed . My grandfather looked almost pleased , in spite of the money that was going to be lost . He went to the cabinet where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .303 cartridges grimly . Hep152never kept another bull , because by then the Department of Agriculturewas supplying the artificial ones . The cattle business was good , and little by little he let his cotton acreage go , and increased his herds . But  --  excepting his hounds  --  he never got to like any animal . Though he could have afforded it , he never kept horses for pleasure . And he had as little to do with his mules as he could manage . Unless something was very wrong , he never went down to the lot when the hands were hitching up in the early mornings as I did . I liked sitting on the rail fence , above the reeking hoof-torn mud . There was hardly a blade of grass that their long yellow teeth had n't destroyed . The trees had been stripped of their leaves too , high as the animals could reach . Even the trunks had a blotched look : their bark had all been rubbed off . The mules scratched themselves against those trees every chance they got . Though they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had those great harness sores , like white-rimmed welts across their backs and forequarters , the way a lot of work animals did , they never did seem to get over being itchy . They were stupid and mean , and they would bite . A lot of times I had to tumble off the fence because one was coming for me . When the men began getting them into harness and between the shafts of the wagons ( maybe it was picking time and every animal on the place had to work ) , it got noisy . The mules snorted and screeched , and the men yelled back at them , and whacked them with sticks and palms and fists , and twisted ears and twisted tails . By then the sun was up and the whole place warmed , and your nose began to wrinkle with the thick sweetish odors of sweat and animals and mud . My grandfather eventually got rid of them all , and had a flock of tractors to take their place . First time they were ready , he sniffed the clear sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lot better than a mule . " He was a strange man , and decided in his tastes . The only animalsp153he liked were his hounds . Though he himself was n't too fond of hunting , he kept a very fine pack . And when  --  three or four times a year  --  he held a hunt , every man in the county was there . It was a pleasure to watch a pack like that work , they said . Now , a hunting dog does n't live too long what with accidents and heart worms and just plain exhaustion , and William Howland had to put a lot of money in that pack . He did n't seem to mind , though he was pretty close with money as a rule . I 've known him to pay five hundred dollars for a likely Blue Tick bitch . And whenever a whelping was finished , he would come quickly and look over the litter as they scrabbled for their mother 's teats . He always believed you could tell a lot about a brand-new pup  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  while it was still wet and ruffled , before it took on the lumpy butterball shape of a puppy . He and Oliver would talk it over ; then they would select the pup they wanted to keep , and they would mark it , because within a day it would look no different from the rest of the litter . To this day I believe in that method . I believe I can see the future in a brand-new pup ... . As I remember it , there were more animals than people on the Howland place . And I guess they were more important too , because animals were business and cost money , and people , well unless they were your own family , you just did n't see them often enough . Winters were school , but that hardly counted because I lived out of town and did n't see too much of those children ; and summers I hardly saw anybody who did n't live on the place . I did n't go to Sunday school  --  I think both my grandfather and my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church unless it was for a wedding or a christening or a funeral . There was n't much to choose between them , really . They each had the same cakes and Cokes for the children and whiskey for the adults.  |p154I  did n't think much about the ways people arrived and departed . In fact I hardly thought about them when they were around . For all I cared , there was just me and Margaret 's Crissy and Nina . I never had very much to do with Robert . Even when he was living here , he did n't play with us . Ile was older , of course , and a boy ; and he was a serious child . He spent all his free time reading in a sunny corner of the back porch . His mother had taught him to be that way . So it was just three little girls . In all those acres . By this time the place was very large . My great-great-grandmother , the one from New Orleans , had gone land-crazy during the Reconstruction . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted more and more room in the country . It was she who looked up the old letters and found that the Howland farm had once been called Shirley . She tried to bring back the name ; all her papers and diaries referred to it that way . But it had n't worked , and after her death it went right back to being called the Howland Place the way it had always been . She had n't changed its name but she had changed its shape and its size . And she had also bought most of the timber lands that were going to be so valuable . When I was a child they were beginning to look to those stretches , and my grandfather was just beginning to realize what he owned . He was in no hurry . When he went into lumbering he would go in right , not just with one silly little coffeepot mill sawing away ... . He told us that , us three little girls , when he took us with him on those rides up to the timber lands . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways off . He only laughed and said : " I plain ought to charge them rent , " and he wrote that message on a piece of paper and left it there . A couple of nights later there was a bottle of white lightning standing on the kitchen table . He said it was awful stuff , that they had n't any idea how to make likker , and he gave it to Oliver . Crissy and Nina and me .... That was all . My grandfather didn'tp155like visitors . My mother preferred  --  more and more  --  to stay quietly at home and read or rest , she was n't very strong . And we were too far from town to walk in . Of course there were plenty of other children living on the place , Negro children from the tenant and the cropper cabins scattered around the farm . We did n't seem to play with them . I do n't know why . Most times we did n't even see them ; now and then we found them in the middle of a game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no matter we wanted to  --  they pulled away from us . They would n't have us , and after a while we stopped trying and forgot that they had ever been there . I never quite knew why . In town they played with white children . Maybe it was Margaret 's children , the half-bloods , that they did n't want . They understood about me , even if they did n't like me , but they did n't know about them . Almost the only time I went out was with some distant cousins from town . ( I went alone . Crissy and Nina stayed home . ) Once or twice a month my mother sent me in the car with Oliver to pick them up . I never much liked the outing , nor those children . They were younger than I , the last was just a baby still in diapers , and their names were Clara , Reggie , and Maxim Bannister . They would come out with their nurse , a great fat black woman who kept a bottle of gin hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for a ride . We always went the same way and to the same place  --  I suppose Oliver took the best road . We drove up the paved state highway for half an hour , the engine sputtering on the slopes but making it anyhow . At the top of Norton 's Hill we stopped at the old cemetery , the one that was n't used any more , right by the springfedlake where lots of people came to fish . We got out there and I did what my mother told me to do  --  breathe the air . There was supposed to be something especially good about it at that spot . As my mother explained it , it had something to do with ozone , but I forget just how it went . So I breathed in and out , played tag around the old graves , looked for skulls and bits of bones , andp156drank the Thermos jug of lemonade that we always brought along . Oliver , who was pretty much bored with the whole thing , sat on the running board of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with wood , only the peach pits . And he did the same thing over and over again , a funny little animal that might have been a monkey . Sometimes when he 'd gotten an unusuallylarge pit , he 'd cut two animals facing each other . " What 's that ? " I asked him practically every time we went out . " Lay-overs to catch meddlers , missy , " he 'd tell me quietly and that was that . I never did find out what they were , or what they were for , or what he did with them . I never saw any of them around , so I guess he did n't give them away ; but if he did n't then he must have had roomfulsof them in the house he shared with his old-maid sister down by the big spring that was called the Sobbing Woman . It was a good , cleaned-out spring . Somebody , my grandfather or his father , had taken a great pipe four feet across and sunk it there , so that when you knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotta . Beyond that rim somebody had laid other stones , so carefully that they were almost smooth and even as a sidewalk or a street . It was a big spring ; the water flowed out of its gap at a great rate and down across the stones into the run . As it went over those stones it gave the peculiar sound that had got it its name , the Sobbing Woman . I always went and looked straight down , the bottom of any spring seemed wonderful and mysterious to me , though I was never sure what I expected to find . This one particular time , as I was staring down into it , I saw two rats . They were near the bottom , they were a little off it because they seemed to be bobbing slightly , which meant that they had been there awhile and were beginning to rise . I never told Oliver or his sister , but I suppose they scooped them out when they came to the surface , and anyway the water from there did n't seem to hurt them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if maybep157there was n't always a rat in the spring and if that was n't the carving Oliver made . " That a rat ? " I asked him the next time we went for a drive . He studied the little piece of dried pit between his fingers . " Look like a rat ? " " No , " I said . " Not any I ever saw . " " Then , " he said , " I do n't reckon it is a rat . " " Looks like a monkey . " He looked again , turning it around and around in his black fingers . " You seen a monkey like that ? " I had to admit : " No . " " Then I reckon it ai n't a monkey . " That was all he 'd say besides telling me to go away and play because it was almost time for us to be starting back or my mama 'd worry . On the way back , somebody would be sure to have to go real bad , so bad they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get home , and the nurse was too , they did n't stop . I suppose with four kids they 'd have spent most of the trip back stopping . But they did n't have to . The nurse pushed aside the piece of old carpeting in the back , and she lifted the thin flat piece of tin that covered a hole in the floor . Then , propping both carpet and cover back with her foot , she motioned us to come on . If it was the baby , she 'd pull down his diaper herself and hold him over the raggedy hole . If it was any of us , we could do it ourselves . It was kind of fun to squint out the hole , when you got finished , and watch the uneven tarlinedconcrete whiz by underneath you . But the nurse never let us do that very long . She got tired holding up the rug and the piece of tin . I remember things like that . About that time too , the drifters arrived . They came to our kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked up the path from the woods by the river , the girl leading the way , the boy following , but not too closely . They seemed about six and seven , ordinary-looking Negro children , more raggedy than most . They moved slowly  --  not hurrying , but not uncertain either  --  right up to the door . They turned around and sat down on the steps there , silently . And tucked their heads in their laps , like ducks , dozing . My mother lifted her eyebrows . " Drifters ? " My grandfather nodded . " Looks like we be having these two for a while . " We did . They stayed for almost a month . Everyone was very kind to them because there was a saying that if you chased off a drifter you yourself would be hungry before the year was out . In those depression times there was a lot of moving about . My grandfather said that there were streams of people on the main roads , in little trucks with all their furniture and bedding piled around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work , they were moving out of towns looking for places to settle . And with all that going on , some children lost their families . Maybe they died ( there was a bad winter in ' 36 when a lot of people died , whole housefuls ) ; and maybe they just moved on and forgot to take all the children . And sometimes they did n't forget , they intended to lose them . It was that sort of time . Those left-over children became the drifters . They went about in little bands , like stray dogs , two and three and four . Sometimes they were brother and sister and sometimes they had just found each other out on the roads . They traveled amazingly far , when you think how small some of them were . They did n't know who they were  --  most times they had only first names  --  and they did n't have any place to go . They lived out in the fields and the deep woods , and sometimes they found a cave and stayed there awhile . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing what theyp159needed . Winters they came into the barns for shelter , sleeping with the same cattle they had been milking on the sly all summer . And sometimes they would come straight up to a house and wait for food , as those two did . At suppertime Margaret filled two pie plates and brought them to the porch . They ate , without forks or spoons , steadily and daintily , like cats . When they were finished , they disappeared . They came back once or twice a day , as if they could n't remember when it was that we ate . " You 've got to do something about them , Papa , " my mother insisted . " I 'm feeding ' em . " " You know what I mean . " He shook his head . " You want me to put ' em in a cage ? " " Really , now . " " World 's got a lot of troubles , " he said slowly , " and you ca n't worry over them all . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep ' em . " He was right , of course . One day they were gone . They had n't said a single word to anybody all that month , and they did n't give any sign that they were leaving . Just one day they did n't come any more .... We did n't know who they were , nor where they 'd come from . Drifters were like that . And I remember when the war began . We had n't turned on the radio that Sunday , because we 'd worked straight through the day . It was hog-sticking time . Lots of the girls at school said they could n't bear to watch , but it never bothered me , and anyway my grandfather expected me to learn . Work really started the day before when the knives , the two-sided slaughtering knives , were honed on the back porch . By then the hogs had been brought to the slaughter pen ;  |p160they  had n't eaten for two days , but they kept Oliver and a couple of boys busy filling the water troughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began putting shovelfuls of hardwood ash into barrels of boiling water  --  to scald the hair away . The butchers came , three men hired specially from town . They 'd test the knives and stick their fingers into the water ( if it was too hot the hair got stiff and difficult to scrape ) . And then , just as it was getting light , they 'd start to work . They tried not to excite the hogs , tried to move them out of the pen one or two at a time ; but somehow it did n't ever work . The last ones got wild , and had to be knocked on the head or shot with a rifle . Oliver did the shooting ; he stood on the edge of the pen , pumping his shots into the grunting squealing heads below him . My grandfather always hated to tell him to start . " Pity to do that , child , " he 'd tell me , " the meat ai n't going to taste right done that way . Their hearts bound to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way was to stick them , to jab the knife over the heart and cut all those veins and arteries and let the heart pump out its own blood ... . Soon as Oliver finished his shooting , the pen was full of men dragging at the hogs , to wash and scrape them , to slit them open and hang them . All the time my grandfather bustled around saying something like " Cool it fast . Prop ' em open .... " It was late evening before the meat was finally cut and salted in barrels waiting for the smoking . By then my grandfather was staggering tired , and I had a couple of new bladders to make balls with . We went straight to bed , while my mother clucked and fussed over us . " Papa , you 'll wear that child out . " My grandfather was so stooped with weariness that he seemed short . " She 's got to know the way of the place . " Since my mother had n't listened to the radio ( she never did turn it on ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor . I found out the next day at school.  |p161We  all left our classrooms in the middle of the morning and crowded into the downstairs hall to listen to the President asking for a declaration of war . The school had only one small radio , and they turned it on top volume so that everybody could hear . The words were blurry and not at all clear , and I remember wondering what everybody was so excited about . I did n't understand . For me the war had started when my father went off to fight , and that was over two years before . There was one immediate difference  --  planes . Before , you almost never saw any  --  we were n't on any of the regular air runs . Now there were lots of them , zooming up and down and buzzing houses and scaring the cattle worse than ox-warble flies . There were accidents too . You 'd hear about them occasionally . My third cousin Hester , who lived on her father 's place a little to the north of town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A trainer shot by overhead , trying to land in a cotton field . It missed in the dark , tore through the field into the wood lot , exploding as it went . It started a brushfire that ate its way up the back ridges , running fast before a rising wind . Troops worked for two days , hundreds of them , before they got it in the right place and could dynamite it . My cousin Hester kept a piece of the plane 's glass . It was broken into a sort of heart shape , and polished by the fire . Her father drilled a tiny hole in it for her , and she wore it around her neck on the same little chain that held her gold cross . That piece of broken melted glass was just about all the war we had . There were a few uniforms around and a navy poster in front of the post office . And the town looked empty . The young men had been drafted . The older men and the young women had gone down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipyardsthere . That left nobody except women with small children , and those who would n't leave their homes to go job hunting with their husbands . Most all of the hands were gone . Kids chopped cotton , andp162brought it in too , and the way they picked made my grandfather sick at heart . But the prices were so high he could afford to waste , and anyway he was n't nearly as bad off as some of his neighbors . He did n't have much in cotton any more . Cattle and hogs did n't take nearly the manpower . lie was also doing a lot more lumbering than he ever had before . Way on the other side of the ridge there was a big new sawmill that went day and night , and a new railroad spur leading to it . My grandfather and my mother listened to the radio every night and every morning , and he kept marking the war map he 'd pinned up on the dining-room wall . But that was all . Or it was all I noticed . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were doing that . It was Margaret who 'd first told us the story of the hoop snake , the long black snake that has a smile on his face , and a taste for fun and games . When the moon was new , he 'd crawl out on dirt roads and roll himself into a hoop , holding his tail in his mouth . It was lots of fun for him , so he 'd sing a song as he went along . And the song was so jolly that all the animals would come out and listen , the coons and possums , and the other snakes , and the deer , and the bobcats . The mice and the rabbits came to the edge of their burrows . And even the birds woke up and listened . Nina and I , soon as the moon was new , we 'd sneak out of bed and meet behind the chicken yard . We looked and looked , for miles in all directions , and stayed up most of the nights that way . ( I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though the teacher must have noticed , she did n't say anything . She was an old lady and happy to have one child really quiet . ) For all our work we never found a single hoop snake , not one . Though we did see lots of tracks . And while we hunted the road , we were on the lookout for Johnny Cuckoo too . He was the crippled soldier who marched up and down the empty roads , and all the little kids sang about him . We didn'tp163really expect to find him , because he mostly came out and walked on dark and stormy nights , when it was raining hard and blowing and he was sure to be covered with mud . But we kept an eye out for him anyway . There was no telling . In those days I was far more at home outside the house than in it . The house was shivery and strange and there were things going on that I did n't understand . Nobody told me  --  you just learn to find out things  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the word " tuberculosis " whispered about , but a fair number of people around our way had it , and it did n't seem to do them too much harm , and it certainly did n't kill them , so I did n't know what to think . One day Margaret packed my clothes and pushed me in the car and Oliver drove me into town to stay with my cousins , the Bannisters . On the way over he told us that Margaret 's children were going to stay with him . I do n't think he was very happy about that , he and his old-maid sister , with children in the house for the first time  --  but there was n't anybody else . Margaret and my grandfather took my mother to a sanitarium near Santa Fe . They were there the best part of a year . And only my grandfather and Margaret came back , my mother was buried out there . But all this was still in the future that cloudy gusty day in June when Oliver drove me to my cousins ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Maxie were lined up on the porch waiting for me . Maxie was chewing the top of the porch railing . " You 'll get lead poisoning , " I told him , and he stopped . " Do n't you take care of him ? " I asked Clara . " Do n't you know anything ? " I was n't particularly happy to stay with them , and I really did n't like being in town where you never could get away from people 's eyes . They knew when you walked down the street , whether you went to the drugstore or the dentist , whether you had a cherry Cokep164or a root beer . The only secrets you had were the ones inside your head ... . These particular grown-up cousins ( they were Peter and Betsy Bannister ; he ran the Pyrofax office in town ) were just about the only ones my family was on good terms with . There were others I liked a lot more ( I had dozens of them all around ) , but these were the only ones my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century , to the time of the Catholic Mrs. Howland from New Orleans . What with her religion and the way her father made his money , the Howland family had not treated her very well ; they split into those who would accept her and those who would n't . Now she was long dead , but the different cousins went on being cool to each other . I once asked my grandfatherwhy we did n't see some cousins who lived only a little way out of town and who had four sons and the oldest was the star basketball player on the high school team . He shrugged . " Damnfoolthing , child , but they were right mean to my grandmother . " He did n't try to change it though , maybe because he did n't want to have to deal with more family than he already had . And that was why I found myself staying with the Bannisters . Cousin Peter traveled a great deal  --  I forget why  --  and he was supposedto have a mistress in Birmingham . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carried cans of special diet food with him . He always seemed to be eating fruit of some kind , and when he did sit down at the table with us , his plate was never like ours . Years later , on one of those trips to Birmingham , he happened to go to a revival meeting , and he was converted . Now , this preacher was a healer who told him that he did n't need insulin if he believed in God 's Grace and Healing Power . He sent Cousin Peter home with God 's Holy Words rolled up in a little wad and tied around his neck with thread . Cousin Peter did believe , so he threw out his syringes and he sat on the porch ( it was a hot day ) praying for a miracle , until he passed into a coma . Cousin Betsy hesitated to callp165a doctor because she did n't think Peter would like it if she interrupteda miracle or anything like that ; and by the time she got him to the hospital it was too late and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house was long before he got - religion and killed himself . In those days he was just a kind pleasant man , who did n't seem to be around very much . Cousin Betsy was a short stout woman , quiet and easygoing . She had two or three servants but the house was always dirty . " All this town dust , " she would cluck , " it just comes in all the cracks . " It also came in all the windows , because nobody ever bothered to shut them , even if it was raining or blowing . They closed them for warmth in the winter , but not before . And the heavy greasy cooking that you could smell from the minute you began climbing the front steps came from a black wood range ( Aunt Betsy had never gotten around to changing and the cook liked this one ) that had grease and soot a quarter inch thick all over it . Like the windows , the doors were always open and the screens sagged partially ajar , and animals wandered through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a stray cat and I do n't know why she picked that spot  --  but Cousin Betsy fed her until she decided to leave . And of course birds flew in and out of the upstairs windows . It was an old house and they had never got around to screening the second story . We all slept in tester beds hung with mosquito netting . ( And that probably was n't such a bad idea because in those days there was considerable malaria in this part of the country . ) Once wasps built a great nest in the upstairs hall , right over the picture of Cousin Betsy 's father , the one who 'd been Senator from South Carolina . She did n't seem to notice , though the rest of us used to dash along that part of the hall for fear of them . They finally bit Jeff , the cook 's husband , while he was changing the bulb in the overhead light . He almost fell off the ladder and he did drop the glass cover with a great crash . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves up in layers of mosquito netting , andp166got rid of them . Afterwards the upstairs hall was lighted by a bare bulb because the glass shade was broken , and things like that did n't bother Cousin Betsy . There was only one thing that did , as far as I remember . That was underwear . Everybody in that house always had new or almostnewand very fancy underwear . She kept careful check . " Now , honey , " she explained to me , " if you were walking downtown and you were run over by a truck and they took you to the hospital and they saw that your panties were all torn and ragged and your slip was pinned at the shoulder by a safety , you 'd be so ashamed you 'd have to die . " " And just think how people would talk after , " I tried to joke with her . She did n't see it . " And think of that , " she said seriously . " Yes , indeed . " But it really was n't bad living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my grandfather 's sister , came down to see me every month or so , I suppose it was her way of checking up on the Bannisters . ( She was such a neat woman that house must have made her sick . ) The rest of my life was almost the same . I went to school , the same one , only I could walk , and it was rather nice not having to make that long drive every day . Once you got used to it , there were lots of things to do in town . There were even lots of things to do in the house , though it never seemed to occur to Clara , Reggie , and Maxie to do any of them . I had to show them . Maybe it was because they lived there , and just did n't see any more . Take their house itself . It was one of the funny old town houses built and rebuilt so many times that nobody was sure exactly where anything was . It had a narrow front , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire lot . There were halls and wings andp167different levels . Lots of people had added to the house but they had n't bothered to attach their different wings very carefully . I once broke my arm because I forgot and sprawled down the step that went from the breakfast room to the kitchen behind it . The farthest back rooms of the house , the ones behind even the second kitchen , were used for nothing but storage . They were full of wrapped and lumpy things , an occasional dead bird , rat poison , old trunks , and hat racks . Clara , Reggie , Maxie , and I would open the trunks sometimes , the ones that were n't locked . It was a way to spend a rainy day . A lot of the trunks were full of dresses , of wedding dresses mostly . In some the cloth was so delicate that it tore when you picked up the bead ornaments . The egret feathers fluttered into dust when we lifted them out . There were musky furs too ; we had to tear open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaries and journals and letters . And one of the trunks had half a dozen old pistols , two cavalry sabers , and four dress swords . We played soldiers with them all one long afternoon . I suppose we destroyed quite a bit of the stuff we handled . But I did n't think of it then , and I do n't feel badly about it now , because it was just lying there , in storage , and the moths and the roaches were doing more slowly what we did rapidly . They were lovely rooms , stuffy and hot ; dust hung in the air like smoke , and the motes drifted back and forth in the panels of light from the dirty windows . As you went through the line of storage rooms , you noticed that they got smaller and smaller toward the rear . Those must once have been slaves ' or servants ' quarters . The very end of the house was n't even a room really , but a kind of last-minute addition . It was painted the same color as the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't been built for an all-weather room at all . It was more of a tool shed . There were no inside walls  --  just the studs and the outsideboards  --  and the floor had been laid any old way , with greatp168gaping cracks in it . There was a door leading to the outside yard , but it had been nailed shut years before , probably to keep out burglars . The nails were bleeding streaks of rust down the wood . The room itself was completely empty . There was just the dusty uneven floor and the dirty unfinished walls , and that was all . The walls were n't even very solid . Unlike the rest of the house , which was clapboard , the boards of these walls ran straight up and down ; there were cracks between all of them and large knotholes in some of them . It was n't the room . It was what you could see from there . We found out by accident , but once we knew we kept coming back . Just to see . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that marked the property line . Now this fence had been built seven boards high , but it sagged a great deal until part of it was actually leaning against the house . If you stood in the Bannister yard , it looked like a good solid fence and it really was way over your head . But when you were inside you stood on the foundations of the house  - -  and because it was an old house , its foundations were very high . ( They thought it gave them good circulation in the old days and kept down the fevers . ) The other house , the house on the next street , also extended almost to the property line . Though it was an old house too ( there were few new ones in town at that time ) , the additions had been done recently . They had been done very cheaply too , and so they sat almost right on the ground . Because they were so low and the board fence was so high , people over there seemed to think they could n't be seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack of that tool room  --  if we stood on a crate to give a little more height  --  we could see right in . We saw a dresser , of some dark wood , mahogany or walnut . It had a lace scarf hanging across the front in scallops and down the sides in long fringes . There was a line of china ornaments too , but we could n't make out exactly what they were . I thought elephants ,  |p169but  Clara said no , they were china dolls . There was a bed with a pink spread and a couple of bright blue pillows . There was also a brown-haired lady whom we caught sight of now and then . She always seemed to be wearing a pink ruffly robe . The material seemed a bit stiff and shiny , so maybe it was taffeta . We never did see her face , because the head of the bed was out of sight around the corner of the window . And she did n't seem to be home very much unless she was expecting a caller . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to take a peep through the crack into the room . If it was empty we went outside to play in the yard . Usually we stayed near the back fence , so when we heard feet on the cinder walk , and a knock on the door that led into that back addition , we could go tearing into our tool house and start squabbling over who would get to stand on the box . She took the pink spread off the bed first , so it would n't get spoiled . She always did it quickly , right after they 'd first come in . With her long brown hair swinging around the sides of her face , she 'd turn the spread back and hang it over the foot of the bed . Then she 'd step to the other side of the room , out of our sight . There seemed to be something else over there , chairs maybe and a table , I do n't know . The two of them stayed over there quite a while sometimes , and we 'd get pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening for so long and he yanked the box out from under me , and I tore my leg on the head of a nail as I fell . Sooner or later they 'd get to the bed . Their heads were completely out of sight under the window ledge . All we ever saw was the tangle of moving bodies . Sometimes they were dressed and sometimes they were naked  --  it was pretty much the same heaving lump , wrapping and unwrapping , pumping and jerking . We watched all through that one summer . Even when we had to go to school we kept it up  --  until the late afternoons got too coldp170to be standing by a crack in a tool shed . And by the time winter was over , we 'd almost forgotten . It was n't the thing to do any longer . We did n't care who she was . It was n't who that interested us . It was what . Years later , when I thought of it again , I remembered that Dr. Harry Armstrong , who was my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brown hair . Her mother was dead and her father was pretty poor , so they only had one servant , who fixed them dinner in the middle of the day and left them a cold supper on the stove . I do n't remember Linda Armstrong very clearly . She was much older and she went to Chicago to find a job , after a while . She married there and moved to Des Moines , and never came back . When her father got very old and had a stroke and was kind of silly and half crippled too , he sold the house and moved out with her . I suppose we left the boxes in place under the crack of that tool house , and eventually somebody found them , and figured out what had been going on . Because , that following spring when I proposed that we go back there , my cousins got a funny expression and said no , they were n't allowed in that room any more . Their little pudgy pasty faces looked scared , but I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare do anything to me . I went swaggering back to the shed , but both doors had new hasps and padlocks ... . In May my mother died at the hospital in New Mexico . She was buried there . When they heard , the whole family was terribly upset . They thought she should have been brought home , all the Howlands had been buried in Wade County since the first one had wandered in here . They 'd even brought home the bones of the boy who 'd died in the Wilderness and the one who 'd died of yellow fever in Cuba.  |p171They  were always gathered together . Until now . " Just what I expected of Will Howland , " Cousin Betsy said , " and imagine her lying all alone way out there . All by herself . " Now it did n't seem to me to matter much where you were when you were dead . One place was as roomy and fine as another . I might have said so too , only nobody asked me . Every time they saw me , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick look of consolation on their faces . " Poor child , " they would say . At first when I heard , when the phone call came , I got a hard frightened lump in my stomach and it stayed for a couple of days while I felt lonesome and confused . But it did n't last . I had n't seen too much of my mother since we 'd moved back ; even when she was living in the house with us , she was mostly lying down or reading in the summerhouse . It was Margaret who took care of us . And it was Margaret I missed when they left . But that passed too . After all they 'd been gone a year , and that 's a long time to a child . You miss them and you wonder about them and you hurt  --  hard , for a while . But it eases and it 's over . I met my grandfather and Margaret at the station and went home with them . We sat down on the front porch , while Margaret went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , and he was a good deal thinner . You could see the muscles in his neck and count them . We just sat for a while and watched a big blackand-yellowspider with thick furry legs . " I did n't bring her home , " my grandfather said as if I had n't heard . " It did n't seem the thing to do . " There were two spiders just about this time every year . They would come and live in that same bush with the yellow flowers  --  great heavy creatures . My grandfather noticed them . " They come in their season , " he said , " everything does . " I thought about the Biblical passage my cousin had given me to read the day we first heard my mother was dead . Something aboutp172the wind blowing over the grass and the seasons of things , but I could n't quite remember it . " People around here , " my grandfather said , " they wo n't like it , and they 'll talk , way they always do . Talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More fun than cards even for religious folk .... " I picked up a stone that happened to be on the porch boards and tossed it at one spider . I hit it ; the spider dropped down and disappeared . " It was this way , " my grandfather said , not appearing to notice . " She hated to travel so , got so tired on the trip out , it did n't seem right to make her come back . Hating a thing that much you 're bound to hate it still , even dead . " The spider climbed back . I started to throw another rock , but I scowled myself into keeping quiet . " Earth 's the same anywhere , I figured , and with her hating to travel .... " His voice kind of trailed off and in a minute he got up and went inside . " Now you can chuck at the spider , " I told myself . That was all . Living back on the place again , I lost track of town . I did n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from . But they talked , I 'm sure . It 's the way they are . There was a memorial service , later , when my grandfather gave a stained-glass window to the Methodist church in town , with a memorial to Abigail Howland Mason spelled out at the bottom . Some folks did n't like that either , they thought it made the church look too Popish . Maybe they all felt that way , but they did n't feel they could say no , not with the way Will Howland always paid the largest bills . It took a year to get the window made . By that time the death wasp173so far off nobody felt very sad any more . I even sort of liked going to church because I did n't go very often . After the service , my Aunt Annie ( who 'd come down from Atlanta especially ) gave a big supper . Like most of those things , there was a lot of likker and some of the men passed out on the grass , and some of the women went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drag racing on the mill road , and smashed their cars up and had to be taken to the county hospital ( Dr. Armstrong was one of the ones who had passed out ) to be sewed back together again . That was the way my mother 's life ended , with a grave in New Mexico and a stained-glass window in the Methodist church in Madison City . That fall Margaret 's second child , Nina , went off to school . Money was a lot easier now and so she went to an expensive girls ' school in Vermont ( she eventually won the school 's prize for figure skating , though she 'd never had a pair of skates on before she went North ) . She wrote , more often than Robert , and she sent pictures . But she never saw her mother again . And Margaret did n't write . My grandfather answered her letters and Robert 's , and though he must have given them news of their mother , it was as if she were dead or a million miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he went twice a year . Margaret never went at all . She stayed with the last one , the baby , Crissy . It seemed to me that Margaret was a lot more affectionate with her . I noticed that whenever she passed , she 'd scoop her up and give her a hug  --  something I do n't ever remember her doing with either Robert or Nina . And in a way Crissy was the nicest of the lot . Her red hair was sort of curly and it was always sticking out in wisps around her head ; her eyes were more green than blue , and she had a string of freckles across her nose and her chin . She was eventemperedand happy and almost never sick . She was also the bright/est , a lot brighter than Robert , though everybody encouraged him more . She 'd learned to read from the old magazines my grandfather gave her , and long before she was ready to go to school she was readingfrom my old story books . She 'd curl herself up in the crotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled for the whole morning . I liked her . She was just the sort of child you could n't help liking . My grandfather liked her too , and evenings he would play with her by the hour . He 'd never done that with the other children . Maybe he 'd never had chance before . With my mother dead , he seemed to find more time for the last baby in the house . Still  --  when I was sixteen and in high school  --  and Crissy was eleven , she went away , like the others . And like them , she never came back . Not even on vacation . This time , because I was older , I asked about it . One day when my grandfather was repairing the pickets of the fence that enclosed the dooryard , I asked him straight out : " Do n't you miss Crissy some ? " He had a couple of nails in his mouth and he took them out slowly . " You could say I do . " He had gained back the weight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big heavy man again . His face was smooth and pink and unlined ; his eyes were the same bright light blue . I was always surprised at how bright their color her go to school here , " I asked , " if you miss her ? " He yanked up a rotten picket and tossed it aside . " You know as well as I do , lady . " " No , " I persisted , " I want to know why . " He was n't bothering to look at me . " I reckon you want me to putit in words for you .... Seems I can remember when I was little Ihated to put a thing in words . . . . Scared of the words somehow . " He took the new picket and fitted it against the railing with the others . " You know what it 's like for a nigger here . And those kids ,  |p175they  fall right in the middle , they ai n't white and they ai n't black .... " He put a nail in place , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they go to do around here ? The war do n't last forever . The plants 'll close and the shipyards . We 'll all go back to sleep again . " Another nail and the picket was in place . He moved down the fence , shaking each as he went , looking for the rotted-out ones . " There 's hardly a living for the people we got here now , " he said . " And they 're bright kids , they got a way to go . " He found one , knocked it free with the side of his hammer , and twisted it clear of the fence . " Since I got no place here , I 'm sending ' em where they got room . " " Oh , " I said . " Seems I got the money to do it . " He stopped working and looked straight at me . " Happens you 're all that interested . . . Robert goes to Carnegie Tech this September . " " That 's Pittsburgh , " I said , just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to say for you , lady ? " " Well , " I said , " I ca n't help wondering . " " No , " he said , " I reckon you ca n't . " " What does Margaret think with all her kids gone ? " He was looking at me levelly , the bright blue eyes light and clear . " Our kids , " he said quietly . It was the first time he had ever said that . It was as if my mother 's death had made things more open to him . " Matter of fact , " he said , " it was Margaret 's idea . " At the time I did n't understand . I just thought it was odd . I thought all mothers always wanted to keep their children around them until the children themselves wandered off . I did n't see what Margaret was doing . I was sixteen and I was in love . It was a boy in my class . His namep176was Stanley Carter and he had great luminous brown eyes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new druggist and they came from Memphis . I did n't really get to see too much of him , because he lived in town , while I lived out on my grandfather'splace . So I spent most of the long afternoons and evenings  --  when I ought to have been studying  --  writing long letters to him , which I tore up afterwards . I wrote long poems too , about stars for eyes and clover breath and so forth . I pulled the curtains in my room and turned on one very small light and stretched out on the bed and wrote on a clipboard I held up  --  as if I were writing on the ceiling . Since I could n't write for long that way  --  my arms would start to ache and I 'd have to let down the board  --  I spent most of the time staring at the cracked ceiling and the stained strips of wallpaper . " Let her be , " my grandfather told Margaret , " it 's love and she 's pining . " I tried to glare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grinning right straight at you . " Nobody in this house , " I told him , " understands a single thing . Not a single thing . " And I flounced upstairs and started to write an epic poem about unrequited love and star-crossed lovers and all that . Pretty soon I got tired of fitting words into meter , so I read Romeo and Juliet straight through again , crying at the saddest passages . Sometimes I 'd climb to the top of the scuppernong trellis by the back door . I 'd lie there for hours , staring into the sky and eating the soft yellow grapes . I 'd try to see straight on up and through the sky , I 'd try to see what was beyond the blue shell . Sometimes I 'd think I could , that I was just about to . And then sometimes I knew I could n't and the sky was a hard china teacup clamped down on the world . I was busy with things like that and I was n't paying attention to anything else . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p177That  was one of the times I had not come down to supper . Margaretknocked on my door and I yelled that I was busy writing poetry and could n't possibly stop . ( My grandfather never argued . ) By nine o'clock , long after supper , I got hungry . I padded downstairs in my socks , the boards smooth and cool and silent to my feet . I remember hearing the faint crackle of wood in the living-room fireplace  --  it was late fall and the nights were sharp and damp . I came down the stairs carefully , silently . ( I was still young enough to get a thrill out of moving without a sound , a hang-over from my days of playing Indian . ) The hall was dark ; the lamp that usually burned beside the mercury-spotted pier glass had been turned off . The only lights were in the living room , where Margaret and my grandfather were . They could n't see me in the dark hall and they had n't heard me . He was reading one of his papers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . The whole room looked like a set , or a picture . Margaret stopped sewing , her hands fell into her lap . Her head lifted and she stared across the room into the fire . He must have felt her move because he folded his paper and laid it aside . She did not turn . Her masculine head on its thin neck held perfectly still . The wood of his chair creaked as he got up , the boards of the floor sighed under his weight as he walked over to her and bent down . Then because he was still too tall , because she was sitting in the low rocker with the swan-head legs , he knelt down and put his arms around her . She turned her head then , dropping it to his shoulder , pressing it into his neck . I backed away and ran upstairs , still keeping perfectly silent . I was afraid . No , it was more than that . I was just plain scared . That was the only gesture I ever saw pass between them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her grandchildren on a driving tour of the West . The whole thing wasp178decided quickly . " You should go , " my grandfather said firmly . " Good for you . " And the very next day , Aunt Annie and four grandchildrendrove over from Atlanta in a big new black Cadillac and picked me up . I was absolutely delighted . Her oldest grandson , the one who would help with the driving , was extremely handsome . Six weeks touring around the country with him sounded pretty terrific . Later , much later , I found out why they had been in such a hurry to spirit me away . That was the summer my father came to see me . My grandfather found out his plans somehow , and off I went to the Grand Canyon and the Painted Desert . I wonder what they had to say to each other , when my father came to Madison City and found that I had been spirited away . In a way I 'm sorry I did n't meet him , at least to see what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother angrily had not kept any pictures . ) But on the other hand I would n't have known quite what to say to him ; you ca n't very well talk about blood . Or maybe you can . . . . But I did n't . I was away traveling . All I remember of the tour is a jumble of mountains and snow peaks , ice-cold lakes and endless deserts , strange flowers and an ocean that did n't look real . On the way home , I stopped in Atlanta . I was to buy things for my first year at college . " Child , " Aunt Annie said , " your clothes are appalling . How could Willie let you go around looking like that ? " " I bought my own clothes , with Margaret . " Her face went blank . " This time I think I 'll take Margaret 's place with you . " We took Ellen , her oldest granddaughter , along  --  she 'd been to the state university for three years and had just quit to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a college wardrobe for me  --  it was all very wholesale and grand , like the West we had seen a few weeks before , and just as confused . My Aunt Annie was an energeticp179woman and she enjoyed every minute . Once when I hesitated over a sleek black suit , she bristled with annoyance . " What 's the matter now ? " she said . " What are you waiting for ? " " It 's kind of expensive , " I told her . " Child , child . . . " she hissed her exasperation , the way so many fat women do , " he can afford it . . . . But it would be just like Willie not to tell you anything . . . . If he complains about the bills , just you ask him about his lumber business and he 'll hush up . " That night after dinner , she decided that I must have a car . " Living way out there , you have to have an easy way to get back and forth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , learn , " she said emphatically . " Really now ! " And I was quiet , because nothing like this had happened , ever before . " I 'm going to call Will about it right now . " She went directly into the hall to telephone . My Uncle Howland said quietly from his chair : " Annie is a driving woman . " " I just never thought about it like that . " He lifted his brandy glass . " Taste  --  no ? You ca n't hide down on that farm all your life , honey , and Willie ca n't keep you there . " " I live there . " He waved the glass at me . The light danced on the bubble caught in the stem . " You got to be what you are , the granddaughter of one of the richest men in that state . " I looked shocked . And he chuckled . " War money , maybe , but money all the same . " Annie came back beaming . " Willie is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " Later that evening , when she too was a little flushed with brandy , she told her husband : " I asked Willie if he were fixing to come to Ellen 's wedding . " " He said no , I reckon . "  | " Too busy . . . . You know , Howie , I just worry about him . He does n't ever want to come off that place . He does n't want to leave that Margaret . " " Shush , " my uncle said . So I went to college . I had a new blue-and-white Ford convertible and a mink stole and a terrible quaking fear that woke me up in the middle of the night . I would often lie in my bed in the cheerful chintzy sorority house and shiver with longing to get in that new car and drive home . I never liked college . I just got to dislike it less the longer I was there . When I came home for my first vacation  --  at Christmas that year  --  my grandfather said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place you 'd sooner go . " " Stay away for good like Margaret 's children ? " His eyes did n't even flicker . " No , " he said , " you can come back . ... You can but you might not want to , someday . " I hugged him then , because I was sorry I 'd reminded him about his other children , and because he 'd begun to look old in the hard morning light . I 'd been up all night driving and I felt fine . " I 'd like to live here , " I told him , " all the rest of my life . " He was pleased and I could see it , but since he was n't demonstrativehe only rubbed his chin and said : " Depend where your man 'll live . " " I have n't got a beau . " " You will , " he said . " You will . " It was crispy cool and I was wearing the new mink . I rubbed myfingers up and down the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe , " he said , " if you found the right kind of fellow . " " Wo n't marry any other kind . " " You got to be careful , " he said heavily , " your mama marriedp181for love and it ran out on her and she was left with nothing to hold her heart together . " " Not me , " I said , " not me . " " Well , " he said , " you need a cup of coffee . Come inside and we 'll see what Margaret 's got . " I spent four blurred vague years at college . Green lawns , whitecolumnedbuildings , and flowerbeds . Fingers that ached with notetaking , head that ached with cigarette smoke , legs that ached with long hours in spike heels . The unfamiliar singing of alcohol in my ears , and lips that went suddenly numb . And parties . There was a place on a TVA lake , a pretty spot with woods dose all around except for the single road that led to the landing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines on each side . At the very end was a large float with a diving board . It was where you went on Saturday nights after the restaurants and cafes and clubs had all closed . It was always jammed  --  not that anybody particularly wanted a big group , but there was only one float and everybody crowded on it . Sometimes there 'd be a guitar and we 'd sing . Once Ted Anderson brought a harmonica . He did n't play too well , not nearly like I 've heard Negroes play . But it was good enough . And the soft sad reedy sounds drifting out over the still water and softeningtheir edges on the pines  --  well , you remember things like that . And you remember how warm bourbon tasted , in a paper cup with water dipped out of the lake at your feet . How the nights were so unbearably , hauntingly beautiful that you wanted to cry How every patch of light and shadow from the moon seemed deep and lovely . Calm or storm , it did n't matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I wonder now how I lost it , the mysteriousness , the wonder . Itp182faded steadily until one day it was entirely gone , and night became just dark , and the moon was only something that waxed and waned and heralded a changing in the weather . And rain just washed out graveled roads . The glitter was gone . And the worst part was that you did n't know exactly at what point it disappeared . There was nothing you could point to and say : now , there . One day you saw that it was missing and had been missing for a long time . It was n't even anything to grieve over , it had been such a long time passing . That glitter and hush-breath quality just slipped away . The way most things do , I 've found out . The way my mother 's life did , gently , m bit by bit , until it was gone and I did n't even have the satisfaction of mourning . And my love too . There is n't even a scene  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seepage , the worms of time . Like those wedding dresses my cousins and I found so long ago in the old storage trunks . They looked all right . But when you picked them up , they fell of their own weight , without even a breath touchingthem , and even the bits of pieces you held in your fingers crumpled . That 's the way it happened with me , during the years . Things that I thought surrounded me have pulled back . Sometimes I wonder if I am not like an island the tide has left , leaving only some sea wrack on the beaches , useless things . I look at my children now and I think : how long before they slip away , before I am disappointed in them ... . But it does n't matter . Not really . Not to me . Not any more . I have come to expect no more than this . At least I am not disappointed ... . But in those days at college , everything glittered and gleamed and my nerves quivered at the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a chance to wear my date 's coat . After my first real dance , I did n't sleep at all . I lay in my bed and shivered and remembered until I saw dawn break and sun pour in the window.  |p183It  was all part of it , it all went together : the slight bobbing movement of the float , the sad sobbing strains of the harmonica , the dark moon-crusted trees . Ted Anderson only brought that harmonica once . Maybe that was why it sounded so good . I nearly died , too , one of those lovely nights . We had been drinking on the float when somebody said : " Throw ' em in . " And they did , all the girls in their best dresses went over the edge of the float . I do n't think they 'd have heard me in all the squealing and screaming , even if I had remembered to tell them . But I did n't  --  until I felt the cold of the water I did n't remember that I could n't swim . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my yells were n't any good . I had a great full skirt on , I remember , and lots of petticoats ; they were fashionable then . For half a minute they kept me up , and that was all . I held my breath when I sank and fought my way up to the surface , got a new breath and went down again . It seemed forever , up and down  --  and then I made a mistake . I broke water so briefly that I had n't filled my lungs and I could n't resist the impulse to take a breath going down . Once you have water in your mouth , once you start coughing under water , it does n't take long . I remember only a couple of coughs and then I passed out . They said later that they found me a couple of feet under the surface , floating face down , and that they had a devil of a time hauling me up on the float with all my wet petticoats getting in the way . I remember coming to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an awful pressure on my back was jamming my breast into the canvas-covered deck of the float . I struggled to turn over . " Stop pushing me , " I said . " The floor 's hard . It hurts . " Somebody said : " She 's all right . " " My God , " somebody else said , " I need a drink . Scared me sober . " " Take your time , " the first voice said . " I 'll take care of her . " Andp184then somebody picked me up . I could have opened my eyes to see , but it seemed like too great an effort . I did , finally . I was lying on the back seat of a car , and there was only a little tiny glow from the light that went on when you opened the door . The people who had brought me  --  I heard them begin to walk away , heard them talking : " Where 'd you leave the bottle ? " " Out on the float . " " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone . I jerked up , reaching for the door . The first thing I touched was a dripping-wet shirt that had a warm body inside it . And a pair of wet arms grabbed me hard . I recognized him : Tom Stanley . " Where the hell do you think you 're going now ? " He held out a cup of whiskey . I drank it quickly , noticing for the first time the cold in my body , the cold of near-death . I shivered , hard . " Take another one . " He poured it . " What happened , for God 's sake ? " " I ca n't swim , " I said , and my voice was hoarse and broken . He was silent for just a moment . Then he sucked his teeth softly . " We never thought of that , " he said . " We just plain never thought of that . " I drank his whiskey . My mouth tasted awful , as if I 'd been throwingup . I wondered if I had , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim ? " he repeated . " Where the hell 'd you grow up ? " " Why the hell 'd you throw me in ? " I put my face into the wet front of his shirt and began to cry . The more I cried the harder I held on to him , and by the time I felt better , I had crawled all over him , and had my face jammed into his Adam 's apple and my arms wrapped around his neck . When I finishedand started scrubbing at my face with my hands , he gave me his handkerchief . " I 'll drive you home , " he said . " I 'll go tell them we 're leaving . " He walked back to the float , and I decided to move to the front seat . I got out all right , but then I nearly fell , my legs were so shaky.  |p185I  had to hold on to the back door and fumble with the front latch . When I finally did get into the seat , I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to close the other door . Tom slammed it when he came back . It was a long drive back , seven or eight miles over dirt roads that wound and twisted across the very top of the ridge . After a mile or so , he stopped  --  right in the middle of the road , there was n't a car anywhere around  --  and said : " I want a drink . You ? " " Yes , " I said , and my voice was getting less hoarse . " I sound better . " " You 'll live , " he said . He offered me the bottle and I hunted around on the floor until I found the paper cup that I had dropped earlier . I poured the whiskey in that . He drank directly from the bottle . We had n't any water or ice ; that was all back at the float with the party . But still , liquor helped . I stopped shivering . Soon there was a nice warm alcohol glow out along my fingers . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was pretty scared and you were the only thing around and I just had to grab hold . " " Any time . " He started the car and we drove slowly and carefullyalong , the engine laboring in low gear on the steepest places . The slopes of these hills were heavily wooded on both sides , but the crest was natural open meadow . The road ran directly across it for about half a mile . Behind us you could see dark thick woods and the sharp metallic glint of the lake . On the other side , there were the same trees and beyond them , far beyond them , the town and the college . You could see house lights  --  a few people were still up . You could see neon signs , red mostly with a bit of green in them . You could see street lights , straight rows of yellowish lamps , obscured by their own trees . " Let 's stop a minute , " I said . " If you wo n't freeze in that wet dress . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the whiskey inside me I found I could move lightly ) , and walked a little away from the car into the stiff sharp grass of the bald and looked around . There was n't even a wind . I looked at it all , at the ridiculous blotchy lights of the town , at the few moon-faded stars in the sky , and at the magnificent dark heavy slopes of trees . The moonlight was bright and blue and the color of mold on their tops . Just touching them , just brushing them . Underneaththeir lightened branches the night looked immense , and soft , and as deep as could be . As deep as the water in which I had sunk . I looked at the grass at my feet , at the stubbly grass , at the scatteredstones , at the sprinkle of gravel . Each of these things had a shadow , sharp , distinct , a shadow trailing behind . It was so clear , it was so bright , and the alcohol was singing in my ears , a steady clear humming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , there 'd never been such a clear clear night . And silent . Not a night bird , not a wind . It was a night for eyes . Brightness , undisturbed . It would never seem like that again . I went back to the car , wet skirt dragging between my legs . " I think I would like another drink . " " Wait a minute . " He kissed me . And that was like the night , too , hard and clear . I could hear him breathing , I could feel his heart beating under the wet cotton of his shirt . My hand slipped up his arm and my fingers found a tear in the cloth near the shoulder . " It 's ripped , " I said . " I know . " Through the tear I tasted his skin with my tongue . It was faintly salty and faintly metallic , like some oysters . It must have been the lake water which was drying on him . And the moon was shining right in the car window , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drink and stretched out on the front seat , and it was as quiet as if we were n't there , just the thump of an arm or leg hitting the steering wheel now and then , hardly enough top187disturb the night . And the moon still shone in one window and straight out the other , passing uninterrupted right over our heads . Like a river , but flowing across on top of us . And I found that it was n't so hard to lose your virginity , nor painful either . I had n't been told about that , I had n't been taught about that , but then I had n't even been taught to swim . There 's only one night like that  --  ever  --  where you 're filled with wonder and excitement for no other reason but the earth is beautiful and mysterious and your body is young and strong . I can remember him , now , remember just exactly how he looked , though that was over fifteen years ago , and he died in Korea a couple of years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me home and I slipped insidewithout being seen . I did n't even notice if my roommate was back . I stripped off my clothes , tearing them because they were still damp and sticking to my body . I fell asleep naked on top the bed . In the morning I put my ruined dress into a paper bag and dropped it into the garbage . I did n't see too much of Tom after that  --  we had n't really been friends before . It just sort of happened that we found ourselves together . It was the night and the time and the peculiar quality of things . It was n't anything personal . It would have been the same with any man . He did take me to a couple of football games and the big fraternity parties that followed them , but we never were alone again . And then we just sort of forgot . It happens like that and it 's not the less precious . It 's the thing you value and not the man . It happened that way with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes and went to my parties , drank the forbidden bourbon , and held my breath during thep188drunken rides home . Once we were chased by the state police ( we had a trunkful of whiskey that time ; we were bringing it from the next county for a party ) but we outran them . I had no trouble , until early in my final year . Then I got expelled  --  because of a wedding . The bride was from New Orleans , though she was in college with us . The groom was a jockey she met when she was home for Thanksgivingvacation . One Tuesday morning , nine of us  --  two cars full  --  drove with her to the nearest town in Mississippi . He met us there , a tiny leathery man who said nothing . It did n't seem possible that he had been married three times before . But when the clerk asked him , he produced copies of three separate divorce statements  --  it was really true . Now , in those days you could get married in ten minutes ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business . So we all crowded , giggling and pushing , into the office to hear the ceremony . Then we drank their health in champagne  --  we had brought four bottles neatly packed in ice . They got into his big white Cadillac convertible and drove away , waving . We finished the champagne and drove slowly back to the campus , feeling daring and romantic . None of us had ever been to an elopement before . And then the trouble started . Her family nearly went out of their minds . They were Catholic  --  and very serious about it  --  so the whole thing was a horrible sin . They tried to get to the girl , but she was of age and had gone off to a Florida track somewhere and she did n't even bother to write after that first wire with the news of her marriage . All of us were shipped back home . I called and told Margaret I was coming . I did n't say why and she did n't ask . She did n't have to . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting on the porch when I drove up . He did n't bother getting out of his chair . He let me walk up the steps toward him . " What did you do ? " he said . " You could say hello . "  | " I reckon I 'm more interested in finding out what happened . " " Well , " I said airily , " I went to a wedding . " When I finished , he got to his feet , and walked inside . I followed him . " Go take a bath or change your dress or something , " he said , " I got to start telephoning . " " For what ? " " To get you back in , Miss Jackass . " " Maybe I do n't want to go back . You think of that ? " I had started up the stairs when he called out to me : " You say her people 's Catholic ? " " Yessir . " He chuckled , not happily . " That 's going to be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stomped off to the phone . I changed and went out . I took one of the horses ( there only were three ; they belonged to me ) and went for a ride until it was too late and too cold and I had to come back . I heard the phone ringing as I walked up from the barn , and went in the kitchen door . Margaret said : " Mud on your shoes . " " I forgot . " I went back and cleaned them on the boot scraper that was in the shape of two friendly rabbits with perky ears . " You hungry ? " Margaret asked . " No . " " Did n't have lunch ? " " I 'm not hungry . " " Soup , " she said . " Take some . " She was sitting by the kitchen table . She 'd been waiting for me . " Is he here ? " She smiled . " Where else he going ? " " On the phone ? " " Since you flounced out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flounce , " I told her . " The old bastards at school ... "  | " He do n't like you talking like that , " she said quietly . " Okay . Okay . " I went and looked into the soup pot . " Abby . " I jumped . She almost never called me by name . " You ought called to him this morning , not just leave a message with me . " " I did n't want to talk to him . I could n't think of a damn thing to say . " " You hurt his feelings . " " Well , they hurt mine . " She chuckled . " Maybe you better stay out here with me , till the both of you quiet down some . " I took the ladle and stirred the soup , not answering . " He been on the phone all day , " Margaret said . " He 'll fix it for you . " There was a pride and satisfaction in her tone that I had n't heard before . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way tonight , child , " she said . " And take youself some soup . All that temper 's nothing but empty insides . " I had supper with Margaret , while my grandfather stayed by the telephone in the living room . In a little while she brought him a sandwich and sat there to keep him company . Since there was nothing for me to do , I went to bed and read . I do n't know who he called exactly . I did n't even realize he knew that many people . He was always so quiet and reserved , never talked about himself or his business with me . As for me , I was used to that manner of his , and I did n't mind it at all  --  after all , there are lots of southern men who treat their ladies that way . It 's quite pleasant , really . But still , I could n't help being shocked when this kind slow-moving grandfather of mine became somebody else . I 'd never seen this side before ; there had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I had no idea of his influence and the extent of it . I had absolutely no idea of what he could do . He called a great many people , I know . I only answered once , andp191that was the following morning . I happened to be passing the phone when it rang , so I picked it up : it was the governor 's office calling . And it all blew over . The next week , I went back . My grandfather drove up with me . " What about the others , " I asked him , " will they get back ? " " They got to fight their own battles , honey . " " But it was my idea , " I said . " I ca n't go back without them . " " Child , " he said , " you going to get nowhere carrying the world . This whole thing is crooked as a cedar tree with a honeysuckle vine . But you got back , so forget it . " I was furious with him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , my grandfather said abruptly : " Let 's us go calling on the president . " I did n't believe him . " You 're kidding . " " His brother 's done some lawyering work for me . " " Not like this , " I said . " I 've got to change my dress . " He grinned , and it was n't pleasant either . " If you 'd said a word to me on the way up , I might have had it cross my memory . . . . But I 'd just as soon they saw the wicked woman in bobby socks . " I almost died , of course , and after the president we went calling at the dean 's house . Both of them were expecting us , and they had their wives there . It seemed some sort of state visit . My grandfather instantly became old-fashioned and formal . He even referred to me as Miss Abigail . He was as courtly as a planter out of a novel . When we left , he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chuckled softly to himself  --  I do n't know that he was pleased , but he was mighty satisfied . The only thing he said to me was : " Stop by the cab stand . " He got out and went over to talk to the two drivers who were waiting there . One of them got inside his cab and drove off , and my grandfathercame back . " Gone for a spare tire and some more gas , " he said . " He 's driving me back . "  | " All that way ? " I said . " That 's expensive . " He stared at me hard for a moment , and then he chuckled . " Guess I plain better not tell you how much getting you back in school cost me . But seeing I managed that ; I reckon I can afford the cab . I 'm an old man and I want to go home . I 'll be there something past midnight . " " You miss Margaret , " I said . His bright blue eyes went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got set and hard , and almost grey . " I 'm sorry , " I said hastily . " I was being funny . " " You 're a child , " he said , " and like your mother you have very little sense . " He got out of the car as if he could n't stand sitting next to me any more , and he let his eyes wander up and down the street . I got out too , and ran around the car , because I did n't want him to think whatever it was that he was thinking . In the couple of seconds it took me to get there , he found somebody he knew . He was shaking hands with a stocky young man who had the shortestcrew cut I had ever seen . His black hair was like a bruise on his skull . " John Tolliver , " my grandfather said casually , his elaborate manner of the afternoon was completely gone , " my granddaughter . " He had bright blue eyes , startling blue , and long black lashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather demanded . " Law school , sir , " he said . My grandfather nodded as if that was just what he expected . He turned to me . " Knew his father and his grandfather for that matter , and cousins I ca n't keep count of . " " Yes , sir , " John Tolliver said . " His father 's the district judge out there . " The way he said it made it seem like the end of the world . " Matter of fact , got so many out there they call it Tolliver Nation . " He waved his hand at me and I noticed suddenly how creased and knotted and old it was.  | " Get my granddaughter to tell you how she was thrown out of school . " He flicked his finger against my face and got into his cab and drove off . John Tolliver said : " What about that ? " " It was n't very much fun . " " I 'd like to hear about it , " he said , and his smile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't even expect to be here , " I told him , " so I have n't got a thing to do , but do n't you have a date ? " There was just a little flash before he said : " No . I do n't . " So he did have one . But he had taken my grandfather 's words as an order . I did n't think any more about it , beyond the little shiver of satisfaction at cutting into somebody else 's date . He did n't have a car , so I drove him to the sorority house and he carried my suitcase inside . " I 'll be back for you in half an hour . " I raced upstairs and watched from the front-hall window . He went directly to the corner pay phone . I hurried through a shower and looked again . He was still there , he had opened the door for air . I knew that he was canceling his date . I wondered who she was . My roommate sat on her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even expect to see you again , " she said , " and now you not only turn up , but you 've got a gorgeous man in tow . What goes on ? " " He 's a friend of my grandfather 's , " I said . She made a face . " You know , " I said , " that 's really true . " " Where 's he from ? " " Out there . " " What ? " " That 's all my grandfather said . " " Hell , " she said , " he 's not all that good-looking . " " I suppose he isn't. "  |p194We  went to the Chicken Shack &; Roof Garden . Its name made no sense . It was just a one-story building with the usual peaked roof : you could n't have put a garden up there if you wanted to . And there was n't even one blade of grass outside . The building was surrounded by black asphalt right up to the edges of the walls . The Chicken Shack had a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building  --  though the county was dry . ( You 'd see state police cars parked in back now and then , half hidden by the high fence . They 'd be stopping by for a drink or a payoff . ) I ordered bourbon and water , as I always did . John Tolliver said : " They 've got a real good bar here so let 's use it . Two martinis . " I did n't mind the correction . I would have to remember that , I thought . And the next time I would order properly . " My grandfather mentioned Tolliver Nation , " I said . " Where 's that ? " He shrugged . " Just another name for Somerset County . " " You 're the Somerset County Tollivers ? " I-le nodded . Somerset was the northernmost county with the darkest , bloodiest past in the state . The breeding plantations had been up there , duringthe first half of the nineteenth century . They bred slaves and sold them , like stock . There was money in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think too much of the slave runner and the slave breeder . They bought from them , but  --  as they did with Jew traders  --  they spat into the dirt to clean out the taste when they were gone . Those breed stations were always discontented and seething . Slave uprisings often began there . Mostly they were stopped before they left the county . But sometimes they were n't and they spread down into the rest of the state . There 'd been a big one in the forties , one that left a wide trail of burned houses and bodies hanging on trees . As for the white people of Somerset County , well , they were violent too . Travelers in the old days used to shiver and keep their guns ready when they passed along that section of thep195North Trace . . . it was robbers ' country . During the Reconstruction they 'd gone in for family feuds and for twenty years they killed each other . When it was over , just about the only families left bore the name Tolliver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad came through there  --  and cleared their fat black land and raised huge crops of cotton . The new railroad hauled it off . Nothing dramatic had happened up there for a long time , but the name remained , somehow , and whenever you said Somerset County , people would think a minute , remembering . It was that sort of name . John Tolliver was different , too . He carried himself confidently , and that dark head of his was very handsome . I did n't see too much of him  --  we were out only that once before it was time for the Christmas vacation . After that came the flurry of exams , and I sort of forgot about him . When he did call , it was almost February . " Where would you like to go ? Harris Pier ? " " No , " I said abruptly , and then explained . " I nearly drowned there year before last . " We drove over to the next county , to a cafe that was supposed to have terrific pizzas . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the jukebox was far too loud . We got the last of the empty booths , back in a corner by the kitchen door . " It 'll take all night to get supper , " John Tolliver said . " I do n't mind . Anyway , noisy places are kind of friendly . " The jukebox hesitated for two seconds , whirred , and began King Cole 's " Mona Lisa . " " That 's such a pretty song , " I said . " I love it . " " I 'm sorry I ca n't ask you to dance , " John Tolliver said . " I never learned . " " I do n't really care for it . " " I 'm glad . "  | " But how could you avoid it ? " I said . " I thought everybody was forced into dancing school . " His blue eyes were level . " You do n't know Tolliver Nation . " " No , " I said , " no , I do n't . " " There 's nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have the babies . By the time you 're seven , you 've got your chores to do . " " Oh , " I said , " I see . " " It 's not like Wade County , you know . It 's just cotton and more cotton . No timber lands like your grandfather 's got . " " Yes , " I said , not wishing to appear too ignorant , " I guess timber is valuable . " He laughed at me . And I found that I did n't mind that at all , because his laugh was friendly and intimate . " Can I have a bourbon and soda ? " I said . " It 's what I really do prefer . " He had to get up and go over to the bar for the order . It was that kind of place . When he came back , he put the glasses carefully on the table . " I have n't called you before this , " he said abruptly , " because I wanted to get myself free from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I said : " Oh . " " I 've never dated more than one girl at a time . Does that sound silly to you ? " " No . " " I work at the library every week night until it closes at ten , " he said . " I 'll pick you up then . " So every evening after work he met me at the sorority house . Every evening the same time : ten minutes past ten . Mostly we went for a drive and parked and played the radio and talked . He had very little money , and he would n't let me pay . So we drove to a different spot every night , and smoked cigarettes , and watched the silly little coals burn red in the dark . The first time he kissed me good night , it was polite but firm . His skin smelled like clover grass . " Now , " he said , " that 's enough for now . Go on inside . "  |p197He  sounded like a man with a plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew just drifted and let things happen to them  --  not John Tolliver . He ordered and directed events himself . Since no one had ever told me what to do before , I liked it immensely . One evening , my roommate said : " Honey child , if you do n't be careful , you are going to be in trouble . " " What ? " I was too vague and too happy to understand . She picked up the green plastic case that contained my diaphragm . " I was looking to see if you had a Band-Aid in your dresser  --  damn shoe slashed my heel to ribbons  --  and I found this . " She waved it at me . " That 's pretty careless . " " I do n't need it . I 'm not sleeping with him . " She tossed the box back into the drawer , shrugging . " Have it your own way . " " I 'm not  --  I 'm going to marry him . " I had n't dared to think like that before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he proposed a month later , it was in the same matter-of-fact tone . " I would like to marry you , " he said . " Would you ? " " Yes , " I said , " I think I would . " Rather than tell my grandfather by phone or write him , I decided to go home during the short Easter holiday . I drove down overnight , so excited and happy I did n't need sleep . I walked in just as he was having breakfast with Margaret in the kitchen . Without a word she got up and laid another place for me . " Well , " my grandfather said , " looks like you got good news this time . " " I 'm going to get married . " " I been expecting that . " He calmly poured himself a cup of coffee from the old-fashioned flowered pot . " Do n't you want to know who ? " " I expect I do , " he said . " But I figured to find out sooner or later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking his coffee slowly . Margaret said : " You want breakfast ? " " I 'm starving . " My grandfather said : " He 'll do all right . There 's some of his family that 's bums , but there 's some of ours we ca n't look too hard at . We could start listing with your father . " " John has one more year at law school . " " That family 's had things pretty much their own way up in thatcounty past three or four generations . Tollivers everywhere you look . Having things that way kind of gives a man a strange cast . " " No more than being a Howland , " I said . He smiled and shrugged that one off . " I reckon not . " " Anyway , " I said , ashamed that I had snapped at him , " John does n't want to go back . " " Back ? " " To Tolliver Nation . " " Got too small for him , " he said easily . " Eat your breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the back porch , while he put on the heavy boots he used for working . " Near stepped on a copperhead yesterday , " he told me as he laced them up . " You do n't like John . " He went on lacing . " Do n't know him . " " You introduced us . " " I recognized him by the family face that he 's carrying , same way I 'd know any Tolliver . " " But you do n't like him anyhow . " " Know some things about his family I ca n't give much room to . " " But that 's not him . " " No , " he said . " I reckon it ai n't . You in love with him ? " I felt myself blushing . " I 'm not ashamed of it . Yes , I am . " " Did n't say you had cause to be ashamed . " He finished with his boots and straightened his legs out , the wayp199old men will , and he looked across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring  --  down to the barns and the silos and the smokehouses and the other buildings , behind them the fenced lots , and behind them the woods . " You do n't seem happy about it . " He had begun to fill his pipe . " Honey , I 'm just too old to get excited . Seems like all I can remember is how many times the same thing has happened to me . Right now you 're telling me this . And seems all I can remember is your mother and me , just the two of us driving back from the station in a buggy and coming up that front drive there , same drive , same plants , same everything , and her tellingme she was in love and getting married . " " John 's not like my father . " " And seems I can remember me coming home to tell my parents I was in love and getting married . And they did n't look surprised either , nor very happy . " " It 's not the same with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you 're as old as me , " he said , " you 'll see that there ai n't very much that 's different or separate or unusual . " He stood up . " I 'm so old I can remember back before there was any such thing as a boll weevil in this country . . . . You better call your Aunt Annie . Seems like she runs all my weddings for me . " " Okay , " I said . He started off across the yards ; he always began the day with a quick look at the barns and the stock there . He had n't gone more than two feet before he turned and said : " Robert 's finished his M.S. and he 's got himself a job . " " I did n't know that , " I said . " That 's wonderful . Where ? " " San Francisco , " he said . " They need engineers there . " " I bet Margaret is happy . " He looked at me , that same level surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not ever . " That 's a mighty proper and polite thing to say . And I do think she is. "  |p200On  my way to bed , because I was terribly sleepy now , I passed Margaret , taking the dead flowers out of the vases on the hall table . " I just heard about Robert , " I said . " That 's terrific . " " He 's a good boy , " she said quietly . " He ought to be getting married soon . " " Yes , " she said . " He will soon . " Then I went to bed , and before I fell asleep , I thought how much older Margaret looked . She 'd always been tall and rawboned , and she still was , but now there was a thickening around her hips , and the smooth black skin of her cheeks was lined and there were crinkles around her eyes . She had a little smattering of grey in her hair too , her white blood had given her that . While I was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my mother and that would have been in the middle or late forties  --  I fell asleep . We had a big June wedding , as everyone expected . The biggest wedding of the year . My grandfather took over the Washington Hotel in town for the extra guests . Even that was n't enough , and the Bannister cousins ( Peter Bannister was dead by this time ) opened their huge house . It seemed to me that I drove over the whole state going to receptions , to cocktail parties , to showers , to dances . Old-fashioned weeklonghouse parties on the Gulf coast . Hunts in the woods of the northern counties . And more dances : black tie , square dance , masquerade . . . . Two weeks before the wedding I went up to Somerset County to meet John 's people . They gave no parties  --  weddings were nothing so special for them  --  they were serious religious folk . We spent only one day there , and they were polite and kind , after their fashion , but I was very relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way back , " what I mean . It is n't like Wade County . " I nodded . " Did they like me ? "  | " They approve of you . " He flashed that bright smile dryly . " That 's a lot better in their books than liking you . " " Your parents say anything at all ? " " Said you 'd make a good wife . " " Oh . " I sounded doubtful . " It 's their way , " he said . " Do n't fuss with it . " On the day of the wedding , I was so tired that I stumbled and almost fell coming down the stairs on my grandfather 's arm . When the ceremony was done and the reception over , and we drove off in the new Thunderbird convertible that my grandfather had given us , I fell asleep almost the moment we left and slept half the way to New Orleans . I woke to find the car had stopped and it was way past midnight ; we were parked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the moon ) and John was sleeping behind the wheel . I settled back and let him sleep . It was dawn before we drove the rest of the way to New Orleans . Two weeks later we were home ; two months later we were back at the university and John was finishing his last year of law school . I was shocked at how hard he worked . I 'd never known anyone to do that . My grandfather certainly had n't ; I 'd never seen anybody work with such fierce intensity . We had a tiny bright apartment right by the campus , and that whole last year we were there I almost never saw him . I met him for lunch , a quick dash through the university cafeteria , and then I saw him again at night when the library closed , when he came home and pounded on the typewriter for an hour or so . He corresponded with a great many people ; the letters were carefully written and carefully thought out . " They could help me someday , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom you 've got to use everything . " He was away so much  --  and because I had nothing else to do , I began to suspect . Finally one evening after supper , I followed him to the library . He was working in one of the rooms on the lower floorp202and from a seat on the front steps I could watch him . He stayed there hour after hour , hunched over , reading . He did not speak to anybody ; he did not seem to notice that there were other people in the room . He did n't even stop for a cigarette ; he hardly shifted in his uncomfortable wood chair . I sat on the concrete steps for three hours , feeling lonely and sick , and when it was closing time , I scurried home at a run to be there before him . " Your hands are cold , " he said when he came in . " I went for a walk around the block . " " Do you think that 's all right ? " " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't blame me if some of the guys make a pass . " " Do you worry about that ? " I asked . " Do you worry if I have a lover ? " He was taking his typewriter out . ( Every day I put it back in its case because I did n't want to look at it . ) " A lover ? I do n't think you do , " he said . " I trust you . " Then because I felt so awful , I said I had a headache and went to bed , and cried silent hot tears into the pillow . It was that night , I think , that I decided to let myself get pregnant . When I was sure , I told him . " It 's too soon , " he said softly , " but I should have been more carefultoo . " " Do you want me to get rid of it ? " " No , " he said emphatically . " That 's too risky . You might die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out . " It 'll be all right , " he said . " A child will be company for you . " " I 'm not lonesome , " I said . " No ? " He picked up the evening paper and began to read it . " I thought that was why . " He knew . And that always amazed me  --  how much he knew , how much he noticed behind his abstracted busy front ... . He finished school all right , with all the honors , but there wasp203one thing he had n't counted on  --  Korea . Since he 'd kept his army commission , he was called up immediately . He was desperate and furious and raging impotently . His face flushed a blotchy grey and red , and he tore a great hunk out of the upholstered arm of a livingroomchair . I just sat there , behind my thickening belly , and watched him wrench the chair to pieces . " Two years in Germany , " he yelled . " Why the hell do n't they take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mud . " He said a lot more , and he did n't sleep for two nights , and he scarcely told me good-bye when he finally left . But it did n't turn out badly for him after all  --  not at all . But then very few things did . He was adaptable . No matter what happened , he could turn it to his advantage . It was that way with his Korean service . He went to Washington and spent three years in the dim dismal barracks of a purchasing unit 's offices . But he saw something else in Washington and he liked it . He saw a size and a scope of things that his family sitting up in Tolliver Nation had never dreamed about . He also saw a place for himself . He told me about it just before I got on the train to come home . Washington was crowded , the hospitals were jammed , and everything was horrid . I was going back to my grandfather 's house to have the baby . On the way down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he proposed to go about it . It started with governor and it ended with senator . " There is n't a chance of my being president . " He patted my taut belly gently . " Too small a state and a southerner could n't anyway .... I 've been forgetting to tell you , I joined the Citizens Council and the Klan before I left . " " Oh , " I said . " Oh , for heaven 's sake . " " Your grandfather belonged to the Klan . " " It was different then . " " Justice Black belonged too . " " But not any more . " " Honey , " he said , " when I get where he is , I 'll quit too . "  |p204So  I went back to my grandfather 's house during those bright crisp days of early winter . I sat in the sun on the back porch in the morningand the front porch in the evening and passed the time of day with people who came visiting . There were a lot of them too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could tell from their way of inquiringafter my husband that John had impressed them . One evening my grandfather asked me : " He going into politics ? " " Yes . " He chuckled . " Too many old men in politics in this state . You just plain get tired looking at their ugly faces . Seems like we 're about ready for a brave young soldier back from a war . And you get to move into the governor 's mansion  --  I reckon that 's what he 's after . " " He thinks so . " " No reason why not . " " You still do n't like him , do you ? " " Do n't have much taste for politics , child , and never did . . . . You still like him ? " And I told him the truth . " Not as much as I did . But I love him . " " Makes a difference , " my grandfather said . One cold December morning , when there were a million speckles of frost glistening on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard winter blue , I sat down to breakfast . Without warning , I flooded green-flecked ammonia-smelling water down my legs , through my robe , and into a puddle on the floor . Foolish and dull and heavy in my state , I just stared at it thinking : How nasty it smells . How horrid it looks . I kept staring at it , wrinklingmy lips ; I almost did n't notice Margaret , who had jumped up and was dialing quickly at the wall phone . While it rang , she turned to me . " You feel anything ? " I shook my head . " Who 're you calling ? " " The barn . He 's down there . "  |p205My  grandfather , of course . She never called him by name . At least to me . Nobody answered . Margaret let it ring for quite a while , then she called Harry Armstrong , the doctor in town . He was n't there , and she left a message . She went out on the porch and looked up and down , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the sharp cold wind on her dress . " You feel anything ? " " Feel queer . " I was sleepy all of a sudden . And I had trouble pronouncing my words . She put her hand to my stomach , right where the swelling of child began , and pressed it tight . She held it for a moment . Then she got me by the arm and stood me on my feet . " We got to get you to bed . " She helped me up the stairs and into my bed . She went into the hall to call the barn again ; still no answer . My grandfather would be out somewhere , and he had the only car . I had left mine in Washingtonwith John . So I would have to have it at home . I thought : How silly . I ca n't do anything right . I ca n't even get to the hospital in time for a baby .... Margaret came back . " How long has it been ? " I asked her . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my eyes could n't seem to stay open . All of a sudden , my body shivered and shook like a gigantic sneeze . At the end of it I screamed . Margaret was pulling me out of bed . She had gotten my clothes off . Naked and sweating in the chilly room , I leaned against the side of the bed , swaying and wanting so to go to sleep . " Squat down , " she told me . There was a sheet spread on the floor  --  I had n't noticed that before . I squatted on it . She slipped behind me , sitting on the bed , her legs around my body , her hands holding my shoulders firmly . " Now , " she said , " go on . " P206Two more tearing pains and the white sheet held a puddle of blood and a baby and some slimy cord . Margaret was kneeling beside me now , my head rested against her shoulder . She was wiping out the baby 's mouth with a corner of the sheet . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the window was open and I was hearing the sounds of birds outside . But it was the blood-smeared ammonia-smelling bit of flesh I had delivered . We crouched , the two of us , until delivery was finished . Then Margaret helped me back into bed . I forgot about the baby and I fell asleep . When I woke there was a fire burning and the room was warm , and Margaret was sitting rocking by the fire and there was a basketright beside her . She saw my eyes open and she came over at once . " They be having a drink downstairs , your grandpa and Dr. Armstrong . They been having quite a few drinks . " She smiled gently , but the smile faded and she said with a little hesitation : " I got to call them . . . . Might be better if you was to say the baby birthed in the bed . " " Oh , " I said . " White ladies do n't squat down to drop on the floor . " I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a chance . I never said a word and everybody assumed that the baby had been born on a mattress , proper and decent . Anyway it was a girl . And I was sick with disappointment . We named her Abigail . The next one  --  just thirteen months later  --  was born in a hospital , properly . Even the doctor was different . It was Otto Holloway . By then Harry Armstrong had had a stroke and retired . But this baby was a girl too . Mary Lee . I put my head down on the coarse hospital sheets and cried bitterly . I had wanted a boy so much , so very much . John , who 'd managed to come down this time , hung around thep207bed , looking worried and wondering . " Do n't take on so , " he kept saying . " It is n't serious , it is n't that serious . " I had been a girl and the only child ; so had my mother . I had assumed I would do better . I 'd always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand . He could n't . " Oh go away , " I told him . " Please go away . " " It is n't just the baby , is it ? " he asked sharply . " It 's something else . " I hardly bothered to listen . " Go away . " " I know it is . Who 's been carrying stories to you ? " His tone was sharp and angry ; there was even a little rasp of fear in it . " Everything you do , innocent as all hell , people read their way , with their dirty little minds . " Numbly , I lay back on my pillows and looked indifferent while he told me how innocent his life in Washington had been , but how open to misinterpretation . I listened , and everything he said , I understood the opposite . I went back with him though , and we stayed in Washington until his tour was over . ( He asked me to come . " People will stop talking if you 're there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking and wondering : Was that the one ? Was it she ? But I was in love with him , and as my grandfather said , that made a difference . Korea ended . We came back to Wade County and John set up his office right on the main street in Madison City next to the Rexall Drugstore . He worked , hard as he had in college . He was building his practice , and he was making his political debut . Every week , practically , he 'd be off on a speaking trip somewhere in the state . He 'd talk on anything from conservation and the boll weevil to the godlessness of youth  --  always perfectly serious and sincere . One particular weekend he was scheduled to talk to a farmers ' group about the state 's role in reducing anthrax . I had to say something.  | " For heaven 's sakes , John , " I asked , " what do you know about anthrax ? " He grinned the bright happy smile that was beginning to look like it was adjusted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Bacteria , live in the soil , dormant for as long as thirty years . . . . That 's all I need . " " Oh my . " " I 'm not telling them about anthrax , honey . I 'm telling them about John Tolliver . " He was also an extremely successful lawyer , who had a way with judges and juries all over the state . Of course he was in a good position . He was a Tolliver and that meant he could call on practically all the north part of the state . His wife was a Howland , and that meant kinship with practically all the central counties . As for the three or four southern counties , they did n't interest him . As a matter of fact he usually refused to even speak there , claiming that their Catholic majority was hostile to him . I do n't know that there was any truth to his charge . But he often used it to enlist a lot of Protestantswho would n't have been with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and watched . We had a new house , we had built it . At first John wanted to take over one of the old empty houses around town ( there were quite a few of them ) . " It looks better for me to live in an old house , " he told me . " Substantial , like a wool suit in the summertime . " " I want a new house , " I said , fearfully , because if I got in an argument with him I always lost . I just did n't want to have him talk me out of this , so I said something I 'd never said before . " It 's my money . " For a minute there was a terribly mixed-up look on his face . It was n't angry , it was n't hurt . I do n't know what it was . Maybe it was just surprised . " Anyway , " I added quickly because I was afraid I 'd said too much , " the only old house I ever want to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When he leaves that to you , sure . It 'll make a great place with some money spent on it . " " All right , " I said , though I felt a little tremor in the pit of my stomach  --  disposing of a man 's things while he was still alive . I built my shiny new house , and my children slept in shiny ruffled bedrooms . The whole town buzzed when I had a contractor from Mobile do the kitchen and the bathrooms . The master bath had a sunken tub and a tiny sun-bathing patio . The kitchen was right out of House and Garden : it had everything , every gadget that could be installed . I found out what the town thought of that from Margaret . She had brought us some quail from my grandfather , not more than a week after we moved in . She stared around the kitchen , hands on thickening hips ; she pursed her lips and said nothing . " Like it ? " " Mighty fancy kitchen for a nigger to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sarcastic . Or it might have only been a simple statement of fact . Or it might have been her father 's blood talking . I never knew when she was serious and when she was mocking . I think she intended it that way . Maybe by that time she 'd noticed some of the references to John that had been appearing in papers round and about . The first one I saw was a little clipping from an Atlanta paper my cousin Clara Hood sent me . ( She was a Bannister cousin from Madison City . She 'd married a young Methodist minister named Samuel Hood and moved to Atlanta . He was a plain sandy-haired man , very earnest and devout , and a strong defender of Negro rights . Since she 'd met him , Clara Bannister had abandoned all her early White Citizens Council training and become , among other things , a member of the NAACP . Even her vague bewildered mother was shocked . My grandfather found it very amusing . ) The clipping was an interview with John . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long andp210it was n't particularly interesting . It was full of folksy talk about being glad to come to town and see my wife 's people , and always being happy to be in Atlanta . It ended with a phrase that stuck in my mind : " Mr. Tolliver is a rising young lawyer and is considered to be the brightest hope of the southern segregationists . " I showed it to John . " I saw it , honey , " he said . " You do n't read the Atlanta papers , do you ? " " My clipping bureau . " " I did n't even know you had one . " " You did n't ask . " " Did you really look up your cousins-in-law ? " He grinned . " I had so damn many appointments that I did n't even get to call them . . . but it looked good in the paper . " That evening the first he had home in six weeks  --  he spent patiently crawling around the living-room floor with two small girls on his back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it up in their rooms . " So they wo n't forget what I look like , " he said . He loved them and they adored him . Our lives moved peacefully along , the girls and I , dull and uneventful until he came home . And he brought excitement with him  --  he always had been able to do that . John must have thought my question about the clipping was some sort of criticism , because after that he brought them to me . All of them . I put them carefully in a box  --  I found it the other day  --  but I never read them . Sometimes when he handed them to me words would jump out of the print . Racist . Staunch segregationist . Strong friend of states ' rights . I asked about that once , and wished I had n't . We were driving to the university where the student body had invited him to speak . It was one of those silvery grey winter evenings when everything is soft and delicate and the sky is a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The car was new and shiny and smelled wonderful ; the heater poured out a steady stream of warmth on our legs . It 's like nothing else , this feeling of a powerful car onp211good roads in hilly country . We were riding the rises and the falls of the land like the swells of the sea . I was glad to leave the children , too  --  I 'd been home a lot . I was proud to be the wife of the invited speaker . And John had come home yesterday with a sapphire ring in his coat pocket . " Matches your eyes , old duck , " he said casually . I was n't deceived . I knew what money meant to him , and that ring had cost a lot . He 'd been a good husband and a hard-working one , but this was the first time he had brought anything like that , a tribute . I thought how lovely it would be , as we went roaring over those hills , us growing old together and seeing our children grow to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the long grey hills ... . Lulled by that gentle light , I asked him something I 'd been wondering , something the words in those clippings had reminded me of . " John , " I said , " what do you really think about the Negroes ? Not what you 're going to say tonight , but what you really think ? " He chuckled and swerved around a stock truck with a blast of his horn . " Love ' em dearly , " he said . " Like your grandfather . " The silvery light went out of the evening , and the unborn grandchildrendisappeared . It was just bleak winter country and a man driving too fast . A few more years , pleasant , uneventful , broken only by the holidaysthat John had begun to afford . I remember the years by the vacations  --  theJamaica year , the Bermuda year , the Sun Valley year . We went twice a year , summer and winter . The girls grew up . Crib to bed , stroller to bike , nursery school to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-eyed like their father . He wanted more , I know . He asked about it once . I only said : " Let me get these launched . They 're so close it 's been a lot of trouble . " He was waiting ; he would be too proud to ask again.  |p212And  my grandfather died . It was in January , a couple of days after the big snow . Now , we never have a fall of any size in this part of the country  --  just a few sprinklings like hoarfrost on the ground . But this time a level grey-green sky sifted down fifteen inches , and everybody was caught . The stock in their far-spread pastures went into a panic . They broke their fences , tore through the wire , leaving bloody gobs of hide on the barbs , and wandered into the wood lots and beyond . They were going to have to be gathered up again , a few at a time . Every man my grandfather employed was out working  --  looking for injured stock , mending fences . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncingover the rutted frozen lumber roads that thawed slowly into puddles of mud . For three evenings he came home staggering tired , gulped supper , and went straight to bed . On the fourth evening he did not come back . On that fourth day too , my grandfather was working alone . Oliver Brandon , who usually worked with him , had driven to town for some extra sets of wire clippers and a few things like that . He took Margaret 's car , the one that my grandfather had given her the past year , and was back by noon , when my grandfather was supposed to pick him up . When he did n't come , neither Margaret nor Oliver worried . He 'd gotten rather forgetful lately , as old men do , and it was n't in his usual habit of things to come back to the house at noon . Since he had n't said where he would be , Oliver could not look for him ; instead he replaced the cracked boards in the porch floor . Neither worried until dark fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy opaque windows . " Might could be working by headlights , " Oliver suggested . Margaret shook her head . " Did n't rightly think so , " Oliver said . Margaret went and stood by the window , head leaning against the cold glass , staring out where she could n't possibly see anything.  |p213At  ten o'clock Margaret called me . John happened to be home that evening , and the children were asleep  --  it was quiet and neat and enclosed and peaceful  --  until the phone rang . John answered ; his face got more and more strained as he listened . " He did n't come back . " He told me the story briefly . " Where 'd he go ? " John shook his head . " She did n't know and there 's been too many trucks up and down those roads to follow tracks . " We drove over at once . Margaret was alone . Oliver had gone home ; he was an old man and tired . John talked to her briefly . Then went to the phone . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police helicopter . He wanted them to begin at once ; they insisted on waiting for daylight . They settled finally on an immediate ground search . He joined Margaret and me . The three of us sat in the living room and waited . By eleven o'clock we could hear the cars going by on the road , we could see their lights turn at the big hackberry tree where the trail led up to the wood lots and the timber stands behind that . " There 're a lot of people , " I said . " Better be , " John told me . " I promised five thousand dollars whoever finds him . " I just stared at him . I would never have thought of that , but then I never thought of anything . And the telephone began ringing . The whole county seemed to be waking up . By midnight I even had a call from my cousin Clara in Atlanta wanting to know if what she heard was true . I did n't know it traveled that fast , even bad news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next . At one o'clock John got out a bottle of my grandfather 's whiskey . I managed the first drink , but after the second I went straight to the bathroom and threw up . When I came back Margaret and John were sitting silent as mannequins , still drinking , waiting for me.  |p214He  said : " You better not try that again , honey . " Margaret said : " No stomach for alcohol , Mr. John says . " There was something in the way she said " Mr. John . " It was polite enough , but at the same time it was mocking . And knowing . Weary and amused all at once . Every now and then you 'll find a Negro who can do that . It 's always made me very nervous . I do n't want to be understood that much . It did n't seem to bother John . She may not have been completely at ease with him ( and she was n't a woman who went around being easy in the presence of people ) but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got on very well with her . Much better than he did with my grandfather . Whenever he came in a room , John tensed up and got that flashy newspaper smile on his face . But he was at ease with Margaret , as he was that night . We were worried , all of us , worried sick . We waited there , just three people together . While we sat in his parlor my grandfather sat dead in his truck . The ground search found nothing that night . At daylight the police helicopter arrived , and began a methodical search , chopping its noisy way back and forth across the sky . They spotted the truck in half an hour , though it took much longer to get through the broken roads . You see , he was n't where anybody expected him to be . He must not have gone to tend stock or mend fences after all . He went down into the cotton bottoms , the old land , it was called . He drove across the open fields , and into a dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the land the first William Howland had claimed for himself . Stories had it that his fields were here , his first fields . But these were n't fields any more ; these were woods , thick and dense . There were n't even roads through them , only narrow tracks . In this particular place , there was n't even room for a helicopter to land.  |p215They  got to him finally . He 'd driven off the track , just a bit , and parked and turned off his engine and set his brake . So he must have had some warning of what was coming . He was still sitting there , hands on the wheel . Forehead touching the knuckles of his hands . As if he were waiting for something . As if he had stopped and was waiting for something . The police did n't telephone ; they sent a trooper with the news . He came and told us awkwardly enough and then stood around , twirling his cap in his fingers , not being sure what else was required of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've found an old man dead in the woods . I remember looking at him and thinking how much he resembled John . A little heavier , maybe , but the same black hair and close-set blue eyes , the same jaw and the same thin mouth . John looked like everybody from the north part of the state ... . The plain bare statement the trooper brought did n't hurt me much . I 'd had all night to prepare for it . But it rocked John . His face drained white and then turned a kind of light green . He had n't shaved and the heavy beard , uneven and thicker in some spots than others , made his face look bruised . " Jesus God ! " he said . " I 've been thinking all night he must be hurt or sick , a heart attack or something like that because of his age . " He began to bite his nails nervously , something I 'd never seen him do before . " I never thought he could die like that . " He walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept on walking down the muddy side of the state highway . I saw him through the window and started out after him . " Let him be , " Margaret said emphatically . I had n't thought of her  --  neither of us had . I had looked at the trooper and then at John . But I 'd forgotten Margaret . " Margaret , " I said , " I 'm so sorry . " She did n't seem to hear . Maybe because she would n't take any/thing from me , not even sympathy . " Let him be , " she said after John . " He has n't got a coat , " I said , " and it 's cold . " " He be coming back , " Margaret said , " when he feel the cold . " Her smooth round black face was unmoved . It was just the face of a middle-aged Negro woman who looked older than her years , and who was n't particularly concerned by whatever was happening around her . The black skin helped , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It hid the blood and bone under it . " He 'll come back with pneumonia . " " He respected him , " Margaret said quietly . " Let him grieve . " And she went into the kitchen to cook breakfast . Happiness or death , you had to eat , and she had to fix it . Her feet were a little heavy as she walked away , and she shuffled a bit , as if the hold the earth had on her had gotten stronger , all of a sudden . She was right of course . John respected him . And he grieved for him . Not that he loved him . No , it was n't like that . William Howlandhad not liked him and John knew it , so that left out love . But respect now , that was something else . A man was due that by reason of what he was . Will Howland had earned it ; and it came naturally to John Tolliver to give it . For me it was the other way around . I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why all that long night I had faced up to the fact that he was dead . And John had n't ; he had n't been able to . Margaret began to sing as she got breakfast . She never had before , she 'd always been the silent dark woman . But she was singing now and her voice was light and high , delicate and gentle . " Cold thing here I ca n't see , rubbing itself all over me .... "  |p217I  'd never heard that song before . I listened to the words and shivered . It was death creeping up and killing . " Stretch my jaw , jerk my legs , break my bones until I 'm dead ... . Margaret sang it as a kind of chant , monotonous and wailing . " Death spare me for another year . " She was n't talking about herself . She was mourning Will Howland , that he had n't had just anotheryear . Just one more year . We left her moaning that dirge , John and I , and went back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone began ringing . We hesitated . Margaret did n't answer , did n't seem to hear it . So we did n't answer it either . It would have been like interrupting a funeral . All the doors of the house were open in spite of the cold and her singing followed us out to the car . I 'm not sure , but I think John was crying . Funerals are a good deal like weddings this part of the country . Only they 're a bit quicker and a bit smaller . And that 's the only way you get through them at all . But they do end , and people leave , and rooms are empty , and there is only the heaviness in your chest and the nasty taste in your mouth . A couple of days after the funeral , I put the children in the car and went out to see Margaret  --  I was going to ask her what her plans were . I felt terrible . I almost threw up on the way over . And my girls , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing over and over : " We shall meet , we shall meet , we shall meet on that bee-utiful sh -- o -- ore . . . . " The front door was locked . I went to the back . That was locked too . I knocked and waited . Oliver came plodding slowly up from the barns : he had seen my car . He handed me a key . " That for the back door . Did n't seem to be none for the front . "  |p218I  looked at the key , an ordinary Yale key to the night lock on the kitchen door . " Where 's Margaret ? " " Been gone . " " Where ? " " New Church . " My children were chasing the big grey cat around the yard . " I did n't know she had any family there to go to . I did n't know she even thought about going back . " Oliver looked at me , patiently . " She got a house there , five , six years ago . " " Oh , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William give it to her . " " Well , Oliver , " I told him , " I did n't know that either . " He smiled , a tiny curl of the black lips . " I reckon you did n't . " " Tell me where it is and I 'll go see her . " He said : " She come to you . " He walked away then , leaving me to stand on the empty porch with a small key in my hand . I started to go in but changed my mind . I would only cry , and I did not want to do that in front of the children . So I gathered them up again and we drove back home . We saw the will , a few days later , and there was n't a mention of Margaret in it . " John , " I said , " we ca n't let it go like that . It is n't right . " The mottled look had n't quite gone from his face . It made him look sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Ca n't you figure it out ? " " Margaret 's got to live . " " God save me from well-meaning people and idiots . " " You do n't have to get nasty . " " Margaret 's car , the one she left in  --  you remember that ? " " Do n't be mean , John . " " It was her car . It was in her name . " " Oh , " I said.  | " That 's one thing . " He took a deep breath . " I know what you 're going to say to this , because I know what you think  --  but a respectableman just does n't list a Negro woman in his will as one of the major beneficiaries . Not if he 's got children by her . He would n't embarrass his white children with his woods colts . " " I did n't know you knew about that . " He flushed impatiently . " Think for once , God damn it . Just do n't ooze good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know . " " Look , honey , I do n't know anything either , except maybe this one thing . He took care of Margaret . He gave it to her , years ago , I bet . He left her plenty to live on , and their kids too . Trust funds when they were in school or something like that . " " He never said anything . " " It 's easy enough to do if you want . " A tight little flicker of a smile : " And the gift tax is a lot less than the estate tax . That would amuse him too . " In about a month , Margaret sent me a message , as Oliver said she would . That particular afternoon , I had been shopping . As I turned in our street I noticed a green-and-white Plymouth standing in front of the house . It was Margaret 's car , license and all . I hurried into the kitchen , packages spilling out of my arms , expecting to see Margaret 's heavy greying head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . I tumbled the packages to the counter . " Did n't Margaret come ? " " No 'm . " " Oh . " I was disappointed . " It 's her car . " " She sent me . " He was a handsome boy , and he looked familiar . " You related to her ? "  | " Her ma and my granny was sisters . " " You look like her . " " She sent me to carry a message to you . " " Fine , " I said . " She say to tell you that she is living at New Church , if you ever have need to find her . " " Where , exactly ? " He looked puzzled . " You ca n't say hardly , but anybody there 'll show you . It 's kind of back by the baptizing place on the river , sort of . " Automatically I began to unwrap the things I had bought . Twopairs of sneakers , a wad of blue cloth for a gym suit . They lookedsilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What else did she tell you ? " " That I got to make sure Mr. John ai n't home before I come in . " That was Margaret , self-effacing , discreet . Margaret , dark and bitter . Except to my grandfather . And what had he seen that was hidden to everybody else ? " Is she living alone ? " I asked the boy . " But she would n't be . " " No 'm . My ma 's there and me . " " Just three ? " " Well , " he remembered , " when she first built the house , the old lady , her aunt , lived there . " " Not any more ? " " She swelled up and died . " " When Margaret first built the house , when was that ? " He scratched his head . " I was n't nothing but a kid then . Six , seven years ago . " So that was how long ago my grandfather had given it to her . Oliver had known ; he 'd told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " tell her if she needs anything let me know . "  | " No 'm , " he said , " she do n't have to work . " " Tell her anyway . " John had been right , too . It had all been settled long long ago . " She do n't want nothing . " His eyes flicked over me , curiously . After all , we were related in a way . " Tell her something else . " He turned around in the door . On his face the patient mocking mask of the Negro . " Tell her that I 'll be coming up to see her . That there are some things I want to ask her . " There were so many things . . . . All the time we 'd been in the same house , and not able to talk . So many things about her . About my grandfather . . . . How she 'd met him , and how she 'd come to move into his house , and how it had been during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like to send your children away , one after the other , when they were still so young . And never let them come back , so they would n't feel the blame of being a Negro . And never go see them , so they would n't have the weight of their mother 's black face . They were white and she had made them that way . Margaret 's house in New Church was easy to find . I asked once at the gas station and then managed the dirt roads without a single mistake . It was a new house , four or five rooms and a wide latticecoveredporch . It was painted and neat , with a clean-swept dirt yard , and beds of petunias and lantanas growing at the front . Even when we did n't talk ( she was still a silent woman ) we communicated . It was just in the air of that house , in the musky Negro-smelling air . I felt at home and comfortable . This was my mother , she had raised me , my grandmother too .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly : " You tell Mr. John you was coming ? " For a second I considered lying , but then I could n't . " No. "  |p222She  did n't seem hurt or even surprised . " He 's not like us . " And as she said it , there were suddenly three of us , the other was my grandfather . On the drive back , he rode right along beside me , telling me how it had been when he had lost his way in the swamp , and had to walk home from New Church . Not on the road ( there was no paved road then ) , but on the trails over the ridges , through pines not touched by the lumberman , with fallen needles so thick there was no sound as you walked . He was sitting beside me . I could see him . If I looked straight ahead at the road , he was there , right in the corner of my eye . Once I turned to look at him directly and he disappeared . The car swerved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch the road , child , he said . I did n't look at him directly any more after that , only peeped with the corner of my eye . And he stayed there . I could even smell the metallic odor his sweat had always had , a farmer 's sweat , sun-dried on skin and cotton cloth . I could talk to him too . Why did n't you tell me anything ? You did n't . Not one thing . You should have , you should have . By the time I got home that evening , I did understand . As if he 'd explained to me at last . He 'd protected and cared for so many femalesin his life , that he just looked on us as responsibilities and burdens . Loved , but still burdens . There 'd been his wife , the vague little bumbling girl , who 'd been so lovely and who 'd died so young . There 'd been my mother , who 'd read poetry in a summerhouse and married a handsome Englishman , who 'd come scurrying home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the house and around the bed until she died . And there was me , the orphan , and my two daughters . Sometimes he must have felt that he was being smothered in dependents . There had n't been a man of his blood in so long . And that must have worried him too . All those clinging female arms .... And then there was Margaret.  |p223Who  was tall as he was . Who could work like a man in the fields . Who bore him a son . Margaret , who 'd asked him for nothing . Margaret , who reminded him of the free-roving Alberta of the old tales . Margaret , who was strong and black . And who had no claim on him.  |p224IN  the years that followed , John worked harder than ever , building a solid foundation for his political career , building himself a statewidemachine . " Going to be better than the one the Longs have in Louisiana , " he told me once . Of course , he was away more than ever . And once again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspecting , checking on him . I could n't help it . I had to . Sometimes I fought with myself for hours . I would work frantically on the napkins I was monogrammingand I would try not to look at the telephone , so squat and round and white there on the table . But the end was always the same . Biting my lip and shivering with disgust , I would call long distance and nervously tell them the number he 'd left with me . The girls in the telephone office soon got to recognize my voice : " How you , Mrs. Tolliver ? This is Jenny Martin . " I knew them , of course I did . I knew all the girls  --  operators , secretaries , clerks  --  who worked in the white-shingled building across the square from the courthouse . I could see them gossiping between calls : " She keeps up with him , for sure . You suppose she 's got reason ? " I hated that . Hated to set them talking about me , to give them grounds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm always went weak , and my will betrayed me . John did n't say anything for months . Finally , late one night , Ip225reached him at his hotel in New Orleans . I had less to say than usual , even , and he was very tired and you could hear the rasp of irritation in his voice . " Honey , why 'd you call ? " You could hear the annoyance and the nervousness and the waspishnessin mine too . " Because I get lonesome and afraid when I 'm pregnant . " In the silence my thoughts ran around my head , rattling like marbles : You 're not sure , you 're not sure ... . " I 'll be damned , " he said . When he came home , he brought me a pearl necklace . " It 's not the best , " he said , " but it 'll do for a while . " I need n't have worried . Soon there was the soft bland feeling of gestation , as my body and I settled down to the comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little flecks of calcium forming , tissue growing , cell by cell , life pouring in through the cord . I was placid and lazy , and John took charge of the remodeling of my grandfather 's house . He brought an architect from New Orleansand the two of them worked for months over the plans . There was plenty of money now , and John used it well . I 'd never known it was such an imposing house . John had been clever enough to go back to the original style , the massive solid farmhouse  --  of the sort that preceded the rage for Greek Revival . It was heavy and rather African , but it was beautiful . They 'd also taken off most of the wings and sheds that had grown on it like mushrooms or barnacles over the generations . And they had cleared away the woods that pressed on it and crept up to it . You could see the river now , you could see the outline and the shape of the crest the house stood on . Before we moved there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howland Tolliver . He was a dark ugly baby , jolly and healthy . Johnp226sent me a diamond broach from Cartier . " A wonderful wife , " the card said . I was happy ; I 'd had a son at last . There seemed to be no more problems . Just a happy procession of days leading straight to the capital and that hideous governor 's mansion with its ugly red brick walls , and its squat white columns . I did n't tell John  --  I did n't want to bother him  --  when I had a message from Margaret saying Nina was dead . And I did n't tell him when I found out  --  later  --  that the news was wrong . I did n't understand what had begun to happen . That Margaret 's children had finally grown up and were beginning to have a force and an effect of their own . One afternoon  --  we were still living in town then  --  I took Johnny into the side yard . He was waving his absurdly thin arms and legs in the sun and giggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick black hair around my finger and making faces at him when I heard heels on the stepping stones behind me . I saw a tall , very tall , red-haired woman , well-dressed , as a northerner is well-dressed . She seemed familiar  --  yes , very  --  but I did not know her . So I handed the baby a rattle and went to meet her , wondering who she was . She stopped , waiting for me ; she expected me to recognize her . " Yes , " I said , " can I ... " And I recognized her at the very time she said softly : " I 'm Nina . " The girl I had played with , who 'd run the pasture and chased the cattle , had hunted lamb's-tongue lettuce and pulled dandelion greens for supper , found thickets where deer had lain , sniffed the musky odor of snakes  --  the girl came back a woman . She stood smiling at me eagerly ; she was very beautiful . She looked  --  somehow  --  Greek . I blurted the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her face emptied out , like a glass , quickly and smoothly . " I know she did . "  | " Who could have told her that ? . . . Who 'd be so mean ? ... But come inside . I 'll take the baby . " Nina shook her head . " We 've just come from New Church , and we 'll go along . My husband 's never seen the South and we thought he should . " I said apologetically : " Margaret did n't mention your marriage . She really did n't . " " I sent her a wedding picture  --  when we were married a few months ago . " She started to say something more . But she shrugged and let the words flutter off her tongue unsaid . " When I was in New Church  --  I brought the baby to see her  --  she seemed fine . " " Did you see her ? " Nina asked politely . " The door was locked and the shades were pulled the very minute we came in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist at a beam of light . And what was wrong ? ... " I ca n't imagine why , " I said truthfully . " Come to the car , and meet my husband , " Nina said . We walked on the carefully placed stepping stones through the side yard , past the thick hydrangeas with their heavy sagging blue flowerheads . We came around the house and cut across the front lawn . Nina 's husband saw us coming and he opened the door and stepped out to meet us . And then I saw what had happened , then I knew why Margaret called Nina dead . Nina 's husband was a Negro . Tall , strikingly handsome , but very dark and unmistakably a Negro . It made sense , then , it all made sense . I shook hands with him mechanically , not even hearing his name . Nina said with a harsh laugh : " You look just the way my mother must have looked when she got our wedding picture . " " Really , " I tried not to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am dumbfounded . How could I know ? I heard you were dead , and now it seems you 're alive and married too . " " And you think she might as well be dead as married to me , " he added quickly . I looked at that handsome dark face and I thought : I do n't like him , I should pity him , but I do n't even like him . " Well , " I told him evenly , " you said it , I did n't . " They both got into the car . Nina leaned across her husband : " Tell my mother you saw us . " " No , " I said . " I wo n't . I wo n't do that . " She lifted her carefully shaped eyebrows . " I never could stand self-pity . " I was furious now ; my voice was shaking and that made me even more angry . I did not want them to know that they had the power to make me that upset , to disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pester an old lady just to give you a thrill . " Nina 's pecan-colored eyes flickered a moment . " We should n't have come . " " Margaret did n't ask you to come . Nobody sent for you . " They would call me a white bigot . Let them , I thought . To hell with them and all their problems . I marched back into the yard . I yanked the baby out of his stroller and stomped into the house . I went straight to the bar in the corner of the living room . I plunked the baby down on the rug without a word and poured myself a stiff drink . He watched me , too amazed even to cry . I soon forgot about Nina . I had my own life , my own excitements . We moved to the Howland place that summer when the house was finally finished . It was so elegant now , quiet and dignified and obviouslyvery expensive . It was a magnificent house for entertaining , the house of a man who knows what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John was pleased . " Looks great , old girl , " he said lightly . " You 've got good taste . " He so seldom complimented me that I felt myself blushing . " You look prettier when you do that , " he joked . " You should always be doing a house . Agrees with you . " My grandfather would n't have recognized his place and he would n't have recognized the life that went on inside it . He 'd never kept any servants to speak of . He did n't like people around his house , so he did n't have them  --  though everyone in town was shocked . The matter of servants is so very important around this county , this state  --  kind of like stripes on a uniform sleeve . When John and I were living in town , we kept two , a cook and a nurse for the children  --  and people clucked and thought that awfully stingy of us . Out at the Howland place , we had a proper staff , and people were finally content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very old woman , her fat jolly flesh all melted away with age , paid one duty visit to us and nodded her pleasure . " First time this house has looked like anything since your great-grandmother 's time . Where 'd you find a trained butler out in this wilderness ? " " John hired him in Atlanta . " " Stole him from one of my friends ? " she wheezed with amusement . " He 's a love . " She could have meant John and she could have meant the butler . I did n't ask . She sat on the front porch and had bourbon and three lumps of sugar in an old-fashioned glass . She was at it steadily all day , so she was quite drunk by the time we put her on the plane home . Her great-grandson , who was with her , steered her to the steps very carefully , winking at me as he went . Aunt Annie looked at me too , her thin emaciated face still holding something of the Howland look . And she stopped with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " This boy 's something of a prick , but he 's the only one I gotp230home now . He still winking over my shoulder ? " She did n't expect an answer . " Of course he is . " She heaved herself up the steps and disappeared into the plane . She died a month later and that was the last of my close family . Even John 's parents , dour and silent , visited us for two days . " They do n't like it , " he reported . " Smells too lush to be godly . Anythingnice got to be sinful . " He chuckled and kissed me . " Leastways they still think you 're a good wife . " " It does n't look like I 'll be bothered with visiting in-law trouble . " " It 's a long way to Tolliver Nation , " he said . " And they do n't take to traveling . " We were peaceful and smug and contented . Things went on smoothly , with only minor changes . Take John , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert Dade finished his term , and then go for the Senate . It did n't work quite like that . Things were n't changed , but they were delayed . Herbert Dade , who was a political power the like of which people had never seen and whom most people compared to Huey Long in Louisiana , got the state constitution changed , so he could  --  and he intended to  --  succeedhimself . I thought John would be annoyed , but he only laughed . " Honey baby , the old boy has ulcers and high blood pressureand he 's started having strokes already . He can get himself this new term but he sure as hell ca n't get himself to finish it . " And there was another reason that he did n't mention . Dade was naming John his political heir . Day after day in the papers you saw pictures of them together . I can even remember Governor Dade 's flat drawling old man 's voice saying : " This young fellow here thinks more like me than I do myself . " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senate and old Dade campaigned for him . That fall , Dade was re-elected byp231something like three to one . John was elected by something like eight to one . About a week after the elections , late one night , after all the fuss had died down , I found John working at his desk . He had made one wing of the house into an office . In those four rooms , he kept two clerks and four secretaries . Officially his office was in town , but most of the work was done here . He wanted to keep the business and the clatter out of sight  --  to keep his official office carefully sparse and simple . Country fashion , he would say . He had even found a beat-up desk that belonged to his grandfather and moved it in . It brooded over the office , a hideous carved yellow oak thing ... . On this particular night , the children were asleep , and I was reading . All of a sudden the house seemed so empty and so lonesome that I went looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election returns . He was doing it very carefully , polling place by polling place . He took off his glasses , and rubbed at his eyes . They were red with strain . " I was just coming in , honey . " " How does it look ? " He grinned , and it was the good , slightly lopsided real grin that he gave to the children and not to the photographers . " They came through fine all right , white and black together . " " You did as well in the Negro precincts ? " " You should n't sound so surprised , honey , it is n't flattering . " " But the Citizens Council and that sort of thing . " He chuckled again , the wise and knowing chuckle of a politician . " I 'm just behaving the way a white man is supposed to behave . White and black both know it . " " Did they count the votes ? Really count them honestly ? " " Mostly , I think ; they 're machines , honey child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in this state , you have n't figured it out , have you ? " He folded his glasses and put them in the leather case he always carried in his breast pocket . " The Negroes figure I 'm not old Judge Lynch himself  --  and I 've tried my damndest to seep232that they get that message straight . And everybody in the district pretty much knows about your grandpa 's bastards . That counts for something , I guess . As for the white people , well , they think I 'm for just about whatever they 're for . And I 've told ' em that myself . " He popped up from his chair , grinning happily , and he looked an awful lot like the man I married fourteen years before . " Woman , " he said , " let 's go to bed . " He was still the most attractive man I 'd ever known . I remember that night , even now . I always think of it as the end of the happy times . And in a way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Once I saw the boy who had brought me the first message from Margaret . He was standing outside the Woolworth store on Main Street . He had bought a couple of things , neckties and a baseball cap , and he was checking their colors in the daylight . He did n't see me , he was so busy , and he jumped when I spoke to him . " How 's Margaret ? " I asked . He looked so very surprised that I wondered if I had the wrong boy . But I could n't have . " You 're the boy she sent , " I told him . " Are n't you living with her any more ? " " Yes 'm . " " How is she ? " " She did n't give me no message this time . " His dark eyes had gone opaque like mirrors . " Do n't be the impenetrableAfrican , " I said . " I just asked you how she is . . . . Do you know what impenetrable is ? " He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was only a boy after all , and I had pretty much jumped on him . " I did n't mean to startle you . I just want to know if she 's well . " The eyes did n't change character at all . " She 's an old lady , Miss Margaret is , and they got their aches and pains . " " You mean she 's sick . "  | " No 'm . " I could almost feel the evasion , his mind rolling away like a drop of water on oil . " What do you mean ? " " She been low in her mind , you might say . " " Well , " I said , " it ca n't be easy for her . " And then I saw my two daughters running across the town square . They had been to the dentist and they each had a huge yellow balloon with the black lettering : " Dr. Marks Happy Friends . " " Tell Margaret hello for me , " I said , and walked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner for the light to change . It was the only traffic light in the whole town , and they always went to cross at that corner . They enjoyed it more . Half an hour later as we walked toward the car to drive home , me holding the balloons and feeling the queer live tug of their strings in my hand , Abby asked : " Who was the boy you were talking to ? " " I do n't know , honey . I did n't ask him . " I had done what most white people around here did  --  knew a Negro and dealt with him for years , and never found out his name . Never got curious about who he was , and what he was called . As if Negroes did n't need identities ... . Margaret died . Four years after my grandfather , on the very day when he had collapsed over the wheel of his truck and died in the woods . The anniversary of that day was bleak and cold and wintry , with everyone huddled inside by their fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did any more , not even into the yard ; she did n't seem to care . In the late afternoon , just after the watery winter sun slipped behind the southwest ridge , she put aside her tatting and got up from her rocker . " Somebody calling outside , " she said . And she went , without a coat or a shawl , though the ground was already lightly frozen and crackled under her heavy steps.  |p234Her  cousin and the boy waited patiently . At midnight , the boy bundled up and took a flashlight and looked for footprints in the frosty ground . He found them at once . They led straight down the slope toward the trees and the winter-slowed creek . He followed them across the open places , but he hesitated at the dark of the trees  --  the beam of his flash seemed too small . He turned and scurried back to the house , his hands shaking and his face grey . He refused to go back again . He smelled death , he said . He and his mother together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house  --  got into Margaret 's car and drove down the road to their family . They spent the night there , and in the morning , they got seven or eight people together and came back to hunt for her . It did not take long . Her steps were plain for everybody to see . They followed them through the trees to the creek and down the creek to the crumbling old brick baptistry . In the morning light the pool had the leaden look of water about to freeze . There , in the leaflittered , twig-crusted , leaden-green depths they found her . She was bobbing gently to the flow a couple of inches below the surface . She was face down and her arms were spread as if she were flying . Since the baptistry was so deep and they did n't know how to swim very well , any of them , they poked and dragged at her body until they maneuvered it close to shore . Then they lifted her out . She was a big heavy-boned woman and even heavier in the stiffness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken with chunks of rock and bits of branches , and covered and slippery with ice  --  so they stumbled and dropped her . It seemed to them at that moment she was twisting away from them , was twisting back toward the pool . Margaret 's cousin screamed and ran , her son right behind her . The others , grown men and women that they were , murmured a little rush of words and hurried after them . Even the preacher ran , though he was n't supposed to be afraid . ( His name was Boyd Stokes and his father and his grandfather had preached in New Church in theirP235time . ) They all waited an hour or more , standing in the bare empty field , stamping their feet on the frozen ground , and watching toward the wall of trees , as if they were waiting for someone to tell them what to do . After a bit they sent for whiskey . The sun warmed their backs ; the shadows shortened , the trees did n't look quite so dark any more ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer and they did what decent people had to do : went back and gathered up the muddy , bruised , leaf-plastered body and brought it into the house . That was all . That was the end of the girl my grandfather had met on a cool morning washing clothes in a little creek that did n't have a name . When she died , she was an old woman  --  though she was n't all that along in years  --  tired and sick , and there was n't any part of the world that looked familiar or comforting to her . I wonder now what it was like living for four years , not wanting to , only waiting for your hold to weaken so you could finish up and leave . John was surprised that I did n't cry at the news . I could n't explain to him , but it was n't like that . This was the order re-establishing itself . This was the way I 'd known all along it would be , without realizing it . It was n't something you cried over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term . You just curled up where you were , curled up in pain and fear , and you stayed shriveled and shivering . John did n't say anything , he was only a little more solicitous . He called me twice a day now , when he was away . And he made special plans to be home when the baby was born  --  I was pregnant again . It was a horrible time . I never knew whether it was the baby moving or my own fear shaking me inside . I did n't sleep , because Margaret lurked around the corners and the dark spots of all my dreams . She even called to me out of the color-streaked ether-filled cold when the child was born . It was a girl and I called her Margaret . I expected John to object , but he did n't . " Lay her ghost ? " he said.  |p236And  that was the thing with him . Just when you thought he was stupid and dense , he would come up with the answer , and he would put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been able to phrase it yourself . Margaret had not kept the addresses of her children . Her cousin ( I found out finally that her name was Hilda Stokes ; she was the widow of the youngest of the seven Stokes boys ) did not know them . I had a couple of old ones from my grandfather 's records and I tried them , but the telegrams and the letters came back , unopened . They  --  Robert , Nina , and Crissy  --  got the news some way . I 've never known how . In the year that followed Margaret 's death , they appeared , one by one , drifted back into my life . First , a letter from Nina , its only address a post-office box in Philadelphia . It was a single line on heavy white formal paper : " How is my mother ? " She had heard then . So I wrote across the bottom of the letter , not even bothering with a sheet of my own : " She killed herself January 30 last year . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't tell her that it might have been an accident after all . A stumble on ice-slick rock . I did n't like Nina and I was n't going to give her a shred of comfort . Even a tiny shred . When I dropped it into the mailbox , I thought : Carry that now , and see how strong you are . Carry that behind your arrogant handsomeface . Guilt for being a Negro , guilt for having a suicide for a mother ... . Nina 'd come back to flaunt her marriage , to hurt Margaret . But Margaret was even , in their war of hurt and be hurt . I nodded to her wherever she was , and I almost found myself saying out loud to her : You 've won one round ... . When the florist in town got a telegraphed order for fifty dollars '  |p237worth  of flowers for Margaret 's grave , I knew I had been right . Nina would ache with guilt the rest of her life , wondering how much she had done in her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he did . He did n't want to , but he could n't think of a reason , and he did n't dare not . He finally came out and asked me openly , nervously . " The telegram came from Philadelphia , " he said . " I thought you might know if it 's one of her children , " and then because he felt he had gone too far , he added : " I been remembering that Margaret worked for your grandfather for years on . " " I do n't know , " I said , " but have you ever had a single fifty-dollar order before ? " He clucked with confusion , that funny little wispy man who had been florist in the shop just across the street from the county jail for as long as I could remember . People in little towns seem to live forever , drying up like crickets , chirping all the time ... . As I left him , I could n't help smiling at Nina , egotistical selfcenteredNina . She thought she had killed her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her that my grandfather 's dying had killed Margaret . That after his death , she found an earth of brass , and she had n't been able to stand it . Who could tell Nina that it was n't any of the children , that they were n't that important to Margaret , who had known from the moment they were born that she would send them away . No , Nina would n't be the sort to believe that people died for love , for weariness . As I walked over to meet John at his office , I wondered : If he died , what then ? But I knew he was n't all I had . There were the children , and a house and land that had been in my family for a hundred and fifty years , and a round of duties , dull and familiar , but saving , if it ever came to that.  |p238I  might miss him , but I would n't die of him . That was the difference . Neither Nina nor I was like Margaret . Neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months  --  Robert called . I was getting ready for bed  --  John was out again . The state legislature was in session and he had gone to the capital . I had a nasty cold  --  I was fixing a hot toddy when the phone rang . " Spokane calling Mrs. John Tolliver . " I agreed mechanically , wondering who I knew in Spokane . I did not recognize the voice  --  how should I ? " This is Robert Howland . " For a moment that did not register either . He got impatient with my heavy breathing silence . " Margaret 's son . " " Oh , " I said , " for heaven 's sake . " Here he had always been called Robert Carmichael . " Can you hear me ? " He had a crisp midwestern voice . It came through the line as sharp and clear as a radio announcer 's . " Of course I can . I was just surprised . After all these years , both of you turn up . " " Who else ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you know ? Do n't you see her ? " " I do n't even know where she 's living . " I did not believe him , even when he added : " I do n't think much of her husband . " " Neither did Margaret . " " I want to ask you about her . Is it all right or would you rather go to another phone ? " " Why ? " He sounded impatient again . " Is your line tapped ? " " Now who would tap my line ? " " Your husband 's in politics . I 've been seeing his name around one place or the other . His line might be . "  |p239I  sneezed and my sinuses began a steady aching . " Oh for God 's sake , Robert , everybody for miles around knows about Margaret and her children . What is there to hide ? " He hesitated for a moment , not saying something . Then he asked abruptly : " How is she ? I heard she died . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It was Nina , " I said flatly , and he did n't contradict me . " I thought you 'd keep in touch with her whether or not you liked her husband . " " Well , answer me , " he said . " She drowned herself on January 3oth . " " Last year ? " " Yes . " " Where ? " " The creek by her house  --  they tell me . I did n't go over to see . " " Of course you could n't go over . " " I can go wherever I please , and do n't be such a fool . " The operator cut in . " Your three minutes are up . Please deposit ... " " Okay , " he said , cutting across her voice . " I 've got the change here . " And there was the dull muffled clang of silver dropping into a pay box . So he had n't called from his home or his office , or even his hotel , if he was away traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renewed silence , he asked : " Did she leave a note ? " " Fixing the blame ? No , " I said . " You 'll have to do that your-self . " " Did she leave anything for me ? " " If you mean money "  --  he did n't of course , but I wanted to be nasty  --  " she left the house and the land to the cousin who lived with her , and about a quarter of the money too , whatever she had from my grandfather . The other three-quarters she left to me. "  | " A will ? " Why did Margaret 's children make me so angry ? " How else could she leave it ? " " Nothing in it about me ? " He hesitated , hating to lump himself with the others : " About us ? " " No . Of course not . " " I wondered . " " Do n't you remember even that much about her ? When you allleft here , you were gone forever . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , " he said slowly , " but I can remember that . " " She did it for you . " That sounded so silly , but it was true . " It might have been better if she 'd kept us there . " His voice was as bitter as mine when I answered him . " Then you 'd be a Negro in the South , grubbing in the mud . " " A quadroon . " " You 've been reading books , " I told him . " I never did hear anybodyuse that word here . You 'd be a nigger to the white people , and you 'd be a nigger to the blacks . " " I 've thought of that , " he said quietly . " She did what she could , " I told him , " and you would n't have the sense nor the courage to do the same . " I slammed down the phone , ending his furtive call , and put my head down on the receiver and cried with fury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Do you think our phone is tapped ? " " You 've been hearing clicks ? " " I wondered . " He was going through the stack of mail that had collected for him over the past two days . " I would n't be surprised . " " You would n't ? "  |p241He  shrugged and kept slitting the tops of letters , methodically . " Politics , honey . " " You mean it 's usual ? " He looked up suddenly and grinned , a bright boyish grin that clashed with the streaks of grey at his temples . " Sometimes the peoplelistening on my office phones ca n't help commenting on what we say . Now that we know they get angry , we always try something to see if we ca n't get them to join it . " I did n't say anything ; I could n't think of anything to say . " After a while you get used to three-way conversations , honey . " " You did n't tell me . " He grinned again . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd let the opposition gather my divorce evidence for me . " " Oh John , you should have . I might have said something . " " You could n't , honey . " And I stopped . I could n't indeed . I did n't know anything . " After all , " John said , " what does it matter if they know who we 're going to have dinner with  --  they could get that much out of the servants for a few bucks . Or what you 're going to send to the church fair , or if Mr. Shaughnessy sent you a lousy roast . " " You 're right , " I said slowly . " But I do n't think I like that . " My grandfather had treated me the same way ; but then I was a child . John shrugged . " Why tell you things I know will upset you ? Look right now . . . a little thing like a wire tap and you flip . " He stood up and went to the bar , kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A drink for you , Mrs. Tolliver . " The girls came home from dancing school . We could hear them tramp in , teasing Johnny and the baby until they roared with frustration . " To them ! " John lifted his glass toward the noise . " Is Miss Greer going to make dancers out of them ? "  | " No , " I said . " She 's trying , but they just do n't have any sense of rhythm . " And then he asked what he had been wanting to ask : " Why are you worried about wire tapping all of a sudden ? " I sighed and tried to fish the cherry out of my old-fashioned . I kept getting the orange slice instead . " Margaret 's son called today to ask about her , and he wanted to know if it was all right to talk . " John gave a short low whistle and relaxed . I wondered what he thought it might have been . " Everybody knows about your grandfather'swoods colts . " " I told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't surprised . I knew by now that those three kept in touch , in a manner of speaking . This was a postcard  --  Bois de Boulogne in spring  --  and a couple of lines in clear stiff board-like handwriting . ( That writing reminded me that Crissy was left-handed . ) " I have heard about my mother " ( From Robert or Nina ? I wondered ) , " and I wish to send my thanks for your trouble . I now live in Paris , the haven of American Negroes . " She had not signed it , and she had started to fill in my address on the right side . When she was half through , she changed her mind , and put the postcard in an envelope . Careful and discreet . She wanted to avoid trouble for me . But then she had always been the gentlest and the nicest of Margaret 's children . There were a few more months , quiet baby-filled months . I could feel myself sinking into the deceptive softness of early middle age , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wifely role in state politics . Sherries in the morning ( little giggles because liquor was still illegal in most counties ) , coffees in the afternoon , weekends with the proper people . Baby showers , weddingp243showers . I drove up to the capital every week now , had tea with Mrs. Dade , lunch with three or four other women , and then did my hospital calls . It was the biggest hospital in the state and I always went by , always the same routine  --  John had told me precisely how to do it . A few chatty words with the grey ladies at the reception desk , a quick pass through the director 's office , then the visits to the floors . There was even a special order for that : third floor , second floor , fourth floor , fifth and sixth , then the Negro wing . Third floor was surgical , the dramatic cases , they came first and nobody would object ; second was the ordinary jumble of illnesses ; fourth was obstetrics ( " They wo n't mind being last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 'll be so delighted with the child " ) . Fifth and sixth were the ward floors , the charity floors . Finally the Negro wing , all floors . The first time I did it , I felt silly . I held my breath against the odor of sickness , and the look of pain . Finally I began to realize that these people were glad to see me . That my visits , howeverobvious their purpose , broke the monotony of hospital routine . John was delighted with my success . " What a campaigner you 'll make , " he said . I did n't like it . No , I never did , but I was able to do it . I never drove back home the same day . It was too long and too hard ; anyway John did n't like me driving alone at night . I stayed in the apartment he kept at the Piedmont Hotel . In the morning I stopped at one of the big department stores ( finer than anything in our town ) to bring the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in the car and drove home . I suppose I 've made the trip two hundred times , but now that it is all over , I find that I only remember one . Out of all that , only one . I woke up very early that morning , and the hotel bedroom was cheerless and drab . I had n't slept at all well  --  I had been dreaming of my mother . I had n't even thought of her for years and now all of a sudden there she was . It 's funny how those things come back . And it 's disturbing too . I could n't remember what the dream was exactly ,  |p244but  it had something to do with her , and something to do with high grass and fireflies in the trees . It was a summer dream and it had some of that oppressive brooding quality summer nights have . Only in a dream its worse . Anyhow , I was awake , and I clearly was n't going back to sleep , so I decided to go home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ar ; I was in a hurry and nervous about it . I did n't really feel good tuft iI I was behind the wheel and on the way out of town , ignoring traltic lights because it was so early . The car was chilly , and I turned on the heater . Its little monotonous hum made me worry about falling asleep , as I always do when I am alone . So I turned on the radio . I got the usual early-morning program of hymns and yesterday 's quotations from various markets . Soon I was out of the city and there was n't anything but empty road unrolling in front of my headlights . It was still dark . I had no idea of time  --  I had n't looked before I left . The dashboard clock never worked . My own wrist watch was stopped ; I had forgotten to wind it . It must have been about four o'clock ; since it was still early spring , dawn was fairly late . Some of the farmhouses I passed had lights in them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the house was very close to the road , I could catch a whiff of frying through the small crack of my open window . Then those houses ended , and the road swung directly south through empty lumbering country . There was no traffic , no house lights ; there was n't anything except a stretch of concrete and stands of timber . There was just a black pre-dawn sky and two jabs of my headlights , the friendly glow of the dashboard , and the vibration of the heavy engine , straining slightly as I climbed hills without lessening speed . I 've always liked to drive alone at night . There is a sentimental brightness to things  --  it 's a good deal like being drunk . I always see the world perfectly then , see it in all its great pathetic clarity . I becomeinvincible , beyond life and death . With the hum of wheels under me , I can love the human race , as I never can at any otherp245time . I can think great cloudy thoughts , and tremble with the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a dozen children and live forever . It seems possible . I drove very fast . I knew , as everyone else did , that the highway patrols went home at three and did n't come back until seven . I was making very good time . The grades got steeper and I had to push a little on the accelerator to maintain speed  --  I was crossing the ridge of hills that separated the Great Central Valley from the smaller Providence Valley . The Providence River was the one you saw from the front of our house , the one that the first William Howland had followed when he was looking for a place to settle , the one he had named for his mother . I did n't believe I could have gotten here so fast . I slowed and opened the window and looked out . Pine trees , neat rows , neat fences , then a lumber road . I slowed even more and read the small identifying sign . It was the Eastman-Halsey tract , I was three-quarters of the way home . I closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come . I really should have looked at the speedometer . John would be furious if he ever found out . But I did n't slow down . I came out of the mountain ridges and zoomed down the straight level road through Madison City . The courthouse , street lights burning at each of its four corners . Post office , street lights broken in front of it . John 's office , shuttered and empty . ( And how does the roll-top desk look in there , teetering on its too thin legs in the dark ? ) I startled a pack of dogs rooting in the garbage pails in front of the Happy Chicken Cafe . They bolted for the shadows , yelping . I passed Joe 's Place , on the outskirts of town , closed and dark , except for the string of small lights burning in its parking lot . Just then the radio went off . Very suddenly , without static , without any warning , its sound stopped . The lights still burned and I pushed all the buttons and worked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new car  --  and it was very annoying . I do not like to drive alone without a radio . What had been funp246turns into something mildly threatening . The dark , which had been filled with the pleasant empty-headed chatter of the machine , closed back  --  and this time it was filled with its own sounds , not with yours . The sounds of empty country and empty roads  --  depressing , a little frightening . I was happy that I was almost home and that dawn was almost breaking . The sky was already lightening . You could see that the day would be overcast , at least until the ground fog rose and burned away . I came to the bend at Thatcher 's Creek and slowed down . No more than a mile now , I should see the house at the next turn . The sky was silvery-colored , fish-colored : the color of a swamp cat . The wild azaleas were blooming . I had n't realized how many of them there were . Their sweet wet perfume slipped through the crack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . I felt thewheels skid once , slightly . I slowed down still more . This valley often had fogs when the higher , drier mountains had none . The road curved up to our pastures , edged by a barbed-wire fence covered with tight pink sweetheart roses , not yet in bloom . And then I came to the last turn and looked up the slope of ground toward the house . Somehow I had gotten the idea that it would not be there , would have disappeared like a ghost . ( Damn that radio , I thought . ) But of course it was there . Vague and indistinct in the fog , but there , just the way it had been for the last five generations . It looked very very large in this light , and empty . Fog covered the fields beneath it , so that it seemed to float without solid ground , just exactly like those fairy castles in a child 's story book . I turned in the drive , through the great mass of azaleas John had planted . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were n't quite in bloom , their wet leaves shone black in the fog . I drove faster , the gravel rattling off my tires , until I came to the end , and there was the yard familiar and safe , stretching in front of me , full of known things . A power mower , forgotten and left out overnight . A rake leaning against the house . A bicycle . Empty clothes lines , cords frayed and fluttering.  |p247At  that moment the radio went on again . Very loud . I listened for a minute , then switched it off . As I walked to the kitchen door , pulling the key from my purse , shivering a little in the morning chill , I began to wonder . And the more I thought , the surer I was . There 'd been a message of some sort . Something had brushed right by me  --  for good or evil I did n't know . Because I had n't understood . I had rocketed through the night alone , something traveling with me . And I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from a high-speed accident . And my own spiritual denseness had n't answered whatever it was that had called to me . I went into my house and closed the door firmly behind me.  |p248IT  'S like this , when you live in a place you 've always lived in , where your family has always lived . You get to see things not only in space but in time too . When I look at the Providence River , I do n't just see a small yellow river that crests into flood every year and spreads its silt over the bottom cotton lands . I see old William Howland , adventuring his way along , fresh from a war , seeking a place to settle . I see him coming along through its canebrakes and its swamps , the thin homely face of the portrait that now hangs in the dining room . . . . I ca n't ever see the ridge that rises to the east without seeing more than the deep green of thick timber . I see Cousin Ezra Howland , shot through the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , during the Civil War , who got to the top of that ridge , and no farther . They said he 'd left a fifteen-mile trail of blood . He slipped off his horse and died up there , in sight of his home . His mother and his aunt and his sister , who were in the house alone , they saw the hawks and the buzzards circling and went out themselves and found him . . . . When I drive to Madison City itself , I do n't just see a small town with mangy dogs slouching about the gutters . I see the time when the bandit Whittaker brothers  --  all six of them  --  tied their boat at the river landing and came into town to rob and murder . When they left , to continue their way toward the Gulf coast , they took the daughter of the livery stable ownerp249with them . People said it was n't kidnapping , that she offered to go , so it was her own fault that she was never heard of again and that a skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hers . That 's the way it is with me . I do n't just see things as they are today . I see them as they were . I see them all around in time . And this is bad . Because it makes you think you know a place . Because it makes you think you know the people in it . Things fell out this way . Old Governor Dade , who lasted four years longer than John expected , finally died after two years of his third term . His lieutenant governor took the oath of office . His name was Homer O'Keefe , and he was a handsome , silver-haired man , who came from the southern part of the state . He looked respectable , as old Dade did not , and he had been put on the ticket to draw the votes of the respectable well-to-do groups . But he was a stupid pompous fool . When John told me about Governor Dade 's death , he said flatly : " Wait till you see the mess old Homer makes now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him is going to be swept in like Jesus Christ on Palm Sunday . " He was right of course . I ca n't remember all of them , but there was a highway scandal , and a welfare scandal . An instructor at the State Teachers College was discovered to be a card-carrying Communist . A school in Plainview burned down and the parents of the dead children and all the rest of the state blamed Governor O'Keefe for that . A hurricane that seemed headed for Yucatan turned right around and smashed into the Gulf coast . And that same summer there was a polio epidemic that closed every swimming pool in the state , and it was an unusually hot summer . That was probably the worst thing of all . John looked more and more smug as we went on our usual roundsp250through the passing months . " Is n't there something I can do ? " I asked him once . He winked . " You 're doing great . " " I 'm not doing a thing . " " Why should I spoil you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet and kind to everybody . " " Do n't joke with me , John . " " Honey , you 're perfect for the job , and that 's why I married you . " I did n't say any more because I was n't at all sure that he had n't told the exact truth . I did nothing extra or special in the last weeks before the primary . John was almost never home , and the house was quiet . I only saw a couple of reporters who wanted to see how a candidate 's wife lived , and they were disappointed . Once I got a phone call from my cousins Clara and Sam Hood . They were furious over the account of one of John 's speeches an Atlanta paper had carried . I talked to both of them at once ; they always picked up both ends of an extension . " Really , honey , " Clara said , " he 's gone too far this time . " " I have n't seen it , " I said , " the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think not , " Sam said . " Did your grandfather own the papers too ? " " You know better . " " Maybe he really did n't say it . " Clara asked : " Did he ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " I told them . " The contents of the average Negro skull is 169 milligrams lighter than the average white skull . His brain casing is on the average some 121 millimeters thicker . He is simply not suited by nature forequality with the white man .... " I interrupted . " I 've got the idea . "  | " Honestly , my dear , " Sam said , " this business of not wanting them to marry your sister was enough to get votes , was n't it ? " Clara said : " I am really ashamed to be related to him . I thought I would die when the papers here carried that story . " " Is that what you called to tell me ? " " We just could n't believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was somebody else or a mistake . " " I have n't the slightest idea , " I said . " But I 'll tell John you did n't approve of it . " " You ca n't be for things like that , not after the way your grandfatherbehaved . " " I am very busy , " I told him . " I will call you back sometime later on . " When I hung up , my stomach was icy stiff . Anger or fear , I did n't know which . I went into the side yard , and stretched out in the sun there , waiting for the bright yellow rays to warm into my cold . I had plenty to do . I had the month 's accounts to check out . I was supposed to call a man in Louisiana to say that we would buy his beautiful little roan Shetland for the children . But I did nothing . I lay still in the warmth and waited for it to seep through me . That sort of bodily cold frightens me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following day . " I got quite a spread in the Atlanta papers , " he said . " I suppose you 've heard from your cousins about it ? " " Yes . " " Those papers are no friends of mine , " he said . " I was sure they 'd jump on this one . " " Did you say that ? " " Sure , " he said . " Did you notice where I was speaking ? " " No. "
