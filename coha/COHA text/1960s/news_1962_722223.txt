txt Anxiety over strikes and strike threats in key industries tends to make us forget the extent to which peace prevails in the negotiation of most of the country 's 150,000 collective bargaining agreements . A report just issued by the Labor Department shows that the number of strikes last year dropped to the lowest level since World War II and that the time lost matched the low record set in 1957 . The 16,500,000 man-days of strike idleness in 1961 sounds like a mountainous total ; yet it represented only one lost hour in every 700 when measured against all the available work time .

Among the most encouraging aspects of the year 's record of industrial peace was the substantial drop in work stoppages at missile bases . Thanks to a no-strike pledge by labor and the Administration 's establishment of machinery to settle disputes , the ratio of time lost through strikes has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Labor Goldberg and the responsible leaders of labor and management deserve credit for this improvement .

Ice is the dazzling hoar frost on tree and bush . Ice is the delicate frost fronds on windows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice is the frozen motion of the wind in a snowdrift , the massive plow of a glacier . It is crystals so small , so light , that they float like Mist and shimmer in a January sunrise . It can be the cruel beauty of the dazzling glaze that rips  --  trees apart in an ice storm . ? When it is a - snowflake ; ice is one of the most ? beautiful ' and evanescent crystals we ? know .. As frost , it - is one of nature 's most ' powerful levers , . ? heaving the earth and rending the rocks in the ' silence of long winter . ' nights . The mountains know ice-intimately , the valleys ' know its uncompromising presence , and even the sky has its banners of ice , its high-riding cirrus elands that defy even the heat of July . Often ice is a thing of beauty , but always it is a force , a great elemental , insensate force . And for Most of us , ice is winter , - and seldom is it really simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
