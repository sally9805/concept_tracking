txt Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg called today for Government subsidies of all performing arts and urged both business and labor to join in a partnership of financial support of the arts . The Secretary made his proposal in an arbitration award of raises to musicians of the Metropolitan Opera orchestra in New York . He granted the ninety-one musicians a raise of $10 a week for this season , and more money at later times . Mr. Goldberg had entered the dispute between Local 902 of the American Federation of Musicians and the Metropolitan Opera Association last August at the request of President Kennedy . At one time last summer , the dispute threatened the Met 's entire current season . 6-Way Plan Given Mr. Goldberg used the case as an opportunity to consider ways toward national support for the performing arts . He urged a six-way " partnership " to assure support for the arts in an era he called one of " tumultuous " growth for all art forms . He said that a diversity of sources of funds would assure freedom for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from patrons and benefactors , from corporations and unions and from government , both local and Federal . The Federal Government , Mr. Goldberg said , should increase aid given through its role as a commissioner and user of art and in its job of helping build homes for theatres and museums , as at the Lincoln Cer. ter . Matching Funds Asked But , he continued , none of this work should preclude " programs of direct Federal subsidy for theatrical and musical performances " and the like on a match ing-funds basis . He said " much the larger proportion " of the funds should be provided by " private . sources or by other levels of government . " He also said a Federal advisory council on the arts should be established . The creation of such a council failed to win Congressional approval this year . Such a body , he said , could consider ways to assist the artist , among , them Federal collection of royalties on musical works in the public domain , the revenue to be used to support the arts . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The views herein expressed are my own and not necessarily those of my sponsors . " He said he had not shown his statement to President Kennedy but that " the President in the past has strongly endorsed an arts council when he was a member of Congress . " Mr. Goldberg said he hoped Mr. Kennedy would include such a recommendation in his State of the Union message . He said a Federal council on the arts could explore revenueproducing measures like the following ideas : ( ) Increasing income tax deductions for contributions to the arts . At present a person can deduct gifts for such purposes of up to 20 per cent of gross income . The percentage for gifts for educational and medical purposes is 30 . ( ) Providing special tax provisions for artists themselves , whose earnings often are concentrated in a short period of years . qCollection of royalties by the Federal Government on music on which copyrights have expired . He said it has been estimated this could produce up to $6,200,000 a year . Problems of Growth ' " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of decline , " Mr , Goldberg said , " They are the problems of growth ; a growth so rapid , so tumultuous , so eventful as ' to be almost universally described as an explosion . " He said there were 5,000 community theatres , more than the total of radio and television stations ; more than 500 opera-producing groups ; and 1,100 symphony orchestras , twice the number of ten years ago . " The individual benefactors and patrons just are n't there , as they once were , " Mr. Goldberg said . And he added that " it becomes less and less appropriate for our major cultural institutions to depend on the generosity of a very few of the very wealthy . " He said the principal source of financial support must continue to come from audiences . He urged corporations to expand their support of the arts and said that labor , too , had a responsibility . " The labor movement is of age in America , " he said . Some labor unions have sponsored symphony programs , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions have been directed for activities similar to those which have attracted business support . " Mr. Goldberg appended a special appeal for help to eliminate the Metropolitan 's everpresent deficit . He paid particular tribute to the efforts of Mrs. August Belmont and Mrs. Lewis W. Douglas in seeking support for the Metropolitan . In his arbitration award yesterday , Mr. Goldberg granted the ninety-one musicians a minimum weekly wage of $180 for the current season , retroactive to July 1 ; and $185 for the 1962-63 season ; and $190 for the 1963-64 season . Last season 's minimum pay was $170.13 . The musicians ' union had first asked for $268.80 but scaled this down to $220 . The Met offered $175 for the current season and $180 thereafter . Three-Year Pact Set The union had also sought a one-year contract , while the association had demanded a five-year contract . Mr. Goldberg awarded a three-year contract . Mr. Goldberg said he considered the contract a " fair , just and equitable award . " However , he said he realized the salaries were not b laro-e enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real sense right in their positions . " He said that " the suggestion that these musicians are required to subsidize the Met is in a sense very true , " but he added that it also was true that the opera association was incapable of paying larger salaries . Mr. Goldberg also granted raises in a number of other areas  --  day rehearsal rates ; preseason rehearsal rates ; nonacting stage appearances by musicians ; and overnight per diem allowances . The Labor Secretary tossed back to the association and the union the matter of setting up grievance procedures for the life of the contract . However , he did offer guides for the procedures and said he would do the job himself if they failed to agree on grievance machinery in ninety days . In another of the more than 100 issues at stake , Mr. Goldberg appointed Theodore W. Kheel of New York City as arbitrator in the dispute over the fact the opera association did not rehire Lester Salomon , a French-horn player . Mr. Kheel currently is Impartial arbitrator of the transit industry .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
