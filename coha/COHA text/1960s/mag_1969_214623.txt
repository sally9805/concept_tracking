Russia 's secret-police agency , the KGB , is on a constant lookout for potentially useful Western visitors-and not above using sex to provide evidence for blackmail . With an increasing number of businessmen visiting Russia and other Communist countries , the British government has taken public account of this fact . In a pamphlet issued by the Board of Trade , it offers Britons the delicate warning that " a liaison between a visitor and a local girl will not long remain unknown to the local intelligence service . The girl may be acting for that service from the outset . " <P> If any Britons doubted that understatement , they had only to consider the case of Michael Connock . A correspondent specializing in Eastern Europe for London 's Financial Times , he met a married Polish woman on a trip in 1966 , and on subsequent visits , in his words , " we became very fond of each other . " Last month , when Connock returned to Poland , security agents picked him up , told him " you break up families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . They asked Connock to help identify British agents in Poland ; he signed a statement of cooperation , then reported the whole affair to the British government , his wife , and his editor . Instead of being shifted to other work on the paper as he had expected , he was fired , and last week was still looking for a job . <P> One way of handling the KGB was related by British Agent Greville Wynne in his 1967 book Contact on Gorky Street . Returning to his hotel one night , Wynne recalled , he found a " dark , smiling girl " in his bed . Forewarned by British intelligence as to what to do in such circumstances , he left the door open , ran downstairs , and told the clerk that his room had been rented to someone else by mistake . Then he went for a walk . <P> Some other counter-sex methods were offered last week by London Columnist Angela Ince . Writing in the Evening News , she advised wives of Russia-bound businessmen to " 1 ) Insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him ; a man in a vest eating digestion tablets is as morally safe as a man can be . 2 ) See that he packs no fewer than four pictures of you , taken ten years ago in a bikini and a bad light . Write across them ' Counting the seconds till you get back , Darling ' in purple ink . 3 ) Ask him to phone you every night at nine . The amount of trouble a man can get into is minimal when he spends his evenings trying to make a telephone link between Omsk and Bexleyheath . 4 ) Go with him . The Board of Trade should jolly well buy your ticket . You 're traveling for your country , are n't you ? "
