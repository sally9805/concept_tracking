Wall Street is more than just a seven-block thoroughfare in Lower Manhattan : it is also a marketplace for 17 million investing Americans , a worldwide symbol of capitalism , and a national pool of money from which American business draws its financial sustenance . The Street has meant profit for many investors and grief for some , and since World War II has raised $43 billion for the expansion and modernization of U.S. industry . Any man can buy a piece of what Wall Street offers with a down payment of as little as $2 , but the men who really run the Street , says the Securities and Exchange Commission , are a small and clubby circle of insiders . <P> Last week a group of investigators for the SEC reported that these men often overcharge and insufficiently protect the small investor , and called many of the rules by which they work outmoded , ineffective , and in need of reform . This was the essence of 2,100 pages of findings in the second report of a three-part series on the financial markets , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 lawyers , economists and SEC staffers under Milton H. Cohen , 51 , a sad-eyed and careful Chicago attorney . <P> The SEC group found few outright abuses of the stock market 's rules , but its recommendations struck deeply at five major areas ( see box on next page ) that make up the very heart of the market , promised the most sweeping overhaul of Wall Street since the Pecora investigation set up the SEC 30 years ago . The SEC recommended that trading in stock issues that are " unlisted " on any exchange be automated and perhaps made cheaper for the investor , and that the cost of trading in " odd lots " of fewer than 100 shares be lowered . It asked for closer regulation for the stock exchange specialists and bearish " short sellers , " and suggested that the exchanges ' anachronistic floor traders be abolished altogether . <P> Long Overdue . Having been relieved last spring at the relative mildness of the first part of the SEC report ( TIME , April 12 ) , Wall Streeters were shocked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suggestions were " wild " and " unknowing . " Said Floor Trader Edwin H. Stern : " The other floor traders think what I think . They do n't know what to think . " But after the first shock , many close observers of the market acknowledged that the proposed reforms are long overdue , would bring the market up to date and raise investor confidence . <P> Speaking with the slow deliberation of a man who does not want to rouse the bears , Investigator Cohen conceded that the proposals are " quite controversial " and said that the SEC commissioners might find some " alternative solutions . " SEC Chief William L. Gary and the four other commissioners already have the power to order most of the changes , but Gary , a tough and even-tempered former Columbia law professor , does not intend to take any action until Wall Streeters get a chance to speak their piece at public hearings . <P> Illusory Value . The SEC investigators were disturbed most that the market 's safeguards for small investors seem inadequate and that its devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
