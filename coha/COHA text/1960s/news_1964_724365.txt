txt Secretary of Defense Robert S. announced plans to : day to close 95 military bases and installations , including some naval shipyards , as in economy move . He did not identify the bases . Mr. made his plans known at a Pentagon news conference . He will drop the other shoe tomorrow , when he is scheduled to make the list of closings public . He said the delay was necessary to permit official notifica : . Lion of local officials affected by the cutbacks . About 63,000 jobs in 33 states and five foreign countries are involved . The pending cutbacks are clearly the most far-reaching since the Secretary began his cost-efficiency program in 1961 . He emphasized that nearly $500 million a year would be saved by the pending , base reductions and closings . Similar actions at 574 military bases since 1961 have resulted in estimated annual savings of $576 million . Some Called Costly The pending list ineludes many large , costly installations , Mr. said . There were contradictory indications on the fate of the New York Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the 11 Government-owned shipyards involved in efficiency studies , the Sere , tary answered that he had visited " all but the hard core yards . " ' The official list of announced visits to the naval shipyards by Mr. did not include Brooklyn , indicating it possibly was safe for the time being . On the other hand , it developed that Mr. had made an unannounced visit to the Brooklyn yard last week , in the company of Secretary of the Navy Paul H. Nitze . Thus it was not clear whether the Secretary had his official or unofficial list of visits in mind when he answered the question . Silent on Yards Reporters failed to draw him out on the identity of the yards to be closed . In the meantime , Representative Emanuel Celler , Democrat of Brooklyn , appeared to be first in the deluge of protesting officials that is expected when the list is made public . In a statement tonight he accused Mr. of a " breach of faith . " The Defense Secretary , according to Mr. Celler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's steering committee in the fight to save the Brooklyn yard , had promised to give the New York group " an opportunity to make comment " and had not done so . Mr. Celler said he registered his complaint " regardless of // what the report will be tomorrow . " The list of announced visits to shipyards by Mr. in the last year , presumably including the likeliest candidates for closing , were San Francisco and Mare Island , in California ; Boston , Portsmouth , N. H. , and z Philadelphia . Three of the yards  --  at Boston , Philadelphia and San Francisco  --  were believed earmarked or closing at least three years ago . Mr. said that the base reductions and closings would not affect the nation 's military strength . He said all : the actions had the " full sup- , 1 ) ort of the Army , Navy and ' this comment on expected pro-tests : " I assume that some will be inclined to treat the forthcoming announcements essentially as bad news , because a significant military payroll is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that there really is good news in these announcements , not only for the taxpayer and the citizen who are concerned about efficiency and economy in government , but specifically for the citizens of the many affected communities . " " Our experience to date with a number of these communities indicates they can derive a net benefit both in payrolls and in tax rolls from the actions we are taking . " Then , with pointer in hand and a layout of charts on the  --  - wall behind him , the Secretary cited examples of military installations that had been shut down and the nearby community ultimately had prospered . He distributed a 32-page booklet with examples of savings due to reductions in military bases and parallel benefits to the communities that undertook new projects as substitutes . Memorandum by Johnson A covering memorandum by President Johnson observed : " We expect to receive a dollar of value for every dollar we spend on defense . . To do so has meant we must eliminate surplus , obsolete , unnecessary defense installations . This has and will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an obligation to assist the individual employes who are affected to adjust to the changes in their local economy . This we are doing . " Mr. told newsmen : " We will protect the indviidual employees who are affected by these moves . We will guarantee a job opportunity for every career employe affected by a closure . If the new job opportunity requires a move to another location , the Government will arrange for payment of transportation and moving expenses for the employe and his family . We also arrange for retraining at our expense and continue employes ' salaries while they are being retrained . " Mr. said that the names of the five countries overseas in which base closings are scheduled would not be made known , because they required additional negotiations with the governments involved . To Be Phased Out The bases to be closed or reduced in operation in the United States , he said , would be phased out over an extended period . He made clear the Navy yards concerned would be closed entirely rather than put on a standby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is quite clear that we have excess capacity in our naval shipyard system . " He noted also , however , that the studies concerning the naval shipyards were among the most complicated he had had to undertake , especially because of the skills of the employes . Mr. repeatedly has said that private shipyards have been found to be more economical and efficient in shipyard construction in recent years . He added that as a result of the closing of some naval shipyards , other naval shipyards would receive increased work . : The Secretary said that a total of 377,000 acres  --  almost 600 square miles of land  --  would be released for nondefense use as a result of the cutbacks . Summarizing past actions , the Secretary said ' that 574 bases had been closed or reduced . This involved 1,694 square miles released or to be released . The Secretary said that 32 , - 921 civilian jobs and 52,913 military assignments had been ! saved . The annual savings to the Department of Defense was $576.8 million , he said . No Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that officials had no idea whether it would be affected by the shutdowns . Some 10,000 men are employed there .
