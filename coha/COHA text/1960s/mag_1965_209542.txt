For bandleaders , society can be a cruel mistress . At debutante parties they receive compliments but not calling cards , at charity balls they take their breaks with their players instead of their patrons , and at cocktail parties they are not to be seen at all . Even hair dressers fare better - no doubt because they know more secrets . But with Band leader Peter Duchin , 28-year-old son of famed Piano Stylist Eddy Duchin , life is considerably sweeter . <P> Last month , at the White House par ty for Princess Margaret , Duchin sat at Lynda Bird 's table until he had finished off his praline glace , then took his seat at the keyboard and kept Washington 's ringleaders in step till 2 a.m . <P> At one point , the President of the U.S. <P> danced by . Peter waved casually . And why not ? The President 's partner was Duchin 's wife Cheray ( nee Zauderer ) , who is the daughter of a wealthy New York investor . <P> Watched Man . Virtually every night when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , Peter is shaking his head at hors d'oeuvres trays in Manhattan drawing rooms . He is the only bandleader who is invited for supper even when he is not asked to play for it . <P> Gossip columnists chronicle his every move as if he were the best addition to society since Serge Obolensky . <P> The key to Duchin 's double life lies in a scrambled lineage that is the epito me of today 's mobile society . Father Eddy Duchin was only the son of a pharmacist , and a paid performer at deb parties , until he caught the eye of Marjorie Oelrichs , descendant of a leading Newport family and heiress to the last scraps of a once immense mining fortune . When she married him , the Social Register struck her name from its rolls . <P> But many friends could not have cared less , including Marie Norton , who became a chum when they were at Spence School together and had subsequently married Averell Harriman . <P> When Marjorie died six days after Peter 's birth , it was the Harrimans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on extended concert tours and served a four-year hitch in the Navy . Eventually , though they never legally adopted him , the Harrimans became Peter 's foster parents . <P> Father Eddy spent his childhood serving up milkshakes in his father 's pharmacy ; his son Peter was brought up in a dazzling world of millionaires and Chippendale chairs . Even the names of his schools had that ring of good crystal-Eaglebrook , Hotchkiss and Yale . <P> But Eddy came around often enough to make sure his son knew his musical as well as his social scales . By the time he reached Yale , Peter was already a good pianist and a weekend bandleader . <P> Business Quadrupled . After a two-year stint with the Army in Panama ( " I spent most of my free time digging up pre-Columbian art objects " ) , Peter arrived back in New York and started searching for a gold-plated piano stool , just as his father had 32 years before . Duchin and his twelve-piece band were soon booked for $3,000 a week in the St. Regis Hotel 's Maisonette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter stayed on for three years , and the Maisonette was the only cheek-to-cheek dance spot in New York , besides El Morocco , to prosper in spite of the discotheques.
