In the Valley A story by Hugh Nissenson , 6111 Day ? . Nothing . So far we have found nothing to indicate that they are here  --  but not so much as a gnawed bone , or ashes from a fire , either in what the Fourth Expedition numbered Cave Three , where I am writing this now , or in any other limestone cave in what will eventually come to be known as the Valley of the Vezere . " Maybe we 've come too soon , " says Lisel , in a voice that echoes in the elongated axial hall which resembles a rotunda , with a vaulted dome . Her husband Irwin shakes his head , and I 'd stake my reputation on it : somewhere , outside , above us in the valley at this very moment , Europe 's , and as far as we know , the world 's first Cro-Magnon community has already established itself , and with the coming of the winter is preparing to move into this cave which will serve them as a kind of temple for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Lisel , leafing through her portfolio of photographs of the frieze of cattle they will paint on the wall of the lateral gallery to our right . " Marvelous , are n't they ? The hulls , particularly . Look at this one done in ocher . A perfect representation of Bos primigenius . It 'll be extinct by the seventeenth century . " " Brenner , what do you really think ? Are we wrong ? " her husband asks me . " Maybe we 've miscalculated . There are hundreds of Neanderthals in the valley . Where are the Cro-Magnons ? It does n't make sense . " " Never mind . McIver and Williams will be back in a day or so . They 'll have found something . " " You really think so ? I hope so , " he says , clearing his hoarse throat , and spitting into his handkerchief . The damp caves have given him a bad cold . . . . go IN THE VALLEY Lisel has set up her cameras and tape recorders . " Box primigenius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? " she cries out . " No , no , right there , where I 'm pointing , under those trees . Two . . three . four of them ! A bull and three cows . " She gets down on one knee to take her pictures while I focus my binoculars on the herd . The wind abruptly shifts , and the humped red bull raises his muzzle streaming with saliva and strands of chewed grass to low in our direction and then wheel to the left , and lumber off , with the cows following in a bunch . " I got them . I got them all , " says the girl . " It 's marvelous . Those cave bears the day before yesterday , and now the bull and those cows . It was a Box primigeniux , did you see him , darling ? " Irwin , to whom she has been married for six months , has just climbed the hill , and all flushed and sweaty from the exertion  --  his high , bald forehead gleams with sweat  --  gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reloads the camera . Twenty-six , or maybe twenty-eight at the most , the daughter of a famous sculptor , and an able art prehistorian in her own right , she met her future husband while going for her Ph.D . in paleontology at NYE ) , where he heads the department . In the ten or twelve years that . I have known him , I 've never seen him as happy as he 's been in the last few months . When he asked me if she could accompany him on the expedition , I felt it was the least I could do to allow her to come ; it was he , after all , who was among the first in the natural sciences who believed in the feasibility of chronological transference , and who did so much to influence Congress to provide the necessary appropriations to develop the technique . " It 's late . We ought to be getting back to camp , " he says , rising to his feet . " Yes .77 This , from his wife , with an anxious glance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fires are burning in the gathering twilight  --  the campsites of the Neanderthals , who are slowly but surely infiltrating the valley with the coming of the cold weather . Later " Ten , twelve , fifteen . . . I make it fifteen . " The girl is counting the Neanderthal campfires in the hills . " No , sixteen , " she continues after a moment ; our own fire , on which Halevy heaps an armful of brush , blazes up , exploding in a shower of sparks . " Is it safe ? " Lisel asks me . " Supposing they see it . " And then in a lower voice , as if ashamed : " You 'll laugh , I know , but I ca n't help it . There 's something absolutely horrifying about them . If you want to know the truth , they give me bad dreams . " Her husband and Halevy , bedding down for the night , overhear the remark , and glance at each other in the firelight. , They too ? Apparently the Neanderthals give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a week , they have haunted me in my sleep . Some of them are cannibals . A week ago , hidden in some rocks , we filmed a feast in one of their encampments about four miles from here . As we watched , a tribe of about a dozen or so killed and devoured a young female whose legs had been previously broken to prevent her from running away . A grizzled old male with a tufted beard like a billy goat , and a pronounced limp from an old wound , finished her off with his flint hand-axe , one blow to the crown of her skull that cracked open her brainpan , In my dreams , he  --  it 's always the old male  --  is unarmed . I dream in color , by the way , something I 've never noticed before . He is covered with graying reddish hair , and has pale , yellow eyes , all iris , like a cat 's , at night , which gleam under his flat , receding forehead , and thick , shaggy brows  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his broad , flattened nose , and thin lips . . . The dream is always the same . I am alone among the rocks near their encampment , under a vast , desolate sky , filled with masses of gray clouds heavy with snow that cast their moving shadows on the broken ground . It 's winter , the glacial winter , freezing cold , so cold that it gives me an agonizing pain in the sinuses below my eyes just to draw a breath . Like Irwin , it occurs to me . Had sinuses . What do you know about that ? " Irwin ? " I call out . " Lisel ? Halevy ! Where are you ? Answer me , somebody ! " Then I catch sight of the old male for the first time , standing to my left , perhaps a dozen feet away , among the rocks , with his back toward me , and his huge hands at his sides . " Where are they ? Where did everybody go ? " I whisper , and he slowly turns around , bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole upper part of his naked body bending forward , as if dragged down by the weight of his massive head . " Where did they go ? " I repeat . 82 IN THE VALLEY have great influence on human thinking , of course . To the Prophets , for example , time was a very different thing than it is to us . As a matter of fact , in a certain way , the whole , wonderful , prophetic tradition . . . " But he breaks off , rubbing his prizefighter 's nose . " The whole , wonderful prophetic tradition ... " He comes from an old French-Jewish family , originally from Algiers , as I recall , which for generations , since the end of the second world war , has alternately produced sons who were either distinguished scientists or rabbis  --  attributes of both , I have begun to suspect , commingle in that powerful , bulky body , and extraordinary brain . Later Wonderful news . An announcement by Irwin after lunch . Lisel is expecting . General rejoicing and hoopla , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who never touches a drop . " Yes , " he tells us . " She was n't sure until this morning , so she did n't say anything . The morn-ing sickness clinched it . Of course , if I had known there was even a possibility . . . I mean , if she had said anything before , I never would have allowed her to come . " I agree . It was a mistake . No one knows what effect her chronological transference , exposure to that powerful electromagnetic field . may have had on herself , or her baby , or will have , when we return in a few days . . . . Still , perhaps I 'm wrong . She looks strong and healthy , and with her full breasts and wide hips , capable of bearing strong , healthy children . 10th Day IVIciver and Williams have finally returned a little after dawn this morning , exhausted and depressed , with a week 's growth of beard on their cheeks . " It 's no use , " McIver repeats , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you sure ? " asks Lisel . " It 's no go , I tell you . I 'll swear to it . There 's not a Homo sapiens fossilis in the whole valley . Just Neanderthals . . . . " " Well , what now ? " Halevy turns to me . " I do n't know . What do you suggest ? " Williams speaks up for the first time , in a hollow , wavering voice . " What about our supplies ? " " We 've got about enough food for two , maybe three days . " " Then I suggest we break up , and have one more try . We can meet back here in forty-eight hours . " Later Halevy and I will go north . " Supposing , just supposing , the Cro-Magnons are n't there , " says Lisel . " I mean they are , they have to be , somewhere in the valley , but just supposing they 're not . What will we do then ? " " ' Strive to be a man where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knapsack . " What ? " " Nothing . " " No , really . What did you say ? " " Nothing , " he says . " It 's a quote from the Talmud . " " IIow does it go ? " " ' Strive to be a man where there is none , ' " he repeats , screwing on the top of his canteen . 11th Day . Evening Maybe the others have had more luck . I2th Day . Night Nothing . . . . We are all here , back together again , and have found no one , any of us , except for an occasional Neanderthal , as impossible as it is to believe . It 's snowing . We have built a fire from damp wood which smolders rather than burns , flaring up now and then in the darkness to illuminate our shadowy faces , and what is frozen there , in the glassy eyes . Intolerable , the expression in Williams ' eyes , particularly , behind his thick glasses which magnify the dilated pupils , and lids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Silence , utter silence , except for the rising wind . McIver fiddles with his electronic equipment , the four black boxes that tomorrow morn-Dig ? vill return us all to our own time , in those concentric , vibrating cones of opaque , violet light which brought us here . . . If Lisel is concerned about the effect the transference will have on her unborn child , she says nothing , but after a little while , when she rises to stretch , calls her husband , and walks with him a little distance away from the rest of us by the fire , to talk with him in an undertone , alone . 13th Day . Morning .. . They 're gone . Irwin and his wife have left us . Halevy woke me a few minutes ago , with a note in Irwin 's handwriting , left under a rock where they spread out their bedrolls last night . There are two pairs of tracks in the snow , leading south , says McIver , who now stares uncom-     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
