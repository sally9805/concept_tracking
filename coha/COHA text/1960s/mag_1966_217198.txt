Near Isfahan , surveyors were setting the final location for a $286 million steel mill that the Russians will construct for Iran . Other crews tramped across the desert and through mountain passes driving stakes to mark the route for a $450 million pipeline that will carry natural gas 800 miles north from Iran 's southern oilfields to the Russian border . At Bandar Shahpur , still others staked out the site for a $100 million petrochemical plant , owned jointly by Iran and the U.S. 's Allied Chemical Corp . Around the clock , workmen were building two new ports on the Persian Gulf ( $300 million ) , a state-owned refinery outside Teheran ( $133 million ) and , nearby , the giant Latyan Dam ( $100 million ) , which they hope to complete early in 1967 . <P> Achieving the Symbol . The intense activity represents the latest stage in Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlevi 's three-year-old " White Revolution " ( so called because it has been bloodless ) , a grand design that is intended to wrest Iran from the middle ages into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land reforms and a massive literacy drive and aided by annual oil royalties worth more than $500 million and an influx of $2 billion in foreign investment capital , the Shah has launched his country headlong into what is far and away the Middle East 's fastest-moving , most ambitious development program . From broad , modern boulevards in Teheran to the effusion of makeshift classrooms in the hinterlands , it has already begun to change the life and look of Iran . <P> The Russians have also agreed to build a $20 million plant to turn out heavy boilers , bridge girders and cranes . Czechoslovakia has promised a $15 million precision-tool factory . On a smaller scale , the U.S. Government last week agreed to provide $245,000 for the planning of a nationwide power grid to integrate the electricity that seven new hydroelectric dams will provide by 1967 . In recent months , the U.S. 's American Motors , Britain 's Rootes , France 's Citron and West Germany 's Volkswagen have all signed deals to begin assembling cars in Iran , thus giving the country that ultimate symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Largesse . Such has been the progress of the Shah 's program that the U.S. Government slashed aid to Iran from $22 million to $2,900,000 last year . And , last December , President Johnson 's Cabinet Committee on Balance of Payments-which sets guidelines for the " voluntary " program limiting direct U.S. investment abroad - declared that Iran was now a " developed nation . " Far from feeling complimented , the Shah and Amir Abass Hoveida , his Prime Minister and chief economic planner , took the declaration as an affront ; it made Iran for the first time subject to the guidelines . <P> Iranians see the U.S. action as a threat to the continued influx of dollars , to the completion of their development plan , and to their foreign-exchange position . " Balance of payments simply is n't that important , " says Hoveida . " For a very small capital saving , the U.S. is badly damaging Iran 's chances to develop . " U.S. officials have privately explained to the irate Iranians that the move was aimed at big-spending American oil companies . Other U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead with plans for investment in Iran .
