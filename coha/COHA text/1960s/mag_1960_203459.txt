Zwicker , 57 , one of those people fated to remain famous for a peripheral incident in life ( he successfully defied Joe McCarthy 's badgering question : " Who promoted Peress ? " ) , will soon retire after 33 years in the uniform McCarthy said ( quite wrongly , of course ) that he was " unfit to wear .

" <P> <P> One of the least amicable borders in the world is the endlessly patrolled line between Turkey and its ancient enemy , the U.S.S.R. Thus it seemed odd to some quarters of the Arab world when Turkey 's Premier Adrian Menderes and the Soviet Union 's Nikita Khrushchev last week accepted reciprocal invitations for official visits . But then , everybody 's visiting everybody these days . Menderes will toddle up to Moscow some time in July ; Khrushchev will soar down to Ankara at a later date .
