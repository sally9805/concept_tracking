THE SUPER-AMERICANS ( 395 pp. ) - John Bainbridge-Doubleday ( $5.95 ) . <P> <P> If there still is an American Dream , the State of Texas is the American Dreamland . Here flourish the myths-of slim-hipped , soft-voiced frontiersmen and sky-eyed , sexy gals ; of boom town bragging and spaces that are Great and Open ; of easy wheeling and cool dealing that turn a fortune at the breakfast table and double it at the barbecue ; of a DC-3 on every private airstrip and His and Her Cadillacs in every garage . <P> Just how close the dream is to reality is lovingly explored in John Bainbridge 's study of Texas and the Texans , whom he dubs The Super-Americans . Bainbridge is a veteran profiler for The New Yorker ( where most of the book first appeared ) , and The Super-Americans has all the best ( and traces of the worst ) of New Yorker style-urbane detachment , smooth understatement , and relentless pyramiding of minutiae that sometimes suggests a late evening with a victim of total recall . But though The Super-Americans might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perceptive and entertaining Baedeker-in-depth . <P> Droughts &; Snakes . The Super-Americans seemed to Bainbridge highly touchy about criticism from the outside world . <P> Edna Ferber 's 1952 Texas novel , Giant , made such a searing impression on them that the evils of " ednaferberism " are still good for a diatribe from the Panhandle to the Rio Grande . Novelist Ferber gathered all the Texacana she thought she needed in a six-week visit-though , as Texans like to tell it , she merely flew across the Southwest in an airliner and sent a note to the pilot : " Please fly a little lower-I want to write a book about Texas . " Author Bainbridge moved his wife and two children from their house in Bronxville , N.Y. , to Dallas , spent nine meticulous months in traveling , researching and interviewing . <P> He found Texas no smiling paradise . Droughts make the chiggers worse ; floods bring out the rattlesnakes and copperheads ; and the blazing heat of summer keeps people close to their ubiquitous air conditioners . In fact , Texas is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-air-conditioned automobiles have to be specially ordered . " I remember one we sold to a man that hated any kind of air conditioning , " a car salesman told Bainbridge . " But his wife made him trade it in for a regular model . She had a French poodle that refused to get into an un-air-conditioned car . " <P> Pioneer Spirit . One aspect of the frontier tradition that Texans keep alive , says Bainbridge , is the cheapness of life . More people are killed in Texas traffic accidents than in any other state except California , which has about 40% higher population . Perhaps , Bainbridge suggests , it 's all the result of the old pioneer spirit . " Texans behind the wheel tend to excel by far all other Americans in aggressiveness , perhaps in this respect outclassing even the Germans . Courtesy can be expected on the splendid Texas highway system only from the lily-livered . "
