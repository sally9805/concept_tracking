Special to The New York Timcs WASHINGTON , July 26 The Senate passed a $2.06-billion authorization for economic foreign aid today -- $409-million below the Administration 's request . On a 66-to-27 vote , the battered measure was sent to cwiference negotiations with the . House . The bill authorized all aid for only one year , except aid to Latin-American countries under the Alliance for Progress . which was authorized for two years . The President had asked a fiveyear authorization for all economic programs . The House voted five years for the alliance and two years for other programs . Steel Deal Opposed The vote on final passage came as an anticlimax to a stormy session in which a majority voted 56 to 33 to denounce West Germany 's deal with Communist China for a steel-rolling mill . The Senate called tin , plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free world and to the safety of American troop . . in Vietnam . " The action followed a longny apologia . by Senator J. W. Fuldaright , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee . The Arkansas Democrat announced that after nearly 20 years he had decided he could no longt'r support a bilateral program of foreign aid that he said had hi ' - come a kind of " national private charity . " Mr , Fulbright called for " internationalization " of the aid program and said he would support an even larger outlay if it were turned over to such multilateral organizations as the United Nations or the World Bank and its affiliated institutions . Bid to Soviet . Union Senator Fulbright proposed that the United States and Rus ; in divert equivalent amounts from armaments expenditures : o an international development . ) ool and suggested that this iountry sponsor amendments to ' flake membership in the World 3ank complex more attractive o the Soviet Union , Having disposed of the iconomic aid authorization , the senate turned promptly to the , ompanion ** military Lid authorization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Foreign Relations Comaittee had cut from he Administration 's request for 917-million for military aid . he House had considered and , assed both economic and milLary aid programs in a single ! ackage and had put the millary aid under a two-year uthorization while the Senate ad provided only for the curent fiscal year . Senate dissatisfaction wit he Administration 's course in Dontinued on Page 12 , Colin/m.1 , $2 BILLION AID BILL PASSED BY SENATE //  - -   - -  -   - -  Vietnam  --  never far below the surface -- flared openly during debate of the proposal by Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr. , Democrat of Virginia , to censure the Federal Republic of Germany for its leadership of a West European consortium in financing a new steel capacity for Communist China , With Senator Fulbright taking the lead , several members from both political parties took the floor to object to mentioning Germany by name in the amendment since it was a friendly and allied power . Hoping to prevent a full scale debate Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana , the Democratic leader , offered a motion to table the amendment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides who were not familiar with the pqnding motion and , as several edplained later , voted against it until they could learn what was involved . The resulting tally of 53 to 37 Kept the Byrd proposal alive and opened the way for a full airing of views . Senator Fulbright labeled the proposal a " gratuitous insult to a sovereign nation that happens to be our . most loyal ally . " He added that the United States was the only major trading " iia ! tion not doing business with Communist China , that France and Italy were participants in the steel consortium with Germany and that there was no difference between this and Canada 's big sales of wheat to the Soviet Union . Senator Byrd 's response to this was to modify the wordI ing of his amendment to omit any mention of " the West German Government . " His change made the amendment apply to " any Government giving approval and financial backing " to a trade arrangement with Communist China . The Peking Government ' was described in the amendment as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vietcong . " Senator Thomas H. Kuchel of California , the Republican whip , . and Senator George D. Aiken , Republican of Vermont , joined Senator Fulbright in denouncing the proposal . Republican Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Clifford P. Case of New Jersey also argued against ' the censure . But Senator John 0 . Pastore , Democrat:of Rhode Island , who first brought the matter to the attention of the Senate several months ago , entered a vigorous defense of the amendment and the tide began to swing on his side of the aisle . " I 'M proud of it , " he.shouted . " I do n't want to push anybody around but I do n't want anybody to push us around either . All this amendment does is to say ' You 're hurting us with this deal '  --  and what 's wrong with that ? " The President has said , " Mr. Pastore continued , " that our purpose in Vietnam is to show North Vietnam that they can not win  --  that aggression does not pay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red China will be joyfully received in Hanoi ? When anyone does anything to jeopardize the safety of our boys in Vietnam it is our duty to point it out . " Still trying to head off a vote , Senator George S. , Democrat of South Dakota , proposed that action on the amendment be postponed indefinitely . He claimed the support of Democratic Senators Edmund S. Muskie of Maine , Gale of Wyoming , and Stephen M. Young of Ohio as well as Senators Case and Javits . But this second attempt to sidetrack the issue failed on a vote of 55 to 31 . In vain , Senator Mansfield told members that the matter was one that should be handled through diplomatic channels . Finally Sena tor Fulbright noted that Japan enjoyed the largest trade with Red China of any nation and said that " you can kick her in the teeth , too , if you want , to but I do n't think it 's very wise . " Adoption of the Byrd amendment appeared to dampen the Senate 's enthusiasm for deliberation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way in earnest , A compromise version of an amendment by Senator Robert F. Kennedy , Democrat of New York , was adopted . 74 to 17 . It called for a committee study of the aid program with four members appointed by the President , four from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and four from the House Foreign Affairs Committee , It directed the committee to report nn its investigation on a long range aid program , if any . by July 1 , 1968 . But the compromise version deleted guidelines directing the group to estimate the aid requirement for closing the gap between the rich and poor countries and the relation of United States economic . aid to the country 's gross . national product , or sum of goods and services produced . The Senate bill passed today reduced the authorization of the Foreign Relations Committee of 82.35-billion to $2.06-billion . The biggest cut in the measure was in funds for long-term development loans , which were ' left at $370-million , compared with the Administration 's request for $665.3-million .
