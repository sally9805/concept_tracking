A segregationist Mississippi law forbids Negro state colleges to hire white teachers . Last week Moses Hadas , the famed Columbia University classicist , slipped around the law without ever leaving Manhattan . Picking up the telephone , he lectured for an hour through his luxuriant white beard to 500 rapt students at four Negro colleges in Louisiana and Mississippi . His subject : the religious roots of Greek drama . The phone bill was $100 , a pittance paid by the Fund for the Advancement of Education , which thus demonstrated one of education 's cheapest , handiest new ideas . <P> " Telelectures " were pioneered at the University of Omaha , where Linguist Michel Beilis was saddled with the problem of luring big time lecturers to a distant and none-too-rich campus . Author Harry Golden , for example , set his price as " $1,500 just to lecture , $1,700 if I have to answer questions , $2,000 if I have to have cookies with the ladies . " But by phone Beilis got the Golden word from North Carolina for a cutrate $214-$64 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staged telelectures with eminences all over , from Anthropologist Margaret Mead in Manhattan to Psychologist B. F. Skinner at Harvard . <P> The technique is what telephone men call a " glorified conference call . " From any phone , operators can arrange a call involving as many as five parties at station-to-station rates . For lectures , the phone company hooks an amplifier ( $30 a month maximum ) to the phone at the audience end . A microphone hooked to the same phone allows the audience to ask questions . Innovator Beilis , who now works for A.T . &T.,; is swamped with requests by colleges from Dartmouth to U.C.L.A. that want to swap star scholars by phone . <P> Classicist Hadas spoke to Negro high school teachers in the first of 18 telelectures on " Great Ideas in Antiquity , " a credit course that uses a paperback library of classical drama ( cost : $5.70 ) . Mississippi 's Jackson State College suggested the theme ; the Fund for the Advancement of Education will spend $10,000 for the series . At Louisiana 's Southern University , students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadas even opened his mouth . Hadas considers the idea not as good as " a flesh-and-blood teacher , even a bad one . " But since even a bad Hadas is unavailable to the Louisiana and Mississippi students , Hadas ended his first talk feeling " quite elated . " <P> So did the Fund , which , to make an extra point , bounced part of the program off Telstar II and showed that telelectures could be transmitted to darkest Africa as well as the South .
