The Battle of Alabama moved off the streets and into the courts-at least for a while . <P> Of all silly things , the Birmingham school board , right in the middle of a lull in the city 's race conflict , announced that it was expelling or suspending the 1,081 Negro pupils who had been arrested during recent civil rights demonstrations . <P> The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People promptly brought a test case before U.S. District Judge Clarence W. Allgood . From the moment the hearing started , there was never any doubt about where Allgood , a Kennedy appointee in 1961 , stood . Said he : " This court was shocked to see hundreds of schoolchildren , ranging from six to 16 , running loose and without direction over the streets of Birmingham and in the business establishments . " Allgood upheld the Birmingham school board . <P> Within six hours , Negro attorneys had sued for a restraining order against the school board in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta , and Chief Judge Elbert Tuttle was hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , administered a stinging , if indirect , rebuke to Allgood . " It 's perfectly shocking to me , " said he , " to learn that any board of education , having the responsibility of educating children would think that under circumstances such as these , they could achieve the results that they were elected for by knocking out 500 student-years of study . " Tuttle reversed Allgood 's decision , and Birmingham 's Negro kids went back to their segregated schools . <P> Open &; Shut . Next day Birmingham 's segregationists got an even tougher court setback . Four members of the Alabama Supreme Court settled a fight between two contending Birmingham city governments , voted unanimously to seat recently elected Mayor Albert Boutwell , 58 , and his nine-man city council . Removed from office were incumbent segregationist Mayor Arthur Hanes and Public Safety Commissioner Theophilus Eugene ( " Bull " ) Connor , that symbol of artistry in the use of the fire hose and police dog . With Connor and his crew out of the way , Mayor Boutwell promised to " move immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the city . " <P> Would Boutwell , a segregationist who seems mild only in comparison with Hanes and Connor , be willing to talk to Negro leaders ? Replied he : " In my more than 20 years holding some type of office , my doors have always been open . " Would that policy extend to Negro Leader Martin Luther King Jr. ? In a word , said Boutwell , no.
