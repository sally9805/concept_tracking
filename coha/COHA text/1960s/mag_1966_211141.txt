A good museum director must be a clever sleuth and a keen scholar , bold but tasteful , charlatan enough to fool his competitors , discreet in his dealings , a master charmer , a canny politician , greedy , and above all , always right in his purchases . Allowing for a bit of hyperbole , Sherman E. Lee of the Cleveland Museum of Art meets most elements of that prescription . Traveling 14,000 miles a year , he metaphorizes his annual buying foray into a military campaign : " One begins with strategy , continues with tactics , ends with responses to local situations . " And , he might have added , measures his success-and ultimately that of his museum-by the trophies brought back from the battlefields of back rooms , auction houses and dealer-wheelings from Ipswich to Istanbul . <P> Elegant &; Eccentric . Last week , on the occasion of Cleveland 's 50th anniversary , Lee looked like a Caesar back from the pillage of some artistic Carthage . Presiding at a candlelit banquet for 275 guests and trustees , he displayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some $5,000,000 . For sheer size , scope-and elegant rapacity - the booty was unparalleled in U.S. museum history . <P> Among the country 's half-dozen major museums , Cleveland has long enjoyed a reputation as an aristocrat , partly because its location kept it aloof from the hurly-burly of the international art markets , partly because its purchases were often choice but eccentric , mainly because it was just plain loaded with money . Blessed throughout its existence with a string of benefactors who left it both fine collections and huge bequests , including the $33 million Leonard C. Hanna Jr . legacy , Cleveland now boasts an endowment yielding $1.3 million annually-just $100,000 under that of New York 's Metropolitan . <P> With that kind of money , the museum often second-bids the Met , as in the case of Rembrandt 's $2.3 million Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer in 1961 , frequently top-bids it . Equally important , hard cash often buys the right to a first look . Over the years , Cleveland has made remarkably astute use of its money , sometimes with the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renowned William M. Milliken , was given to weeping openly at meetings of his acquisition committees . <P> Flawless Flair . Director Lee , who joined the museum in 1952 as curator of Oriental art and took over the reins from Milliken in 1958 , uses subtler but equally effective tactics . When a Velsquez portrayal of a court jester turned up for auction in London last year , gossips cast doubt on its authenticity , reserving their admiration for Rembrandt 's Titus . Lee arranged to have the Velasquez secretly Xrayed , jetted to Madrid to compare it with other works by the Spanish master . When the hammer went down , Titus sold for $2.2 million ; Lee walked away with a rare early Velsquez for a modest $500,000.
