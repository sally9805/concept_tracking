THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN time , we suppose , we will discover what Apollo 8 means to us . Last week , we were disappointed in ourself . An extended sense of letdown , some failure of private response , persisted within us during that brilliant journey , stubbornly coexisting with our apprehension , elation , incredulity , awe , relief , and pride . Imagination , it turned out , was inadequate to this enormous and perfect adventure . The moon flight overlapped Christmas , and it was perhaps inevitable that its quick , draggy unfolding slunild have reminded us strongly of the Day itself . One by one , the exciting presents were opened and inspected  --  the shiny earth hall and the ingenious ( and slightly busted 1 little camera ; the interesting globe ; the enormous moonscape , executed in plaster of Paris and sort of after Vlaminck ; the album of home snapshots  --  each present better than the last , and each , interiorly , marching through the emotions from is to was , from delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on downhill to familiarity . Cries of surprise and joy came from us " Wow ! Look at that ! " ) , but in time it grew difficult to outexclaim ou rsel f , and we found we had begun to sustain the occasion with repeated silent reminders that the festival was still special and still happening . ( We 're at the moon . This is the day . We 're actually there . It has come at last . It 's here , and we 're actually , truly at the moon . At the 710071 . Right now . Think of that . Actually ... the ) The afternoon of the experience drew on and darkened . At dusk , knee-deep in wrapping paper and string , we began to wonder , ungratefully and rather sullenly , where we were going to find shelf space for such a treasure of discoveries and complications . We have discovered some comfort for our little shame . Friends have told us of a similar secret sense of pettiness and failed imagination . Even the Times , in an editorial that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " s , hailing a " superlative feat of human history ... that will deservedly become the subject of song , story , and pictorial art in the decades and centuries ahead , " had to confess by the third paragraph that everybody was too close to the event to get a good grab on it . Curiously , we sensed that the men who were closest of all the brave men in the spacecraft , were going through something of the same process of ill-sustained elation . Earthshine , they reported while they were in moon orbit , was " about as expected , " and the moon itself WAS , in Colonel Borman 's words , " a vast , lonely , forbidding-t3 pe expanse of nothing . " They were more at home and more cheerful , it seemed , during the interior telecasts from Apollo 8 , and so were we . This was more like it  --  a compressed " Person to Person " show from out there , which invited us to browse around the place , opening closets and examining the slipcovers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly like our own . With them , we inspected the crowded living room , the picture window , and the den , or lower hay . Here is the toothbrush . Here is the new electronic display keyboard . Over there we keep our navigating instruments , for when we wish to navigate . ( They will tell us exactly where we are and how fast we 're going . ) Here is Jim using the exerciser . ( We like to keep in shape . ) Here is how we prepare a meal of delicious orange juice , corn chowder , chicken and gravy , and sugar cookies . Watch us cut the plastic hag with our scissors , preparatory to adding hot water . Now we put the scissors away . Now we get rid of the plastic . Now we use the little napkin . Now we get rid of the napkin . Dinner is over now , and soon we may feel like taking a nap , over there on the Beta-cloth hammock . Here is a smile . Here is a Christmas wish for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass the time here , waiting for whatever new things may happen tomorrow . At Jasper Johns ' Place THE Provident Loan Society of New York has fifteen friendly offices around town . The Society once maintained a particularly impressive branch at the corner of East Houston and Essex Streets , but a few years ago this branch was closed down , and in 1967 ? signs of the times  --  it was bought by Jasper Johns , one of our more provident artists , who has since turned it into combined studio and living quarters . - Mien we heard that Mr. Johns was lending the premises one evening to the sponsors of a benefit to help pay off the accumulated debts of Merce Cunningham and Dance Company  --  like all dance companies , a somewhat improvident group of artists  --  the symbolism of the thing got to us and drew us irresistibly downtown . Not surprisingly , Mr. Johns ' purchase looks very much like a solid , medium-sized bank . It is a square , forthright two-story building , and he the time we arrived , at about nine-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacked up on East Houston as far as Katz 's Delicatessen and extending along Essex past John 's Bargain Store . Inside , over a hundred people , each of whom had paid a hundred dollars to be there , had gathered in a large , square saki , scene of former fiscal hopes and desolations. its conversion from commerce to art seemed to have been accomplished mainly by the removal of the interior furnishings . All that remained of the ancien was five old-fashioned light globes hung on braided chains from the ceiling , fifty feet high , and a pattern of imitation Greek columns at intervals around the walls . A kitchen counter ran parallel to one wall . A large blackand-white painting by Cy Twombly 24 JANUARY 4 , 19 6 9 ? and an even larger , jagged metal sculpture by John Chamberlain on top of a partition completed the &cot-.; " The Chamberlain used to be on the floor , " Mr. Johns said as he greeted us . " We had to get it out of the way , so the dancers would n't cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and get some champagne . " We did as we were told , and found ourself in a somewhat smaller , equally hare room , with paintings on the walls by Johns , Frank Stella , Robert Rauschenberg , and other new masters . A champagne bar had been set up near a staircase leading to the second floor . Corks popped , wine flowed , and wraps were taken by a pretty Indian girl in a purple sari , Looking around , we noted an absence of miniskirts and a profusion of pants suits and frilled shirts , worn with dash by members of both sexes . At about nine-forty-five , Merce Cunningham and his company of seven filed quietly down the stairs in their hare feet and began to dance around and among us . Each dancer wore colored stretch tights and a stretch top of a different color . The dancers slipped past the guests and moved into the main room , and so , after an interval , did we , ? Cunningham and his troupe were performing in the middle of the big room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films of the company performing some of the identical dance movements in a city square were being projected on two of the walls . A taped sound track of urban traffic noises , seagulls , foghorns , and various electronic effects filled the air . Jean Rigg , who works as an administrator for the Cunningham Dance Foundation , explained to us in a whisper that , thanks to the National Endowment for the Arts , which gave the Foundation thirty-five thousand dollars for the project , the film was made last fall in Ghirardelli Square , in San Francisco ; that it will he shown eventually over San Francisco 's television station KQED , and possibly over other noncommercial stations ; and that what we were seeing was a new dance , tentatively entitled " Assemblage , " which Cunningham had choreographed specially for KQED , using the dimensions and spaces of Ghirardelli Square as a guideline . Thu musical accompaniment , he said , was a taped collage of San Francisco sounds , with additional sounds that had nothing to do with San Francisco , such as snatches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it had been put together by the musicians Gordon Mumma , David Tudor , and John Cage . Midway through the performance , the dancers began to slip away , one by one , but they reappeared a few minutes later , in different costumes . The dance continued without a break , and eventually they were all hack , wearing what looked like jogging suits , in pastel colors . The dancing became more athletic and playful . There was a good deal of racing about and comradely contact . At one point , the whole compam formed an interlocking group and moved laboriously across the room , taking elaborate pains over the placement of their feet . Miss Rigg explained to us that in San Francisco this had been in the nature of a game , in which they were allowed to step on the pavement bricks but not on the lines in between , The performance lasted about forty minutes , and the audience , though moderately perplexed at times , seemed in general to he well pleased . The modern-art collector Victor Ganz , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been nice to be so close to the dancers and yet not to have to participate in the performance . Barbara ( Mrs. Eugene ) Schwartz , who had helped to organize the benefit and had given a dinner party beforehand , said it was a pleasant surprise to see so many people on their feet , what with the flu epidemic . As we were leaving , we asked Judith Blinken , the director of development . for the Cunningham Dance Foundation , how the evening had worked out financially . She gave us a radiant smile . " We cleared twelve thousand dollars , " she said . " This wipes out our overdraft at the bank and gives us a Start on the debts from our South American tour last summer . We 're planning another benefit , at the Electric Circus , and  --  who knows  --  by spring we may even he free and clear . " St. Regis Spectacular " P ROFESSOR BALER 'S going to show I us a volcano , " Dr. Shannon McCune , the director of the American Geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktail hour that preceded the Society 's annual dinner , on the St. Regis Roof , and he obligingly introduced us to the speaker of the evening  --  Paul S. Bauer , an enormous , owl-faced man in a white tie , whose boiled shirt was decorated with a rib-honed blue-and-white cross . " Order of THE NEW YORKER 25 the Falcon of Iceland , commander rank , " he said , following our gaze . " Given to me two years ago by the President of Iceland , who is head of the Order . I was born in Lynn , Massachusetts , and I inherited a **35;3475;TOOLONG business there from my father . I went to Andover , and then to Harvard , where I spent eight years without getting a Ph.D . I 'm a retired captain in the Navy , and I used to he Adjunct Professor of Earth Sciences at the American University , in Washington , D.C. I 'm six feet three and a half and sixty-four years of age . Tonight , I 'm going to talk about Surtsey , the new volcanic island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on November 14 , 1963 , off the southern coast of Iceland . A new hunk of territory that did n't exist six years ago ! Since it came up out of the water , I 've visited it twenty times , taking pictures from a boat , from a helicopter , and in situ . I 'm an honorary founding member of the Surtsey Research Society . We 've had a hundred and six scientists studying various things on Surtsey . What will the succession of life there be ? VVe have a laboratory on it named Palshacr , after me ' Paul 's house , ' in Icelandic . " We asked Professor Bader if he had a copy of his speech , and he waved three or four small pieces of paper that seemed to have notes jotted on them . " I never write a speech , " he said . " I 'm going to show slides and a movie , and comment on them . " Dinner found us seated between Mrs. Russell Gurnee and Mr. Howard Van Zandt . " My husband has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explorers Club , " Mrs. Gurnee said . " We 're spel cola-gists . We 've explored caves in Puerto Rico for the National Geographic Society , and we 've been to Ecuador , Venezuela , and El Salvador . We 've probed Floy d Collins ' Cry still Cave , in Kentucky , which is fifty-three miles long . " " I 'm in my twenty-third year in Japan , where I represent the International Telephone &; Telegraph Corporation , " Mr. Van Zandt said . " I came here this week for some company conferences . I was horn near Chicago and spent five years in my teens in japan , where my father was chief engineer of the Japan Cement Company . I 've written a honk called ' Little Known Facts About Japanese and Americans . ' I live in Tokyo , and I 've visited all forty-six prefectures of Japan . Except for the chi ones , they 're all beautiful . " Distinguished guests at the dais table were presented by Dr. Serge A. Korff , the Society 's president ; five medals were awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surtsey . His pictures , in color , showed some of the submarine volcanic activity that spewed up lava , from a depth of four hundred and twenty-five feet , over a period of three and a half years , accompanied by lightning storms and explosions of lava bombs ; the lava was turned into cinder by-the sea , and then into black sand . When the last lava iltort , stopped , in June , 1967 , the island was nearly two miles square . " Iceland is nature 's laboratory , " Professor Batter said when we congratulated him on his spectacular offering . " Its people are multilingual . All high-school graduates have learned English , Danish , and either French or German . I sell the film to schools and universities for three hundred dollars a copy . If I can average a hundred sales a year for the next ten years , I 'll he on Easy Street . " Producer THE other day , we met Mag Bodard , the producer of " The Umbrellas of Cherbourg , " " The Young Girls of Rochefort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " Benjamin , " all of which have comforted us in recent years in the art houses around town . Mag Bodard is a woman  --  the only successful female producer of movies in France , or , probably ' , anywhere else . She does n't look a hit like L. B. Mayer . She is a petite , wistful-appearing , red-haired woman of about fifty , and she has it small , thin face with wide eyes . " Please outline for us , from the very heginning , how y. nu managed to become a producer of movies , " we said after shaking hands with Mine . Bodard at her digs , in the Hotel Regency . " I am actually Italian , " she began . " I was horn in Turin , where my father had a vineyard . " " Red wine or white wine ? " we asked . " Red wine , " Mine . Bodard said . " In the north of Italy , there is mostly lad wine . I had no sugar as a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still like to eat meat and wine . My name was Margherita Perato . When I was five years old , my aunt , whose husband was French , and who had no children of her own , took me to live in Paris . I learned to read and write in French , and I took all my schooling in Paris , at the Institution Maintenon . I have a younger brother and sister , and they , too , went to France to school , because my parents thought we would find better educational opportunities in France . We went home to Turin during the summer months . " " Did n't your parents miss you when you were away ? " we asked . " Not really , " Mme. Bodard said , and gave a kind of detached laugh . " After school ? " we asked . " I began to paint . Portraits , " she said . " Do you still paint ? " we asked . " Never , " she replied . " I painted for about a year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my life , I do not like to go back . / go on to something new . " She gave us that laugh again . " After painting ? " we asked . " I attended a private atelier to study interior decorating , " she said . " Then I met my husband  --  Lucien Bodard , the journalist . We were married for about twenty-five years , and then we became divorced , but we are still very good friends . When the Second World War started , my husband went to England . I stayed in Paris throughout the war . I designed fashions , mostly for small houses . Thr only big house I designed for was Lucien Lelong . " " Did you work for the underground during the Occupation ? " we asked . " I did what was normal in my circle , " Mme. Bodard said . " What was that ? " we asked . " Hid people who had to be hidden , passed letters that had to be passed , " she said . " And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for the Agence France-Presse , " she said . " He had been born in China , because his father was in the diplomatic service there , and he speaks Chinese as well as he speaks French . Eventually , he went to Indo-China for France-Soir , and I travelled with him . We had a small apartment in Saigon , in the center of the city . We were the only married journalistic couple in Saigon in those years  --  I 948 to 1955 ? and so we received all the other journalists at home . Then I started writing articles for France-So ; r and , later , for Elle . About everyday life in Saigon  --  how the women lived , how life went on . The articles were collected , and they made a book . The book was published in France at the time of Dien Bien Phu , the final battle . So the book was very successful . " " What was the title of the hook ? " we asked . " ' C'est Aussi Comme " Mine . Bodard replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for one year in Hong Kong , " she said . " Then I became sick , as a result of Indo-China . With malaria . With amoebic infections . With everything that was normal for people who lived in Indo-China . I returned to Paris . I wanted to do something new . Something that would be closest to my sensibility . " " Why did n't you go hack to decorating or designing ? " " I do n't know why . My life changes continuously . I finish with one thing , I go on to another . I do n't know how to go back . " " Well , what was the something new ? " we asked . " Television , " Mine . Bodard said , and she gave us another of her laughs . " I felt we were in a new world now , and I felt that it would he easier to reach the new world through pictures than through words . In Hong Kong , all the foreign newspapers had what France-Soir had and still has : the bodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long captions under cartoons . The stories were told in such a way that anybody could follow them . So I had the idea of bringing a kind of bandes drssinies to television , in the form of a special movie . " " What happened to the idea ? " we asked . " Nothing , " Mme. Bodard said . " I did n't do it , because it was impossible . In France , we had only one channel , and it was government-owned . There were very few hours of programs . " " Well , what did you try to do with the idea ? " we asked . " As always , when I have an idea ; I start telling it to everybody . To everybody . tont h- 771011dt% And I do n't abandon it until everybody says no . " " And everybody said no ? " " Correct . So I have never made anything for television . Now , perhaps , now I may finally do something for television . " " But what did you do when you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make movies , " Mme. Bodard replied . " I formed my own company  --  Parc Film . Because I live near the Parc Monceau . " Again , that laugh . " I had a very good script , which had been written by two friends . I felt it would make a very good , a very strong movie . " " What made you think that you could simply go right out and he a producer of movies with just a script ? " we asked . " Because if somebody wants to do something it is always possible to do it , " Mme. Bodard answered . " Well , " we said , " what hap-pened ? " " I brought the script to all the major French companies , and they all said no , " Mme. Bodard continued . " I brought it to Pathe , and they told me my idea was an excellent idea , and that I must find a gond director . So I found a good young director , Jacques Deray , who had made two movies . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they told me I must take a director of their choosing  --  one who had just had a commercial success . I was inexperienced , and so I did what they said . And it was horrible . The director they chose changed everything in the script . I was so ashamed of this film . It was so far from what I had wanted . From then on , I decided to do only what I liked and only what I wanted , and to do it alone . " " And how in the world did you get financing for a movie , with an attitude like that ? " we asked . " The work of a producer is the work of a promoter , " Mme. Bodard said . " It is very hard work . And you have to believe in what you are doing . My attitude is : I want to do this film . I will guarantee the budget . I do not ask to be paid anything , because I want to keep the budget low . I ask only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of whether it will make money . I think only of whether it is of interest to me . " " Yes , but how did you do it ? " we asked . " In 1962 , Jacques Demy , the director , showed me the script he had written for ' Les Parapluies de Cherbourg , ' " she replied . " I liked it so much ! I went to all the companies and tried to find the money . My faith grew stronger as I worked and as I heard Michel Leg-rand sing and play his music for the film . But everybody said Mag Bodard is very crazy . ' Everybody in the business told me I could not win with this film . Finally , " But I did n't say we had won the hearts and minds of the people . I said we were well on our way to winning them . " ? ? Andre Hakim , at Twentieth Century-Fox , said he would help me . He agreed to put up one-fourth of the money  --  thirty million francs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beta , distributors of films , I got another sixty thousand . From the Cinema Center , I obtained still another sixty thousand . The Cinema Center is something we have only in France . Everybody who makes films belongs to it , and producers give the Center a prorated percentage of the profits from their films . The Cinema Center then gives advances to filmmakers who meet their requirements . " " And the last sixty thousand ? " we asked . " From me , " Mint . Bedard replied . " I put my own money in , and money borrowed from friends . Then I decided if I did not win , I would go to the U.S.A. and become a governess for children . I found out all about how to place an advertisement for a position of governess and how to come to the United States to do such work . " " Why a governess ? " we asked . " Because it seemed to be the simplest kind of job for which you need no special training , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we said . " No . ' Les Parapluies de Cherbourg ' won . It was a very big success in France , in the United States , in Spain , in Japan , in South Africa  --  all over the world . Even the Soviet Union paid about twenty thousand dollars for this film to show it . Only in Italy , in Germany , and in the Scandinavian countries it was not a success . " " What was your second film ? " " The next year , 1964 , it was ' Le Bonheur , ' by Agnis Varda , who is the wife of Jacques Demy . For me , this film was very , very important . It was a film made by a woman , and it is exactly what goes on inside the head of every woman , except that she does n't realize it . " " How many movies have you made altogether ? " " Eighteen  --  in the past six years . I know everybody now . And I have many of the good young new direc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Bresson , , Jean-Luc Godard , Alain Resnais , Christian-Paul Arrighi . I have just finished three films for Paramount . It was very difficult to produce three films at once , but I wanted to do it , so that I would have greater freedom now to do exactly what I want . For me , producing movies is some-thing I will not say goodbye to . I like it because the work is artistic . I like finding new talent and encouraging young people . Also , the work permits me to he independent . Also , I like it because it is dangerous . Now I have confidence in myself , but each time I start a new film , it is like taking an examination at school . " " Any other reason you like being a producer of movies ? " we asked . " It allows me to have a lot of people around me . Parc Film employs about thirty people . I like to give those people the certainty that they will always have work . " " Do you have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and to do it you must be strong . Strong . "
