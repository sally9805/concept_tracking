THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO by Ann Radcliffe . 672 pages . Oxford . $8 . <P> " Rather little wool for a very great cry . " George Saintsbury 's epigram was Ann Radcliffe 's epitaph ; for more than a century her quaint gothic masterpiece has been buried among bookworms . Yet for half a century before that , from 1794 until the triumph of Dickens and Thackeray , The Mysteries of Udolpho was an international bestseller , acclaimed by Coleridge as " the most interesting novel in the English language . " It enchanted Keats , who under its influence wrote The Eve of St. Agnes ; it electrified Byron , who stole its hero and called him Childe Harold ; it directly inspired Sir Walter Scott to produce his greatest works , the Waverly novels . And even today Udolpho commands deference as the first successful thriller in the language and the proximate cause of the grand tradition of the grotesque that runs through Anglo-American letters from Wuthering Heights to Yoknapatawpha County . Reason enough to exhume the hoary old horror and reissue its haunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game of suspense , Mistress Radcliffe can tease with the best of them , and in the art of natural description she can pile a crag or plummet a chasm with any man short of Scott himself . True , the dear lady is one of the ickiest prigs who ever put quill to scented paper . Yet if in 1794 her virginal vaporings came on as symptoms of high sensibility , in 1966 they come off as conventions of high comedy . All unintentionally , Udolpho is one of the funniest books ever written , a travesty of the romantic ethos that reads at times like a collection of exquisitely sappy subtitles from an old Pearl White picture . <P> A Maiden Fair . The story takes place Far Away ( south of France , north of Italy ) and Long Ago ( end of the 16th century ) . The heroine , a young Frenchwoman Of Gentle Birth named Emily St. Aubert , is a Damsel In Distress-Alone In the Cold Cruel World with only her Lofty Principles to guide her . She is beautiful and dutiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpeting permits , seeks refuge from the " vices of the world " in the " beauties of nature and the nicer emotions of the mind . " She sketches , plays the lute , offers helpful hints to harried humans ( " Though splendour may grace happiness , virtue only can bestow it " ) , and produces Poetry with alarming regularity : <P> Ah , merry swain , who laugh 'd among the vales , And with your gay pipe made the mountains ring , Why leave your cot , your woods and thymy gales , And friends belov 'd , for aught that wealth can bring ? <P> Alas , Emily is in love with somebody almost as saccharine as herself : a Noble Youth endowed with " manly frankness , simplicity , and keen susceptibility to the grandeur of nature . " His name is Valancourt , and his idea of passionate lovemaking is to beseech , if Emily thinks him " not unworthy such honour , " whether he " might be permitted sometimes to enquire after your health . " She , almost fainting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my esteem . " He : " O Emily ! this moment is the most sacred of my life ! "
