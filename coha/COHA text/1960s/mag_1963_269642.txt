Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman picked up his phone , heard President Kennedy ask coldly : " What happened ? " Freeman gave an honest answer : " I do n't know . " <P> What Freeman did know was that more than a million wheat farmers had gone to the polls and , in a vote that may well shape the future of U.S. agriculture , overwhelmingly turned down his plan for high Government supports and strict production controls . <P> In 22 previous years , wheat farmers had voted on similar but milder plans ; each time they said yes by at least the two-thirds majority required for approval . But the margins had steadily dwindled , and Freeman had long known he was in for a real fight this year . He and his sprawling Agriculture Department campaigned tirelessly , told farmers that their choice was between $1 wheat and $2 wheat . Freeman 's major antagonist was the big American Farm Bureau Federation and its president , Charles Shuman . The Farm Bureau 's slogan : " Freedom v. Freeman . " <P> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular election-night headquarters , expected to chart the ebb and flow of the vote late into the night . But by 7 p.m. , Room 6768 in the department 's main Washington building was a glum place . Far from giving Freeman 's plan the necessary two-thirds , farmers refused it even a simple majority . The final vote was 547,151 for , 597,776 against ( see box on following page ) . <P> For Flexibility . Only six states gave the Freeman program a two-thirds majority . One was Maine , where a mere 32 farmers cast ballots . The other five were all in the South : Georgia , Kentucky , North Carolina , South Carolina and Tennessee . In none of these states is wheat nearly as important as cotton and tobacco . Both of these crops have long operated under high-support , strict-control programs , and Southern farmers have become so fond of the supports they will accept almost all controls . <P> Outside the South , the vote against Freeman 's program cut across all regional lines . Of the nation 's top wheat-producing states-Kansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 65.8% in favor , even came close to giving Freeman a two-thirds majority . Among the so-called corn-belt states , those west of the Mississippi tended to favor the Freeman program , although not by two-thirds . In these states - Iowa , Missouri , South Dakota , Minnesota and Nebraska-the price of corn often follows the price of wheat . Many farmers plainly feared that lower wheat prices would pull down corn prices . <P> The eastern corn-belt states were still another story . Michigan , Ohio . Illinois and Indiana cast about 300,000 votes , or one-fourth of the national total , and in each state the returns went lopsidedly against Freeman 's proposals . In these states , the secret to successful farming is flexibility . Farmers there like to shift from crop to crop-mainly wheat , corn and soybeans-as prices and supply conditions change . But under Freeman 's plan , a farmer 's past wheat production would determine his marketing quota ; farmers were apprehensive that establishing this wheat " history " would lock them into wheat production at the cost of flexibility .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
