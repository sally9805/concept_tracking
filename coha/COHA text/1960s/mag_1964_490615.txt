Notes and Comment HIS seems to be an era of gratui-THI inventions and negative im-provements . Consider the beer can . It was beautiful  --  as beautiful as the clothespin , as inevitable as the wine bottle , as dignified and reassuring as the fire hydrant . A tranquil cylinder of de-lightfully resonant metal , it could be opened in an instant , requiring only the application of a handy gadget freely dispensed by every grocer . Who can forget the small , symmetrical thrill of those two triangular punctures , the dainty pfiff , the little crest of suds that foamed eagerly in the exultation of release ? Now we are given , instead , a top beetling with an ugly , shmon-shaped " tab , " which , after fiercely resisting the tugging , bleeding fingers of the thirsty man , threatens his lips with a dangerous and hideous hole . However , we have discovered a way to thwart Progress , usually so unthwartable . Turn the beer can upszde down and open the bottom . The bottom is still the way the top used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unsettling jolt , and the sight of a consistently inverted beer can makes some people edgy , not to say queasy . But the latter difficulty could be cleared up if manufacturers would design cans that looked the same whichever end was up , like playing cards . Now , that would he Progress . Termites TALK of windfalls ! Thanks to Dr. Alfred E. Emerson , professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Chicago and one of the nation 's leading authorities on termites , the Museum of Natural History has just been made richer by a million of these destructive isoptera  --  enough to demolish the whole Museum but , as luck would have it , all safely pickled in alcohol  --  and we have just been made richer by a talk with the donor . This took place in the office of Dr. Jerome G. Rozen , Jr. , chairman of the Museum 's department of entomology and associate curator of hymenoptera . Hymenoptera are bees , wasps , ants , sawflies , and the like ; the termite , often called a white ant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum has no isopterous curators . Dr. Rozen told us that the Emerson gift has swelled the Museum 's insect total to thirteen million . Dr. Emerson observed that the smallest of his specimens is a mere three millimetres long , while the largest is a hundred and one millimetres. long and thirty-one millimetres wide  --  approximately four inches by an inch and a quarter . " An unusually large queen from the Congo , " he explained . " Termites run to several castes , including kings and queens , workers , and soldiers . I 've collected them all over the tropics , where they abound . Some eighteen hundred living and fossil species have been identified , of which I 've obtained around sixteen hundred . Only one species is known to exist in the New York area . " Dr. Emerson , who hails from Ithaca , where his father was professor of archeology at Cornell , became termite-oriented in 1919 , when he visited the New York Zoological Society 's Tropical Research Center , in British Guiana , with the late William Beebe. " 14Iy sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ina , was lunching with Dr. Beebe , who told her he was about to go to British Guiana , " he said . " I 'd graduated from Cornell the year before and was just getting demobilized from the Army at Fort Meade , and she said to him , ' I have a kid brother who 'd love to go along on a trip like that . Why do n't you let him join you ? ' Beebe said O.K. , if my family would pay the passage , and she wrote me a letter , but I did n't get it . The first thing I got was a wire from her , saying ' Why do n't you answer ? Passage engaged . ' I wired back ' Will go . Where am I going ? ' and within a couple of months I was on a ship headed south . Beebe showed me a nest of Guianan termites , and I was launched . I went back to the Center twice , and became assistant director there . I 'd studied at Cornell under J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and worked with old John H. Comstock , its previous head , but I had intended to go into psychology , rather than insects , until Beebe turned my thoughts to termites . Social insects  --  ants , termites , and a minority of bees and wasps , most of which are solitary have fas-cinated me ever since ; I wrote the article about them in the Encyclopxdia Britannica . " Dr. E. went on to say that some groups of termites have a complex organization in which an adult worker caste takes charge of nest building and trophallaxis , or mutual feeding , and in which soldiers are specialized for protection and kings and queens for reproduction . " Termite mounds are up to thirty feet high , " he said . " Some queens lay eight thousand eggs a day continuously for many years . " the sociality of termites shows certain parallels with human life ; study of it has led me into social fields , and even into religion . The vast majority of termites soldiers and workers ? are sterile : a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life process is significant . Death is just as natural as birth , though most of us do n't like to think so . It would he a catastrophe if we all lived forever . The whole question of teleology and purposiveness is reflected in termites . " ?

" Town House Revisited THE Radcliffe Club of New York , to benefit its scholarship fund , ran one of those art tours of local stately homes the other weekend , and we stopped by while the Climes and their supporters were exclaiming over the town house of the John Hay Whitncys , on East Sixty-third Street . We had a double reason for calling at the ) , Vhit-neys ' ; one was that it seemed especially gallant of Jock Whitney , a true-blue Yale man , to he opening his door to Harvard 's sisters , and the other was that several years ago , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by the owners ' decorator , Mimi Rand , who told us that when it was finished there would be a storage bench in the front foyer , because Mr. Whitney had begged for a handy place to keep ice skates and galoshes . You never know what 's going to happen to people 's dreams about their own houses , and we wanted to see if his modest wish had been granted . On revisiting the house , we were pleased to spot a utilitarian white-painted wooden storage bench , with three compartments , just inside the front door , but as we reached toward one of the compartments , we were stopped by a stern , do-not-touch glance from a Pinkerton man guarding the entrance . A pert blond woman with a name tag identifying her as Mrs. Cranston Jones diverted us by calling our attention to a couple of cardboard ice buckets that were serving as umbrella stands . " When the weather looked had this morning , we got these from an ice company , " said Mrs. Jones , who proved to be the chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather good-looking . We also got some paper garbage bags for overshoes . We thought of that once before , when we had the Harriman house . " We looked over at the Pinkerton man , who was watching us . " He 's the Whitncys ' , " Mrs. Jones said . " We used to get private detectives ourselves , but we 've found in eleven years of these tours that husbands do just as good a job . We have two of them stationed downstairs now . " She remarked that her own husband a Harvard man , we later learned was n't on duty at the moment . " But over the years he 's been quite helpful , " she added . " He 's become very good at operating elevators . " We followed Mrs. Jones into a stairwell hall , its walls sheathed in a rich red material she described as velvet flock  --  a handsome background fur the paintings on display . A woman without a name tag came up , and Mrs. Jones presented her as Mrs. Esther Clement , Mrs. Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Smoking ' signs , " Mrs. Clement said to Mrs. Jones . " I told Mrs. Whitney I was sure you would n't allow smoking . That 's one reason we removed all the ashtrays . Also , people have a way of  --  ah -- -nudging little things . " " Oh , we do n't even let them sit down , " said Mrs. Jones reassuringly . " All your people are so quiet , " Mrs. Clement said . " It 's a very discreet audience , " said Mrs. J. " I wish Mrs. Whitney could see it , " said Mrs. C. " It would relieve her mind great-ly , , Leaving the two ladies , we began our tour of the premises  --  of the few rooms , at any rate , that were not closed off . At the bottom of the stairwell , we stopped before a couple of Rembrandts and a dashing John Singer Sargent portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson . Then we moved into a panelled library containing two Picassos , a Monet , and several photographs of Dwight 1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runners that had been laid protectively over the library carpet . A man who looked much too distinguished to be a mere Radcliffe husband , and who turned out to be the Whitneys ' ! littler , William , was in there , too . He was talking to Mrs. Isabel Hill , Mr. Whitney 's secretary . We joined them , and two touring women nudged all three of us as they strove for a closer look at a garden beyond a picture window . " I tried to find out how many were coming , but they never told me , " Mrs. Hill said . She excused herself to sneak into the kitchen for a smoke , and we entered the dining room , where a feast of French Impressionists awaited Os . A man and a woman had Mrs. Jones backed against a Cezanne . They wanted to know where the Whitneys were . " In the country , naturally , " said Mrs. Jones . " We do n't tell the owners they ca n't be present , but most of them would rather not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing en route a spectacular stairwell gallery that ran the gamut from Michelangelo to Wyeth , with stops in between for R uhens , William Blake , and Walt Kuhn . The only upstairs chamber open to traffic was a spacious , bright , and elegant drawing room , with crystal chandeliers . " It 's a cozy room , " a woman was saying to a man alongside a Seurat . " Fantastic , " said her escort . " Beautiful , " she countered . " Gorgeous , " he came hack . " Exquisite , thrilling ! " she cried . " Yes , " he said , letting her win . They stepped back to admire the Seurat ? " L'Ile de la Grande Jatte " ? and she nearly came a cropper over a length of buckling plastic runner . A hovering Radcliffe Club lady dropped to her knees and wrestled the plastic into suhmissinn . We moved back downstairs , and in the foyer , while the Pinkerton man was momentarily distracted , we peeked into all three storage compartments . They were empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd mitten in the lot of them . The Whitney 's ' butler materialized quietly , and we explained that we were just wondering where the household skates and galoshes were kept . Driving Problem AFRIEND of ours has told us of a taxi ride he took the other day . The driver was going uptown at frantic speed , and our friend , as is his custom , told him that he would be tipped twice as much if he would go half as fast . The driver turned around , glared , and said , " What do you want me to do when I got Napoleon in front of me , Brutus to my right , and Octavius on my left ? " Our friend suffered in silence for the duration of the journey . Father ALOW , persistent susurrus of the type that heralds major avant-garde events in this city lured us to the Hunter College Playhouse one evening last week to attend a " lecture-recital " by the young West German experimental composer Karlheinz Stockhausen . The lecture , although it was somewhat forbiddingly titled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments , " proved easy to spot at the East Side Airlines Terminal , being tall , solidly built , fair-haired , and given to corduroy clothing with impressively wide wales . It struck us that , despite a moderate chin stubble , he looked far too young to be a global father . " I have n't shaved today , because the plug of my machine wo n't fit your sockets , " he explained , in fluent , lightly accented English . " Of course , I should know about such things . I have been here twice before  --  the first time in 1958 , when I gave thirty-two lectures on electronic music in six weeks . Fantastic ! And then I spent six months here last year , but that was very secluded . I stayed in a private house on Long Island and composed the whole time  --  no lectures or concerts . Excuse me while I weigh in . " David Tudor , the pianist , and Max Neuhaus and Christoph Caskel , percussionists , who had performed with Stockhausen at Hunter and who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , and Stockhausen doled out tickets and typewritten itineraries to each of them and oversaw the weighing of their baggage , which , miraculously , was within the weight limit . Stockhausen explained that twelve hundred pounds of percussion instruments had gone on ahead , and that he was counting on the concert authorities in each city to furnish the necessary electronic equipment . Once aboard the airline bus , Herr Stockhausen quickly set us straight on his relationship to music made without instruments . Although he is widely known for his pioneering in the use of electronically generated sounds , he also does a great deal of composing for instruments . During his Long Island sojourn last year , in fact , he composed a large work for three full orchestras , and an even larger choral work for four choirs and four orchestras  --  all playing at the same time , under four conductors . The musical concepts involved were too vast for our comprehension , so we brought the conversation around to the concert at Hunter . Had the reception of his work here surprised him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even architects  --  some of them famous names I have known since years but never met came to the concert and to the party afterward , at the home of Judith Blinken , that angel . I talked with Edgard Varese , Frederick Kiesler , John Cage , Leonard Bernstein  --  with people from France , Italy , Japan , everywhere ! You know , before the recital Norman Singer , who runs the concert bureau at Hunter College , was afraid that no one would come . Now he says so many people were turned away we may have to give another concert in the spring . And there is talk of concerts elsewhere in the city . It 's really something phenomenal , considering that the reaction to my music in Germany is as violently hostile as ever . Last year , for example , when I conducted my Momente ' in Cologne , the audience made so much noise I just gave up stopped the performance . After about five minutes , I started again , and went through to the end , although they were yelling so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always that way . " We asked about Stockhausen 's background and musical training , and he obliged with these details : A country boy , raised near Cologne , he began studying piano when he was six , devoted a year to intensive study when he was twenty , and then completed the rigorous four-year music course at the State Music High School in Cologne . During his year of intensive study , he supported himself by serving as an accompanist for a touring magician ( " I improvised on the piano , and distracted the audience at crucial moments " ) ; while he was at the State Music High School , he supported himself by playing jazz in Cologne bars . He had his eyes opened to modern composition in 1957 by a score of Anton Webern 's , studied in Paris with Olivier Messiaen , worked with magnetic tape in the Paris studio of Pierre Schaefss , fer , the inventor of tnusique con- er  --  te , and returned to Cologne to join , as resident composer , the studio for electronic music at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic director . Although Stockhausen is recognized internationally as a leader of the postwar musical revolution brought on by the development of magnetic tape and electronic manipulation of sound , he is , as he indicated , a far more controversial figure in West Germany than he is in New York . Did he have any theory to explain this ? He did . " In foreign countries , the people are always more objective , " he said . " It is harder for me in West Germany because so many people are against me on grounds that have nothing to do with the music , just as in America people are probably less objective about your composers . So perhaps when I travel here , giving concerts and talking about American composers , it will help them , do n't you think ? In any case , it is a kind of measurement that is important , to go out from your own country to places where you are judged as to the music and nothing else . Actually , we are making not just one tour this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , we go out again  --  as far as Texas  --  and then in May we give five concerts in Ohio , and in between I will teach some classes at the University of Pennsylvania . Ah , the airport already . " Disembarking , we said goodbye to Stockhausen and his colleagues , and wished them good luck . He wished us good luck . As we saw him off , the huge roar of two jet engines warming up suddenly sounded like music . ? NOTICE on a postcard received by one of our neighbors the other day " Sidney Wellons ( Formerly with Internal Revenue ) Announces the Opening of the Tax Season . " Phantom City FORyears , in the course of trips to central New Jersey and beyond , we 've found our attention caught by the Humble Oil &; Refining Co. ' s Bay-way Refinery , which straddles the New Jersey Turnpike at Linden , a few miles southwest of Newark Airport . Being consistently malodorous , and frequently surrounded by a miasma of smog , the refinery can hardly he called prepossessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its tanks and towers ( though not the tanks and towers themselves ) are made visible by a great number of small electric lights attached to them , it takes on the appearance of a city rising out of the surrounding meadows  --  and a triumphant city at that , since there are often plumes of fire flaring from the tallest towers , as if in announcement of some industrial equivalent of the victory-at Marathon . On our most recent jaunt to Jersey , we stopped and visited Bay-way , and discovered that in a sense it is a city , though one whose population has been declining lately at a rate that any municipal government would find alarming . It was opened in 1909 , it is now the largest oil refinery in the Greater New York area and the eleventh-largest in the United States , and it is equipped to process a hundred and seventy thousand barrels of crude oil a day . All this crude oil arrives by tanker from either the Gulf Coast or Venezuela , and about half of Bayway 's output is automobile gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and petrochemicals . As for population , ten years ago Bayway had forty-eight hundred employees , all told ; today , with approximately the same output of oil products , it has eighteen hundred , or hardly more than one per acre . The reduction has been brought about by better organization , the introduction of more advanced instrumentation , and the use of computers , the chief of these being an IBM 7080 , which keeps accounts , solves engineering problems , and figures out production schedules . kI7e , learned all this , and more , from an old Bayway hand named Arba S. Taylor , who has been working there for a quarter of a century . Mr. Taylor met us in the reception area of the administration center , a low-slung brick building , and as we followed him down a long corridor , we noticed through open doors one empty office after another . " The building was designed , eight years ago , for four hundred and twenty-five people , and now there are only three hundred of us in it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts in employment , in either staff or line work . The whole place is pretty well down to rock bottom . " Once we had reached Taylor 's office , we asked him to explain the functions of the pieces of equipment that are so luminously visible from the Turnpike . " The tall cylinders  --  most of them painted in various pastel colors , as you may have noticed  --  are pipe stills , catalytic-cracking units , and fractionating towers , " he replied . " The pipe stills initially prepare crude oil for further treatment . The job of the catalytic-cracking units  --  or , rather , of the one cat-cracker unit we have in service at present  --  is essentially to divide oil into its gasoline-oil and heating-oil components , and the fractionating towers , which are those real high ones , do a further job of refinement . It takes four men , working in shifts , to run the cat-cracker unit on a round-the-clock basis . " The units are lighted so spectacularly at night , Mr. Taylor continued , to enable the crewmen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodic inspection rounds . As for the flares , they arc to burn up gas that is escaping from a malfunctioning unit . When everything is working right , each tower should have only a small pilot flame on top ; a wild , heraldic flame means there 's a leak somewhere . Mr. Taylor , having equipped himself and us with goggles and metal hats as protection against flying sparks and debris , took us on a tour of the refinery in his car . Passing between pipe stills and fractionating towers on paved streets with names like Central Avenue and Refinery Avenue , we saw here and there , presumably one to an acre , a lonely , not yet automated figure , and we noticed a point of resemblance between the refinery and a city that we had n't known about before : the many small pipes connecting the units
