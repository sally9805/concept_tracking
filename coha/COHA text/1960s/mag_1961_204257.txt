In the offices of each of 29 Binghamton , N.Y. , general practitioners last week sat a high school student . As patients came in , the doctors asked them ( provided that the situation would be neither embarrassing nor unethical ) whether they would object to the student 's staying . Most did not . During the week , 57 students from the town 's four high schools spent a morning in a G.P. 's office , gulped lunch with the doctor , walked hospital corridors on visits to his patients , went home to dinner with him-and got a chance to observe how much his supposedly free time was interrupted by patients on the phone . <P> The occasion was a pilot demonstration of what the American Academy of General Practice calls Project MORE . The name , no acronym , reflects the academy 's urge to recruit more premedical students and thus aid in the production of more doctors , especially G.P.s . Even sharper than the threat of an overall shortage of doctors in the U.S. is the growing scarcity of " family doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into specialty training . The ratio of family doctors ( including some specialists , notably internists , but mostly general practitioners ) has dropped from one to 1,100 population in 1941 to one for an estimated 1,700 population today . This is the A.A.G.P. 's concern . <P> Its Binghamton branch , under the leadership of Dr. Raymond S. McKeeby , 49 , a former flight surgeon , passed the word on Project MORE through the high schools , got hundreds of students to sign up for skull sessions on doctoring as a profession . From the most interested and promising , the doctors chose the 57 who went through last week 's preceptorship program . From the Binghamton experience , and a similar pilot operation in Omaha , the A.A.G.P. will draw final plans for a nationwide Project MORE next year through all its 50 state chapters . <P> Said Dr. McKeeby : " We need direct , personal , one-to-one interest by the doctor in the student to stimulate young people to go into medicine . Then we must follow through . Medical school is a long pull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " A fellow also needs money . As a starter , the academy offered a $1,000 scholarship in Binghamton and another in Omaha .
