txt The Supreme Court held unconstitutional today a Federal statute depriving naturalized Americans of their citizenship if they returned to the land of their birth for three years . The vote was 5 to 3 . Justice William 0 . Douglas , writing for the majority , said the statute had created a " second-class citizenship " for the naturalized instead of putting them on an equal footing with the nativeborn , as the Constitution re , quires . The decision will have immediate and widespread effects . ) % ' 12t.s 'Ve - . S.v6 ) 3211Mlesk. ? s -- timated that up to 40,000 persons had been deprived of American citizenship because lof the three-year rule . All those persons are in effect made Americans by the Court 's ruling . They tan estaolish their citizenship by applying at American consulates abroad for passports . Most of them , officials said , reside in Italy and Germany . Court Splits , 4 to 4 In another case today the Supreme Court divided equally , 4 to 4 , on the constitutionality of a statute canceling the citizenship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission . The result was to affirm a lower court decision expatriating Herman Frederick Marks , a native-born American who fought in Fidel Castro 's Cuban Army . Marks now becomes a stateless person . Joining Justice Douglas in the majority against the three-year provision for naturalized citizens were Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justices Hugo L. Black , Potter Stewart and Arthur J. Goldberg . A dissenting opinion by Justice Tom C. Clark was joined by Justices John Marshall Harlan and Byron R. White . Justice William J. Brennan Jr . took no part in the decision because ' his son had done some legal work on the case . He decided to stay out of the Marks I case also because it presented a similar issue . Justices Not Named As is customary , there was no announcement of how the Justices divided in the Marks case . But Justice Stewart 's known position on expatriation Made it likely that it was he who switched from the five-man majority in the other case . Mrs. Angelika L. Schneider was the person who successfully challenged the statute calling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries for ithree years or more . Mrs. Schneider , a native of Germany , was brought to the United States before the age of 5 . She went to New York public schools and graduated from Smith College in 1954 . She won a scholarship to study in Switzerland . At her farewell party in Nutley , N. J. , she met Dieter Schneider , a young German lawyer studying here . She married him two years later ? on July 4 , 1956 . Mrs. Schneider moved with her ' husband to Cologne , where he practices law . Three years later she was informed she had lost her American citizenship . She could have acquired German citizenship but did not , preferring to fight to be an American again . The statute at issue goes hack to 1907 , when Congress established a presumption that a naturalized citizen living in his native country for two years intended to forfeit American citizenship . But that presumption , established by the Nationality Act of 1907 , could be rebutted . In 1940 the present law was enacted . A companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad  --  not just in his native country  --  for five years . Today 's ruling almost certainly means that that provision is unenforceable also , " We start from the premise , " Justice Douglas said , " that thei rights of citizenship of the native-born and of the naturalized person are of the same dignity and are coextensive . The only difference drawn by the Constitution is that only the ' natural-born ' citizen is eligible to be President . " - The Government had clamed the right to expatriate to avoid possible foreign policy entanglements . Its view was that persons such as Mrs. Schneider had an ambiguous status that might lead to conflict between nations . The five-man majority on the Court rejected this argument today but was not agreed on the precise reasons . Justice Douglas said some of the five had favored one ground , while others had rested on a second . The first view is that Congress has no independent power I to  - -  expatriate any citizen ? ' there must be a deliberate , voliontary renunciation of citizenship , The second position is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable lin order to - meet the Fifth Amendment 's demand for " due process of law . " It can exIpatriate only for " conduct inconsistent with undiluted allegiance to this country . " Justice Stewart has taken that position in a prior case and wrote the quoted phrase , Taking up the second theme , Justice Douglas said today that " living abroad ; whether the citizen be naturalized or nativeborn , is no badge of lack of allegiance and in no way evidences a voluntary renunciation of nationality and allegiance . " " It may indeed be compelled by family , business or other legitimate reasons , " he went on . The opinion also critized what it termed " the impermissible assumption that naturalized citizens as a class are less reliable and bear less allegiance to this country . " Justice Douglas thus suggested that naturalized citizens may in no way be treated differently by law . Justice Clark 's dissent said that he sympathized with Mrs. Schneider , but he could not agree that Congress had placed any kind of badge on her " because she chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , the dissent said , must have power to deal with , the foreign entanglements ' caused by dual citizenship in the only effective way ? by ending the American citizenship . Justice Clark pointed out that 29 other countries expatriate naturalized citizens for residing abroad . The dissent also rested on a long line of cases , going back to 1915 , sustaining expatriation power of Congress and Justice Clark particularly disagreed with the majority 's suggestion that Mrs. Schneider 's actions were not inconsistent with " undiluted allegiance " to this country . " She wishes to retain her citizenship on a standby basis for her own benefit in the event of trouble , " he further said . " There is no constitutional necessity for Congress to accede to-her wish . " - In recent years about 1,000 naturalized Americans have lost their citizenship under this provision of law . Passports will also be affected . They now carry , on the inside back cover , a warning to naturalized citizens that they may lose their citizenship for staying abroad too long . The duration of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted ? was designed to fit in with the expatriation laws . There may now be a move for legislation to make all passports good for five years . The 4-to-4 decision in the Marks case indicated again how troubling the Court finds expatriation issues . In 1958 the Justices divided , 5 to 4 , in a series of expaa. triation cases . One struck doll : loss of citizenship for deserti4 in time of war , but another held expatriation for voting a foreign election . 1:11 !
