" The richest race ever contested by Thoroughbreds , or any other animals , for that matter  --  worth a fantastic $357,250  --  was run off at Arlington Park last week , and it was hardly earth-shattering news , in this year of the foul claim , that the little men were at it once again . Nor was it much of a surprise that the little man in the middle of the postrace muddle was that celebrated organizer of mayhem , Manuel Ycaza , who has spent so much time on the ground that he might easily be mistaken for a member of the Panamanian walking team . // This time Manuel , who got off comparatively lightly for a frivolous claim of foul in the Preakness ( SI , May 28 ) , was hit with all the artillery the Illinois Racing Board could drag into the film patrol room : 60 days for another " frivolous claim " and his outright accusation that the three-horse Rex Ellsworth entry had ganged up to see that he and Never Bend would not be first to the wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension was stiff , but so was Ycaza 's accusation. // Ellsworth 's entry of Candy Spots , Space Skates and Big Kim was the second choice in the race to Captain Harry F. Guggenheim 's Never Bend . Ellsworth and Trainer Mish Tenney knew that all three of them were good , but did n't know how good until they faced Never Bend , the Easterner with the best reputation to date . Space Skates and Big Kim had been nominated originally for the rich Arlington-Washington Futurity ( at seven furlongs ) , but Candy Spots , a rough chestnut , developed slowly in California this year , and Ellsworth decided to leave the colt home on the ranch when he shipped east to Chicago . He changed his mind at the last minute , however , and , once at Arlington , decided to put Willie Shoemaker aboard the big long-quartered youngster . ( He is by Nigromante out of the Khaled mare Candy Dish . ) Shoe won two races with Candy Spots , and as Futurity time drew near Willie told Ellsworth , " If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candy Spots . " On Shoemaker 's opinion , Ellsworth wrote a check for $25,000 and made the chestnut a supplementary nomination . // " The strategy for the race was n't really complicated at all , " said Ellsworth after the Futurity . " Big Kim was to stay with the pace . Space Skates was to take back off the pace . As for Candy Spots , there was only one way to ride him . He 's a slow starter , and if he runs at all he 'll come from way out of it . " // In the race , the Ellsworth team operated just about as they had planned . At the start Jet Traffic and Rash Prince sped to the front . Ycaza and Never Bend were right behind them . Big Kim quickly moved up with Never Bend  --  nicely locked on the outside of him , as a matter of fact . Space Skates was in the middle of the pack , and Candy Spots , who was last away from the gate , also suffered from being pinched back almost immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . // Moving around the far turn , at just about the three-and-a-half-furlong pole , Ycaza and Never Bend were ready to make their serious challenge for the lead . But Henry Moreno , aboard Big Kim , came over and as they did so they made sure that Ycaza was kept on the rail . There he stayed for a few precious seconds , long enough , in Ycaza 's opinion , to persuade him that he was being victimized . In a moment , sure enough , Big Kim fell back and Ycaza took to the outside and went to the front entering the stretch . But the precious lost seconds back there on the rail might have been critical , for now here came Candy Spots , on the outside of everything , eating up ground in magnificent long strides . They were even at the eighth pole and went together a 16th of a mile before Candy Spots gradually drew away to win by half a length . // Ycaza immediately claimed foul against Big Kim , on the grounds that he had no racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board decided to give him one of racing 's severest penalties . " He maintained , " said Steward Ted Atkinson , " that the purpose of the entry was to hurt him at the three-and-a-half-furlong pole . Big Kim , he said , came over and hurt him . " // " It 's absolutely preposterous , " said Rex Ellsworth. // Preposterous it may have been , but the penalty , in the light of what the patrol film showed , seems slightly unjustified to me . There is no question that Big Kim moved Never Bend to the rail and kept him there awhile  --  but was this intentional or was it racing luck , which often plays such an important part in any horse race ? My own opinion is that Ycaza was right to claim foul , and if so he can not be guilty of frivolous action . At the same time , I do n't believe Big Kim 's crowding cost Never Bend the race . Finally , I do n't think Ycaza should have been grounded for 60 days , or one-fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul claim took some of the glitter away from the great show put on by track owner Marje Lindheimer Everett ( SI , August 20 ) . However , the unmistakable fact emerged that undefeated Candy Spots , who seems to get stronger as the distances increase , is at least one of the best 2-year-olds in the country , if not the best . His opposition at the moment looks spotty . At Atlantic City last week Rambunctious won the World 's Playground Stakes , but the day before at Aqueduct the Hopeful winner . Outing Class , turned in a poor show in finishing next to last . There may be some exceptional 2-year-olds lurking in somebody 's barn , but for the moment I 'd say Candy Spots is the best of the bunch , with Never Bend second  --  by just about half a length .
