txt Dr.Donovan to Headi Schools After Board Settles Gross Case By LEONARD BUDER Dr. Bernard E. Donovan , who ' began his city school career as a teacher in 1930 , will be the next Superintendent of Schools here . This decision was reached at a recent informal meeting of the nine-member Board of Educa-1 tion . No official announcement is planned , however , until the : board resolves the problem of the status of Dr. Calvin E. Gross . the deposed Superintendent . Dr. Donovan , who is 54 years old , is Acting Superintendent.i He will formally become Super- ! intendent as soon as that post ' is vacated by Dr. Gross . who is on a three-month leave o ( absence ending June 4 . The board has said that he will , not be reinstated . Although the board has re- ; fused to comment on the stab : * of its negotiations with Dr.j Gross . sources at school head-1 quarters said yesterday that ! the board had been advised that ) it had the authority to dismiss him without a departmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Previously , the unofficial ' opinion was that the board could act 6 against a superintendent only after formal Charges had been brought and a departmental hearing held . School sources indicated that ' while the board was prepared ' to dismiss Dr. Gross if an agree- ' ment with him could not be ' reached by June 4 , it still hoped ! that an amicable solution could ! be worked out . The advice to the board om its powers in the case was given by Leo A. Larkin , city corporation counsel . Mr. Larkin confirmed yesterday that he had recently submitted " a memorandum of law " to the board , but he refused to discuss it . However , it was understood that he had informed the board that , in his opinion . Dr. Gross 's appointment to a six-year term . which began in 1963 , did not have the same status as a con- , tract , and could be terminated " for cause . " Conditions of Law Mr. Larkin is reported to have cited Section 2565 of the State Education Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shall hold his position in a city having a population of 250,000 or more for a period of six years from the date of his appointment subject to removal for cause . " Legal authorities said that if the board dismissed Dr. Gross . and he wanted to challenge it . he would have to bring suit . contesting whether there were " good and sufficient reasons " for his removal . Last March 4 , the board put Dr. Gross on leave with pay after having expressed dissatisfaction with his performance in his two years in office . The board said at the time that it would cooperate with Dr. Gross in helping him to obtain another position and to " compensate him appropriately for any pecuniary loss . " His salary is 545.000 a year . There were reports then that if Dr. Gross found another position with a smaller salary . the hoard might retain him as a consultant and pay him the difference until Sept. 1 , 1969 , when his term would have expired . There was speculation also that Dr. Gross might sue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future earning capacity . However . he has remained4 silent on his plans . He has reained Herbert Brownell Jr. , a ' former - United States Attorney ; General , to represent him in his ! dealings with the board . Although the hoard stripped ! Dr. Gross of his powers on March 4 , he comes daily to his 10th-floor office at the board 's headquarters . 110 Livingston Street , Brooklyn . He sometimes , spends a full day there . and sometimes only a few hours . What he does in the office ' is something of a mystery to , others in the building . He told . a reporter last week that he ; had " lots to do , " but declined ; to elaborate . However . he chatted amiably ; about general matters . Asked ! whether he still regarded him-i self as the Superintendent . Dr. ! Gross replied : " Of course . There is no question about that . " The spacious , green-carpeted , office , which is larger than a typical city classroom , was strangely quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly an hour. ; His desk was relatively bare , of papers . The ash trays on a large conference table were empty . When it was remarked that everything seemed unusually tidy , Dr. Gross laughed and said , " You mean there are no flash bulbs on the floor . " The 45 - year - old educator was in good spirits . He apologized whenever he was asked a question that he felt he should not answer . " I 'm sorry , " he said repeatedly , " but Mr. Brownell has advised me not to say anything about that . " A door in Dr. Gross 's office opens into the office of Dr. Donovan . While the former spoke to the reporter , Dr. Donovan was meeting with the system 's deputy superintendents . No one opened the door . Since being placed on leave , Dr. Gross has been divested of most of his aides . Dr. Nathan Jacobson , a principal whom Dr. Gross brought in to serve as his special aide , still occupies a desk in a corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donovan . Two secretaries still sit in the Superintendent 's outside office , but only one is assigned too Dr. Gross . Four clerical work- ' ers who also used to work for Dr. Gross are assigned to Dr. Donovan 's office . Dr. Gross still has the use of a chauffeur and an official car , with a mobile telephone and retractable writing table . To Dr. Donovan , heading the city school system , with its one million pupils , 45,000 teachers and 860 school buildings , is not a new experience . He was Acting Superintendent for six months before Dr. Gross was appointed . At one time during the administration of the previous superintendent , Dr. John J. Theobald , Dr. Donovan simultaneously carried out the duties of three top positions  --  those of Executive Deputy , Deputy Superintendent for business affairs and Deputy Superintendent for school buildings and construction .
