Political Sociologist Leonard Fein , 34 , is a Jewish intellectual who is associate director of the M.I.T.-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies . Black Educator Rhody McCoy , 46 , is administrator of New York City 's Ocean Hill-Brownsville experimental school district . Last week they met at the offices of TIME to discuss their concern about the deteriorating relationship between the ethnic communities to which they belong . Excerpts from their talk : <P> <P> Fein : The peculiar tragedy is that the Jewish community has a history of many creative relationships with blacks . We have shared a great deal . While your grandfather was being whipped in Mississippi , my grandfather was being killed in a pogrom . I may be dead wrong on this , but I sense that blacks say to themselves : " Look , the Jews have gotten it in the neck , too ; yet they 've been extraordinarily successful in this country . How do I explain their success and black nonsuccess ? " They 're certainly not going to conclude that Jews are better than black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that the Jews were successful only by cheating , and that the people they cheated were black . So in one fell swoop you explain both Jewish success and black nonsuccess . But there are a lot of Jews who are so obviously good guys that it 's hard to say that they are gougers or cheaters or bigots . So what do you do ? You call them hypocrites and you provoke them so fiercely that they , too , in the end turn against you . Then you can relax and say , " See , everybody 's a racist . " <P> McCoy : That 's a pretty frightening concept , is n't it ? But I 'm not sure that 's so prevalent . I would suggest that black people are still enslaved in one way or another , and I do n't think they 're really so ready to find scapegoats as to find reasons to blame it on the total American scene . It 's an anti-white attitude period . To me , it eventually all goes back to economics . Jewish people say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a second-class citizen and so I 'm going to do something about it . " But they still continue to practice the same discrimination . You ca n't even get a job as a dishwasher in certain areas they inhabit . <P> People who are oppressed want the oppressor off their backs . If he happens to be Italian , somebody 's going to say you 're anti-Italian . It 's ridiculous . It only becomes a charge of anti-Semitism when some person needs a political platform . It 's all part of a very definite effort on the part of some people who are trying to keep the black community isolated and fragmented . <P> Let me put it another way . Of course I think anti-Semitism is bad but I think we have more things to be concerned about than making anti-Semitism a priority . In Ocean Hill-Brownsville , people who basically were committed to educating children suddenly now are being charged with antiSemitism . It takes things all out of context . I keep asking myself why it 's so repugnant when it becomes black antiSemitism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtly . If every black man in America were an anti-Semite , it would have no real impact on our society as it presently stands .
