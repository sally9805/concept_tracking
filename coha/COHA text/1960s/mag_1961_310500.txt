Last September , exasperated by Yugoslavia 's dissident Communist Dictator and his blanket defense of Soviet nuclear testing , President Kennedy vowed that the U.S. would no longer give aid to nations that profess neutralism while supporting Communism . As a first step in implementing that policy , the State Department pointedly held up approval of Tito 's request for 500,000 tons of surplus U.S. wheat . Tito reacted in character : he made a bitterly anti-U.S . speech , and in time-tried Communist dialectic , somehow managed to claim that the U.S. was interfering with Yugoslavia 's affairs by withholding the wheat . For Tito , such abuse had its benefits : last week the State Department agreed to ship Tito the wheat he needs for his drought-starved land . <P> State denied that there was any connection between Tito 's attack and approval of the deal but offered little positive explanation of the latest gift . The 500,000-ton shipment , worth about $30 million , will be sent to Yugoslavia as a surplus crop under terms of a law that provides for payment in local currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already received some $64 million worth of agricultural commodities this year , raising his total haul in U.S. assistance since 1949 beyond the $2 billion mark-more than Belgium , Norway or the Philippines has received .
