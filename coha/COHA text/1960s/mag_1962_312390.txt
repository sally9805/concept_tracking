WHAT IS HISTORY ? ( 209 pp. ) - Edward Hal left Carr-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> " I often think it odd " said one of the characters in Northanger Abbey , " that history should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention . " How much of it is invention , how it should be invented , and to what end , is the subject of this dazzling display of witty wisdom by one of the world 's top historians . Professor E. H. Carr of Trinity College , Cambridge , originally put together his thoughts in the form of six lectures , delivered a year ago to his fellow Fellows at Cambridge . The BBC found them so interesting that it put the entire text on the air . In book form , they should fuel many an erudite bull session . <P> Professor Carr deftly disposes of the " common-sense view of history " as an assemblage of facts like so many fish , stone-cold dead in a fish store ( " The historian collects them , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style appeals to him " ) . Instead , Carr demonstrates , facts are more " like fish swimming about in a vast and sometimes inaccessible ocean ; and what the historian catches will depend partly on chance , but mainly on what part of the ocean he chooses to fish in and what tackle he chooses to use-these two factors being , of course , determined by the kind of fish he wants to catch . " A self-styled optimist , Carr believes that the idea of progress is necessary to answer his title question . History turns into theology when the meaning of the past depends on " some extra-historical and superrational power . " It becomes literature when it is merely a collection of stories about the past . Concludes Carr : " History properly so-called can be written only by those who find and accept a sense of direction in history itself . The belief that we have come from somewhere is closely linked with the belief that we are going somewhere . A society which has lost its belief in its capacity to progress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . "
