While the safety razor and the electric shaver have thoroughly conquered the U.S. , many Europeans still strop their own razors or visit a barber for a shave . This naturally makes Europe highly attractive to the world 's razor-blade makers . Throat-cutting competition for the market is raging between Boston-based Gillette Co. , world 's biggest producer , and Britain 's Wilkinson Sword Ltd. , whose introduction of the long-lasting stainless-steel blade changed the whole nature of the market ( TIME , May 1 ) . Stainless blades now account for almost 70% of British blade sales , 35% of the German market , and are increasing fast in other countries as delighted shavers try them . So far , smaller Wilkinson has been holding its own against Gillette . <P> Badly Nicked . Last week Gillette started distribution in Britain of a new stainless blade that will sell for less than both present Gillette and Wilkinson blades. * Gillette 's new Seven O'Clock , which sold under that name in traditional carbon steel , will be 14 less for a five-pack than Gillette 's premium Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established name in stainless , Gillette hopes to hold the old Seven O'Clock market while luring away Wilkinson shavers who never tried Gillette 's Silver blades . In Germany , Gillette has also switched a well-known Gillette blade name Rotbart ( red beard ) to stainless , hoping to beard Wilkinson in the same fashion . <P> Gillette needs a breakthrough . Unlike Wilkinson , which makes only stainless blades , Gillette frequently has to fill one pocket from another as customers switch from its carbon blades to its stainless . This shift , along with high promotion costs for the new blades , has badly nicked Gillette profits . From record 1962 earnings ( $45.3 million ) the company slipped 8% in 1963 despite higher sales , lost another 11.5% last year . Gillette 's British subsidiary cut its employee force 5% last summer , discontinued longtime fair-trade prices on blades and hiked retailer discounts to stimulate sales . <P> Wary Watching . The new marketing moves , Gillette feels , will once more give earnings that old smooth feeling . Even so , it warily watches Wilkinson , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 100 ) and quietly slipped into France recently with low-key ads that announced : " Elle est arrive-the Wilkinson Super Sword . " In both France and Italy , Gillette produces lower-priced brands similar to Seven O'Clock that will be converted to stainless if the war heats up . Meanwhile , it receives royalties regularly from Wilkinson , whose blades and bustling business are based on a 1959 Gillette patent ignored until Wilkinson came along . <P> <P> *Gillette is also testing a cartridge razor in which the shaving surface is a continuous reel in place of individual blades ; the shaver turns a knob to advance the reel when an edge becomes dull .
