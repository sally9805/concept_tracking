THE BRIDGE ( 215 pp. ) - Manfred Gregor - Random House ( $3.50 ) . <P> On one side of the bridge crouched seven German teen-agers with only two weeks of military training . On the other side was a combat patrol of battle-hardened G.I.s supported by three Sherman tanks , artillery and planes . The result ? Two U.S. tanks destroyed , a scatter of U.S. dead in the street and , finally , a crestfallen U.S. withdrawal to allow planes and artillery to soften up the remaining schoolboy defenders . <P> This bloody skirmish serves Germany 's Manfred Gregor as the core of his first novel . Like his seven heroes , Author Gregor was called up from high school during the spring of 1945 in the desperate mass conscription of 16-year-olds designed to flesh out the shattered Nazi armies . As U.S. armored columns knifed their way into Germany , they frequently encountered such youngsters , callously thrown into the front lines . Most often the dazed and frightened teen-agers surrendered in tears without firing a shot . But occasionally , they put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of their leadership . <P> The hero of Gregor 's book is Ernst Scholten , a schoolboy who cares little about the war and less about politics . A passionate reader of Karl May 's cowboy-and-Indian stories , * Scholten imagines himself as the dauntless Indian chief , Winnetou . Even though German adults - both soldiers and civilians-urge the uneasy boys to desert , they blindly follow Scholten 's lead . " You can do as you please , " he says . " I am staying . Winnetou will hold the fort . " The boys ' resolution is strengthened when a passing general can not resist spouting nonsense : he urges them to defend the bridge and announces that with a few thousand like them , Germany might still win the war . <P> Twelve hours later , only Scholten and one other teen-ager are left alive . When a truckload of German troops arrives , the boys think they are replacements to take over their position . Discovering that the unit is really a demolition team come to blow up the bridge , Scholten cries hysterically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? Five are lying over there who 've fought for this bridge . " Author Gregor 's final irony : after driving the demolition squad away from " our " bridge , Scholten is killed by a fellow German . <P> The Bridge is briskly told with an interlacing of flashbacks . Since the major characters are 16-year-olds , these flashbacks are mercifully short , if overly sentimental ; the boys seem to have grown up surrounded by sweet , long-suffering mothers and avuncular lieutenants , with hardly a Nazi in sight . But these scenes from the boys ' past merely serve as counterpoint to the adventure at the bridge and as clues to the variety of boyish responses , which range from terror to heroism . Gregor 's bitter little novel labors no point , nor does it have to . The futility it illustrates would have been depressing enough even if it had been grown men who held the bridge . Its special dimension of bitterness grows , without overstatement , from the fact that children suddenly forced into men 's roles have only their childhood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the U.S. , May wrote dozens of volumes on the American West which have been devoured by generations of German schoolboys .
