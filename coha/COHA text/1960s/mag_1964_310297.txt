Near adjournment time one afternoon last week , Illinois ' Republican Senator Everett Dirksen arose in the Senate . " Mr. President , " he proclaimed , " I present an amendment in the nature of a substitute . " Passing to Senate Parliamentarian Charles Watkins a 74-page rewrite of the House-passed civil rights bill , Ev resonated : " I doubt very much whether in my whole legislative lifetime any measure has received so much meticulous attention . " <P> By that time the civil rights bill had been before Congress for six months and six days . Reported to the House last Nov. 20 , after 22 days of Judiciary Committee hearings , the bill was debated for nine days , then passed by the House 290 to 130 . On March 26 , the Senate voted to take up the bill , has been debating it steadily since March 30 . During the last three weeks , Dirksen , who insisted on 50-odd amendments in return for precious G.O.P. votes in invoking cloture against the Southern filibuster ( see box ) , was " beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences with other Republicans , Minnesota 's Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey , and Attorney General Robert Kennedy . The fruit of their endeavors was what Dirksen now offered the Senate . <P> <P> " We have now reached the point where there must be action , " said Ev . " I believe this is a salable piece of work , one that is infinitely better than what came to us from the House . " <P> <P> One who predictably disagreed was Georgia 's Democratic Senator Richard Russell . " Stripped of any pretense , " he charged , the Dirksen substitute amounted to " a punitive expedition into the Southern states . " Russell continued : <P> " As one who lives in the South , as one who has never been ashamed of being a Southerner , and as one who believes that the people of the South are as good citizens as people anywhere else in the country , I resent this political foray . " He also had a word of warning for Dirksen . " Unless I am badly fooled , " said Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South , at least so far as his party 's prospects in the presidential campaign are concerned . " <P> If Ev was worried he did n't show it , instead exuded optimism over prospects for a speedy cloture vote . " I believe we can get cloture , " he said . " And I think we have to have cloture now . " <P> <P> Last week the Congress also : <P> &gt;Approved , in the House Foreign Affairs Committee , President Johnson 's $3.5 billion foreign aid authorization request . It was the first time in the stormy , 17-year history of foreign aid that the committee had voted to give a President all he asked for . But Johnson was n't home free . Still to come was the foreign aid appropriations bill , which would no doubt feel the paring knife of Louisiana 's Democratic Representative Otto Passman , champion dasher of Presidential foreign aid hopes .
