PRESS SECRETARIES <P> Far from the White House and daily communion with the Washington press corps . Presidential Press Secretary Bill Moyers made the most of an unexpected opportunity to sound off about critical reporters . Cornered by local newsmen before speaking to the Charlotte , N.C. , Young Democrats , Moyers was asked why President Johnson had such a reputation for managing the news . " This is uninformed criticism , " Moyers replied . " The press is insatiable . We try to give out as much as we can . Often it 's the inconvenience rather than the management that is criticized . " <P> As an example , Moyers cited the rash of announcements he gave out just before Johnson 's last trip to Texas . Instead of welcoming all the news , the press grumbled that it should have been ladled out over a period of two or three days . " If we had done that , " continued Moyers , " that would have been managing the news . Newsmen complain if they get too little and if they get too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days we had the rack . Today we have the press . ' " <P> Anyway , who are reporters to complain about L.B.J. ? " He has no peer as an editor , " declared Moyers , who discovered in his boss a talent that even Presidential Aide Jack Valenti did not cite in his famous catalogue of L.B.J. 's virtues . " He 's a very demanding and precise editor . He has the ability to reduce ten pages to one . "
