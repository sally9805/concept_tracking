T H E Kips always boasted that their blood was the finest in New York . They had managed to restrict it , since the eighteenth century , to the small group of families that had then been considered Manhattan society . The temptation to wade out , as the sand dried , into the endless waves of new fortunes that lapped the city had been sternly resisted . A Kip lady had been denied to a nephew of Mayor Hone in the 1830s and a Kip gentleman to a Gould heiress a half-century later . Even Standard Oil would not do for the Kips , even the House of Morgan . There had been a now legendary Miss Kip , not blessed in looks or fortune , who , seated alone at a ball , had rejected the proffered introductions of her hostess , saying : " Thank you so much , but I 'm perfectly happy sitting here and thinking what everyone in this room would give for one drop of my old Kip blood ! " The Kips wanted to be left alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too numerous to be supported forever by the bit of old farmland in downtown Manhattan on which a famous office building squatted . Long before the disaster of 1929 , " Kip Keep , " the turreted shingle castle of the Beekman Kips in Newport , had been razed and the tall gabled matching Dutch houses on Madison Avenue of the Tyler Kip sons had been converted to stores . By the middle of our century , the male Kips were mostly at work , as lawyers or brokers or insurance salesmen . They still managed to send their children to private schools and to get out of town in the summer , but where were the marks to set them aside from the crowd ? Where were the distinguishing features ? These were the questions that disturbed Bayard Kip , who , as a tax expert and , at thirty-four , an about-to-be partner in the Wall Street law firm of Tower , Tilney Fc Webb , was considered the prodigy of the family . But what was a Bayard Kip who had to help his wife with the dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was a Bayard Kip who had to hire a sitter when he went out in the evening and whose apartment rang with television phrases ? Were there not thousands such ? Was not this fatal competence in adapiation more extinguishing to a family than any other quality ? Bayard might polish and repolish his London shoes and wear waistcoats throughout the hottest summer ; he might roll his umbrella until it was as thin as a cane and wear the darkest suits and the darkest ties  --  it was all no use . The face that looked back at him in the morning from his grandfather 's mahogany framed shaving mirror had none of the highcheek-boned , hook-nosed superciliousness of a Colonial governor , none of what Bayard 's grandmother , pronouncing it in French , had called race . It was a mild , soft-eyed , square jawed , straight-nosed , blemishless American face . It might have been looking at him from across a soda fountain . The government agents and auditors with whom he had to work seemed equally unaware that he had any particular claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - stuffy , " but his patience with every demand , his quiet reasonableness in argument , and his clear , exact mind for figures made him a popular lawyer to deal with . One of the agents , a hard-fisted , cynical Irishman , Tommy Reardon , became almost a friend . Reardon was intrigued by Bayard 's economic philosophy which he liked to describe as somewhat to the right of Louis XIV . " Does it never occur to you . " he asked Bayard at lunch after they had completed auditing a great building contractor 's return , " that there 's something wrong with a country whose best brains are spent in attacking and defending the shenanigans of an old trickster like Inka Danduh ? " " You will understand that 1 must disassociate myself with any such description of a client , " Bayard replied in his mild , cool , but unindignant tone . " You know what Danduh is !

" " I have swept nothing of Mr. Danduh 's under the rug , " Bayard insisted . " All right , leave him out of it . Let 's just say a client . Surely you wo n't maintain that oil your clients are angels ? " " Let me put it this way , " Bayard said , after a moment of judicious reflection . " 1 believe that all the returns which I have prepared  --  or which have been prepared under my supervision  --  represent an honest disclosure of the pertinent facts . " " Oh , for Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is n't it had enough for you to have to work or these new tycoons without justifying them ? All this easy money , these phony deductions , these blown-up expense accounts , these crazy corporate shells  --  all this slick financing to give the public a shoddy product  --  why must you defend it ? What do you get out of it but a wretched salary , fully taxable , at that ? Where are your deductions ? You remind me of those ladies ' maids in the French Revolution who followed their mistresses to the scaffold because they were too blind to see that the Jacobins were their real friends ! " " Is that what you plan for us , Tommy ? The scaffold ? " " Well , if we could have your head , my friend , Uncle Sam would collect a lot more taxes ! " T Fl E Y laughed and parted , as usual , friends , but Reardon 's comparison to the ladies ' maids rankled deeply in Bayard 's heart . For lnka Danduh , the son of an Armenian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , was to Bayard the incarnation of the destroying spirit that had laid low the poor , old , shabby , genteel past . Whole blocks of beautiful , sober , red-faced federal houses had fallen before his bulldozers ; churches and shrines had been sacrificed to make way for his thinly built , highly priced , spare gray cubes . And Inka himself looked like a conquering Tartar , a scimitar-swinging Tamburlaine , smiling at the discomfort of his victims . He was a tall , wide-shouldered , big-stomached , formidable man , with a blue complexion , a hawk nose , glittering black eyes , and long , thick , oiled black hair , who spoke with a rumble and laughed in the sudden , explosive way of one whose temper , however massive , is always at the service of his shrewdness . He lived on top of one of his many buildings in a penthouse constructed of glass and bamboo , in the great bare reception halls of which , painted red and yellow and gold , hung his Pollocks and 44 SONG by Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine shapely thought That I carried so long When so young , when so young ?

Dandith , on the other hand , regarded Bayard with the greatest admiration . It gave him especial pleasure to watch this cool young man , cool on the hottest day in the hottest conference , the only person not in shirt sleeves , work out the most tangled problems with the aid of a slide rule and a single sheet of paper , in one corner of which his sharp pencil jotted the minimum of figures . " It 's old New York , " Danduh would announce triumphantly to the partners of his venture . " My little Kip here is a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Armenian tricks ! " Bayard at such moments felt like a captive Athenian scholar in the court of a Macedonian king . But the most burdensome part of his duties for the builder were social . Danduh had an old yacht on which he liked to take a motley group of helpless guests for weekend outings in Long Island Sound , and on the Sunday afternoon following the day of his lunch with Reardon , Bayard and his wife were included in one of these . Peggy Kip was a bright-eyed , tense little woman , with a habit of always pursing her lips , and although she did not share her husband 's umbrage at the present obscurity of the Kips , being quite contented with the mild distinction in her little set conveyed by such heirlooms as horsehair sofas and Hudson River canvases , she had to the fullest the Kip sense that anybody , be he Pope or President , who was in any way " different , " was " hinny . " And Inka Dandult was the lunniest of all . She made no effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long table in the main saloon , turning the pages of the visitors ' log with half-suppressed giggles . " I suppose I 'm being awful , " she whispered to Bayard with perfunctory remorse . " 1 suppose I should be more respect bd . " Tr was true . of course , that she was behaving badly and that the wife of any other clerk in Tower , Tilney Rc Webb would have been up on deck with the host uttering little squeals of admiration over the boat and its fixtures . But Bayard had never asked Peggy to be a good office wife : he would have scorned to do so . He did , however , observe , over the slowly widening gulf between her domestic preoccupations and his long downtown hours , that it never seemed to occur to her that she owed him more . " If you find the visitors ' log amusing , why should n't you express your amusement ? " he asked . " Does n't it amuse you ? " " Ought it to ? ' " It 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their florid messages . It 's like an old copy of Movie Mirror ! " " I sometimes think there 's nothing so vulgar as poor gentility , " he said with a small sigh . " But let me look at it . This yacht is supposed to be used for business entertainment . " Is that what you call business ? " Peggy demanded with a snort , pointing to where Inka was standing on the fantail , the arm of a blonde tucked under his . If I amused Mr. Danduh , would you let him deduct me ? " Bayard 's gaze followed her impertinent finger and rested for a long moment on his host . Then he turned with a new interest to the log . In fact , in the ensuing half-hour he examined every one of its pages . Although he was not familiar with the names of stage and screen , the exclamatory messages beside the signatures , the poems and limericks in the margin , the caricatures drawn all over , the dirty pictures , made it entirely clear that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he was closing the book he felt a friendly grip on his shoulder , and the nimbly voice came from above his head : " Quite a varied group of friends , is n't it , Bayard ? " " That 's what I was trying to determine . Is it ? " lnka , however , seemed unconscious of any special meaning in his lawyer 's lone . " You should mingle with the others , you and your pretty wife , " he continued . " You should meet my guests and not just read about them . They may not be in the Social Register , but they can teach you a thing or three . That 's why I keep this yacht . It 's like a desert island , on which we 're stranded . We 're cut off from our roots and all the little props that we depend on . For one afternoon we have to he on our own . We have to rely on our wits and our tongues . We have to amuse . Yes , my dear Bayard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's an experiment with democracy ! " As their host moved off , waving his big cigar in the air , Bayard followed his broad retreating back with narrowed eyes . Peggy , who never seemed to listen to a thing he said , had a way of noticing his smallest change of expression . " Now , Bayard , you 're not going to get in one of your moods , are you ? What do we care what he uses his silly yacht for ? " " I happen to care very much . " " Oh , dear " she said apprehensively . " Why could n't I keep my mouth shut ? What are you going to do now ? " " Do ? " Bayard 's tone was detached again . " I 'm going to do what our host suggests . I 'm going to take a little stroll on deck and meet my fellow passengers . I 'm going to rely on my wits and my tongue . I 'm going to find out exactly what each and every one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I Y I N G awake early the next Monday morn- 4 ing and gazing from the faded shepherdesses of their bedroom wallpaper to the flaking paint of the ceiling , Bayard prepared in his mind , with a grim , tense satisfaction , the things that he would do when he got to the office . He would take the Danduh income-tax returns to Mr. Madison and lay them on his desk with a slight , respectful how . " If you wish to sign these , here they are , sir . I 'm afraid I can no longer be responsible for defrauding the Collector . " He smiled a thin smile as he imagined the habitual look of preoccupation on the long gray Face of the senior tax partner as it would dissolve into astonishment . " What 's that ? What ? " And then anger . Anger and recrimination . Bayard rose quietly so as not to disturb Peggy and went to the window with a sudden quickening heartbeat to stare down at the backyard of the apartment house with its garbage pails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did he care ? At breakfast with the children he gave a lecture on the use of " Good morning " instead of " Hi . " In the subway he read the market news and a tax periodical . And all the while his curious exhilaration persisted . He remembered the French duchess in the revolution that his friend Reardon loved to cite , who , about to deny corresponding with the enemy , then shrugged , saying : " No , no , life is n't worth a lie . " That was it . No boasting of moral superiority , no vulgar dramatic oratory , no affectation of heroism  --  simply a shrug and a life tossed away . If one was a Kip , there was , after all , a gesture still to be made , a gesture that for all its quietness was a repudiation of rottenness , a repudiation , indeed , of the whole wretched age in which he had to live . Had not the first Bayard Kip been ruined for resisting the Astors ? Had not his own great-grandfather lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had consciences as simple as the brownstone behind which they had lived , consciences that stemmed from the quaint old days of eighteenth-century finance , consciences that antedated the venality of steam and oil . Bayard was grateful to the son of an Armenian rug peddler for providing him with the opportunity to show that the Kips still stood apart . Mr. Madison did not disappoint him . His bewilderment and irritation were all that Bayard had hoped . " But why do you have to be the judge of what 's a business deduction ? " he demanded fretfully . " Why do you have to go snooping into what he uses the yacht for ? The client tells you it 's for business . AlI right , put it in the return that way . " " I have . But I wo n't sign it . " " But Danduh will blow up ? " Madison stopped when he saw Bayard 's shrug . " Look , Bayard , I 'm not asking you to do anything dishonest . I simply want you to recognize that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely to work on Danduh 's matters . He depends on you ! " " I know lie does , " Bayard said grimly . " He depends on my signature . If he 's ever prosecuted , he can always make the defense that his lawyer signed the return . " " But damn it all , you ca n't know all the uses he puts that yacht to ! " " That 's just it . I can . " " Well , I ca n't ! " Madison exclaimed angrily , picking up the return . " And 1 can sign it . " " As you wish , " Bayard said quietly and withdrew , He did not see Madison again that day , but the real scene occurred that evening when he told Peggy . " I think it 's the meanest thing I ever heard ! " she wailed . " You 're going to blast your career at the office because I sneered at Mr. Danduh . " " You were right to sneer at him . " " But I never thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I did n't want to see him socially . " " You think it 's all right to make your living off 46 THE DEDUCTIBLE YACHT ti a man like that provided you do n't see him socially ? " " Well , naturally . Has n't that always been the rule ? " It has never been mine , " Bayard said sternly . " Nor has it ever been that of my family . It may interest you to know that my great-grandfather Kip lost a ... " It may not interest me to know it ! " she exclaimed fiercely . " It may interest me to know that you care more about your silly family pride than you do about your wife and children ! I believe you 're actually happy about this thing . I bet you did it to spite met " Bayard , however , was little touched by her hysteria . After all , the children were not going to starve . Only promotion was at stake , and it was clear that Peggy , a creature of her age , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity , that she expected him to succumb to the modern sentimentality of basing moral decisions on the material needs of his family . But things were right or things were wrong , and life was only worth living if one acted with some consistency in the face of this simple premise . Peggy 's charge that he was motivated by a desire to hurther was quite irrelevant . Motives mattered only if one asked for credit , and he was asking for none . It was an anti-climax , therefore , the next day , when he was summoned to Madison 's office , to be ushered into the big smiling presence of lnka himself . " Bayard , my boy , " he said , putting a thick arm over the younger man 's slim shoulders , " 1 want you to come straight to Daddy Danduh when you have doubts about his virtue . Do n't leave the job to poor old Madison here . When I walked into his office this morning I caught him in the act of signing my returns . ' Hey , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's job ? ' Well , he started to explain , and you should have heard him stammer ! The great Morris Madison , the glibbest advocate before the tax court ! But I gradually made out that you think your friend Inka 's a fraud and a phony . All right , so he 's a fraud and a plionyl But do n't you think von owed it to me to come and tell me so yourself ? " " It was n't my place as an associate , " Bayard explained in his gravest manner , " to make that kind of communication to a client of Mr. Madison 's . " " Oh , I see , " Inka said , nodding emphatically . " Well , then , let us hope that you may be a partner before too long . But to the question of my poor old yacht . Of course , we 'll knock the deduction out of the return . I would have done so myself had I only thought of it . She was originally used for business , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more of a personal plaything . As a matter of fact , I wonder if the time has n't come to get rid of her . Do you know any yacht brokers , Bayard , my friend ? " They were both grinning at him , Madison and Inka , but Bayard did not grin back . lie was disturbed to recognize the sudden little weight in his heart as disappointment , and he remembered what Peggy had said . P ROM OTI ON , when it came , came as it so often does , fast . In two months ' time Bayard was a junior partner with an office overlooking the East River , a full-time secretary , and his lunch-club dues paid . Peggy was able to redecorate the apartment and have the family pictures cleaned and the silver lacquered . For the little family party at which they celebrated this advancement a butler was hired , and Bayard , sipping his sherry under the now gleaming Rembrandt Peale portrait of General Kip and glimpsing through the freshly painted , open doors of the dining-room the glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kips were coming back to life . It was a bit startling to have life turn out to be as simple as his own principles , to have the ashes of martyrdom so promptly converted into the downy pillows of success , but might n't it be the ultimate justification of his lifelong adherence to the creed that a family , with faith and tenacity , could stay on top ? When he next lunched with his friend Reardon , the latter was in ribald mood . " So you 've decided to be a lady 's maid no longer , " he commented . " You 've decided to be a marquise . " " I figure the knife of your guillotine wo n't feel any sharper . " " Oh , that knife . It 's dulled with disuse . As dull as your conscience , man . " Bayard examined those laughing eyes which so ill concealed their resentment . " I know you think that one pays with a bit of soul for each step up in the great world outside of government , " he retorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the opposite to be true . I have found that clients appreciate honest advice , even when it proves expensive to them . " " What kind of honest advice ? " " 1 was thinking particularly of the propriety or impropriety of certain business deductions . " " Oh , that yacht of Danduh 's , " Reardon said with a snort . " I know all about that . The whole main shaft was split . He stung the Better Brands Company for it , and they 're charging it off as a bad loss this year . " Bayard 's unflinching stare reflected nothing . " You suggest that he was going to get rid of the yacht anyway ? " " I suggest that he was killing two birds with one stone . He got rid of a leaky old tub that might have taken him to the bottom of the sea and acquired instead the lifetime devotion of a brilliant young tax lawyer of unimpeachable respectability . I should say he had a bargain . " Bayard opened his lips in a faint smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not bought , no . Men like Danduh do n't buy . They acquire . He needs your advice and the name of your firm , and he 's willing to pay high for it . But what he does with that advice , you 'll never quite know . He has his accountants . And other tax lawyers . On a lower level . And one thing you can be sure of , old man . He 's tipped his hand once to you . and he 's learned not to do it again . All the plays that you 'll see from now on will be straight as arrows . " " Can a lawyer ask more ? " Bayard queried coolly and turned his attention to the menu . N OBODY watching Bayard walk back down Wall Street after lunch , carrying his tight y rolled umbrella despite the spring sunshine , would have suspected that he had received the bitterest shock of his life . He nodded with the same quiet gravity to the receptionist as he entered the office and with his usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own room , behind a closed door and seated at his desk , he raised his fingertips gently to his temples and closed his weary eyes . Life , he admitted , was too much for his simple philosophy . One tried to do right and one 's wife accused one of spite . One tried to fight wrong , and the enemy turned up after the bout in even richer ermine . Perhaps the lesson of it all was that the appearances to which he had so clung , the old family appearances of honor and scrupulousness , of dignity and aristocratic distinction , were , after all , the only things that could he preserved . He opened his top drawer and drew from it a photograph of a small , high-gabled , gingerbread villa on Bellevue Avenue in Newport which had just been left to him by his uncle , Maturin Kip , of whose estate it had been one of the few assets .
