Nature writing is a kind of industry these days , with numberless authors following birds and beasts in the hope of trapping them into a bestseller . The boom comes just about a century too late to do any good for Richard Jefferies . It is a pity for he could have used the money , and he was a writer of such skill and integrity as to deserve the best in reputation and fortune . He may be in for a revival , for  --  though he is not widely read  --  there is a flourishing Richard Jefferies Society , whose members live in places as far apart as Paris , France and Houston , Texas . Jefferies was born in 1848 , the son of a small farmer who owned 40 acres ( called Coate Farm ) in Wiltshire , England . He grew up on the farm , and as a boy often sneaked away from his chores to walk with his gun to the bare uncultivated downland that lay beyond a nearby hill . Sometimes he would come back hours later with no shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his shoulder , he would observe a new peculiarity of the flight of the pigeon , or watch , for the hundredth time , a rabbit , thumping its hind legs on the ground as a signal of danger ; and his long sensitive forefinger would slowly stray away from the unpulled trigger . // In 1865 a journalist who had lost his way floundered through a thunderstorm to the thatched farmhouse , and there Jefferies met for the first time the world of letters . Through this meeting he took a poorly paid job as a reporter on the North Wiltshire Herald . In his spare time he still roamed the fields . // Until his painful death from tuberculosis at the age of 38 , Jefferies poured out a stream of intensely accurate observations on his life at Coate , eagerly snapped up by the leading magazines and newspapers of the day . Self-taught as a writer , he never fell into rustic whimsies . " Style , " Jefferies jotted in a notebook . " The proper choice of a word . A polished style , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // Sitting beside a tree trunk , his gun safely leaning in the crook of a branch , or lying in a punt with his face near the water while the line trailed uselessly behind , he recorded in his mind 's immense notebook more data in half an hour than would be accumulated in a week by an ordinary man . // His parents could not understand the dreamer they had begotten , and their bafflement led to his great unhappiness at home  --  he once tried to run away , to walk to Moscow at the age of 16 , but got no farther than France . He starts his best book , The Amateur Poacher , with an account of an act of great stupidity on the part of his father : // " They burned the old gun that used to stand in the dark corner up in the garret , close to the stuffed box that always grinned so fiercely . " // He never forgot it , but softened slightly a few years later when " they " gave him a weapon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flintlock . " The lock was a trifle dull at first , simply from lack of use . A small screwdriver soon had it to pieces , and it speedily clicked again sweet as a flute . " Later , when he met a man named Haylock , the gamekeeper on the neighboring estate at Hodson Bottom , he learned the perfect lubricant , which never congeals in cold weather , for any such mechanism  --  gin . // His many hours spent with Haylock taught him not only the art of shooting and the elements of fieldcraft , but also gave him an insight into the various devices used by Haylock 's enemies , the poachers . The new invention of the breechloader meant that gentlemen of position wanted to shoot birds in the hundreds , even in the thousands ; and the science of large-scale pheasant-raising was studied by keepers all over the country . When the birds thus reached a many-fold surplus over the ordinary production of nature , few countrymen were averse to taking an occasional one for a quick sale . Haylock told Jefferies what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight , and a decade later he wrote about them , when he was living closer to the hub of the editorial world . // Even when he moved to Surbiton , near London , he was able to point out to Londoners that wildlife still existed there . On his long walks , his lanky figure stooping and his soft brown beard curling in the wind , he cataloged 60 wild flowers growing in one London street , and saw a trout  --  perhaps the last London trout  --  being speared in one of the many streams that now run underground . // In his 38 years of life , Jefferies turned out a great number of essays , most of which were republished in book form , such as his Gamekeeper at Home . He never knew any kind of affluence and nearly always sold the copyright of his works . // Jefferies was , perhaps , a product of his age . As the center of British life shifted for the first time from the open country to the grime , smoke and congestion of the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land which they could never know more intimately than through an occasional weekend visit . Certainly , many have followed him in his trade , and England now has 500 new books a year on agriculture , natural history and related subjects . But there will seldom be another who , like Thoreau , could write a whole compelling page about a single leaf , an essay on the living things around a particular ditch or an entire book by sitting observantly in one field .
