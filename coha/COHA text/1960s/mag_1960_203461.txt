Sizing up prospects for the Olympics in Rome next August , nearly everyone agrees that the U.S. has the world 's best pole vaulters-and that the highest-flying U.S. vaulters are Veterans Bob Gutowski , 24 , who holds the outdoor record of 15 ft. 8 in. , and Don Bragg , 24 , who claims the indoor record of 15 ft. 9 in . But last week in Norman , Okla. , a relative unknown vaulted as high as anyone else in track history : John David Martin , 20 , a University of Oklahoma junior , cleared the bar at 15 ft. 9 in . <P> A strapping ( 6 ft. 4 in . ) Oklahoma farm boy with huge hands ( his nickname is " Goose , " after onetime Harlem Globetrotter Goose Tatum , who could make a basketball look like a BB shot in his vast paws ) , Martin began pole vaulting on a dare . Challenged by seventh-grade friends to enter the event in a school meet , Martin did- " and I was terrible . " Humiliated , he walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using it as a pole , began practicing . <P> Although Martin 's vault last week equaled the highest ever recorded , * it probably will not be recognized as a world record . To keep it from blowing down in the face of a stiff wind , the crossbar was placed on the vaulter 's side of one of the upright standards-thereby making it just a bit more difficult to brush off . But the vault was still enough to serve warning to Olympians that the U.S. , in addition to Gutowski and Bragg , has its high-flying Goose . <P> <P> * Gutowski 's 1957 mark of 15 ft. 9 in. was rejected as a world record because his pole fell under the bar .
