As a Habsburg emperor , Rudolf II was exceptionally inept . During his rule , from 1576 to 1612 , he was forced to cede Hungary , Moravia , Austria and Bohemia . Yet he had vision of sorts . He was an amateur astronomer , brought Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe to the Hradcany , his imperial castle in Prague , to perfect his stargazing . Rudolf 's keen eye carried over into the arts , which he collected with all the magpiety of a Renaissance nobleman worshiping beauty . It was one of the world 's greatest collections , but Rudolf could not hold on to it either . <P> During the Thirty Years ' War , the Hradcany was sacked by the Swedes , who floated bargeloads of art homeward down the Elbe . The Habsburg descendants contributed to the losses . In 1749 , Empress Maria Theresa sold off 69 paintings at bargain rates . After the Habsburgs moved their imperial seat to Vienna , they removed Rudolf 's collection from Prague . Between 1865 and 1894 alone , Vienna 's palaces gained 312 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersal has gone on until art from Rudolf 's Schatzkammer now hangs across the world , from New York 's Metropolitan to Leningrad 's Hermitage . <P> Many times , experts have declared that Rudolf II 's huge Hradcany palace was thoroughly bare . So did Czech Art Historian Jaromir Neumann , 40-at first . While studying inventories , Neumann found discrepancies suggesting that some old masters might still be lying around . And he found them-coated with dirt and varnish that has taken 22 restorers 2 years to scour off . Now these 74 noble remnants , mostly from Rudolf II 's collection , are on view again , some of them back in the marble-floored stables of Prague 's Hradcany ( see opposite page ) . <P> These priceless oils were buried under layers of ignorance , neglect and anonymity , " explains Neumann . Tintoretto 's Flagellation , with all the master 's mannerist mystery of depth , stage lighting and evanescent flesh tones , had been attributed to a copyist . Titian 's Toilet was supposedly by his son Orazio , although the supple shoulder line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fluid sleeve reveals the artist 's lustrous trademark . <P> These and the other masterpieces in the Hradcany may only be the first of many new finds . The Czechoslovakian Communist government declared all of the country 's 4,200 castles to be state property , and almost none have yet had their collections examined . Says Neumann eagerly : " I myself know where there are two completely authentic Van Dycks . They 've simply been hanging there all these years with nobody paying any attention to them . " Even in a people 's republic , some good can still come from nobility .
