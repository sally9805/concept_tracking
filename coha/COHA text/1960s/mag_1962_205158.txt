THE CALIFORNIA TRAIL ( 339 pp. ) - George R. Stewart - McGraw-Hill ( $6.95 ) . <P> <P> George R. Stewart writes inanimate prose about inanimate heroes . His best-selling books-with titles like Storm , Fire , or U.S. 40-generally describe some vast entity of nature or engineering and its ef fect upon scores of tiny lives . His new book might have been called Rut . Its chapters are headed " 1841 , " " 1842 " and " 1843 " and so on , as year by ox-drawn year he records the development of the overland route to California . Back and forth the reader travels , five times in the first 100 pages alone , until a pair of transcontinental grooves has been worn into the top of the brain . <P> But grooves like these should be worn more often . The California Trail is a proud and valuable book , researched with skill and a lifetime 's attention . Its lack of flashing style can hardly defeat the record it offers . In this era of the third martini and the heart-saver chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems shockingly alien , as if they were someone else 's ancestors . <P> Minor Nuisance . Many of them were kids , 19 or 20 years old , often newly married , with a couple of yoke of oxen and no fear at all . On a good day they could make 14 miles , and after two months of walking or jolting along , they still had 1,500 to go . When a baby was born , the wagon train would stop for a few hours . They were not the sort of people to die on the trail , and amazingly few did . In fact , the skeletons that are strewn all over the emigrants ' path in Stewart 's book are almost entirely the remains of oxen , milch cows , and Hollywood scriptwriters . Indians , he says , " were a minor nuisance , not a real hazard . " A wagon trail to California was first attempted in 1841 , and new tries were made each year , but no white traveler was killed by an Indian until 1845 . <P> Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no record anywhere that they galloped around in circles twanging arrows into the ring of wagons , an absolutely pointless maneuver since the Indians would have been exposing themselves to rifle fire from protected riflemen . Instead , they laid siege , taking command of any springs or streams , until the white men 's tongues turned black . But that was rare . Mainly , they hung around asking for handouts . <P> No Horses . No one used Conestoga wagons ; they were too ungainly . Smaller ones , with boxes about 9 ft. by 4 ft. , were popular . They were not called prairie schooners . When deep rivers were encountered , the bottom of the boxes could be covered with canvas or hides ; off came the wheels and the vehicle became a boat . On land , they were pulled by oxen or mules , mainly oxen , because an ox cost only $25 , a mule $75 . No horses . Too weak . <P> While they were still in the relative East , they ate three-star meals , with hot biscuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venison , wild peas , tea and coffee all included in a single typical dinner . Toward the other end , they ate rancid bacon , mountain sheep , red fox , and sometimes boiled hides . When they were dying of thirst , they drank mule urine . While 47 of the 87 members of the Donner Party were dying of hunger in 1846 , there was some cannibalism . " What do you think I cooked this morning ? " said Aunt Betsy Donner one day . " Shoemaker 's arm . "
