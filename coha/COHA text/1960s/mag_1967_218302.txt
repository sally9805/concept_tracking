If the painful march toward democracy begun by Saigon 's Soldier-Premier Nguyen Cao Ky is to have any real meaning , South Viet Nam must produce a literate electorate . But how can this be done in time of war , when rural schools are as much a target of Viet Cong grenades as American military encampments ? More than 90 teachers have been slain by the V.C. and another 260 kidnaped since 1960 , and many a classroom in the countryside has had its singsong language lessons abruptly interrupted by the staccato racket of a nearby Communist machine gun . <P> The answer has been a combination of U.S. money and Vietnamese grit . It is called the Hamlet School Project , a scheme that has put half a million Vietnamese children in school since 1963 , and which aims eventually at putting a school and trained teacher in every " secure " hamlet in the nation . In the en tire U.S.-supported pacification program , no project has proved more popular with the war-battered rural populace . <P> Typical is the pair of two-room buildings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mekong Delta , where the teachers ' voices must compete with the rumble of armored convoys on the road outside . Communist slogans , painted on the classroom walls by Viet Cong by night and whitewashed away by day , are faintly visible . Bullet holes stand out more starkly . On their way to school along a pot-holed road , children step carefully , watch for Viet Cong mines . One enemy mine recently killed two South Vietnamese soldiers near the school , and both sides ambush each other along the trails in the area . Sometimes the Viet Cong block the road-and that day school starts late . <P> Time to Cry . Teacher Diep Thi Kim Khanh , a shy 22-year-old who was born near by , concedes that conditions are sometimes terrifying but , she says , " I can not leave these children . " She recalls the afternoon when shots burst out around the school , and Vietnamese soldiers from a nearby government fort rushed into the building to fire back through the windows at the Viet Cong . " The children began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khanh . " I was very afraid and on the point of crying myself . " After a half-hour fight , the Reds disappeared . <P> Despite the dangers , the building of a school wins friends for the Saigon government . At Soc Don , another Delta hamlet , all but twelve families moved off into the jungle when government troops arrived to secure the community . But when classes were opened in a deserted hut , using ammo boxes as tiny desks , people drifted back . Now 120 families live in Soc Don , the school is crowded , and a new classroom building is going up . <P> The Hamlet School Project has built 6,278 such classrooms since it began as a U.S. AID program four years ago . At first the Saigon government put up the buildings , but when the Viet Cong burned them down , the local people were indifferent . Now it is common for Saigon to provide the cement and aluminum roofing and let the residents do the work . That way , notes Ho Van Chieu , primary education chief for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn them down for fear of infuriating the people who built them . "
