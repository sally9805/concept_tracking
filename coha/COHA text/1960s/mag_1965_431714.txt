 | Recently , millions of women throughout the world who had been told by their doctors that they could not expect to bear children received electrifying news . It concerned amazing new drugs that enable infertile women to give birth to normal children ? sometimes even twins and quadruplets ! " At long last , " said one childless couple ( 10 percent of couples in the U.S. of childbearing age want children but have been unable to have them ) , " our prayers have been answered . Science has found a cure for sterility ! " But has it ? How effective are these drugs ? In what kinds of cases do they work ? Are there physical risks involved ? How does a woman become a candidate for this exciting new treatment , and what happens to her when she does ? We tried to find the answers to these and other questions by talking to some of the patients and research scientists who have been involved in the still-continuing experiments . The current excitement in the United States began quietly enough with a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center in New York City , which was mailed routinely to newspaper offices and wire services in the early autumn of 1964 . The paragraph mentioned a new drug that dealt with the treatment of menstrual difficulties in barren women . It is probably safe to say that in many cases it landed in wastepaper baskets , for it was filled with words like chorionic and gonadotropin and sprinkled with the mysterious symbols of chemical formulas . One newspaper reporter , however , was considerably intrigued with line eight . which said , " One of the pregnancies , following this induction of ovulation , resulted in quadruplets . " He quickly tracked down the principals in the case . Eleven months before , in Queens , a residential borough of New York City , a pretty , dark-haired , 28-year-old , 90-pound ex-schoolteacher named Mrs. Martin Brecker , married six years , had given birth to quads . They were her first children . Local newspapers had run headlines . neighbors had sent telegrams of congratulation , and the understandably astonished male parent had been named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having quadruplets are 725,000 to one . However , the Columbia-Presbyterian report made it apparent that for the Breckers the odds had been artificially shortened . Prior to her pregnancy , Mrs. Brecker had been treated with Pergonal , a new " miracle " drug that induces ovulation and thus makes it possible for some childless women to become pregnant . In experiments here and abroad ,  | Pergonal and similarly acting drugs have proved highly successful in inducing ovulation in groups of carefully selected patients ? so successful that they have been instrumental in the conception of numerous sets of twins and several sets of quadruplets . The world of gynecological medicine had hoped to keep the story a secret , at least until the drugs ( of which Pergonal is only one ) had passed the experimental stages . None have thus far been approved for general use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , though there is expectation that one or more will be released within a year or two . The women involved in the research experiments were all volunteers who entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant and painful side effects resulted . Several doctors have also claimed that the drugs can be extremely dangerous when administered incorrectly . Dr. Robert K. Cutter , chairman of the board of Cutter Laboratories , American processors of Pergonal , said , " It is regrettable that there has been premature publicity with reference to Pergonal . This is a promising product in the fertility field but it is only that ? promising . " Nevertheless , with the publication of the reporter 's scoop on the Breckers , the news was out , and torrents of mail and telephone calls begged for the wonderful new drugs . A number of communications came from perfectly healthy , normal women , many of whom had already conceived and borne children , but who felt " it would be fun " or " it would add to our prestige " to have twins or better . But the bulk of appeals came from women who have been married five or more years and are of childbearing age but have not had children . Wrote one , " I 've been married eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt a baby , but I so want one that 's really mine ! " A 33-year-old woman in St. Louis reflected guiltily , " My husband and I have been taught that contraception is wrong . Yet we used contraceptives for the first five years of our marriage . When we had a high enough income ( we also had to support my invalid father ) , we got ready to have a family ? and found that we could n't . My mother-in-law says I 'm being punished for not having enough faith in God 's ability to provide . My doctor says my ovaries do n't work right . Please ! Please help me ! " Still another confided , " When my husband and I met and fell in love he told me that he wanted a large family . While we were still starry-eyed and holding hands , we agreed on eight children . I knew all the time that my menstrual periods were n't normal . But I did n't dream that I would n't be able to have babies . You are my last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugenia Rosemberg , director of the Medical Research Institute of Worcester City Hospital in Massachusetts , has done a large part of the pioneering work in the United States on Pergonal . She said , " There 's no person more desperate or more pitiful than a married woman who finds her life meaningless without a baby . Yet it is too bad these new drugs have aroused so many false hopes ? at best they can help only 10 percent of infertile women . " Like most scientific discoveries , the new fertility drugs are due not to one man but to several , all working in separate places at the same time . In Uppsala , Sweden ; Berkeley , California ; Tel Aviv , Israel ; Rome , Italy ; Rochester , Minnesota , and elsewhere , research scientists puzzled , in the late 1950 's and early 1960 's , over the chemical structure and function of the sex hormones released by the tiny but powerful pituitary gland at the base of the brain . In Sweden , Dr. Carl Gemzell obtained pituitaries from corpses of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormone ? a kind of chemical starter ? that proved to stimulate female ovaries . In Rochester , at the Mayo Clinic , Dr. Alexander Albert was working along similar lines . Meanwhile , in Italy , Dr. Pietro Donini found that this same hormone ? its scientific name is gonadotropin ? was also  | present in the urine of older women who had ceased to menstruate . He helped to persuade a group of retired nuns to contribute specimens , and from them isolated a product he called Pergonal . When Dr. Donini published his findings , Dr. Bruno Lunenfeld , in Israel , injected the hormone into the buttocks of two married women , each of whom had had a long history of monthly menstrual failure . Soon after , both became pregnant . In the United States , Cutter Laboratories paid close attention to the European reports . It had long been known that hormones extracted from animals stimulated human sex organs , but often this was at the cost of violent allergic reactions . Now , however , Cutter Laboratories , hoping to prove the human hormone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental teams around the country . They included Dr. Eugenia Rosemberg of the Worcester City Hospital Research Laboratories , the Tyler Fertility Clinic in Los Angeles , the Yale Infertility Clinic in New Haven , the ColumbiaPresbyterian Fertility Clinic in New York and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . Dr. Rosemberg was the first in the United States to use Pergonal successfully on an infertile woman . The patient was 30 years old , had been married seven years and had never , apparently , experienced a normal menstrual period . Ten months after treatment ? a series of intramuscular injections of Pergonalshe was delivered of a normal , healthy baby girl . A second patient , similarly diagnosed and treated , had an 8-pound , 3-ounce boy . In Uppsala , Sweden , Dr. Gemzell was the first to realize that injections of human gonadotropin have a tendency to produce multiple births . Of his original 50 hopeful cases , half the women became pregnant . Among these , two conceived quads . One set of quadruplets was lost by miscarriage at five months . The others arrived alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ounces . Twelve of the 25 women gave birth to twins . None were identical twins , who occur when a fertilized egg splits into two independent parts . All were fraternal twins ? the result of the simultaneous fertilization of two or more separate egg cells . Early experiments in the United States confirmed the tendencies of the drug to produce multiple births . At Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital , 21 women were treated . Fifteen became pregnant . Among the resulting births , in addition to the headline-making Queens , N.Y. , quads , there were three sets of twins . At about the time that the hormoneinduced babies began to arrive , scientific reports mentioned an artificial chemical substance called Clomiphene which produced similar results . At the Harvard University Medical School , the Medical College of Georgia . the Free Hospital for Women and the Rock Reproductive Clinic , directed by Dr. John Rock , in Brookline , Mass. , many of the childless women treated with Clomiphene became pregnant ? and about one-third of these had twins ! " Unfortunately , " said Dr. Elijah B. Romanoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury , Mass. , " neither Pergonal nor Clomiphene is a cure-all for infertility . Far from it . The vast majority of infertile women can not be helped by either . " Patients who apply to the testing clinics here and abroad are carefully screened to make certain that they are sensible candidates for treatment . As Dr. Rosemberg observes , only about 10 percent qualify . These are women suffering from what the medical profession calls " secondary " amenorrhea . The term means that a healthy egg may mature each month in one of the patient 's two ovaries , but , because there is a defect in her hormones , the ovary fails to eject the egg into the adjacent Fallopian tube , where fertilization with a male sperm can take place . As one gynecologist put it , " The carburetor is okay , but the gas apparently is n't reaching the cylinder . " Clomiphene , the artificial chemical , and Pergonal , the natural hormone , can , when injected into a woman patient , stimulate a normal but " lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a ripe egg cell into the Fallopian tube . Indeed , as current experiments have shown , it frequently causes the appearance of not one egg but two or even four . Ordinarily the two almond-sized female ovaries , one on the left and one on the right side of the lower abdomen , work in alternate shifts , each releasing only one egg every other month . Researchers are not certain why twins and quads ( but no triplets ) have resulted from the Pergonal-Clomiphene experiments . Most think that the multiple births are due to overdosage , but no one yet is sure how to prescribe the exact dosage for a particular patient . A dose that releases four eggs in one woman may have no effect on another . Researchers now believe that the fertility drugs may be causing two very different effects . In most of the success ful experiments , ovulation , proved by pregnancy , occurred only after several series of injections over a period of months . In some cases , however , women barren for many years and proved by painstaking medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single injection of Pergonal . The question : Did Pergonal itself stimulate the " lazy " ovary , or did it go , in some mysterious manner , to the base of the trouble and stimulate the patient 's pituitary gland to manufacture and discharge its own hormones ? This answer , too , awaits further research . Observers are also concerned with annoying or painful side effects apparently related to the injections . The drugs occasionally produce symptoms of swollen ovaries . Patients may experience discomfort , comparable to menstrual cramps . Among treated women , there is an abnormally high record of premature births , miscarriages or a show of blood in the early months of pregnancy . A sudden skin allergy is not uncommon . Some women complain of dizziness and blurred vision . Others develop cysts ? small pockets of fluid under pressure ? in the ovaries or uterus . Sometimes the patient 's lower abdomen swells up painfully . In addition , multiple births ? still a frequent possibility for Pergonal and Clomiphene patients ? are not safe for all women , even in good hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to result in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage , and when carried to term entails a more delicate delivery than ordinary birth . The babies are nearly always smaller in size or weight than a single child and frequently need to be placed in incubators or special respiratory cribs . Thus it is obvious , one doctor pointed out , that no woman should attempt to become a Pergonal or Clomiphene patient , at least at the present time , unless she is prepared to spend her entire pregnancy under continuous supervision and deliver her baby in a well-equipped modern hospital . Such facilities , however , are well within the reach of millions of American women . And if and when one or more of the new fertility drugs is approved by the FDA , an estimated one million or more women who are now childless can hope to be offered treatment with one of them . Here is the fairly typical case history of a woman named Marian D. who was accepted last year as a patient at one of the fertility experimental centers in the United States . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for apparent infertility . The family doctor said , " I 'd known Marian since she was eight years old . She had her first menstrual period at age thirteen and menstruated normally until she was nineteen . Then her periods suddenly ? for no apparent reason ? became irregular , sometimes occurring at three-month intervals and lasting for two weeks or more . " One standard treatment for that kind of complaint is curettage ? surgical  | scraping of the womb . Marian underwent this minor surgery several times but with no helpful results . Then , for a brief time , she was treated by X-ray . That did n't help , either . " At 23 years of age , Marian became engaged . She and her fiance had a frank talk with the doctor before their wedding . The doctor explained that , as far as medical examination showed , Marian was not ovulating normally and would probably have difficulty in conceiving children . He held out hope , however . He said that Marian might well be producing healthy egg cells but not releasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you marry and relax , my dear , " he explained kindly , " things may work out well . " His advice was based on sound , oldfashioned medical folklore to the effect that infertile women are often helped more , apparently , by being told to go home and let nature take its course than by being subjected to extensive and radical treatment . In 1963 , however , Marian D. , now married five years and without her hoped-for pregnancy , appealed successfully to a prominent gynecologist and was referred to one of the fertility experimental centers . She said , " I volunteered as a human guinea pig . I went through a long series of examinations and got the overhaul of my life . They even wanted to look into my teeth fillings . They asked me what I usually ate for breakfast , how much outdoor exercise I got , how often my husband and I made love and even whether I liked it ! They asked how many sisters and brothers I had , whether my family life was happy ? all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , because the next thing I knew my husband was asked to report for physical examination . We had n't expected this . My husband was rather angry . The doctor explained to him that about 40 to 50 percent of all sterile marriages are the fault not of the wife but of the husband . He went on to say that it would be an unfair waste of the clinic 's time and money to put me through treatment when Dick 's low sperm count might well be at fault . " My husband pointed out that I 'd suffered from menstrual difficulties for nearly five years before our marriage . All in all , it was a kind of undignified mess that I had n't looked forward to . But the doctor held firm , and my husband wound up by taking a sperm count . It proved to be a little below average but not enough to account for my inability to get pregnant . My husband was put on a sort of fresh-airand-exercise routine , together with a high-protein diet , in the hope that raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment at the clinic . " A sympathetic young physician told Marian that she might experience some discomfort , and that if the treatment were successful she might have twins . " I was so scared , " Marian said , " I did n't have the nerve to ask how the injections were carried out ? and I guess they were so busy it did n't occur to them to tell me . " Marian D. discovered that the injections were given much like penicillin shots ? a swift , single thrust of a needle in the muscular area of the buttocks . The dose was administered every day for twelve days immediately following her menstrual period . Marian and her husband were advised to try once again to conceive a child . Marian visited the clinic every day . She complained of a swollen feeling in her abdomen . " My skirts wo n't zip shut ! " she said . Tests showed there was a slight accumulation of fluid in her abdominal body cells . Her diet was regulated to eliminate salt and reduce fluid intake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fivemonth period . Periodic microscopic examination of cells from her uterus showed encouragingly increased activity . In the third month there was evidence that she was menstruating normally . After the fourth series of shots , there was indication that her ovary had discharged healthy egg cells . And in the fifth month , she became pregnant and eventually gave birth to a nine-pound son . Interestingly , she has continued to menstruate on a normal 28-day cycle ever since the baby 's birth . Currently , all the clinics where experiments on fertility drugs are being carried out have long waiting lists , and there is little immediate chance of more volunteers being accepted . It must be emphasized too that , at least at the time of writing , all these drugs are still experimental . In addition to the side effects mentioned , there may be other , more serious , ones as yet undetected . This is always a possibility with new and relatively untried drugs and should not be discounted . However , if you would like to volunteer for one of the fertility experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or your family doctor , who may refer you to a gynecologist . A gynecologist will be able to tell you whether there is any possibility of your benefiting from drug therapy , and , if so , how to go about applying to one of the experimental fertility clinics . At present there are several hundred women in the United States and in Europe who have conceived children with the aid of one of the new drugs . There are millions more who are desperately waiting for the drugs to become more widely available , in the hope that they too can be helped . Unfortunately , a major percentage of these women are doomed to disappointment ; their infertility can be relieved only when science knows more about what causes it . Even where the cause is known and can apparently be relieved by drug therapy , it is not yet certain whether any or all of these drugs will ever become standard treatment . But the new drugs do signal a major breakthrough in the intensive efforts now being made to overcome involuntary childlessness . Other breakthroughs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
