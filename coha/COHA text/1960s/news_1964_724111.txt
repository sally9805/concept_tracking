txt Democratic leaders believe that the Presidential campaign will strengthen their position in Congress , possibly dramatically . They believe that the nomination of Senator Barry Goldwater by the Republican National Convention has opened the door . to a substantial increase in the Democratic membership of the House of Representatives . More important , Democratic strategists foresee a measurable increase in Administration support in the House , even though some Democratic members may be lost along the way . Southerners Replaced The hypothesis is that any Republican Representatives who ride into office on Mr. Goldwater 's coattails are likely to replace Southern Democrats , most of whom vote with the Administration only when it suits them . On the other hand , new Democrats elected to the House in a Johnson-Goldwater contest are likely to come from the cities and suburbs of the North , Middle West and West and hence hold much more enthusiasm for President Johnson 's programs than the Republicans they replaced . The outlook in the Senate is much less promising for the Democrats than in the House . This is largely because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fall 's election ? 26 of the 35 ? that they almost have nowhere to go but down . Added Seats in Senate In a national Democratic sweep six years ago , the party picked up Senate seats in a few unlikely jurisdictions like North Dakota and Utah . Now those terms are expiring . Barring a Johnson landslide , Republican strategists believe that they have a good chance of retiring Senator Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota , Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah and Senator Stephen M. Young of Ohio and filling the seat being left vacant by the involuntary retirement of Senator J. Howard Edmundson of Oklahoma , who lost a primary fight . Less vulnerable but definitely on the Republican " possible " list lam Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana. , Senator Gale W. Mc'Gee of Wyoming and Senator Ralph W. Yarborough of Texas . The Democrats have their sights set on two Republican seats , those of Senator J. Glenn Beall of Maryland and Senator Edwin L. Mechem of New Mexico . They are hopeful about deposing Senator Hiram L. Fong of Hawaii , Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Williams of Delaware , with Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania a pos sibility . Even if the Republicans should score a net gain of two seats or so in the Senate , the Democratic position will remain ' secure . The line-up is now 6i Democrats and 33 Republicana.1 For the 435 House contests , the Democrats have drawn up a list of some 40 Republican seats they regard as potentially vulnerable if President Johnson runs anywhere near as strongly as the most recent public opinion polls have indicated . In the Northeast , these include the seats being vacated by Clifford G. of Maine and William B. Miller of upstate New York , the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate . Also , those of Louis C. Wyman of New Hampshire , Abner W. Sibal of Connecticut and Steven G. Derounian of New York ; and those of four Pennsylvanians : William S. Curtain , Joseph M. , George A. Goodling and James D. Weaver . In New Jersey , the Democrats are eyeing the districts now represented by Milton W. Glenn and George W. Wallhauser . In the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver P. Bolton , Samuel L.

Other targets are the new Seventh District in Michigan and the seats of Henry C. Schadeberg in Wisconsin , Robert T. and Paul Findley in Illinois , James E. Bromwell , John Kyl and Charles B. Hoeven in Iowa , both Hjalmar C. Nygaard and Don L. Short in North Dakota and James F. Battin in Montana . Rounding out the Democratic list are the districts of Ralph E. Beerman and Dave Martin in Nebraska , Joe Skubitz in Kansas , Ed Foreman in Texas , Lawrence J. Burton and Sherman P. Lloyd in Utah , Bill Stinson in Washington and Don H. Clausen , Del Clawson and Pat Minor Martin in California . With the Republican high command ' still in San Francisco assessing the effect of the Goldwater nomination , no comparable Republican list of Democratic weak spots was available here . However , these are some of the seats Republicans are known to believe reachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Idaho : Ralph R. Harding ; Illinois : William T. Murphy and George E. Shipley ; Indiana : John Brademas ; Kentucky : Frank Chelf ; Minnesota : Alec G. Olsen ; New York : Hugh L. Carey and John M. Murphy . Also , North Carolina : Basil L. Whitener and Roy A. Taylor ; Oklahoma : Victor Wickersham ; South Carolina : Albert W. Watson ; Tennessee : Clifford Davis ; Texas : Lindley Beckworth and Bob Casey , and Virginia : J. Vaughan Gary and John 0 . Marsh Jr . A fairly high proportion of hope over evidence goes into the Congressional calculations of both parties this early in a Presidential campaign , especially one with so many imponderable factors . This much is clear , however . No matter how powerfully Senator Goldwater runs in the fall , it is virtually impossible for him to carry with him a Republican Senate . And it is highly unlikely he can swing enough seats to win control of the House , which is now aligned 257-178 in the Democrats ' favor .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
