txt The House passed and sent to the President today a civil rights bill designed to topple racial barriers in 80 per cent of the nation 's housing . The vote was 250 to 171 . A cheer went up from the packed galleries and there was applause on the floor earlier as Speaker John W. McCormack of Massachusetts announced the 229-to-195 vote by which opponents of the bill were blocked from sending the bill to conference . After that , the final passage was a formality . Outside , still ringing the Capitol , were troops rushed to Washington last week to quell Tiotirg that followed the slaying of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . last Thursday . Effect of Assassination The assassination of Dr. King appeared to have influenced the outcome , despite the insistence by civil rights supporters that the bill would have passed in any event . President Johnson announced at a news conference that he would sign the bill " at a very early date . " He termed the House action " a victory for every American . " Opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tortuous and difficult road , " the President said . " There have been days of sunshine and sorrow . But it is now a finality . " The Senate , too , appeared to be reacting to Dr. King 's slaying and the riots by refusing today to back down on its demands for $75-million for summer jobs for the poor and $25-million for Operation Head Start , a preschool program for poor children . Report Is Rejected The House agreed last week to a conference report that eliminated these funds from a special money bill . The Senate , by 54 to 24 , rejected the report , thus sending the matter back to conference . Civil rights leaders along with liberals in Congress are demanding prompt Congressional action on a wide variety of social action programs in the wake of the riots . President Johnson had planned to address a joint session of Congress Monday night to call for " constructive action " but postponed it . Asked if he had set a new date , he replied : " That has been postponed for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter recess tomorrow . In the House , as in the Senate last month , Republicans provided the margin needed for the passage of the rights bill . While Democrats control both the Senate and House , defections among Southerners had made it impossible for Democrats to pass the bill alone . Seventy-seven Republicans joined 152 Democrats to block the bill from going to conference , while 106 Republicans and 89 Democrats voted to open the way for conference negotiations . The bill does the following : ( Mowers racial barriers , by three stages , in an about 52.6 m. ' ion housing units , including millions of single-family dwellings . ( Provides stiff Federal penalties for persons convicted of intimidating or injuring civil rights workers and Negroes engaged in schooling , housing , voting , registering to vote , jury duty and the use of public facilities .

( Wakes it a Federal crime to travel from one state to another  --  or use radio , television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incite a riot .

The maximum penalty would be a $10,000 fine and five years in prison . ( Extends broad rights to American Indians in their dealings with their tribal governments , the courts and local , state and Federal governments . A similar bill passed the Senate last year but had never cleared the House . A ** Plan The bill would lower housing barriers by three stages . 1 . Effective immediately , it would bar discrimination in the sale or rental of federally owned housing and multiunit dwellings whose mortgages were insured or underwritten by the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration . 2 . Effective Dec. 31 , it would bar discrimination in multiunit housing , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owner occupied dwellings of four or fewer units , such as boarding houses , would be excluded . 3 . Effective Jan. 1 , 1970 , it would bar discrimination in single-family houses sold or rented through real estate brokers . Owners selling their homes without the aid of brokers could discriminate but would not be allowed to use discriminatory signs or other such advertisements . Congressional sources estimate that 80 per cent of housing sale transactions are handled through brokers . The bill offers these remedies against discrimination : ( Conciliation efforts through the Department of Housing and Urban Development . ( IA civil suit in Federal District Court . A complainant could collect damages , lawyer 's fees and costs , and up to $1 , - 000 in punitive damages . ( The Attorney General could seek an injunction if he deter ? mined that a racially motivated pattern of discrimination existed in neighborhoods or developments . Debate Emotional The usually noisy House was quiet at moments during . the emotional debate . " We are being blackmailed , " cried Representative Joe D. Waggonner Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should lower the flag to halfstaff in mourning to this once great nation , " said Representative H. R. Gross , Republican of Iowa . Supporters also went to the well of the House to plead for passage . " It 's an ironic , almost macabre twist of fate that this bill comes to the floor the day after Dr. King 's funeral , " said Representative John B. Anderson , Republican of Illinois . " I legislate not out of fear , but out of concern for the America I love . " He was cheered as he took his seat . There was applause , too , for Representative Emanuel Celler , Democrat of Brooklyn , who said that the bill provided " a small key that will open a large door , " and for Representative William M. McCulloch , Republican of Ohio , who said that " the people of this country are watching , they are waiting for us to act .

Opponents reasoned that the ; march would so irritate many1 members of the House that the I rights bill would be doomed . Three weeks ago , the House , ' Rules Committee , by 8 to 7 , ' blocked prompt action . Yesterday it cleared the bill for floor action .
