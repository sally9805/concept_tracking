txt Cape Kennedy , Fla . The United States scored a major first in space with the Gemini 3 . Pilot Virgil I. Grissom maneuvered his spacecraft manually to change its orbit . He brought it down 50 miles , then steered it sideways some 10 miles , then brought it down another 50 miles . All this was preparatory to reentry . With Gemini 3 so successful , the question now is : What about the next Gemini shot ? Will it be speeded up ? Will the pilots be given assignments now scheduled for later shots ? There are 10 manned Gemini shots , and the program calls for finishing them in 1966.  - -  Program flexible All that can be said at this time is that for the record the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is sticking to its present Gemini schedule . The next Gemini shot will come in " the third quarter of this year , " to quote Christopher C. Craft Jr. , director of the Gemini flight from the ground . It will be a four-day flight , and one or both astronauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't leave the craft . What NASA now is saying is that the present Gemini program is not rigid . Mr. Kraft and his colleagues are careful to say in sticking to the present Gemini flight program that there " now " is no plan to change it  --  and now meant March 23 , 1965 . While officials are careful not to commit themselves to any new duties for Gemini 4 , or even 5 ( both set for this year ) they do not hesitate to discuss what Gemini is going to accomplish . A Gemini spacecraft is to stay in orbit for up to two weeks . The pilots will practice rendezvous on the fifth shot , if not the fourth . Practice in rendezvous and docking will become commonplace in later shots . To leave cabin By some undetermined shot number , an astronaut will leave the craft and learn to live outside the cabin . This will first be done by keeping him attached to the cabin by a rope as in the case of Cosmonaut Alcxei Leonov . Otherwise he might float away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a later Gemini shot he will be let out of the cabin with both an independent life suit and external power strapped to his body . This power unit will propel him in space . Mr. Kraft says flatly that the importance of Astronaut Grissom 's maneuvering of his spacecraft " ca n't be overemphasized . " The purpose of this flight was not really to see if the United States could orbit two men in flight . It knew it could do that as soon as it had a powerful enough booster . This it now has in the Titan 2 , a modified intercontinental ballistic missile . The primary purpose  --  the great leap forward in space  --  this flight accomplished was the manual maneuvering of the craft by the pilot . No one had ever done that before . The Soviets have orbited three men in a spacecraft . They have orbited a woman . They have had one cosmonaut do 81 orbits . They have put two spacecraft up within clays so that the two were orbiting simultaneously . They established their orbits so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have - let a spaceman-step Out ? of his craft and float in space . But they have not done any maneuvering in space yet . Spacecraft ca n't rendezvous or dock without being able to maneuver as did the Molly Brown . And without docking ? and.undocking they can not take on fuel in orbit or let astronauts down to the moon 's surface and then have them rejoin the mother craft . Orbit altered Mr. Kraft was quite right , it .. would pear , in saying that the importance of maneuvering a spacecraft could not be " overemphasized . " Command Pilot Grissom also maneuvered ? the craft to land . This assured the craft 's descent either by rockets or by manual control . By going into an elliptical orbit that brought the craft down to nearly 52 miles above the earth and into the earth 's atmosphere , the Molly Brown was assured of reentry because of atmospheric drag , even if the retrorockets had not worked . It would have been a more difficult and dangerous reentry , but it ? could have been done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
