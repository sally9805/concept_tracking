BEHIND THE FACADE The Second of Three Articles by STEWART ALSOP Atraveler in the Communist countries of Eastern Europe often finds himself wishing that he had X-ray eyes , to see through the outward seeming into people 's minds . If you take a car , as I did on a recent seven-week tour of the Soviet Union 's vast European empire , and if you stop often along the way to talk to people , and to cat and sleep , you can find out a lot about the real shape of things in the captive Communist countries . You can find out a lot more than you can by taking a plane from capital city to capital city , for example . But you can not find out everything . There arc some things which remain puzzling and alien and mysterious . Consider an example ? the wall newspaper in one of the girls ' dormitories at Cluj University in Romania . The girls ' dormitories at Cluj present a startling contrast to the dormitories at Smith or Vassar . The girls sleep four in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much 4s a picture to relieve the convent-like atmosphere . As for the girls themselves , only one or two that I saw wore lipstick , and that of the palest sort  --  personal adornment is frowned upon as " bourgeois " in Romania . Even so , the girls had a certain old-fashioned charm , like girls at a seminary for young ladies in the 1890 's . That is one thing that strikes a Western visitor to the Communist countries  --  a drab sort of old-fashioned primness . You hardly ever see vivid colors , except for a very bright red , always precisely the same shade in all the Communist countries and always used for a political purpose . In the grim little reception hall of the girls ' dormitories at Cluj , for example , there were only two spots of color  --  the red draperies around the big picture of Lenin and around the smaller picture of GheorghiuDej , the Romanian Communist boss ; and the red crepe which festooned the wall newspaper . The wall newspaper was there for a curious reason . Forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , there was a shortage of newsprint , and typed or hand-written bulletins were therefore tacked up on the walls in factories and public meeting places to give the faithful the party line . As one of the Soviet Union 's queer genuflections to the revolution-ary past , these wall newspapers are still tacked up on walls in Russia , although their reason for existence has long since vanished . And so , because whatever is done in Russia must be done in exactly the same way in the Soviet Union 's vast European empire , you see wall newspapers everywhere in Eastern Europe . The leading item in this particular wall newspaper was an article carefully written in a girlish hand in green ink , which the interpreter translated as follows : FOR A LASTING PEACE AMONC ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD . Foremost among the problems that concern all the peoples of the world is the problem of the relaxation of tensions and the liquidation of the cold war , Comrade N. S. Khrushchev has pointed the way toward the liquidation of the cold war in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . We acclaim the proposal of N. S. Khrushchev .. It was at this point that I wished I were equipped with X-ray eyes . For the whole letter was filled with the current platitudes of Communist propaganda  --  every phrase , without exception , was a Communist clich . What was in the girl 's mind as she carefully wrote out the familiar , dreary phrases in green ink ? Did they have some real meaning to her , as the familiar ritual has to a churchgoer ? Or was she , just conceivably , a satirist , a female Jonathan Swift born to blush unseen , and were those pretentious phrases her way of making fun of Communism 's empty pomposities ? Or was she simply an ambitious girl , carefully polishing teacher 's apples ? I wish I knew , for the answer is important . I also wish I really knew the meaning of the peculiar demonstration at the " students ' rally " that night . The rally took place in a hall with a seating capacity for 500 ? there were about 100 empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young and self-conscious way , took their places in a row on the stage . The proceedings began with the awarding of prizes for " voluntary socialist activity . " The prizes were paper-backed novels about the youth of Karl Marx and cheap plastic book bags . About half the prize winners did not show up . After the prize giving , the president of the University Students ' Movement , a rather sternly handsome fellow , got up and read a speech loudly , with seeming conviction , but in an oddly sing-song fashion . Like the wall newspaper , it consisted entirely of Communist cliches : " We must march forward in the building of socialism under the leadership of the P.M.R. " ( The is the Romanian Communist Party . ) There was never a smile , never a joke , never the slightest intimation of originality of thought or word . Al the very end the speaker loudly pronounced the name of Gheorghiu-Dej , Romania 's No . I Communist . On hearing that name , the whole crowd instantly leaped to its feet and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pause ) ... CLAP ... CLAP ... CLAP . Then loudly in unison , three times : " P.M.R .... P.M.R .... P.M.R. ! " On the third " P.M.R. " everybody sat down . A national youth leader got up to address the rally . He was about thirty , a born politician who spoke with a certain force and skill . " You see , " said the interpreter , obviously impressed , " he speaks entirely without notes . " l was not impressed . I have heard a lot of politicians on the stump , and this one had obviously made this speech word for word at least a hundred times . He spoke in favor of " voluntary work in the building of socialism " which would prove that " our future intellectuals , unlike the former intellectual class , do not despise work with the hands . " He wound up with a modest proposal  --  that every student contribute fifty hours of voluntary work to the building of socialism , working on the roads or on the state farms , twenty-flee hours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that each student also collect ten kilos of scrap iron . Again the name of Gheorghiu-Dej , and again the instant reaction : CLAP CLAP ... CLAP .. , ( pause ) ... CLAP ... CLAP ... CLA P ( pause ) ..... P.M.R .... P.M.R .. . . P.M.R. " In my notebook l wrote : " Does it sound more like ' Heil Hitler ' or ' Yale , Yale , Yale " ! Perhaps a bit of both . " The answer is sail tentative in my mind . For , looking around at the students , I was mystified . A good reporter ought to be able to tell the difference between boredom camouflaged as enthusiasm and the real article . But I simply could n't be sure . A few of the boys were obviously bored , and one girl yawned repeatedly  --  but in what crowd is there no one at all who is bored or sleepy ? Many of the others seemed to be enthusiastic , with about the same level of enthusiasm you might rind in a college rally before a basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odor of earnestness emitted by large numbers of young people dedicated to a righteous cause . That last " P.M.R. " ended the political part of the program , and the entertainment that followed was worth waiting for  --  native songs and dances by the students in peasant costume , with much leaping about and shouting . It had an authentic air , since most of the students were from peasant villages , and also a certain sweaty vitality . After the entertainment there was a dance in the basement . The jazz was slow and cautious , and the dance had an air of excessive gentility , like a dance at some small , very strict college many years ago . But the dance must have been very popular , for the basement was crowded to suffocation , and while I was talking to the national youth leader a tremendous banging on the locked doors leading into the basement began . The youth leader instantly marched up to the doors , banged loudly on his side and shouted , " If you do not cease this conduct , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found outside a great milling mass of students waving tickets and trying to get in . Later l lunched with half a dozen or so journalists at the Journalists ' Club ( the former Millionaires ' Club ) in Bucharest . To the journalist on my right , a handsome and clever man and a leading Communist , I confessed that I was mystified by what had seen at the students ' rally and asked for his explanation . " I can understand , " he said , " how to you of the West such a demonstration might seem mystifying and , indeed , I say this frankly  --  some of these demonstrations have become too ritualistic . But you must understand that what you saw was the outward expression of the deep inner spiritual experience of these boys and girls , the experience of helping to build socialism with their own hands . " At this point the man opposite , a pugnacious and far less intelligent fellow and an obvious careerist , broke in . " Yes , " he said , " let me give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty , and she was asked to do voluntary work on the great highway we are building , At first she was angry and said why should I , an old woman , be forced to work on the roads ? But she returned from her first day on the highway with her eyes glowing with enthusiasm . It is wonderful , she said to me , out there on the road in the sunshine , building socialism together with one 's good comrades . " I could not suppress a small giggle , and the man on my right , who was quite shrewd enough to see that even a foolish Westerner could hardly be expected to buy such hogwash as that , tried to shush up the careerist , But it was too late . Nothing is more difficult in Communist countries than to distinguish careerist hogwash from genuine conviction . And yet it is important . all the same , to make the attempt , for conviction is as much an element of national power as tanks or missiles in the ideological struggle which has seized the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , I became convinced that the majority of Soviet citizens , especially the young ones , really do believe essentially what the Soviet regime wants them to believe . ) See THOSE SMUG , SMUG RUSSIANS , The Saturday Evening Post , December 31. 19554 They may dislike Khrushchev and execrate the memory of Stalin , but most of them believe , nevertheless , that their system will ultimately triumph over all other systems , which are caught up in a process of inevitable decay . Why should they not believe such things ? The Russian Revolution is now in its middle age , and only the old have ever been exposed to any real competition in ideas . And the Russian Revolution was . after all , made in Russia . The revolutions in Eastern Europe were not made in the countries of Eastern Europe . They were imposed on those countries by Russia , That is a simple , obvious fact which is nevertheless often overlooked . And it is one reason why I am convinced after my long tour of Eastern Europe and after talking to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people in the satellite countries , including those students I saw that night at Cluj University , do not believe what the Communist regimes want them to believe . Another reason is that , because of their history and geography , it is impossible hermetically to seal the minds of the people of Eastern Europe as the minds of the Russians have been sealed , And the third reason is Hungary . Before the Hungarian revolt in 1956 there was a small but very hard core of Communist fanatics in all the Eastern European countries . They were the True Believers  --  the young men and women who had dreamed great dreams in the cafes and prison cells in the war and prewar years , dreams of the coming time when the rivers would be dammed and the power of the earth harnessed for the good of the people , and all men would be brothers . Dreamers can'be ruthless people , and the need to satisfy the ruthless fanaticism of the True Believers had much to do with the postwar irrationalities of East European Communism  --  the madly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper of dissent . Yet the True Believers were an important instrument in the establishment of total Communist power over half of Europe  --  almost as important as the guns of the Red Army . Now I am convinced there are hardly any True Believers left . In some countries , notably Poland and Hungary , there are almost none left at all . The Soviet tanks which shot down the teen-agers in the streets of Budapest killed at the same time the Communist faith of the True Believers which had somehow survived the miseries and treacheries of the Stalinist years . All Western observers in Eastern Europe agree that this post-Hungary crisis of faith among hard-core Communists is a real thing and an important phenomenon . Among Polish Commu nists , who differ from all other Commu-nists in that they talk quite freely and even make jokes about Russia , the crisis of Communist faith is a favorite subject , and the more intelligent Communists of the other satellites agree in private conversation that the crisis or faith exists . In Poland and Hungary especially , the Communist parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , meetings are unattended , and those who remain active Communists are almost all mere timeservers and careerists . The same is true , to a less striking degree , in the other satellite states and in nonsatellite Yugoslavia as well . My guess , then  --  and it is a rather confident guess  --  is that a lot of the boys and girls who clapped and shouted " P.M.R. " in that hall in Cluj were there because they wanted to see the entertainment and go to the dance ; and that a lot of others were there because they knew that clapping and shouting with the proper enthusiasm would help them get ahead in the world , No doubt some clapped and shouted out of sincere conviction . I remember a tall , gaunt girl with a Mamie Eisenhower hairdo whose eyes shone with an enthusiasm which could not have been simulated , as she clapped her hands , No doubt there were others , children of peasant or worker families , who were grateful to the system for giving them a chance at an education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cluj University were in the hall . And 1 am reasonably certain that the great majority of the boys and girls who were there and who clapped their hands so eagerly knew in their hearts that they lived in a dictatorship imposed by a foreign power ; and that Gheorghiu-Dej , the dictator they saluted with their clapping , was a Russian stooge and quisling . The young people of Eastern Europe , in short , now regard Communism quite cynically as both the instrument of Russian domination of their countries , and at the same time the only open avenue for their own advancement . An ambitious young man in the satellites joins the Communist Party in much the same spirit as an ambitious young man in America might wed the boss 's unlovely daughter . The almost total disappearance of the Communist True Believers in Eastern Europe is a most significant development . But it should not be taken to mean that the satellite Communist regimes have no popular support at all , They may even have a broader base of support than they had in the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believers . It is a different kind of support  --  the support of committed careerists rather than idealist fanatics , The economies of the East European countries have now progressed to the point where a shrewd careerist can do quite well for himself . Americans visiting the satellite capitals these days are apt to be surprised by the sight of tweedy gents in well-shined shoes , well-fed ladies in imitation-French costumes and impressive displays of consumer goods in the stores . What they are seeing , of course , is by no means typical of the whole country  --  there is still aching poverty in the villages and in the industrial slums . And the tweedy gents and stylish ladies represent a tiny fraction of the whole population  --  what disillusioned Yugoslav Communist Milovan Djilas has dubbed " the New Class . " But although the New Class is so small a proportion of the whole population , it is an important phenomenon all the same . Members of the New Class are managers of state enterprises , upper bureaucrats , plus some favored intellectuals . and some professional men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloc , as in the United States , is the most lucrative of all professions . The members of the Ncw Class are rarely True Believers . But like any ruling class they believe deeply  --  indeed passionately  --  in the wisdom of maintaining their own privileged positions . Consider , for example , the case of the huge , mustachioed manager of the state farm at Ujpuszda , in northern Hungary . Rowland Evans of the New Yor4 Herald Tribune and 1 had set out in our car with an interpreter  --  a nice , pleasant-faced journalist , who shied away from all political talk  --  for a tour of the countryside . It is not true , incidentally , that " they show you only what they want you to see " in the satellite countries . In a journey of more than 3000 miles we wandered everywhere at will  --  except in Romania , where we were escorted from border to border  --  and frequently we wandered not at will , since we often got hopelessly lost . On this occasion we chose our route , which led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the places we wanted to stop and the people we interviewed . Our last stop was the state farm at Ujpuszda , which I had spotted from the road . This farm looked precisely like the state farms I had seen in Russia four years previously . State farms were first created by Stalin during the terrible agricultural purges of the 1930 's , and they were hailed by him as the epitome of Communism . A state farm is run like a factory . Whereas in a collective farm the farm workers share  --  or are supposed to share  --  in whatever profits the collective makes and are allowed a small plot of land of their own , on a state farm the workers are paid wages , as in a factory . As in all Communist factories , their wages arc determined by a piecework and speed-up system long ago outlawed by American trade-unions . This state farm seemed to have been transported bodily from Russia . In front of the main administration building , for example , there was the same military-looking , red-decorated bulletin board you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stakhanovites who had " exceeded their norms , " and such announcements as : Fore THE CALF WORKERS : 500 forints extra for each worker if the calves gain 25 kilos in weight in the next three months . 300 forints if there is not more than 7 percent tuberculosis . In his office in the administration building we found the manager  --  a very big man with a huge handle-bar mustache . At first he was surly and suspicious ; he held out his hand to the interpreter and said curtly , " Docunienti . " While the manager was examining the interpreter 's identification papers , Evans and I were examining the manager . We agreed later that what impressed us most was his tweed coat  --  it looked like the very best and softest Scotch tweed . Satisfied by the doctimenti , and astonished to find himself in the presence of two indubitably authentic Americans , the manager began to thaw out . The farm , he explained , was a big one  --  more than 6000 acres , with 300 workers . Like most state farms this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In former times , the manager told us , he had been the head gardener on the estate . At this Evans and I read the same thought in each other 's eyes  --  the manager had liberated that wonderful tweed coat from his former master . Proudly the manager showed us around the calf barns , all solidly built of brick , showed us other outbuildings and machinery , and then some new workers ' housing . All the houses were exactly alike  --  very small , plain brick , square , neat , a kitchen-dining room , a bedroom-living room , a storage room , no running water , one electric-light bulb . One house  --  only one  --  had a television aerial . In the end I gave the manager a picture of him I had taken with my one-minute camera  --  which caused wonder and admiration everywhere in Eastern Europe  --  he gave us each a small bottle of excellent apricot brandy , and we parted friends . He seemed to me an interesting figure  --  for here was an undoubted member of the New Class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly genuinely proud of the huge enterprise he now manages . Despite that marvelous tweed jacket , he no doubt works harder and lives a lot more simply than his former master . But the farm workers who encounter him give him a little bow , the same little bow he no doubt once gave to his former master . And in terms of power and prestige , his situation as boss of a 6000-acre , 300-worker empire is hardly less enviable than that of an aristocrat of the old regime . The manager was a Communist Party member , of course  --  anyone who aspires to high position in the satellites must be a party member . I do n't think he has ever bothered his huge head for a minute about Marxist-Leninist doctrine . Bul I am quite sure that he was and is a loyal supporter of the regime of Hungary 's contemptible Communist quisling , Janos Kadar . From his point of view Communism is a " good thing . " Or consider the case of the live men around the blue-felt table in the chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of the state farm , and so much else in the satellites , what amazed me about the steel mill was how much it was like the steel mills I had seen in Russia . There was the familiar pompous wedding-cake architecture of the main administration building ; the inevitable huge statue of Lenin ; the hortatory signs : WHAT DID You Do TODAY TO FULFILL YOUR NORM AND WHAT WILL You Do TOMORROW ? : the pictures of the Stakhanovites and the admonitions to emulate them ; the wall newspapers ; the overcrowded cafeteria with a smell of bad plumbing . There were the old ladies idly sweeping the sidewalks ; the horse-drawn carts ; the young , obviously healthy workers who did n't have enough to do ; the SATURDAY ' EVENING PUST vast blast furnaces ; the same queer atmosphere of disorganized bustle . After the tour of the factory we went to the chairman 's office to see the chief managers of the factory . This was exactly as in Russia too . There was the plain desk with four telephones , the tong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase of the bedraggled flowers , the big picture of Lenin , the boasts about how the norm had been surpassed , the toasts to " peace and friendship among all peoples . " Talking to the men around the table  --  the chairman , an assistant , the planner of norms , the chief of production , and the young engineer who had acted as our guide in the factory-1 soon learned why the factory seemed to have been bodily transported from Russia . All five had been trained in Russian steel mills , from two to four years at a stretch . They had simply reproduced a Russian steel mill on Bulgarian soil . And they were proud  --  quite genuinely and intensely proud  --  of what they had done . It might not be a very good steel mill  --  it looked remarkably messy and inefficient to my inexpert eyes  --  but at least it was there and it was turning out steel . They were also proud of their own positions . Before , they had been , as they said , " simple workmen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Communism , they were the bosses . Again , I do n't think any one of those men around the table bothered his head about Communist doctrine . But I am sure that all five were firmly loyal to the Communist regime in Bulgaria . But what about the others , the vast majority who are not bosses , who have not become members of the New Class ? The production chief , a man with a great shock of tangled brown hair and vast vitality , volunteered to show us the workers ' apartments , built directly across the road from the steel factory . The workers ' apartments consisted of great gray blocks of flats , plumped down in what was farmland a few years ago . We went first to the Young Workers ' Quarters . The entrance hall , decorated with a bust of Lenin , photographs of Stakhanovites , and the usual slogans  --  LoNo Live THE RUSSIAN-BULGARIAN FRIENDSHIP smelled of bad plumbing , a familiar smell in every Communist country . We climbed past broken window panes to the third floor , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kind of
