txt American Airlines proposed yesterday a 50 per cent reduction in jet coach fares for persons 12 through 21 years of age when seats are not filled by full-fare passengers . The Civil Aeronautics Board must approve the plan before it can become effective , but approval is considered virtually certain in industry circles . American Airlines estimated that 33 million American youngsters would be eligible for the plan . Foreign visitors also would be eligible . American flies to most major cities in the continental United States , except some points in the Southeast and Northwest . It also flies to Mexico City and to Canada . The half-fare service would be available on the entire system if Mexico and Canada authorized It for their areas . Youths eligible for the half ? Are would first have to apply to the airline , show proof of age and pay $3 for identification cards . The cards would show the holder 's birth date and expire on the 22d birthday . Armed with their cards , they could take any American Airlines plane on which seats were available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . The plan , scheduled to become effective on Jan. 27 , would be in effect all year except for the Thursday before Easter Sunday , the Wednesday before and Sunday after Thanksgiving , and between Dec. 15 and Dec. 21 . The airline explained ' that there seldom are empty seats on these ways , anyway . In terms of dollars , the plan brings air fares down to about the level of bus fares and below train fares . Between New York and Los Angeles , for example , the round-trip bus fare is $151.40 . The train fare is $186.93 . For eligible youths , the jet coach round trip would cost $145.10 . Between New York and Chicago , the round-trip bus and train fares are $50.95 and $71.78 respectively . Jet coach half-fare would be $43.70 . A. spokesman for Greyhound Bus Lines , apprised of the plan , said the 12-to-21 years age group represented about a quarter of its riders , but that the company expected to hold a substantial portion of that business because of the " door-to-door " service it ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the plan yesterday , or said they were studying it . Privately , they admitted that if American 's plan went through , they would have to follow suit . 40% of Seats Empty Marion Sadler , American Airlines ' president , said that the plan would help to fill some of the 40 per cent of the seats the airlines now fly empty . If only a quarter of American 's empty seats were filled with half-fare youngsters , Mr. Sadler said , the airline would take in $25 million a year . United States airlines . at American 's instigation , tried a youth fare plan once before , in 1961 , but it proved disastrous , according to one airline source . " The last time , " he said , " they stole us blind . " He said one problem was that under the earlier plan , teen-agers bought up large numbers of seats at discounts and sold them to , adults . And it was difficult for airline personnel to challenge obviously over-age passengers . Mr. Sadler said the identification cards and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier problems , but that certain new problems would have to be watched , notably serving of alcoholic beverages on airplanes . American does not serve liquor to persons under 21 and the in-flight service personnel would have to be very careful about this . Environment at Airports A second problem , Mr. Sadler said , would be to make the environment in airports suitable for teen-agers. - We do n't want them wandering off into bars while they 're waiting for an airplane , and we want to be able to find them , " he said . To accomplish this , he said , American will set up special youth lounges , with soft drink machines and juke boxes , first in Kennedy Airport here and in Los Angeles International Airport as a test . With the youth plan in effect , the number of Americans eligible for reduced air fares will climb to 128 million , the airline said .  --  Military - personnel already are eligible for half-fares under a plan instituted by American several years ago and now available on all other United States airlines under present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling alone . Most airlines now offer a family discount plan , under which the head of the family pays full fare , his spouse two-thirds , and the children one-third . Infants under two go free . Some airlines also offer " golden age " reduced fares for the elderly . In cases where youth plan passengers and military personnel must compete for avail-1 able seats , the airline said , the servicemen will have priority . Once a youth is aboard an airplane , the airline said , he may not be " bumped . "
