Wait Until Dark . A middling mystery thriller is rather like a war : 90% boredom and 10% terror . Wait Until Dark does not fight the percentages . <P> A doll containing two pounds of heroin has fallen inadvertently into the hands of a photographer and his blind wife ( Lee Remick ) . They do not know what it contains , and after the husband is lured away , Lee Remick does not even know where the doll is , though an unlikely-looking safe is part of the living-room furniture . Two musclemen and their brainmaster do know about the doll , and they want it . <P> The crooks concoct an elaborate hoax about being cops , and there is much hokum with rattling of Venetian blinds , fake phone calls , unscrewing of fuses , disguises of voice . But Lee Remick is a sightless Penelope with uncanny perception who carefully unravels in Act II everything that the crooks have carelessly knitted in Act I ; it takes a pretty dedicated mystery fan to follow every purl three , drop one , of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a refrigerator becomes the most electrifying actor in the house . <P> Frederick Knott , who also wrote Dial M for Murder , has left this plot-boiler perforated with illogic . At one point Lee Remick has located the doll , hidden it beyond likelihood of discovery , and decoyed the thugs out of the apartment . Instead of staying to be tortured or killed , she ought to call the police or flee . Playwright Knott seems to have forgotten that to scare a playgoer out of his senses , one must first satisfy his good sense .
