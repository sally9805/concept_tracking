THE NEW REPUBLIC The most difficult thing in the world is to be taken seriously . People go limp in the street , throw bricks through shop windows , and take cold poison , but for all the good it does they might as well be home by the TV . One way or another , a super-sophisticated society will find ways to dismiss them ? as kooks , as victims , or as performers . The medium of their action A Prophetic Minority by Jack Newfield ( New American Library ; $4.75 ) replaces their message : hipsters mean long hair and pot , poor Negroes mean summer riots , Stokely Carmichael means a lively session of Meet the Press . The hippies , the poor blacks , and Stokely Carmichael are , in varying degrees of attachment , elements of the New Left , and they are trying to say something that will be taken seriously ? not about themselves , but about the world in which they are uneasily placed . They have had a measure of success under ground . In some Black Belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghetto districts the young radicals have significant followings . Ordinary people have been " turned on " by SNCC 's organizers in the South , by community unions in Northern slums , by the Scheer campaign for Congress in California , by anti-war and anti-draft programs , farm workers ' strikes , slumlord protests , and school boycotts . But over ground , on the level of public consciousness and visibility , the Movement looms small . Newspaper editors and TV producers demand " victories , " and the product of the New Left has been small , or temporary , or dead-ending : a street light at a crossing in the slums , an integrated lunch counter , control of an anti-poverty advisory board by poor people , relaxation of parietal rules on a college campus . The new structures of society , the embryonic institutions the radicals think necessary to change America are not yet built , not abuilding . And no one ? no one , that is , in the big , visible world ? takes the New Left seriously . Which is not to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already a small shelf of books , and a large stack of magazine articles ( many from this journal ) on the New Left as a Phenomenon ( or Happening , in the current mode ) . The newsmagazines have been through it and gone ; as a Modern Living topic in Time it held attention for a brief period between Skate Boards and God Is Dead . The radicals themselves have produced position papers , manifestoes , letters , personal chronicles and leaflets without number , and without very much coherence . The best of the bunch has been anthologized , but as it turns out , the best is none too good . In any case , the anthology form strengthens the impression of the new radicals as curious specimens , who should be read to find out what they are , not for what they say . Jack Newfield 's survey of the New Left is probably the best quick look at the Movement that we shall have . Newfield is well-placed to write about it . He grew up knowing all about the goings-on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its early days ( on the staff of Students for a Democratic Society ) . He has picketed in New York and has been harassed in Mississippi . He works for The Village Voice , is engaged in a running feud with Irving Howe , and has a continuing friendship with Michael Harrington . He is on speaking terms with John Lindsay , Bobby Kennedy , Bob ( Moses ) Parris , and Tom Hayden . Newfield is aware that American culture has a " spongelike genius for either absorbing or merchandizing all dissent , " but for all that not even he takes his subjects seriously . He sympathizes with them , he finds them fascinating , he divines their origins and has a fair idea of where they 're going , and suspect he would tell them to wear their rubbers if it were raining , or get some rest if they had been working too hard . But in his accounts , the New Left turns out to be another transient phenomenon , a point on the historical continuum : " In the loxes it was radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroism of the trenches . In the 1950 's it was the cultivation of the private . Now , halfway through the decade , it is once again the ideal of social action . . . . " Now you see it , now you do n't . The hazard of such analysis is that history comes out sounding like a script for You Are There . Walter Cronkite speaks : " What happened in Greensboro , North Carolina , on February 1 , went unreported in The New York Times the next day , but it had the effect of the Boston Tea Party . It was the single spark that was to ignite the conscience of white America and the hope of black America . The four freshmen from a Jim Crow college who sat-in that day in Greensboro 's downtown F. W. Woolworth could hardly sense the historic significance of their deed . No one , not John Kennedy , then starting his bid for the presidency , not Martin Luther King , then a Moses without a movement , not George Wallace , then running for governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of coffee would set in motion a chain . . . " Newfield 's infatuation with the melodrama of history leads him to compress events and personalize them . The result is a mixture of Barbara Tuchman and Jimmy Breslin ( " Your name is David Lloyd George , and all your life you 've wanted to be Prime Minister " ) . It encourages the collection of categories ? of people , attitudes , ideologies , and events . Newfield has boxes for everyone and everything . There is the Hereditary Left and the New Left , the THE NEW REPUBLIC Young Left and the Adult Left , the Ex-Radical Left , the Social Democrat Left , the Romantic Left , the Humanist Liberal Left , and the Nat Hentoff Left ( for some reason , Hentoff , the writer and jazz critic , has a box all for himself ; Newfield thinks he is the worst thing to come down the pike in years ) . What may not be so clear is that there is also a Newfield Left . He has a good idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the True Movement ? is appropriate to it . All others are " stupid " ( as Newfield calls Progressive Labor ) or " tragic " ( as he sees Carmichael 's SNCC ) . The assumption of the Newfield Left is that democracy somehow renews itself in every generation ( via a " prophetic minority " ) and that the purpose of radicalism is to convince the Establishment of what must be done . He quotes , approvingly , a line from Paul Booth , a former SDS officer : " Maybe if we can do some successful community organizing now , it will be a spur to get King , Reuther and the churches to do the same thing themselves next year . " In fact , it has , but the consequence seems to be that the Kings and Reuthers ( and the War on Poverty , if it could ) merely co-opt radical energies . That may be the New Reform , but it is hardly the New Radicalism . The evolution cf the New Left , Newfield says , will be seen in the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Dylan 's poems will be taught in college classrooms . . . , Paul Booth , Julian Bond , and Carmichael will be the leaders of adult protest movements . . . . Torn Hayden , Robb Burlage , and Bob Parris will be major social critics . " At best , the Movement is a Training Program for careers in social criticism , and a ginger group to spur the Democratic Party to do something about war , poverty , and alienation . To take the New Left seriously is to see America as a monster , capable of devouring everything and changing not a bit . It is to reject the notion that in every decade the society gets a little bit better . For a serious writer , it is to tell the Movement about itself , not characterize it for a pop audience . No one has done that job yet . THE NEW REPUBLIC In Washington today it is considered " square " to be greatly alarmed over the influence of lobbying or the spread of monopoly . These are regarded by many as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures from business , labor and consumers . To those who hold this view James Deakin is a square . Twelve years as a Washington correspondent for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch have convinced him that lobbying is a growing , not a diminishing , danger to our form of government . Contending pressure groups do not exert equal , or nearly equal , power on government . Monopoly industrial power so far outweighs the other forces at work that organized lobbying advances the greatest good of a select few most of the time , Deakin 's investigations disclose . This comes as no surprise to those who have read , let alone studied , the Lobbying Act of 1046 which Congress passed to reform the system . Its purpose was to establish rules of fair play in the lobbying trade . Few people today , including Mr. Deakin , subscribe to the proposition that lobbies are inherently bad and should be outlawed , as Justice Hugo Black advocated when he was a senator . The last Congress to legislate reforms in 1.046 sought instead to distinguish the professional lobbyist from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1046 measure therefore limited its application to those whose principal purpose ( my italics ) is to influence legislation for pay . In order to pass their bill , its sponsors bargained for votes by agreeing to make no mention of what lobbyists could or could not do within the law . What finally went on the books was the sole requirement that lobbyistsfor-hire register with the Congress , report their income and its sources and how much of it they spend in lobbying . Twenty years of life under this puny law has produced predictably puny results . As Deakin reports : " The private interest lobby operates without any effective rules or limitations . There is a lobbying law , but it is a mockery . " The Lobbyists is largely given over to documenting that charge . The phrase " principal purpose " in the law opened a loophole a mile wide for trade associations and their employers . Washington representatives of those organizations immediately claimed exemption on the ground that direct lobbying of members of Congress is only part , not the principal purpose , of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Capitol Hill have successfully declined to register under the Lobbying Act , using this legal alibi . To those who could not get through the " principal purpose " escape hatch , the Supreme Court opened a wider exit in 1954 . The 15146 Lobbying Act as drawn applies only to direct pressure on members of Congress , the Court ruled in US v fiarriss , That made life sweet and easy for those who make a living building up pressure at the " grassroots " ? wherever that may be ? for one well-heeled cause or another . Mr. Deakin details what the Court decision plus the vagaries of the 1046 Act have made possible for the enterprising lobbyist . Item : The President of E. I. du Pont , Crawford W. Greenewalt , personally pounded congressional corridors for three months to put through a special interest stockholders ' tax relief bill for his company . Most congressmen and administration officials of any importance to his cause received the honor of a call from Greenewalt during that time . His bill passed and President Kennedy signed it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is not paid for the " principal purpose " of lobbying , du Pont officials explained .
