There has never been anything to compare with the sound of a Mighty Wurlitzer in full cry . Its rumbling , trumpeting majesty , its cooing , whimpering intimacy brought shivery pleasure to a generation of balcony sitters back in the golden age of the movie palace ; saccharine with sentiment one moment , it was a hell-for-leather Marine marching band the next , and for many a movie fan , when the Wurlitzer sank out of sight into the bowels of the orchestra pit , the best part of the show was over . <P> Most cinemagoers today have forgotten the Mighty Wurlitzer along with the choruses of Sunkist Beauties , the personality bandleaders , and the bouncing ball - all victims of the talking picture . But there is one group that still remembers : a fiercely dedicated underground called the American Association of Theatre Organ Enthusiasts . Like the electric-trolley buffs and the antique-auto fanciers , the Enthusiasts are a diehard coterie , with a single-minded mission : to save those mighty relics of the recent past from the wrecker 's hammer . <P> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters in return for the privilege of holding Sunday-morning rallies , where everybody gets a chance to noodle before the house opens for business . But the real zealots remove complete organs from doomed movie palaces ( or theaters where they have been neglected , unplayed and unloved ) and install them in , under , and behind their homes . <P> <P> Monster in the House . It is no small undertaking , for a Mighty Wurlitzer is like an iceberg ; the largest portion of it is invisible . Hidden behind ornate grilles on either side of the stage in a theater are a number of rooms , each bristling with ranks of pipe ( one rank sounds like a flute , another a musical foghorn , a saxophone , a violin , a trumpet ) or the percussion instruments , ranging from a grand piano to a castanet , which gives the Wurlitzer its one-man-band versatility . These organ chambers must be duplicated in a home installation , and even the smallest organ needs more space than a kitchen for its hundreds of pipes , which vary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restoring a wilted Wurlitzer can be both costly and timeconsuming . Last year United Air Lines Captain Erwin Young installed an organ out of the Regent Theater in Harrisburg , Pa. , in his home near Mount Vernon in Virginia . Less mighty than most , Young 's Wurlitzer has a two-manual console and seven ranks of pipes . But it has cost him more than $10,000 to purchase , ship , and install it in the new cinder-block and brick annex that he built for it behind his house . The work of wiring , releathering , tuning , and voicing took unnumbered hours . Sighs Young 's wife : " I 'm a Wurlitzer widow . " <P>
