In his gleaming white uwe , a kind of nightshirt decorated with lace , Nigeria 's delegate made quite a sight on the rostrum of the U.N . General Assembly . And his words made quite a stir among the assembled delegates . " I am losing confidence in the great powers , " cried chubby Jaja Wachuku , lambasting both East and West for failing to end their quarrels . " They are climbing from the pedestal of greatness to the pedestal of insanity . We expect leadership from them ; they give us destruction . We expect wisdom from them ; they give us lack of knowledge . We expect objectivity from them ; they present us with blurred vision . " <P> It was Wachuku 's debut as Nigeria 's new Foreign Minister , and the verbal swagger reflected his country 's pride in being Africa 's most populous nation ( 40 million ) . It also reflected the fact that the new , half-civilized African states do not enter the world stage with any shyness . Only one year after his land reached nationhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world : " I am serving notice ... " ( to South Africa ) , " Things we want ... " ( from Portugal ) . <P> Up from Iboland . Despite a reputation for being emotional and showy , Jaja Wachuku at 42 stands head and shoulders above most of his African brethren at the U.N. , in ability and common sense . Descendant of 20 generations of African chiefs in the Ibo country of Eastern Nigeria , he went to West Africa 's public schools , then won a place at Dublin 's Trinity College , where a law degree came easily , along with a medal for oratory . <P> After a legal career at home , Wachuku made his way up the political ladder under Eastern Nigeria 's remarkable , U.S.-educated Dr. Nnamdi ( " Zik " ) Azikiwe , now Governor General ; this is no great political asset these days , since Nigeria is largely in the hands not of the Easterners , but of their rivals , the Moslem Northerners , notably Prime Minister Balewa . But whatever his political future at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comes naturally to the political firebrands of Iboland . <P> Trace of Scorn . Like most other African delegates , he sees self-determination as an issue only among colonial people , not in such a place as Berlin , which he airily dismisses as a matter of power politics . But while most Africans carefully concealed their opposition to the Red proposal to run the U.N . by troika-so as not to anger Moscow-Wachuku spoke out bluntly against it : " We do not agree with the Soviet Union about the troika proposal . That would not work . ' ' <P> And with just a trace of scorn in his voice , he suggested that if the big powers could not really get together on a successor to Dag Hammarskjold , the problem might be turned over to someone else-the Africans themselves . " We , the smaller states , will produce one , " declared Wachuku , " and will give him our fullest support . That is how we do things in Africa . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
