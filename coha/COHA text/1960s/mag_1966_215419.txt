Hull down amidst the garbage , the Soviet trawler was fishing for intelligence . All day it had wallowed along in the wake of the U.S. aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt , scooping up gobs of creamed beef and soggy lettuce in hopes of finding a classified document inadvertently mixed in the mess . Suddenly another American carrier reared on the horizon , and the Russian skipper bellowed an order . Snorting black diesel smoke and heeling heavily to port , his trawler set a course straight for the newcomer . The chase was on . <P> <P> For an hour and 13 minutes the converted Russian tuna boat chased one of the mightiest ships of the Seventh Fleet ; in turn , it was chased by one of the scruffiest vessels in the U.S. Navy . The U.S.S. Conserver is a rust-pitted , rickety tug , built in 1945 and capable of a scant 14 knots ( " with plenty of wind and a little bit of lying " ) . Nonetheless , it managed to close on the trawler 's starboard side and station itself between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a collision , then at least an embarrassing change of course on the carrier 's part . Frustrated , the Russian ship went back to sniff among the flotsam . <P> Rules of the Road . It was another typical day on Yankee Station , the patch of the 45,000-sq. - mi . Tonkin Gulf from which U.S. Task Force 77 launch es its air strikes on North Viet Nam . Ever since the 33-ship force arrived , it has been tailed by one or another of the snoopy Soviet trawlers . Equipped with sophisticated electronic gear , the Russian " skunks " ( as they are pungently known in Navy parlance ) keep a close watch on U.S. air operations , flash their information to beleaguered Hanoi , and do their best to monitor the radars and radios of American ships and planes . From time to time , they make a dash at the U.S. ships in hopes of scaring American skippers into violent evasive maneuvers that could result in a collision with one of the task force 's screening destroyers . <P> The Russians justify their presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and when they move close to U.S. ships they fly the two red balls and white diamond that identify a vessel engaged in underwater search . International rules of the road give such a ship the right of way , and the Russians use the rules liberally to push into American formations . <P> On the Fantail . The Conserver 's C.O. , Lieut . Commander Fred Hilder , 34 , a plump , pipe-smoking Pennsylvanian , has deep respect for the current Soviet captain 's pushing ability . Says Hilder : " He 's a hell of a big bear of a man , barechested , and wears a white cloth to shade his head from the sun . And he 's got a ship that can turn on a dime . " <P> Most of the time , the Conserver and the Russian trawler Gidrofon ( Hydrophone ) , lie dead in the water , the ' two crews gawking at each other through binoculars . The Russians sunbathe and swim from a rubber life raft ; the Americans lounge on the fantail , reading or tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
