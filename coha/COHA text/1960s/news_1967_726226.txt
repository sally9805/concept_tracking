txt Letters to the Editor of The Times Letters to the Editor of The Times Dr. King 's Advocacy of Resistance To the Editor : I , too , share Dr. Martin Luther King 's views that we never should have become involved in the Vietnam war . Nevertheless , I feel that his latest pronouncements on the subject are fraught with dangerous consequences to the future of our democratic system . It would nullify the theory of rule by representation and give to each individual citizen the right to decide whether an act of government Is illegal . It would be up to the individual to decide which law he would obey and which he would not . The result is the same even though this doctrine be clothed with the cloak of obedience to conscience . Dr. King advises resistance to serving in the armed forces by pleading conscientious objection . The logical implication of his views is that if the properly constituted authorities rejected the plea , resistance and refusal to serve would still prevail . Dr. King 's opposition to the law has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President and the State Department be urged to seek every means possible to putting an end to the conflict . I would agree that we urge them to adopt a policy of immediate cessation of the bombing of Vietnam . But it is a far different matter to encourage illegal actions which would only bring on chaos and anarchy and bloodshed in our own land . Editorial April 7 . IRVING SWEET New York , April 5 , 1967 ? Use of Napalm To the Editor : In The New York Times for Feb. 13 there is a. short column mentioning that the Portuguese Government has been using napalm against the rebels in Angola . In your issue for March 29 there is a column mentioning that the Government of Bolivia is using the same weapon against the guerrilla movement in that country . Whose napalm ? DONALD GARDNER New York , March 30 , 1967 ? Student Exemption To the Editor : Difficult as it is for a college student with post-graduate plans to seem . impartial to the proposals of the President 's Advisory Committee on Selective Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? the right to dispose of his life as he sees fit  --  bartered away to the army on a lottery ticket . There are three inducements short of compulsion which encourage an individual to enlist ; they are the opportunities offered him by the Army , the extent to which he thinks the freedom afforded him by his country is threatened and the extent to which he values this freedom . If the first of these inducements is small , it can be enhanced by increasing the pay of enlisted men . If , onsthe other hand , there is no threat to the nation 's security , then it is just as well that no one enlist . Finally , if there is a real threat to the citizens ' freedom , and still no one enlists , then it would seem questionable whether it is worth while defending such people in the first place . In short , there is no need for a draft  --  but if we must continue to live with the evil , it should be made as small a burden as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed lottery , is most reasonable . The same principle which is involved in the progressive income tax is involved here : those who Will be hurt the most by paying shall pay the least . It is the student who pays the most in being drafted . He sacrifices the crucial years of his life when he should be preparing for his career ; he also loses time to those of his peers who are not drafted and get a head start in life . The nonstudent , however , is not so likely to be engaged in a profession which requires a life 's dedication ; he can more readily afford an interruption in his life , and is more likely to gain froth experience in the army than the average college student with higher aspirations . This is not to say that it is right to draft the uneducated ; the point is that they will lose less than students , who , through education , have the most freedom to lose . DALE H. GIERINGER Cambridge , Mass . March 28 , 1967 ? Haryou 's Past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great newspaper undertakes to chastise a public official for doing his duty . Yet that is what The Times did in its April 1 editorial " More Politics With Poverty . " You based your criticism of me on the fact that the HaryouAct report by the Controller 's auditors is , as you put it , " past history " and should presumably therefore be filed and forgotten . This would be a flagrant violation of my statutory obligation . I would call your attention to the fact that the report covers the period to June 30 , 1966 , which can hardly be considered very far past . It stresses that there have been significant improvements in fiscal management , many of which , incidentally , were initiated by my office . It also points to a number of fiscal practices which are " still not acceptable , " and makes 44 detailed recommendations for fiscal management improvements in Haryou Act . The Haryou-Act audit represents not my own evaluation , but that of a , team . of auditors in the office of the Controller . These auditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their field . Their politics are unknown to me . If I thought for one moment that they were motivated by anything other than their professional and statutory obligations , I would be the first to take appropriate corrective action . Blame for Delays Moreover , my office has been most diligent in efforts to cooperate with Haryou-Act to resolve its many continuing problems . Too frequently  --  as again in your editorial  --  this office has been unfairly criticized for delays when the responsibility for delay properly belonged elsewhere . Haryou-Act officials themselves can attest to this . I would also call your attention to the fact that the auditors ' report was issued without comment . As your own reporter can testify , newspapers and other cornmunications media were told nothing more than that the report was completed and available on request at the Controller 's office . Neither I nor any of my staff made any comment in connection with the report . The advice contained in your editorial that I should " speak up , of course , " in the event of " fraud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with accepted governmental practice , copies of the Haryou-Act report were sent , on the day it was issued , to the Mayor , to Haryou-Act , the District Attorney , the Commissioner of Investigation , and to all other agencies concerned . Haryou-Act is one of the great programs in the nation 's war on poverty . It has had and still has the capacity to stand out as a beacon in this area of public concern and community action . Every effort must be exerted and every precaution taken toward the achievement of its goals . I agree with you that " the real challenge now is the future , not the past . " But in order to make that future more bright for the poor of Harlem , errors of the past that still exist must be corrected , and I mean to do all in my power to see that they are corrected . I would hope that in exhorting others not to play politics with poverty , The Times would be more careful not to do so itself . MARIO A. PROCACCINO Controller City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? State Lottery Opposed To the Editor : For one who has regretted The Times 's position which has favored off-track betting , it was most interesting to find the statement in your lead editorial of March 30 that : " . . . the lottery can not be a financial success unless many citizens who can least afford it are lured into buying tickets at two dollars each . " What a miserable business this is for this proud city and state to embark on . We appear simply to lack the leadership and guts to impose a fair and equitable tax . Instead , we resort to a form of revenue raising which , as proved in England , will place the tax burden on those " who can least afford it , " and will make this city and state parties to an indefensible program of " luring " these lowincome people into risking their inadequate resources on a 30,000-to-1 pie-in-the-sky shot . It is no answer to say people would bet anyway . The question is whether you want the state to promote this tricky way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would dare impose a tax directly . Your concern that " too many lotteries may kill the goose before it lays any eggs " leads one to hope that we may soon come back and kill the goose in us that laid this particular egg  --  the whole lottery idea ? and adopt an equitable tax program that faces up to our responsibilities . ETHAN A. HITCHCOCK New York , April 5 , 1967 ? Segregation by Religion To the Editor : Your editorial arguments March 30 for continuing to disallow tax support for churchsponsored schools are good ones . May I advance yet one more ? Those who conduct parochial schools segregate according to religious belief . Their youngsters , during formative years when lifelong attitudes are shaped , are put in a special category based on faith . We 're ashamed to have race or color keeping children apart , but here , with no apparent shame , creed does so . It is , I suggest , an unhealthy thing in our midst today , even without it being underwritten by tax money . To go the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tab for segregation based on religion  --  this flies in the face of reason . It is not social progress , but a setback for it . If society as a whole is going to post reward money , it should be for new unity  --  not old divisiveness . RAY HARVEY Great Neck , L. I. March 29 , 1967 ? Limit on Air Travel To the Editor : There is much wailing and hand-wringing about the problem of where to locate more jet airports . I have yet to notice anyone making the simple though perhaps treasonable suggestion that we build no more airports and solve the problem by limiting air traffic . Huge subsidies to the airlines given in the name of national defense pay for bigger and faster planes and cheaper tickets . Mostly this serves to help businessmen who make that fast buck a little faster , and then to speed them ( perhaps exhausted by business trips ) to fun places for rest and spiritual renewal . This kind of progress has only limited appeal to the earthbound millions who live under the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster planes for the military , let us develop them in Governmentoperated facilities located away from innocent bystanders . Then let us revive for air travelers that beautiful old question , " Is this trip necessary ? " ROBERT JOSEPHY New York , April 4 , 1967
