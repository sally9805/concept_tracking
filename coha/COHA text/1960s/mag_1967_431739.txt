 | The Song That Took a City I N ISRAEL today , from one end of the country to the other , one song is sung : " Yerushala'im Shel Zahav , " " Jerusalem of Gold . " Within three weeks it became both national hymn and prayer . Over 30 versions compete for sales in Israel . Eddie Fisher has recorded it in London , Larry Adler plays it on the harmonica , and it has now been released in America . " Jerusalem of Gold " has penetrated the very marrow of every Israeli , and lives on as a reminder of the six-day war in June . In Tel Aviv , Naomi Shemer , long black hair framing a face from a Gauguin painting , sits and ponders her latest creation . For her , it was a miracle which began on May 15 , 1967 . Some 3500 people had crowded into Nation Hall in modern Jerusalem to attend the annual song festival commemorating Israeli Independence Day . This year ; five of the country 's top composers had been commissioned to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to write about anything they wanted , but Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem had expressed a strong wish that one of the five compose a song about Jerusalem . Four were not interested . Naomi Shemer , 34 , popular composer of more than 200 songs , accepted . For two months she wrote nothing at all . But as she went about her daily activities , she thought about the Jerusalem she had known as a girl . She remembered how her Polish parents spoke of their own birth-112  | place of Vilna as " the Jerusalem of Diaspora " ? as if every other city could only be second-best . She remembered the colors , the sounds , the silent mood of Jerusalem , her childhood visits to biblical places , closed forever to her since 1948 . She thought , too , of a story from the Talmud in which the wife of the great Rabbi Akiva lived in poverty years so that her husband might pursue his studies . When Rabbi Akiva became a famous and learned man , he rewarded his wife with a Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the ancient city , to be worn as a symbol her devotion . Naomi Shemer took the Talmudic phrase , " Yerushala'im shel zahav , " Jerusalem made of gold , " and used it as the title for her song . It was to be a song of nostalgia , an intimate regret for a city she had personally lost . " Jerusalem of gold , of copper and of light , " went the refrain ; then , quoting from the medieval Hebrew writer , Yehuda Halevi , she continued , " Let me be a violin for all your songs .... " For the first time in modern song , she referred to the " ancient wall " which Jerusalem " carries around her heart , " and talked of the sights of the old city , sights Jews of today would never see : The water cisterns are dry , The marketplace is empty . We can not visit our temple in the ancient city , Where winds wail in the rocky caves @# Over the mountains . We can not go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lips like a seraphim 's kiss , Let me not forget thee , 0 Jerusalem of gold ! At Nation Hall in Jerusalem , it was already close to midnight when the song was sung . Fourteen other melodies had already been performed to full orchestral accompaniment and , polite applause . Then a young girl , discovered by the composer herself only a few days before , and unknown to the general audience , walked out on stage . Her only accompaniment was her guitar . As she sang " Yerushala'im Shel Zahav , " the audience grew hushed . When the girl finished there was a second of silence , then earsplitting applause for nearly seven minutes . Naomi Shemer 's personal sense of loss , it turned out , was every Israeli 's . " Jerusalem of Gold " had to be played once more , by popular demand . This time ? the second time the song had ever been performed ? the entire audience joined in the refrain . On the same night that the Jewish audience was singing of a Jerusalem they would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sinai Peninsula . In the days after Naomi Shemer 's song was premiered , the soldiers of Israel began to leave their homes and prepare for battle . They took with them almost no personal belongings , but somecaves how ? as the song was played over  | and over on the radio during the early days of mobilization ? they took the song . Then the telephone calls and letters began . Soldiers wrote to tell Naomi Shemer how they sang her song in the fields during the evening . Performers called to ask if they might begin and end their programs for the military with her song , since the soldiers inevitably requested it . A high member of the armed forces called to invite Miss Shemer to sing her song for the troops stationed around Jerusalem . Although she does not often perform , she accepted . Many of the faces in her audiences she recognized ? doctors , lawyers , people she saw every day in the small country of Israel . Some , she remembered , had fought in 1948 and 1956 . They stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a truck breaking the blackness of the night , and she sang to them . Loudly , with determination in their voices , the soldiers joined in the refrain . On Sunday , June 4 , Naomi Shemer was called to one of the army 's central command posts , to be given a new troop-entertainment assignment . She was introduced to some of the top military leaders in Israel , including Brig . Gen. Ezer Weitzman , deputy to Maj. Gen. Itzhak Rabin , and Brig . Gen. Ariel Sharon , division commander who was to lead one of the main thrusts of the Sinai campaign . Sharon turned to her , and in his usual blunt fashion said , " It 's important you should come to sing for us . " It was arranged for Naomi Shemer to g down to Sharon 's base in the Negev in Ezer Weitzman 's plane . Late that afternoon the songwriter from Tel Aviv and the deputy cont. mander of Israel 's armed forces flew together to the encampment of Sharon 's troops in the south . Dinner that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked much . After dinner the young woo an waited to be asked to sing , but she was not . Finally , Sharon 's aide drew her aside . " The war will be tough , he began . " And we have reason t believe it will be soon ? very soon have decided there will be n singing tonight . " She said nothin " Still , " he added , " you do not know how important it is to us to ha you here . It 's difficult to explain , " continued , " but you are a poet , musician ? and somehow we want someone with soul to share this tit with us . " Late that night , very late , the rue moved out and , on Monday mor ing , radios announced that war ha broken out . Naomi Shemer set o to help in the only way she knew On Tuesday she joined the troo outside Rafa , singing for them in the evening . On Wednesday the moved to El Arish , where scatter infantry fighting was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a column built , ironically , by the Egyptians commemorate their 1956 " victory over the Israelis in Sinai . Someone had a transistor radio Suddenly an announcer broke into 1967 THE SONG THAT TOOK A CITY rrs the music . " The city of Jerusalem has been taken ! " The program switched to Jerusalem itself . Gunfire would be heard behind the announcer 's voice , as he described the paratroopers ' block-by-block fight into t he heart of the old city . Now some the troops were advancing toward the Wailing Wall , he said . Then , in t lie background , indistinctly at first , there was the sound of a song ? or a hymn , rather ? sung by what sounded like hundreds of men , in hoarse voices , gasping for breath between lines : " Yerushala'im shel zahav , veshel nechoshet veshel or Halo Icchol shiraich ani kinor . " ( " Jerusalem of gold , of copper and of light , Let me be a violin for all your songs ! " ) Naomi Shemer , crouched by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the announcer 's description of the tanks and trucks coming into the city , many of them plastered with banners reading , " Yerushala'im shel zahav . " Tears ran down her cheeks . Then , in the middle of the sounds of battle in El Arish and in Jerusalem , a very small , personal , professional thought occurred to her : she would have to rewrite the second stanza of her song . There was no longer any need for nostalgia : Jerusalem was theirs ! Later that evening , when the Israeli soldiers had gathered in their camp in the desert , the young woman got up before them . " I shall sing for you a stanza I have just added to Jerusalem of Gold , ' " she told them . " Because when I first wrote the song , Jerusalem was just a beautiful dream for all of us . And now , " she added , " it belongs to us ! " And as the soldiers listened , she sang : We have come back now to the water cisterns , Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard From the Wailing Wall in the ancient city .
