Africa 's new nations last week gave an alarming display of emotionalism and political immaturity . <P> It happened over a U.N . speech by South Africa 's Foreign Minister Eric Louw , who offered a provocative whitewash of his country 's apartheid policy , previously condemned by the U.N . While he was clearly practicing doublethink in his contention that South Africa 's rigidly repressed blacks are actually enjoying blissful freedom and enlightened education , Louw also uttered some truths and half-truths that hit the mark . Example : he stressed the Africans ' high vulnerability to blandishments by the Soviet bloc , " which conveniently ignores conditions existing in Hungary and in the Soviet Union 's occupied or colonial territories . " Added Louw : " The ruler of Ghana is flirting with Moscow and Peking . Guinea , soon after being given its independence , promptly became a disciple of Moscow . Mali appears to be going the same way . " He also pointed out-accurately-that living conditions in the continent 's two oldest black states , Ethiopia and Liberia , are " appalling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their contributions to the U.N . budget constitute a mere 2% of the total-most of which they have not yet paid . <P> The African delegates were incensed and Liberia 's Ambassador Henry Ford Cooper demanded that the speech be stricken from the record . It was an unprecedented challenge to the one institution that makes the U.N . General Assembly important-free speech . Only later did the more reflective among the Africans suggest retreat to the less harsh course of a vote of censure . The grounds : Louw 's speech had been " offensive , fictitious and erroneous . " Precipitately , a ballot was taken and the motion carried by 67 votes to South Africa 's 1 , with 20 delegates abstaining and 9 ( including the U.S. ) " not participating " in the vote at all . Adlai Stevenson , who was absent , later lamely explained the U.S. position : while disagreeing with South Africa 's apartheid policy , the U.S. upholds every speaker 's right to be heard . <P> None of the Africans seemed to consider that innumerable " offensive , fictitious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Communists ( including Khrushchev 's shoe-pounding and other Reds ' denunciation of Dag Hammarskjold as " Lumumba 's murderer " ) without the West 's calling for censure . Some Africans went even farther . <P> Ghana , for one , lobbied to have South Africa expelled from the U.N . That scheme raised some fascinating questions . By Ghana 's rule that South Africa is not fit to be a member because it defies U.N . principles , could Red China , which actually waged war against the U.N . in Korea , ever attain U.N . membership ? Could Russia and the regime of Janos Kadar , which defied the U.N . on the Hungarian question , retain their U.N . seats ? On such matters , the African states seemed resolutely dedicated to a double standard .
