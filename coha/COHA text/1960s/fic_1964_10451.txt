faint ! " laughing and then hurt : " She 's only a person , you know . " He 's afraid he 'll catch what we have , " Deborah said , and they all laughed , because Hobbs had caught it , and died from it too . The expedition neared them . " Get up off the floor , will you please ? " the head ward nurse said to the group of patients sitting against the walls of the hall and corridor . Deborah looked at the Nose . " Obstacle , " she said . She meant that she and the other patients with feet stuck out before the terrified man were like the contrivances in the obstacle courses that men must run through in their military training ; that she and they understood their substitution as " the horrors of war , " and that they would try to fulfill the Army 's desire that this man 's training be rigorous . But the nurses neither laughed nor understood , and passed by with another admonition about getting off the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody always sat on the floor and it was only when guests came that the nurses , like suburban wives clucked at the dust and wished that " things were neater . " Constantia was beginning to work herself up into an allnighthowl , when the ward door opened and McPherson let himself in . Deborah looked hard at him , saw everyone suddenlygo easier , and said meaningfully , " They should have changed the lock . " She was thinking that McPherson 's key-turn and incoming was of a completely different order from the one which had preceded it  --  as different as if there had been different doors and different locks . She felt obscurely that the words had somehow done her injury , and so she went over them , seeking the culprit . " They . . . should ... have . . . changed . . . the . . . lock . "  |p101McPherson  said , " I do n't like this key business anyway . " Carla looked around , as Deborah had just before , knowing that no one understood , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hatred . She sat back quietly . They were all glad that McPherson was there , and because feeling this meant that they were vulnerable , they had to try to hide it . " Without those keys you would n't know yourself from us ! " But McPherson only laughed  --  a laughter at himself ; not at them . " We 're not so different , " he said , and went into the nursing station . " Who is he kidding ! " Helene said . There was no malice in her statement ; she was merely hurrying to rebuild the wall that he had breached . She turned and disappeared into her limbo , and because McPherson 's afterimage still hung in the air there were no catty remarks about her fadeout . But when the procession of magi passed by once more , bearing with them the Nose , rigid and clamp-jawed with fear , no one could withhold the cruelty which seemed to each her true and naturalself . Helene shuddered as he passed ; Carla looked blank ; Mary , always inappropriately gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bodkins , here comes another gas customer ! " " Let 's call him Hobbs 's Leviathan , because he may be a whale of a lot worse ! " " Their religion does n't permit them to commit suicide , " Sylvia said from her place against the wall . The ward was suddenly silent . Sylvia had not said anything at all for over a year and her voice was so toneless that the sound almost seemed to come from the wall itself . The silence hung in the ward as everyone sought to make sure that there had really been words and that they had come from the frozen and mute piece of ward furniture that was Sylvia . They could all see each other checking for symptoms  --  did she say it or did I only hear it ? Then Lee Miller broke from inactionand went to the closed door of the nursing station . Shep104an element called time . She went up to one of them and asked an irrelevant question : " What day is it ? " " It 's Wednesday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The person did n't understand , and since she was too confused to pursue the point , she walked away . Behind her the three-dimensional solids were complainingabout the heat . They fanned the air of their time in front of their faces . She felt nauseated by the freezing cold , so she went back and lay down on a bed , desperately grateful that she recognized it as hers . You see what it is . . . Anterrabae said genially . We can really do it . Do n't toy with us , Bird-one , because we can do it up , down , and sideways . You thought all those descriptions were metaphors : lost one 's mind , cracked-up , crazed , demented , lunatic ? Alas , you see , they are all quite , quite true . Do n't toy with us , Bird-one , because we are protecting you . When you admire the world again , wait for our darkness . Later , Dr. Fried asked her what she had found out since their last session . " I found out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immensity and power and horror of it , she shook her head . " It really is something . Yes , it sure is something . " The struggle between the new Nose , Hobbs 's Leviathan , and the patients went on . His rigid fundamentalist beliefs made him see insanity as a just desert for its victims , as God 's vengeance , or as the devil 's work , and sometimes as all three at once . As the days passed , his fear waned and the time of his righteous wrath was at hand . He saw that he was suffering persecution for his faith . Against his loathing , the sick fought in their sick way . The literate rewrote the Bible or ridiculed its passages to make him horrified . Constantia made flagrant sexual advances to him.  |p105Helene  took the towel he brought her with a little curtsey , saying , " From Paraclete to Paranoid . Amen , amen . " And Deborahmade a few pointed observations about the similarity between psychotics and religious fanatics . McPherson sensed the anger and violence blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do about it . There was not enough staff anyway . The two other new conscientious objectors were doing well on different wards , and one of them was showing signs of ability at working with mental patients . He did n't like the new man on ward D , Ellis , much himself , but he was sympathetic toward him . Ellis was not suited for the work at all ; he feared and hated the patients , and looked upon the government which had punished him as the early Christian martyrs must have looked upon the Roman procurators . Becauseof this , Ellis had to drag the dead Hobbs after him in the nickname the patients had given him . The worst of it was that Ellis ' religion could not see suicide as anything but a sinful horror , monstrous in nature . So , Ellis dragged a dead and stinking whale , and McPhersonmused that there was no hunter in the world as clever or merciless in placing barbs in a weak place as these sick people . Sometimes he wondered why Hobbs had been attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not he . Never was Helene 's tremendous store of knowledge used to damn him ; never did the hard-faced Deborah Blau set her knife-edged tongue against him . He felt somehow that it might just be more than luck , but he did not truly know how or why he escaped the bitterness and unhappiness that vented itself all around him . Now he watched the patients as they stood , waiting for dinner , waiting for darkness , waiting for sedatives , waiting for sleep . Blau was standing near the barred and screened radiator , staring out at something beyond the wall . He had once asked her what she was looking at and she had answered him from her otherness , " I 'm the dead , reckoning . " Constantia was out of her seclusion room , but in seclusionp106still , muttering quietly in a corner . Lee Miller was clenching and unclenching her teeth ; Miss Cabot from the dormitory , insisting , " I 'm the Wife of an Assassinated Ex-President of the United States ! " Linda , Marion , and Sue Jepson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Yet there was a lingeringsense of dangerous unrest  --  more than the sum of the parts of unrest . Ellis came out of the nursing station where he had been writing up the medication reports . The badgering began . " Thar he blows  --  it 's Hobbs 's Leviathan ! " " Get thee behind me , Satan ! " " Hobbs committed suicide and the army committed him ! " " He got a commission , but not the kind that gives you eagles on the shoulder . " " With his commission they give bats in the belfry ! " " What 's the latest from Hell today , preacher ? " " Do n't ask him now . Let him look over his holdings first . " There was a radio built in behind a heavy mesh screen in the wall . It was supposed to be on only during certain hours of the day and tuned only to certain innocuous semi-light music , but now McPherson went to the screen , unlocked it , and turned the radio on good and loud . Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pathetically , even hilariously , incongruous in the heavy urine-and-disinfectant atmosphere that permeated the ward . When the announcer 's moist voice bade them " Good night from the Starlight Roof , " Carla replied in a parody of romantic wistfulness , " A farewell flutter of my restraints , delicately , good night . . . good night . . . " The whole ward erupted into laughter and relaxed , although the mind-scent of tension still hung in the air like the ozone smell after a lightning bolt . Something had been narrowlyaverted . After Deborah had been given her sedative , she got into her bed , waiting the familiar wait , the gods and the Collect reduced to a somnolent undertone . McPherson came into the dormitory and stopped by her bed.  | " Deb , " he said gently , " lay off on Mr. Ellis , will you ? " " Why me ? " she said . " I want all of you to let him alone . No more jokes . No more references to Hobbs . " " Are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion of all the world 's motives and representatives overcame prudence and forced the ques-tion . ) " Yup , " he said . " Everybody on the ward . " " Even Marie and Lena ? " ( They were acknowledged to be the sickest on the ward , even by the patients . ) " Deb . . . just lay off . " For a moment she felt that he was using her . He was the only one who could get away with calling the patients by nicknames without sounding strained , but it sounded strained now . " Why me ? I thought you normal ones had agreed that we were out of it  --  your conventions and routines . I 'm not nice and I 'm not polite and I know more about Hobbs than you do . He was one of us ! The only thing that separated him from us was three inches of metal key he used to fondle for assurance . Ellis is another one . I know all about him and his hate . " McPherson 's voice was low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it coming from a place in him that he had never shown before . " Do you think the sick people are all in hospitals ? Do you girls think you have a corner on suffering ? I do n't want to bring up the money business  --  it 's been overdone  --  but I want to tell you right now that lots of people on the outside would like to get help and ca n't . You ought to know mental trouble when you see it . You do n't bait other patients . I 've never heard you say anything against one of them . " ( She remembered what she had said to Carla and the stroke of guilt fell again for it . ) " Lay off Ellis , Deb  --  you 'll be glad for it later . " " I 'll try . " He looked down hard at her . She could not see his face inp108the shadow , but she sensed that it was in repose . Then he turned and walked out of the dormitory . Deborah fought the sedative for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was tough but true , and under the anger of it ran the tone  --  the tone rare anywhere , but in a mental ward like a priceless jewel  --  the tone of a simple respect between equals . The terror she felt at the responsibility it bore was mingled with a new feeling . It was joy.  | " Something in a session not long ago keeps coming back to me , " Dr. Fried said . " You were discussing being sick as if it were a volcano and you said of your sister that she would have to decorate her slopes herself . Do you know what you tell us now ? Can you really not see that the gods and the devils and the whole Yr of yours is your own creation ? " " I did n't mean that at all ! " Deborah said , backing away , and still hearing the Collect chanting years of people : Snap out of it ; it 's all in your mind . " Yr is real ! " " I have no doubt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else that you seem to be saying  --  that the sickness stands apart from the symptoms which are often mistaken for it . Are you not saying that , although the symptoms bear on the sickness and are related to it , the two are not the same ? "  | " That 's right . " " Then I want you to take me back into that past of yours again , before the slopes were decorated , and share with me a look at the volcano itself . " She saw the look of terror , and added , " Not all at once ; a little at a time . " They had gone over the Great Deceits , and also the many little ones that are inevitable in life , but which , because of Deborah 's feelings and beliefs , seemed to be pointing the way to doom as meaningfully as if they had been arranged as part of a plan , a secret joke that everyone knew , but no one admitted knowing . After months of therapy , Deborah began to learn that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shadow of the grandfather dynast was still dark over all the houses of the family . She went back often again , hearing grandfather 's familiar voice saying , " Secondin the class is not enough ; you must be the first . " " If you are hurt , never cry , but laugh . You must never let them know that they are hurting you . " It was all directed against the smiling sharers of the secret joke . Pride must be the ability to die in agony as if you did it every day , gracefully . Even his pride in her was anger . " You 're smart  --  you 'll show them all ! " He had sharpened her word-wit on his own , cheered the cutting edge of it , called women cows and brood-bitches , and slapped her half-roughly because she would grow up wasted , a woman . She would have to take on the whole world of fools and ingrates , and , even though she was a woman , win his battle : the ancient , mystical battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place and time where Deborah was growing up , American Jews still fought the old battles that they had fled from in Europe only a few years earlier . And then there were the newer battles , pitched as the Nazis walked through Europeand screamed hatred in America . There were Bund marches in the larger cities , and flare-ups against synagogues and neighborhood Jews who had ventured out of the ghettos.  |p111Deborah  remembered having seen the Blau house splashed with paint and the dead rats stinking beside the morning paper that told of Czech Jews running for the Polish border only to be shot by the " freedom-loving " Poles . She knew much of the hate and had been attacked once or twice by the neighborhood bullies , but the grandfather would say triumphantly , as if he saw in this an obscure kind of proof , " It 's envy ! The best and the smartest are always envied . Walk straight and do n't let them know if they touch you . " And then , as if the hate were peering through the joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're like me . They 're all fools , the rest of them  --  you 'll show them someday ! " What she had to " show them " was a harbinger , a deceiver , a seducer : her own precocity . The hint that she would someday be " someone " seemed to make the old man right . For a long time she used her bitter wit as a weapon to startle and amaze the adults in her armed truce with the world , but it never fooled the people of her own age for a single moment . The young knew her , and wise in their own fear , set out to destroy her . " It was a willing soil then , to which this seed of Yr came , " the doctor said . " The deceits of the grown-up world , the great gap between Grandfather 's pretensions and the world you saw more clearly , the lies told by your own precocity , that you were special and the hard fact that you could n't get to first base with your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The gap between the carefully brought up little rich girl with maids and imported dresses and the  --  and the  --  " " And the what ? Where are you now ? " " I do n't know , " she said , but she was speaking from a place in which she had been before . " There are no colors , only shades of gray . She is big and white . I am small and there are bars between . She gives food . Gray . I do n't eat . Where is my . . . my . . . "  | " Your what ? " " Salvation ! " Deborah blurted . " Go on , " the doctor said . " My . . self , my love . " Dr. Fried peered at her intently for a while and then said , " I have a hunch  --  do you want to try it with me ? " " Do you trust me with it ? " " Certainly , or there would n't be this science at all , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourself and truth is sound . Believe in it . " " Go ahead then , or psychiatry will disappear . " ( Laughter . ) " Your mother had trouble with a pregnancy when you were very small , did she not ? " " Yes , she miscarried . Twins . " " And afterward went away to rest for a while ? " The light struck the past and there was a seeming sound of good , strong truth , like the pop of a hard-thrown ball into a catcher 's glove . Connect . Deborah listened to the sound and then began to tumble over her words , filling the missing features of the ancient nightmare that was no more otherworldlythan the simple experience of being left alone . " The white thing must have been a nurse . I felt that everythingwarm had left . The feeling comes often , but I thought it could never have been true that I ever really was in such a place . The bars were crib bars . They must have been on my own crib . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hey ! Hey ! " The now-friendly light struck something else and its suddenness made the small , prosaic connection seem like a revelation full of greatness and wonder . " The bars ... the bars of the crib and the cold and losing the ability to see colors ... it 's what happens now ! It 's part of the Pit  --  it 's what happensnow , now ! When I am waiting to fall , those bands of dark across my eyes are the old crib bars and the cold is that old one  --  I always wondered why it meant more than just something you could end by putting on a coat . "  |p113The  rush of words ended and Dr. Fried smiled . " It is as big , then , as abandonment and the going away of all love . " " I thought I was going to die , but at last they came back . " She paused in the flight and another sudden question took her , as if it had been there forever . " Why does n't everybody have black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week or two . Parents die , even , but the children do n't go nuts and have mourning bands going up and down their retinas . " It had come to her as another deeper proof that she was mismade somehow , that the fault was as elemental as her genes , a bad seed . She expected the doctor 's sympathetic demur , a familiar and comforting lie with which she could light her own way back to Yr . Instead the words were strong . " The memory may not change in form , but years of underlininggive it a weight that can become tremendous . Each of the many many times you are called to remember the cold of abandonment , the bars , and the loneliness , this experience says deep inside you , You see ? That 's the way life is , after all . ' " The doctor rose to mark the session 's end . " We have done very well this time , seeing where some of the ghosts of the past still clutch at you in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price will be . " The doctor touched her arm . " You set the price yourself . Tell all of Yr that it dare not compromise you in this search of ours . " Deborah pulled her arm away from the doctor 's hand because of some obscure fear of touching . She was right , for the place where the hand had paused on her arm began to smoke and the flesh under the sweater sleeve seared and bubbled with the burning . " I 'm sorry , " the doctor said , seeing Deborah 's face go pale . " I did n't mean to touch you before you were ready . " " Lightning rods , " Deborah answered , looking through thep114sweater arm to the charred flesh , and seeing how terrible it must be when one was the grounding path for such power . The doctor , lost under the leap of the logic , could only look past the shaking body of the patient before her to where the hunted spirit had flashed for a moment in gladness and now was gone . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . " " As long as we can stand at all , " Deborah said.  |p115Time  ground on . Deborah was flung and rebounded like a tennis ball in play from stage to stage in Yr , from earth to nowhere , from sunlight to black window , over the divisions that demarcate the time of the sane , trying , in passage , not to be cruel to Mr. Ellis . She freed him from Hobbs 's name , she was obedient if not cheerful , and she bore his martyrdom  --  her own existence  --  as well as she could . A new group of nursing students had come and gone , some comforted that the mentally ill could no longer strike fear in them , some running in terror from the whip of subtle similarity between the madwomen'suttered thoughts and their own unuttered ones . Anothergroup had come and was being broken in on Constantia'sspontaneous nudity , Helene 's graceful and bone-breaking violence , and Deborah 's locked eyes . A young nurse had saidp116too loudly , " That kid looks through me as if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deborah had later whispered to the nurse , " Wrong not . " She was saying that it was not the pretty nurse who was not there but the ugly patient , and still the wrong-coming words only made the frightened student more alarmed , and Deborah saw again the uncrossable expansebetween herself and the species called " human being . " Deborah was standing in the small seclusion room forward of the hall . Her lunch tray had been brought by a nurse , who fumbled with the keys ( her difference ) , and was pale , rememberingperhaps the secret bedlam horror-nightmares of her own keeping . Those , at least , Deborah shared , believed , understood . She whispered her comfort and saw the nurse get hard in the face with fear , and turn , stumbling over her own feet to hang on the fraction of the edge of her balance . Deborah put out a hand almost instinctively , since clumsinesshad made them kin , and the hand got to the nurse 's arm and held her for a second . Balance caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her arm away , strong in her fear , and tottered out of the room . Suffer , Deborah said to all the assembled ones in Yr , the Yri metaphor for greeting . I am a conductor of lightnings andburnings . Passes through me from doctor , flows to nurse . Here I have been copper wire all the time and people had been mistaking me for brazen ! Anterrabae laughed . Be witty , he said , shedding hair-sparks in his unending , unconsuming , fiery fall . Outside this room , ward , hospital , such as that and that even , when her shift is through , laugh , walk , breathe , in an element that you will never understand or know . Their breath in and out , blood , bones , night and day are not of the same substance as yours . Your substance is fatal to them . If they are ever infected with your element they will die of it or go insane . " Like the Pit ? "  |p117Exactly  so . Deborah cried out in horror at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning softly , " Too much power , too much hurt . Do n't let anyone hurt like that  --  not like that ! Not like that . . . like that ... " Then she was standing above herself , dressed in her Yri rank and name , kicking the herself that was on the floor , kickingher low in the stomach and in the tumorous place that gave like a rotten melon . When the ceremonial creak of leavetakingsounded , the sky was burdening itself with darkness outside the barred window . She looked out , finding herself erect and in front of the window and saying quietly , " Let me die , all of you . " If they would all come together against her , she knew that she could not live . There was no joy or happinessor peace or freedom worth this suffering . " End me , Anterrabae , Collect , all you others . Once and for all , crush me against the world ! " The light was put on from the outside and the key grated in the lock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when she saw Deborah 's face , she turned back to the one behind her . " Finish the ward check and get a pack set up . " Deborah did not know what look she was carrying in front of what self , but she was greatly relieved . Help was coming by virtue of some of the misery which was apparently leaking through the mask . " Out at the eyeholes , maybe . . . " she murmured to the people who came after a while . When she rose again , it was in the darkness . She came like a great whale from the benthic depths  --  another element with other rules and climates . The earth came back to a night outsideanother window than the one which had measured the early dusk , and there were now two beds , and full , starred darkness beyond  --  the glass barred , bars screened , screens tightened . It was a beautiful night , with the stars piercingp118clear , even behind the triple-masked window . There was a low sound from the other bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our Lady of the nose-itch , " Helene answered . " Venus de Milo with nose-itch . " " Were you ever in a pack and had a hair get in your eye ? " Deborah asked , remembering the struggles she had had sometimes with hairs or fluff or itches , little devilish mites of annoyancethat seemed to be the whole world when you could not reach up and push them aside . " I am a hair in my eye , " Helene said coolly , " and so are you . " So Deborah lay quietly , resting from the eternal apocalypse . She could see clearly through her mind , and for a while she thought about Helene , lying like a twin in the other bed . Although Helene was bitter and usually angry , Deborah respectedher intellect and also that she , too , in her thorny and unconceding way , had ceased her persecution of the martyredMr . Ellis . Most of the time Helene was out of contact and not to be reached ; sometimes a bitter sentence or two broke like glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard as it was surprising , but Deborah knew in the quiet , unspectacular way of her clear moments that Helene , as desperately ill as she was , had the unknown quantity of strength or will or something that it took to get well . Helene , she knew , could make it . Because of this , her feelings toward Helene were a texture of envy , respect , and fear . Once , she had been cruel to Helene ; she had told her that she thought she could get well and had seen the terror build in the muscular body . Deborah had not realized fully her own tormenting then . Helene had told her in a fine and reasonable voice that if she , Deborah , did n't move away and fast , she , Helene , would break every bone in that dung-stinking head . Deborah had complied . The light went on and both of them groaned softly at the revelation of the lurid spectacle of themselves and each otherp119after the beauty of the star-darkness . Ellis came in alone , and walked swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurses and attendants spoke as they entered , in order to introduce slowly the presence of the world , of which they were representatives , to those who might be midhungand confused , and usually they waited for their presence to be acknowledged even by an eyeblink . The suddenness of Ellis ' coming was too much in so vulnerable a place ; when he went for Helene 's head to capture her temple-pulse and force from it a number for his report , she pulled hard away from his hand . Movement of the head was a person 's whole repertoire in pack ; Ellis grabbed Helene 's face and held it with one hand while he tried to catch the bird-pulse with the other . Again she fought away . Then he straightened a little , not angry , only deliberate , and began to hit her in the face . The blows landed sure and hard . She spat up at him , a diffused and angry spray , and Deborah , watching , saw what would be to her forever after the symbol of the impotence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accurate and merciless , and the spitting back again and again . Helene did not even reach him , but after every attempt he met her at the end of his arm with full force . There was no sound except the pursing sputter of the now dry lips , her labored breathing , and the blows falling . They were both so intent that they seemed to have forgotteneverything else . When he had slapped her into submission , he took her pulse and Deborah 's and left . When he went out , Helene was coughing a little on her blood . The next day Deborah became her own Yri enemy  --  a voluntarysharer , an **25;5470;TOOLONG , which Yri called nelaq tankutuku . She went to the nurse and asked to see the ward doctor when he came to sign the orders for the week . " Why do you want to see him ? " the nurse asked . " I have something to tell him . " " What is it ? " " That a pacifist is one who uses his open hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Ward nurse to head day nurse ; the theme again . The cloud was beginning to darken under the ceiling , lowering toward Punishment , but Deborah had to tell the doctor somehow and get it off her own conscience that she had been a witness and thus , in some obscure way , a sharer in the experience of both victor and victim . The nurse was skeptical and Deborah had to plead , with the cloud pressing closer and the wind coming up . At last she got permission to see the ward doctor . She told , sparely and dryly , what she had seen , trying for the world 's semblance of sanity so that he would believe her . She did not use the expense of the telling to show him how important it was , nor did she speak of Ellis ' propensities , which she knew were secret simply because he had the keys and the patientsdid n't . When she got finished , the doctor sat looking at her , watching her hair grow . She knew from long experience that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sense the Punishment . He sat in another season  --  springtime , maybe  --  beneath a separate sun whose rays ended at the periphery of her eyesight , her reality , and her kingdom . At last he said , " Why does n't Helene tell me this ? " " Helene left right after it happened . " She was about to add that it was like Helene to blank out and leave her holding the bag , her way of getting even for the time when she had told Helene that she saw the possibility of wellness in her . She saw that this was unwise , but the realization stopped her mind on it , like cloth caught on a nail , and she could say no more . " We are interested in stopping any brutality going on around here , but we ca n't take something without proof . You were in pack because you were upset , you know . Something perhaps you believe you saw . . . " " Ask Ellis at least . With his Soul . . . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to lie . "  | " I 'll make a note of it , " the doctor said , making no move toward his ubiquitous notebook . He was clearly giving her what Lee Miller called Treatment number three : a variety of the old " fine-fine , " which went , " Yes , yes , of course , " and was meant to placate without changing , silence without comprehending , and end friction by doing nothing . As she looked at him , Deborah thought about her sedative order . She had wanted an increase in her sedation and she knew that if she asked now he would give it to her . But she did n't want to buy sleep with Helene 's swallowed blood , and she let him go , murmuring , " Chloral hydrate generosity , and charity in cc 's . " She watched the worms that were dropping out of the cloud . The doctor left . Never mind ; she would tell Dr. Fried , The Fire-Touch , about it . Furii , or Fire-Touch , was the new Yri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had seared Deborah 's arm with an invisible burning . " Did you tell the ward doctor this ? " Furii asked . " Yes , and he gave me the Number Three With Smile : yes-yes . ' " She felt ridiculous in her honorable abstinence from the heavier sedation that she had wanted . She wished that she had at least got something not connected with the running of your ward . I can not break into ward policy . " " I 'm not saying that policy should be changed , " Deborah said , " unless the policy is beating up patients in pack . " " I have no say in discipline of ward personnel either , " Furii said . " Is Pilate everybody 's last name around here ? " At last Furii agreed to mention it in the staff meeting , but Deborah was not convinced . " Maybe you doubt that I saw it at all . " " That is the one thing that I do not doubt , " the doctor said.  | " But you see , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wards ; I am not an administrative doctor . " Deborah saw the match lighting dry fuel . " What good is your reality , when justice fails and dishonesty is glossed over and the ones who keep faith suffer . Helene kept her bargain about Ellis and so did I. What good is your reality then ? " " Look here , " Furii said . " I never promised you a rose garden . I never promised you perfect justice . . . " ( She remembered Tilda suddenly , breaking out of the hospital in Nuremburg , disappearing into the swastika-city , and coming back laughing that hard , rasping parody of laughter . " Sholom Aleichem , Doctor , they are crazier than I am ! " ) . . . and I never promised you peace or happiness . My help is so that you can be free to fight for all of these things . The only reality I offer is challenge , and being well is being free to accept it or not at whatever level you are capable . I never promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie . . . and a bore , too ! " " Will you bring it up at the meeting  --  about Helene ? " " I said I would and I will , but I promise nothing . " Because Helene had left her standing alone with the burden of witnessing , Deborah found herself going , without a consciouschoice , to Lee Miller , the one who went tankutuku for the forgotten words of Sylvia . Lee could not allow anyone to be behind her , and she did n't like to stand against the wall the way the others did , so she had to keep circling relentlessly to " keep everyone properly placed . " Without allegiance or loyalty , but because of a mysterious sense of fitness , Deborah began to follow Lee , the ptolemaic sun circling her planets . " Get away , Blau ! " That , too , was fitting ; by her speaking to Deborah she was admitting , Deborah thought , that they were actors in the same event and related to one another . " Get away , Blau ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship . " Nurse ! Get this bitch out of here ! " The nurse came . " Get off the hall , Deborah , or stop following . " The nurse was a third actor , but not tankutuku . The gravity bond dissolved ; Deborah moved away again . By the light of my fire , Bird-one , Anterrabae said , see how carefully , how carefully they separate you from small dangers : pins and matches and belts and shoelaces and dirty looks . Will Ellis beat the naked witness in a locked seclusion room ? Deborah slid down the wall to an accustomed place on the floor among the other statues , watching the pictures in her mind  --  simple pictures , explicit and terrifying . In the evening , Lucia , a new patient with a certain prestige for her violence and the nine years she had spent in one of the roughest hospitals in the country , suddenly said to the small group of perpetually cold ones who were huddled around the radiator enclosure , " It 's different here . I been lotsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotsa wards . What 's here .. . there 's more scared , more mad ; pissin ' on the floor and yellin '  --  but it 's because of the maybe . It 's because of the little , little maybe . " She went off again , leaping in her long ostrich run down the hall , laughing in order to negate the immense , fearful power of her words , but they had been given and they were hanging in the air like the zoo smell of the ward itself . Everyonewas afraid of the hope , the little , little Maybe , but for Deborah , coming at that moment , the words had a special ring , so that she looked out into both worlds and saw the imminent things , the lowering cloud and the worms that were dropping from it , and the law , blowing like a shred in the black wind . " Never mind the Maybe ; it 's an administrative problem . "  |p124Esther  and Jacob sat together in the office , waiting , Dr. Fried saw , for reassurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was not God . There were no sure promises and she could not be a judge of what they had done or not done to their daughter to bring her to this battlefield . " Is it wrong to want a child like anyone else 's ? " Jacob asked . " I . . . I mean is there a cure , really , or will she stay here and have to be placated and comforted . . . always ? " He heard how cold his words sounded . " It is n't a question of love  --  sick or well  --  it 's only that we have to expect something , even to hope for something . Can you tell us what we may hope for ? " " If you want to hope for a college diploma and a box of dance invitations and pressed roses and a nice clean-cut youngp125man from a fine family  --  I do n't know . This is what most parents hope for . I do n't know if Deborah will have these things someday or if she will even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out and come to terms with what she really does want . " " May we see her ? " Dr. Fried had known that the question would come , and here it was . It was the one she did n't want to answer . " Of course , if you decide to see her you may , but I would not advise it this time . " She tried to make the answer very , very calm . " Why not ! " Jacob said , moving loudly against his fear . " Because her feeling of reality is quite shaky now . The way she looks might alarm you a little , and she knows this and is afraid for you . . . and for herself also . " Jacob sat back dazedly , wondering why they had ever done this thing . The old Deborah as she was might have been sick as they all said . She had been unsure and wretched , but she had been theirs  --  unsure , to be guarded and planned for ; wretched , to be cheered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the picture that this doctor made was of someoneunrecognizable . " Let me say that the symptoms are not the sickness , " the doctor was saying . " These symptoms are defenses and shields . Believe it or not , her sickness is the only solid ground she has . She and I are hacking away at that ground , on which she stands . That there will be another , firmer ground for her after this is destroyed she can only take on faith . Imagine it for yourself for a moment and you can see why she does n't pay attention to her grooming ; why she gets so frightened and the symptoms proliferate . " Dr. Fried tried to describe the feelings of someone who had never known real mental health in her life . " We who have never experienced this sickness firsthand can only guess whatp126horror and loneliness there must be . You know , she is now being called upon to suspend all the years of what she has known as reality , and to take another version of the world on faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . " " The world we gave her was n't so horrible , " Jacob said . " But she never took your world at all , do n't you see ? She created a robot that went through the motions of reality , and behind it the true person drew further and further away . " Knowing that people feared the unknown person behind the familiar robot , she let the matter rest . Jacob said quietly , " I still want to see her . " " No , Jacob  --  it 's better  --  ! " " Es  --  I want to see her ! It 's my right . " " Very well , " the doctor said affably . " I 'll call and have her brought down from the ward and you may see her in the visitors ' room . " She went to her phone . " If you should want to see me again afterward , please have the attendant on duty call me . I will be here until four . " She watched them leave and walk rigidly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they say . " Make her well , " they say , " with good table manners and a future according to our agreed-on dream ! " She sighed . Even the intelligent , the honest , the good , find it too easy to sell their children . Deceits and vanities and arrogances that they would never stoop to for themselves they perpetrate on their children . Ach ! Another sigh escaped from her , because she had never given birth or nursed a child , and because she wondered suddenlyif she , too , would not connive or be ambitious , buy dreams and wish them impossibly on a Deborah if the Deborahwere her own . She thought a moment longer , then turned and went to the phone , and got through at last to D ward . " She was just taken down to visitors , Doctor , " the attendant said . " Oh , well , then , never mind . I just hoped ... "  | " Doctor ? " " Just that there was time for her to comb her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were silent . They were waiting for the truth to become plain to them , but becauseeverything they had seen contradicted everything they felt to be true , they were mute in their confusion . They trusted Dr. Fried . She had not been hypocritically calming , but she had given them hope , and it was hope for which they were most desperate . But their daughter had been almost unrecognizable . She had not frightened them with mumbling or violence , but with a subtle and terrifying kind of withdrawal . She had not inhabited her body . As they left the visitor 's room Jacob had said only , " She 's very pale And Esther , striving to catch what she was feeling murmured , " Someone . . . someone beaten to death from the inside . " Jacob 's anger had risen against her and he had turned away . " You always talk too much ! Ca n't you just let it be ? " On the way back to Chicago , all they knew was that it waspast time for Suzy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , and urge her recalcitrantpatient through the circles of loving and hating . Deborah kept fleeing away to Yr 's darknesses , dissembling , and throwingup dust to hide in . She longed for blindness and ignorance , for she now realized that if she herself saw or recognized anything , it would have to be exposed for discussion , howevershameful , fearful , or ugly it might be ; although to Deborahthe reason for this necessity was as mysterious as the lower places of Yr itself . " I have let you get away from your father long enough , " Furii announced during one session . " When you speak of him , it is with fear and hatred  --  and with something else . "  |p128The  deeper secret , toward which Furii reached with her world hooks , lay beneath common injustices : the beating over a trivial thing , the simple misunderstanding at a crucial time . Part of the secret was that Deborah was like her father . They shared a sudden , violent temper , long smolderings that erupted in incongruous rages . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself also , and she felt his love for her was blind , that he never knew or understood her for a single moment . And there was something else beyond his understanding . " I was scornful of him sometimes , " she said . " I know you are remembering something . " " He was always frightened of the men  --  the men lurking to grab me from dark streets ; sex maniacs and fiends , one to a tree , waiting for me . So many times he shook warnings into me . Men are brutes , lusting without limit . Men are animals ... and I agreed in myself . One time he was scolding me for having seen an exhibitionist on the street . Because I had attractedthe man 's attention my father somehow connected me with having done something . He was full of rage and fear and he went on and on as if all such men were bound by laws like gravity to me alone . I said to him , What do they want with me , broken into and spoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Then he hit me very hard because it was true . " " Was he afraid , perhaps , of the commands of his own passions ? " " What ? He was a father  --  " Deborah said , beginning to know the answer before she refuted it . " He was a man first . He knows his own thoughts . Do all others have such thoughts ? He knows they have . Do all others have so good control as he has ? Surely they can not . " Deborah pondered the almost-lust that was almost apparent so many times . It was full of guilt and love intermingled ; it had badgered and confused her , making of her a secretp129accomplice in all of the heinous crimes of the maniacs which he was forever describing . In his fear he saw her as having the same hunger and guilt as they did  --  as he did . He had spoken of the diseased parts of these men and Deborah knew that her shame-parts too had been diseased . Always in her dreams what she fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternally horrifying familiar face of her father and herself . Is it so fearful now ? " " No . . . " And then thinking how great the shadow had grown in the Fear-bog , and that it was only him and a few unspoken , briefly hinted thoughts of her own that had been so cloaked in guilt that their true shapes had disappeared , she said , " No , not fearful  --  good . I was not only . . . only to him a daughter who was making him embarrassed all the time . Part of the yearning was the human . . . human . . . " Deborah began to cry . She was well into it when the terror caught . Furii saw it coming , strangling out the sobs . " Quickly ! " she said . " It may try to make you pay , that sicknessof yours , for our having outdistanced it . Quickly I tell you that you have touched insight , which is truth and love and forgiveness ; that these are part of the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful and thrilling , these things ? " She saw the light drawing away . The voice that came next was coming from Yr . " Well . . . " from far across the barrier , " . . . you did it . I cried . I forgave my mother and father really . Now I guess I go home . " " You are not so stupid and neither am I , " Furii said earnestly , trying to speak across the widening space . " There are many secrets to come and you know it . You are now parting with food that sustained you  --  all the secrets and the secret powers  --  and no other nourishment has yet appeared to replace it . This is the hardest time of all , harder than even your sicknesswas before you came here . At least that had a meaningp130for you , as awful as the meaning was sometimes . You will have to trust me enough to take on faith that the new food , when it comes , will be richer . " They spoke more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting evidence from years of living . Deborah was exhausted , but the stubbornness was still in her , helping her to yield and cast with Furii and her world while she awaited the last collision which would leave her insane forever . " There is more  --  much more , " Furii said . " We will go until we see it all . When it is over , you can still choose Yr if you really wish it . It is only the choice which I wish to give you ; your own true and conscious choice . " " I could still be crazy if I wanted to ? " " Crazy as a fruitcake . . . if you wanted to . " " Nutty as a fruitcake . " " Ah , yes , I remember . I hear also someone say bats . ' What is bats ' ? " " It means bats-in-the-belfry . It means that up in your head , where the bells ring , it 's night and the bats are flying around , black and flapping and random and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that one ! The Americans capturethe feeling of mental illness quite accurately sometimes . " And if I should want it  --  if I should need it . . . afterward ... " " You have no experience to know what mental health is , but I do n't think that you will need or want to have bats in the steeple . Still , the answer is yes . If you need it or want it afterward , all your choices will still be there . " On the ward there was a barely covered excitement . Two packs had been set up in the small seclusion room and were waiting to be occupied ; the hall seemed to be all white and khaki , with nurses and attendants walking fast from here to there , yet still waiting.  | " What 's up ? " Deborah whispered to Lee , the one most likely to know and to tell it . " Miss Coral 's coming back again , " Lee said . " She was here before your time . Thank God . It 's been dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to be brought up , the heavy elevator went rattling down and everybody in hearing gave a little jump . After a while they heard it coming back up and stopping outside the double doors of Ward D. A group of white uniforms filled the translucent screen of frosted glass , and then the key turned and the ward administrator appeared in his magnificence . He was followed by two attendants ( for feet ) and two attendants ( for head ) carrying , under heavy restraint , a tiny , white-haired old lady . Behind them flowed assorted secondary personages of procession : receiving-ward day nurses , acolytes , the regular clergy , novices , postulants , and others . " That is Miss Coral ? " " All ninety pounds of her , " Lee said . There was a ringing string of beautifully balanced , varied , and intricate profanity as the bundle moved down the hall , past the set-up packs ( surprisingly ) , and into the Number Four seclusion room beyond . For a while there was silence and then the bearers began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn again to her post at the dormitory window when she saw the last of the attendants joining the others . His coming was absurd , frightening , interesting , funny , non-Newtonian ; he was flying . He was prone on the air , his expression utterly blank , as if he felt obliged to live out his life as a trajectory . But he did not come to rest ; he fell and it was the heavy , clumsy sound of his falling that stopped his companions and spun them around . Deborah breathed heavily with disappointment . It was only a man after all . He was not hurt in the flight nor in the fall , but he was nearly run over in the stampede of staff that rushed back top132subdue the source of his propulsion . The patients followed to watch and heckle . Miss Coral stood at the open door . Her tiny being was like electricity . That hair has been burned white , Deborah said quietly in Yri . The three men who went to move Miss Coral were pitiful against the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , her blank and expressionless face staring straight ahead . When more attendantsleaped into the melee there was less for her to do , and she stood still because they were working against one another . Helene , sensing a challenge to her reign as at least the most feared on the ward , ran into the deserted upper hall , removed the hasps from the hinges of the nursing-station door , tore the door off with its own weight and hers , flung it into the hall , and followed it with everything that came to hand . Sylvia , planted like a poorly made statue against the wall , found that she could not bear the tension of Helene 's violence and suddenly exploded , diving at Helene in the broken ruins of the door , trays , medicine , cutlery , and towels . Someone rang the emergency bell , and it took twelve extra people to still the riot and put Helene and Sylvia in pack . Apparently the orders for Miss Coral had been forgotten by the ward administrator , because the door was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lee said as Deborah passed her in the hall , " It beats anything we 've had up here for a while , you must admit that . " " I sure wish I could have made it to that narcotics cabinet , " Deborah mused . " I never knew a little old lady was strong enough to sail a grown man . " " She was here two years ago . I saw her throw a bed once . Not push it ; throw it . She 's also the best-educated one of all of us . " " Better than Helene ? " " Hell , yes ! She speaks four or five languages and is some sort of mathematician on the outside . She tried to explain it top133me once , but as you know , I stopped in the eighth grade . " Looking around , she began to circle again , impatiently trying to get the world properly placed . Four days later , Miss Coral 's door was left open , giving her access to the ward . When , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Deborah sitting on the other side . " Hello , " Deborah said . " Hello . . . . Are n't you rather young to be up here ? " The voice was old , but not harsh , and the vowels were spread wide in diphthongs the way the Deep South spoke them . " I 'm sorry I 'm young , " Deborah answered with a bitterness that was half pose . " We have the right to be as crazy as anyone else . " The second part was more like a plea , and to her surprise the superbly inhuman fighter smiled softly and said , " Yes .. . I suppose that 's true , though I never thought of it in those terms before . " The crude hunger that had made Deborah sit at the door for upward of four hours would not allow her to be civil or patient . " Lee Miller says you know languages and mathematics . Is that true ? " " Oh , is she still here ? Too bad , " and Miss Coral clucked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no ! They only taught us to read and write a language in those days and it was only to read the classics . " " Do you remember the languages ? " She looked to Deborah like an Anterrabae who had stopped falling , with the lightning-blueeyes and the static-stiff white hair that only needed rekindling to ignite the whole firebrand . She looked at Deborahfor a while . " What is it that you wish ? " she said . " Teach me . " The rigid lines seemed to melt , the body slackened , and water rose in the hard eyes and overwhelmed them for a mo/ment . " I 'm ill , " Miss Coral said . " I 've been very ill , and I forget . I could be inaccurate sometimes because of the years ... " ( Deborah was watching her sustain an invisible brutal beating , trying to stand up ) " . . . and the sickness . . . " " It does n't matter . " " I 'm tired now , " Miss Coral said , backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a decision and inform you of it later . " She slammed the knobless heavy door behind her . Sitting on the floor in the door-draft , Deborah could hear the muffled sounds of the battle : curses and cries , falling and blows . An attendant passed her . " I thought I opened that door  --  what 's going on in there ? " " Coral vs . Coral  --  divorce action . Fighting over custody of the child . " " Blau , you saw her come out . Did she close that door her-self ? " " Maybe she should talk to somebody , " Deborah said . The attendant turned away and went slowly to start the chain of permissions . Deborah sat down in front of the door again and emptied her pocket of all of its treasures . She found two cigarettes which she had picked up after a forgetful student nurse . They were only half smoked . She went to Lee Miller 's bed and put them under her pillow as an offering of thanks . Sylvia 's debt had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse arrived . Sitting by Miss Coral 's door , Deborah was sensing the inexorable guilt of relatedness ; her substance had spread through the ward reflecting anguish on everyone . For every such battle as raged behind this door she was symbolically responsible . Yet she also remembered Carla saying that her sickness was like an overflowingglass , and Deborah 's drop or two could hardly matter . Was she responsible or not ? Being unable to decide , she let the question go . After a while the sounds from inside the room stopped and Missp135Coral 's voice , dead-level with exhaustion , called through the door . " Young woman  --  young woman  --  are you still there ? " " Are you calling me ? Is it me you want ? " Deborah called back when she could speak . " Yes . " Then Miss Coral said : " Inter vitae scelerisque purusNon eget Mauris jaculis neque arcu Nec venanatis gravida sagittis , Fusce , pharetra . " " What is that ? " " Tomorrow , " Miss Coral said . " And the spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose moments between the closings of their separate worlds . Deborah had entered upon a dry and barren era . The smell of her burnt-up self was always in her nostrils  --  charred flesh and hair , clothing , and the rubber and leather of shoes . She lost her ability to see color and the black bars limited the scope of her vision to a small , vertical strip of gray . Nevertheless she learned . Her pockets and secret hiding places became crammed with scraps of paper carrying the words , sentences , and poems of Miss Coral 's remembered classics in Latin ; Greek alphabet and vocabulary ; and bits of the stolen honey of the licentious middle ages . " It was too sinful in our day , " Miss Coral told Deborah shyly . " The medievals were beasts , supposedly , and their Latin , degenerate ; but the books went around the schoolp137dormitory at night and not all of it was lascivious . Strangely , it is they , the singing madmen , that I most remember . . . " and she recited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I resembled them ... We are here , after all . . . " And she was caught in a paroxysm of weeping and rage . A conventional teacher could never have made a moment 's headway against the defensive anger of Miss Coral 's pupil , but Deborah felt no threat in the small bits of gentle teaching , for her tutor 's manner was limned with her own pain and despair , and precluded the sour superiority that Deborah sensed in most teachers . Miss Coral was a fellow inmate , and Deborah 's genuine hunger , at last divorced from her deceptive precocity , forced her to reach out and take all that Miss Coral had to give . In line , waiting for sedatives : " That De Ramis Cadunt Folia . . . . I did okay until I got to the part about Nam Signa Coeli Ultima . " " Well , you know those words . ... I remember you had them in other poems . " " I know what they mean , but ... " " Oh , yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would mean more like house ' or ascendancy . ' " Waiting before trays : " Morpheus in mentem trahit impellentem ventum lenem , segetes maturas , .. I do n't remember the rest . " From poems they went to bits of poems , to sentences , to phrases , building Deborah 's knowledge on familiar words in their changing grammatical forms . Miss Coral worked with her memory and Deborah , with her hunger and the forbidden pencil.  |p138At  last Miss Coral said , " You have all the Latin and Greek I know . I 'm sorry about the grammar  --  I 've lost so much , but at least you will come across familiar landmarks when you read the classics ; you have quite a number of bits and pieces all copied down on those papers of yours . " Indeed , the scraps of paper were becoming an embarrassment , cramming her pockets and stuffed under the bedsprings . She realized that it was time to ask for the special privilege of a notebook . It took a week or so to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " petitioners " who waited for the ward doctor to come on his rounds . There seemed to be quite a few this time , even without counting those who were there habitually : Lee : " Hey , I want double sedatives tonight . " The Wife of the Assassinated : " Let me go home ! I want to go home ! " Mary ( who has Dr. Fiorentini ) : " I 've contracted a social disease from the socialists ! " Mary ( who has Dr. Dowben ) : " Murder and fire ! There 's a fire ! " Carla , who was going to go to the movie in town , needed special permission , being a " D " patient , and money . Miss Coral , starting at the bottom of the via dolorosa , was there to ask for some basic ward privilege . The doctor arrived on the ward , and the requests and answersflew back and forth . When Deborah asked for the notebook , he looked at her quickly , measuring her . " We 'll see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went his way . That afternoon Dr. Adams came on the ward to see Sylvia . When she left , she was missing a copy of Look Homeward Angel that she had been carrying with her . Later in the day one of the student nurses looked in vain for her lecture notebook . The written pages turned up two days later in the elevator outside the Disturbed Ward , but the half of the book which was blank , had disappeared.  |p139Deborah  began to bother Helene for remembered poetry , and Helene obliged by giving her some of Hamlet and Richard III , dredged , up , to her own amazement , from some distant but still-living source . Greek words were dutifully copied and then Latin ; Look Homeward Angel became an agony under Deborah 's mattress , but she read and reread it until Dowben 's Mary got ahold of it and ate it , leaving only the binding . Carla had read the novel once and for a while they talked about it . " If I can learn these things . . . " Deborah said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is it still so dark ? " Carla looked at her and smiled a little . " Deb , " she said , " who ever told you that learning facts or theories or languages had anything to do with understanding yourself ? You , of all people . . . " And Deborah understood suddenly how the precociouswit , though it had supported her sickness and was part of it , acted for her independently of the troubles that clouded her reality . " Then one may learn , and learn , and be a schizo . " " At least it may be so in Deborah , " Helene said caustically . Deborah put her notebook behind the dormitory radiator and lay down on her bed . She stayed there for the next three months , getting up only to be let into the bathroom or to be taken off the ward to see Dr. Fried . The darkness seemed complete . Phases of Yr came and went , the Collect met and dispersed , but outside the sessions with Dr. Fried she did not fight any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telling the ward gossip or the little happenings of the day . Deborah was incapable of saying how much these visits meant . They were sometimes the only human contacts she had for days at a stretch , for her lying mask gave forth looks that hurried the attendants away ; they would give the tray or put out the clothes and leave without a word or a nod . Because she began to have bad dreams and loud , hard awakenings , she was moved out of the noisy and populous front dormitory and placed in a small room in the darker back hall with twop140more of the living dead . The coming of daylight shut their mouths and cut off their vision a foot or two beyond their eyes , but their dreams burst from them in screaming shards that shattered the brittle crust of drugged sleep for which the other patients fought . It was considered better to have the three of them waking one another than to have the whole ward upset , so they were immured together and left to themselves . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still carried somewherefrom her childhood store of nurses ' threats . Often she would wake with one of the roommates standing over her , arms upraised , or the other hitting her in a sleep-blind anger . One night she thought suddenly of her father and that other facet of his love , which was human need , and to the fat one , whose pounding had awakened her , she broke the mold of silent terror . " Oh , Della , for God 's sake go back to bed and let me get some sleep . " Della turned away and Deborah found herself happier than the mere success of her command would warrant . One night Helene herself  --  an angry , brutal Helene  --  played the apparition . Thinking that it was only one of the roommates , Deborahsnorted in what by that time had become standard form . " Get away , damn you . Beat it ! " " I 'm insane , " Helene said , menacing closer in the darkness . " I 'm insane . . . " Deborah recognized the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now laughter came welling up as naturally as if she had always had it as a friend . " Do you think you could compete with my smallest nightmareon its dullest day ? " " I could be capable of anything . . . " Helene said , but Deborah thought she heard more hurt pride in the tone than savagery . " Listen , Helene . You are bound to the same laws that I am , and there is nothing that you can do to me that my own crazi/ness does n't do to me smarter and faster and better and good night , Helene , go back to bed . " Without a word , Helene turned and went back across the hall , and Deborah for the first time permitted herself to speak a small word of praise for the good light in her own mind . During the dark months spent lying on the bed , she sometimesthought about the half-mythical person , that Doris Rivera , who had been in these rooms , had suffered these fears , had seen the subtle disbelief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone out , well , and taken the world . " How can she stand it , day after day  --  the chaos ? " Deborah asked Carla . " Maybe she just grits her teeth and fights every minute , waking and sleeping . " " Does she have a choice ? Can she be sane by willing it ? " Deborah asked , seeing Doris in her mind as a listless frozen ghost bending her every energy to the Semblance . " My doctor says we all choose , really , these different ways . " " I remember . . . " Deborah murmured , " . . . the years I lived in the world . . . . " She thought of the Censor again ( Now take a step  --  now smile and say , " how do you do . " ) . It had taken extravagant energy to afford a Censor for the Semblance . " I gave up because I just got tired  --  just too tired to fight any more , " she said . Furii had told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge as Deborah knew it was the shockchallengethat Yr created for her in snakes dropping from the walls , people and places appearing and disappearing , and the awful jolt of the collision of worlds . Furii had said , " Suspend experience ; you may not know what it is like to feel , even remotely , what mental health is . Trust our work together , and the hidden health deep inside yourself . " But in the shadows a huddled , skinny shape waited for herp142thoughts to come to it ; Doris Rivera who had gone into the world . Finally , one afternoon , Deborah , for no reason that she knew , got up from her bed and walked the length of the hall to the ward door . She had come out . Her grayed vision was still severely limited , but it seemed to matter less . Miss Coral was sitting on the floor near the door , smoking a carefully attended cigarette , and seeing Deborah she smiled her completely disarming little-old-lady smile . " Why , welcome out , Deborah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still want to share it . " " Oh , yes ! " Deborah cried , and went to the nursing station , borrowed one of the " official " numbered pencils and a sheet of paper , and spent the time until dinner racing after Miss Coral and Peter Abelard and thick gusts of Medea . It had never occurred to her that Miss Coral would be happy to see her , or that Carla , when she saw her on the hall , would smile and walk to her . " Well , hi , Deb ! " It was brave of Carla to do this right off . It showed trust and a very touching loyalty , since it was usually far safer to wait to see , in anyone 's change , how the change ran before coming over and showing recognition . Deborah could think of no special reason for Carla 's courage and generosity . She wondered for a moment if it might not be that Carla was simply glad to see her . Could there be a world , really , beyond her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the metaphoric Yri words of greeting . In obedience to him and his command the range of her vision grew , and with it , something like a potential for color , although the color itself was still not present . " I 'm glad you got out today , Deb , " Carla said . " I was going to come in and tell you : I 'm set to move down to B ward tomorrow . " You will not listen , will you , Bird-one ? Anterrabae said softly . They plant the seed and call it forth in rich soil . Sun and water and food are all given . T hey coax it forth from itsp143casing , crying , " Join us ; join us . " Sweet singing and the feel of warmth . The first green beginnings come , and they stand over the shoot with a dropper full of acid . . . waiting . The awful truth began to dawn on Deborah that Carla had become her friend , that she liked Carla , and that the scarred befriending part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to roar with laughter , and Anterrabae fell faster away . He was teasing her with his great beauty ; his teeth were fire-struck diamonds and his hair curled with flames . Deborah became aware that she had neither commentednor moved one plane of the mask . " Oh , " she said , and then because she wanted it , to make herself suffer , and the only way she knew how was by telling the truth , she said , " I 'll miss you . " The terror of the statement brought a cold sweating through her and she began to shiver with it . She got up and went to huddle with those of Dante 's third circle before the fickle mercy of the radiator . The next morning when Carla was ready to leave , she said another short good-by . " I 'll be around . You could even get privileges to come and visit me down on B. " Deborah turned a puzzled face toward Carla , for with the help of Yr 's codes and magic she had excised the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . So Yr was still strong ; its queen and victim still maintained a shred of power over the world 's will to make her suffer . She went through the day almost gaily , and got Miss Coral to remember Lucretius ' hooked atoms , and gave a hard wit-parry and thrust home to Helene that brought the fleeting mixture of envy , respect , and terror that was Helene 's form of response . It was the first time since Deborah had come up on " D " that she had put on her disguise , consciously striven for in her fear of Carla 's leaving . Doris Rivera had got up and gone ; Doris Rivera was semi-legend , and Deborah had mentally cast her as a sort of ghost , unable to live , unable to die , a figure of desperateand pathetic endurance ; for Deborah could not imaginep144meeting the world again on any other terms than those . But Carla , she knew , was alive and responsive , and she was on her first step into the nightmare that people called " reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Deborah waited , just out of its sight . Soon it would turn to her . She was eased in her illness now enough that the disguise of normality was gone . And the eye would focus on her and the hand would pick her up and set her out in the wilderness of reality , without even the thin coat of defenses she had spent her life making and this year in the hospital destroying . Overhead , in the dimension of Yr , Lactamaeon , tauntingly beautiful , was free in his open sky , enjoying the shape of a great bird . She had once been able to soar with him in that great sweep . What do you see ? she called to him in Yri . The cliffs and canyons of the world ; the moon and the sun in the same bowl , he answered . Take me with you ! Just a moment ! the Censor intervened with his rasp-voice . Deborah never actually saw the Censor because he was not of either world , but had a part in both . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmale , unfemale , joined him . While they discussed the matter elaborately , parodying the now familiar psychiatric manners and terms , Lactamaeon found a chasm , dove into it with a high eaglescreamof triumph , and was gone . Somehow , in the interim , it had come to be evening . Miss Coral came up to Deborah , saying , " I guess that the secret of enjoying hospital food is to be too ill to notice it . " " Mary still has some of those candy bars , does n't she ? Ask her and maybe she 'll give you one . " " Oh , but I ca n't ask . I never could ask for anything . I thought you knew that . When I have to ask , something happens to me and I . . . well , I start to fight . " " I did n't notice , " Deborah said , wondering if she ever looked at anyone or noticed anything about the world.  | " I wanted to tell you something , " Miss Coral said almost shyly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reads classical Greek fluently  --  a real Greek student , and if you ask him I know that he 'll be glad to help you . " " Who is it ? Someone here  --  a patient ? " " No , it 's Mr. Ellis , and he 's here now , on the evening shift . " " Ellis ! " Deborah realized that the episode with Helene and the bitter cost of witnessing and going Unhidden had been before Miss Coral 's time  --  that since McPherson had spoken to her she had not talked to Mr. Ellis at all and that somehow his sneering and scorn , while still as plain as Anterrabae 's fire , had faded into a part of the undertone of the ward . He spoke little now , and had little to defend . He was no longer new on the job , no longer being tested by the patients and he was now looked upon by them and himself as merely a custodian of things , some of which were still alive . Perhaps he had been spoken to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be those who rose from packs during his hours less convinced of the world than they had been when they went in . " If you want to learn , " Miss Coral continued gently , " it 's he who holds the key " She laughed a little at the allusion . " You have all the Greek I can give you . " Down the hall Deborah could see Ellis unlocking the bathroomfor The Wife of the Abdicated . He did not look at his charge or speak as he stood back and let her by him . Withoutexpression he moved back on the corridor , not looking at anything or anyone . As he passed Deborah , the tumor wrenched inside her , doubling her over hard so that she found herself on her hands and knees . The dark sweat took a while to pass , but it was Castle , the new aide , and not Ellis whom she found watching her shaking the dizziness away . " What 's the matter , Blau ? " " Your spatial laws are okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch out for the choices you give us ! "  |p146For  weeks Esther Blau had worried and fretted over having to tell Suzy about her sister 's illness . Who had not heard all the old-style high melodrama of insanity ; of the madwoman in Jane Eyre , of bedlam , of the hundreds of dark houses with high walls and little hope , of lesser dramas in lesser memories , and of maniacs who murdered and passed on the taints of their blood to menace the future ? " Modern Science " had given the official lie to much of this , but beneath the surface of facts , the older fears remained in the minds of the well no less than of the sick . People paid lip service to new theories and new proofs , but often their belief was no more than the merest veneer , yielding at a scratch to the bare and honest terror , the accretion of ten thousand generations of fear and magic . Esther could not bear the thought of Suzy replacing thep147familiar image of her sister with the wild-eyed face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that it was this stereotype that she and Jacob had begun to imagine the first time they heard the grating of the locks , when they saw the barred windows , and when they shuddered to the screaming of a woman from some high gable . Still , Suzy had to know ; it was past time . The little sister was growingup and they could no longer talk around her ; it was n't fair to keep shutting her out from the source of their deepest concern . But the telling would have to be done in some sure way , safely and expertly . They wondered if Dr. Lister could tell Suzy . But Dr. Lister refused ; it was Esther 's job and Jacob 's , he said . " Wait a little longer , " Jacob said . Esther knew that " wait-alittle-longer " was only one of the doors he used to slip quietly into inaction . Close your eyes and it wo n't exist ; everything will be fine-fine-fine . It was a lie . So they fenced back and forth with it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were finished with dinner and Suzy had gotten up to do her practice on the piano , Esther called her back . " This is serious . . . " To her own ears her voice had an odd mixture of gravity and embarrassment . Sitting stiffly , she began to tell her younger daughter that Deborah 's " convalescent school " was a hospital ; her doctors , psychiatrists ; her illness not physical but mental . After they had eased into the icy subject , Jacob began to add , modify , explain this part and that , presentingas fact much of what he himself had been uncertain about . Suzy listened with the complete impassivity of a twelveyear-old , her face giving no sign or flicker by which the parents could detect how she was hearing the words they were wringingout of themselves . When they had finished , she waited a while and then spoke slowly . " I always wondered why those reports seemed to be morep148about Debby 's thoughts than about her body , like pulse or temperature . " " You read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to Grandma sometimes , and once you read to Uncle Claude part of it , and it sounded kind of funny to be about the usual kind of sickness . " She smiled a little , no doubt remembering something else that had puzzled her . " It all fits now . It makes sense . " She went into the next room to practice her piano lesson . A few minutes later , she came back to where Esther and Jacob were still sitting at the table , stunned , over their coffee . " It 's not like she 's Napoleon or something . . . is it ? " " Of course not ! " Then they spoke a little stiltedly and painfullyabout the optimism of the doctors , the advantage of early treatment , and the strong force of their patience and love all weighing in Deborah 's favor . Suzy said , " I hope she comes home soon  --  sometimes I miss her a lot . " And then she went back to the duty of Schubert . They sat for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Esther felt weak with the sudden easing of the tension . Jacob said slowly , " Is this all ? . . . I mean is this all there is or did n't she really hear us ? Will she be back , when the shock wears off , with the look on her face that I have been afraid of for all these months ? " " I do n't know , but maybe the cannon blast we were fearingwas only what we heard . " Jacob took a long draw of his cigarette and let his anguish leave his body with the exhaled breath . " English is a wonderful language , " Furii said , " to have such expressions . You look like what they call down in the dumps . ' " " English is no better than Yri . " " To praise one thing is not to damn another . "  | " Is n't it ? Is n't being wrong courting death ? " ( The sharp sword of precocity had been comfortable in her hand ; she had honed its edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and captive was to be right and only right . ) " But you made costly mistakes , did n't you ? " Furii asked gently . " You identified the wrong girl at the camp . " " I was wrong a hundred times . But as long as I was ugly and ruined and beyond hope , and of a substance that was poisoned and poisoning , I could still appear to be right . If I was wrong  --  even a little  --  then what was left ? " She saw the weak and wound-licking ghost of old vanity in what she was saying and laughed . " Even in Pernai  --  nothing  --  I had to have a little something . " " And so do we all , " Furii said . " Are you ashamed of it ? To me it is one sign that you are a member of Earth at least as much as of Yr . Do you believe that your substance , as you call it , is really poisonous ? " Deborah began to tell her about the Yri laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentiated by this substance , which was called nganon . Nganon was a concentrate which was defined in each person by nurture and circumstance . She believed that she and a certain few others were not of the same nganon as the rest of Earth 's people . At first Deborah had thought that it was only she who was set apart from human kind , but others of the un-dead on D ward seemed to be tainted as she was . All of her life , herself and all her possessions had been imbued with her essence , the poisonous nganon . She had never lent her clothes or books or pencils , or let anyone touch any of her things , and she had often borrowed or stolen from other children at school or camp , delighting , until their stolen nganon wore off them , in the health and purity and grace of the possessions . " But you told me that you used to bribe the children at camp with the candy that your mother sent you , " Furii said . ' Well , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im/personal . Being unopened it had no essence , and it takes about a day or so before the Deborah-rot sets in . I gave it right away almost as soon as I got it . " " And so you bought a little popularity for a few hours . " " I knew I was a liar and a coward . But by that time the Collect had begun to come stronger and stronger , and liar and coward ' were standard comments . " " And this feeling was threaded through with the precocity that you had to maintain , and with your grandfather 's saying always how special you were . " Deborah had pulled away her mind and the doctor looked up with a kind of sharpness in her eyes , catching Deborah at the edge of something . " Anterrabae . . . " Deborah called in Yr . " Where are you now ? " Dr. Fried interjected . " Anterrabae ! " Deborah said aloud and in Yri . Can she bear the great weight ? " " What is it now , Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god , then turned to the mortal in desperation . " Anterrabae knows what I saw  --  what I have to speak of . . . If only I had not seen it ; if it had been hidden , that special thing . . . that thing . " When she began to shiver with the cold of an ancient parting , Furii gave her a blanket , and she lay on the couch rolled up in it and shaking . " During the war . . . " she said , " I was a Japanese . " " An actual Japanese ? " " I was disguised as an American , but I was really not an American . " " Why ? " " Because I was the Enemy . " It seemed to Deborah an ultimate secret , and Dr. Fried was forced to ask her to speak louder time and time again . She began to explain that because she could go into Yr or rise out of its incredible distances without visibly changing , Yr hadp151given her , as a gift for her ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or so she had been a wild horse or a great bronze-feathered bird . She quoted to Dr. Fried the Yri incantation which had once freed the bird-self from the illusion of the ugly and hated girl : " e , quio quio quaru ar Yr aedattemoluqu ' braown elepr ' kyryr . .. " ( Brushwinged , I soar above the canyons of your sleep singing ... ) When she was this great soaring creature it seemed as if it was the earth ones who were damned and wrong , not she , who was so complete in beauty and anger . It seemed to her that they slept and were blind . When the Second World War had come , making of the names of Pacific Islands another language of hell and magic to Americans , the Collect had said to her , " They hate these Japanese as they have always hated you , " and Anterrabae , in the urbane falling-smile , Bird-one ; you are not of them . She had remembered hearing the fragment of some speech on the radio . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Collect had cried out , Then you must be this enemy they fight ! On a certain night before falling asleep , Deborah had been reborn as a captured Japanese soldier . From behind the mask of an American-Jewish girl with a past of an American suburb and city , the elliptical eyes of the Enemy looked for the day of his unmasking . The tumor 's impossible , insistent anguish was his war wound , and his mind , versed in a strange language , rang with dreams of escape . He did not hate his captors  --  he never wished that they would lose the war , but the world now offered meaning to the irreconcilable oppositions in Deborah , the ruination of her secret and female parts , the bitter secrecy of her wound , and the hidden language . Cap/tivity and secrecy and the glory and misery of Yr 's declaration You are not of them were somehow justified . On the day that the war in the Pacific was over , Anterrabaecaused Deborah to break a glass and step on the pieces with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , wincinghimself as he picked the slivers out , was awed and a little puzzled at her " soldierly " stoicism . At last I am brave enough for the damn doctors ! Deborahsaid in Yri to Lactamaeon . You are captive and victim , Lactamaeon said . We did not want you to escape . " You hid this presence from everyone around you , " Furii said . " Did you hide it also from Yr ? " " It had no place in Yr ; it was part of the Earth dimension . " " And so the Censor had the care of keeping it secret . Is that not so ? I have trouble to understand the place of this Censor in your kingdom . " " The Censor is supposed to protect me . In the beginning he was put at the Midworid barrier to keep Yri secrets from coming out in Earth 's conversations . He censored all my acts to keep Yr 's voices and rites from reaching the Earth 's people . Somehow he became a tyrant . He began to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in Yr . " " But this Censor , and Yr itself , was still only an attempt to understand and explain reality , to build a sort of truth where you could live . Well , " the doctor concluded , " I am sure there is much to see here and to study . You are not a victim now ; you are a fighter with me , for the cause of your good , strong life . " When her patient left , Dr. Fried looked at her desk clock . It had been a long , exhausting session , though the clock showed the time had been no longer than usual . The intensity of her listening , of her sharing , had been so great that she wondered if she could face an afternoon of the cries and agonies of the other patients and the studies and bitter ques/tions of the psychiatric students . What was it today , again ? She looked in the appointment book on her desk . Oh , yes , the seminar . But there was , miraculously , an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumann records had lain on the record cabinet unopened . Beethoven was calling from her memory . Why was there always so little time ? She stretched and walked into the living room , teasing herself by humming little bits . Schumann or Beethoven ? How does the doctor feel today ? She took the package down and opened it , and as she did so , she began to think about a patient whose doctor had come for her advice on a seemingly insoluble problem . No . No more patients now . She got the machine ready and put the first record on the spindle . Schumann 's sweet , gentle music filled the room . She listened and her mind shifted to German and the poetry of her youth . She sat back in the soft livingroomchair , closed her eyes , and rested . And then for the twelfth time that day , the phone rang . On Deborah 's way back to the ward the dreaded cloud lowered , and the rumble of the Collect and Censor and Yr began . Terror at what was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back on the ward . Seeing the head nurse leaving , she went after her , but she could not speak ; the door closed and the day shift was gone . The evening shift came on and the menacing moved closer , hovering to engulf her . Just before the wave broke , Deborah went to the ward nurse who was overseeing the evening spoon-count . " Miss Olson . . . " " Yes ? " " It 's going to hit  --  please  --  it 's going to hit harder than I can stand up under . I should be in a pack when it hits . " The nurse looked up ; it was a keen and penetrating look . Then she said , " Okay , Miss Blau . Now go and lie down . " The wave broke as hard as she had foreseen , with a tie/mendous gust of ridiculing laughter , but the fleeing of her senses was not complete . The Censor 's voice , like a cinder on which Deborah 's teeth were grinding , was loud in her innerear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done this ? The third mirror  --  the ultimate deception is still to be given ! You came to this hospital  --  it was in the plan . We let you trust that doctor . You opened your secrets more and more . This is the final one . Now you have given enough of your secrets , and you will see what she will do  --  she and the world ! And the cinder-laugh crazed Deborah 's teeth to splinters in her mouth . Her face was wooden as she walked to the pack and lay down on the cold sheet , but when the full punishment came , she was already under heavy restraints , fighting and thrashing in the bed that would not give an inch ... . When she came clear it was a long time later . She looked around , seeing . The newly cleared vision was like a blessing . The other bed had its white hump , but she did not know who was making it . " Helene ? " Silence . It had been a long time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heels , where they had made the long hours of contact with the wet sheets , were beginning to burn . She lay back and pulled hard with her whole body , trying to get the weight off the tightly bound ankles . When she had to let go , she rested , trying to save the clarity that was permitting her to see down into her mind . It had been longer than four hours ; the attendants would come soon and take her from the now painful " fighting clothes . " But they did not come . The pain became intense . She could feel her ankles and knees swelling against the sheets and the downward pull of the restraints , but even their heavy ache did not neutralize the sharper , burning pain of the bloodstarvedfeet . Pulling to relieve the weight of the bones inside the legs , Deborah succeeded only in striking hard crampsp155into both calves . When she found she could not ease the knotted muscles , she waited on , gritting her teeth . And still they did not come . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah . . . what 's the matter ? " The voice came from the other bed , but she could not recognize the voice . " Who is that ? " she asked , frightened of another kind of deception . " It 's Sylvia . Deborah , what is it ? " Deborah turned her head and her wonder penetrated through the pain . " I did n't know you saw me or knew my name , " she said . She had always thought of Sylvia as everyone else did , as a useless piece of ward furniture . She now felt ashamed of having taken her at her own silence . " Sick , but not dead , " Sylvia said . " Are you all right ? " " God . . . it hurts . How long have we been in ? " " Five hours  --  maybe six . We were packed together . Try yelling and maybe someone will come . " " I ca n't . . . I never could , " Deborah said . Time went on , and the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she called loudly , hoping that Yr would not hear it as a scream of cowardice and punish her with it forever . And still no one came , and finally she stopped . Sylvia laughed a little , low in her throat . " I forgot that the yelling of lunatics is lunatics ' yelling . " " How can you stand it ? " Deborah said . " I probably have better circulation than you . I do n't hurt at all , usually , but if your feet are tied just a little too tightly , or if you have trouble with your blood  --  Ah  --  the night-kitchen light has gone out . Three o'clock , then . " Deborah had never reckoned time by the routine of the hospital , or the day-and-night changes and personal idiosyncrasiesof the staff , and she was amazed at the perception of one who had always , but for one moment months and monthsp156ago , seemed far closer to the dead than to the living . " How long have we been in , then ? " " Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah 's face was full of tears that she could not wipe away . Burning in the painflamingdarkness , Anterrabae fell , crying , Deception ! Deception ! The time is now ! And still they did not come . She realized that the fragile trust had opened her wide again for the cold wind and the cold knife . She groaned against the white-hot stabbing that was moving into her legs . " God , they build their tortures cunningly ! " " You mean the restraints ? " Sylvia asked . " I mean the hope ! " As she spoke , the mirror of the final deception , the Awaited Death Oncoming moved toward her . " I see you , Imorh , " Deborah said , speaking for the first time aloud in the presence of a stranger the language of Yr . When they came at last she was very quiet and they were cheered . " Now you 're all calmed down . " She could not walk , but the late night shift was not too busy and they let her sit for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her legs , and her feet could carry her . Before leaving Sylvia in the hard light and her unrolling , Deborah turned , wanting to repay her for the mercy that had wrenched her from silence . She walked toward Sylvia 's bed , watching the eyes of the others grow wary . " Sylvia . " But Sylvia was furniture again  --  a statue or a mannikin , familiar only in form and alive only to the seeking finger at the pulse-place . Sure doom was not as difficult to bear as the little Maybe had been . Deborah had expected the last deception for so long that its coming was almost a relief . Before she went top157the doctor 's office , the Collect and gods and all of Yr massed together on its horizon . " I will not go easily , " she said to them , " not this time . I will not be brave and obliging . No more games . No more being a good sport . I will not play the Game , and go to this death as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw Furii with her familiar smile of greeting , a current of doubt moved in and away . Maybe she does n't know , Deborah thought . But the thought was foolish and a dream . The last Change was death or worse ; it had been said years ago , and last night , the first help she had asked for in English had been given easily , easily , and was only in scorn . She had surrendered her separateness , trusting , on the cold bed . They make a good score of it . Her ankles and feet still ached from their joke . Dark against the fireworks of the pain was that shadow : the always known Oncoming . By what other hand could the end be so sure and so complete , if not by this fire-touch woman who was now sitting before her ? " Well ? " she said . " Well ? " Furii answered . A sudden rage came . " I know that this has to be played in a certain way , and there is a game that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about the game and the end of the game . Why make me foolish as well as dead ! All right ! I am foolish . The deception and the last change is here , so throw it and be done ! " " Where are we now ? " Furii said , shaking her head a little , very carefully unexcited . " You tell me about the Japanese soldier and about having been set apart and special . I try to make you secure that in giving such valuable secrets to our view you do not risk my faith in you for a moment . Then you come the next day and make our work part of the great deception and change . " " They knew when I was ready , " Deborah said . " When I could ask for help , they knew that I trusted and they were ready with the stone to break the flowerpot. "  | " Somehow the old hospital of the past and this present hospitalhave joined their natures in your mind . I will not open your trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mercy ? " Deborah shouted . " Everyoneis so afraid of getting blood on the living room floor . I ca n't stand to see suffering , ' they say , so die outside ! ' It has started already and you still say trust and everything is fine ! " " When I look at you now in this bad shape I can hardly say fine-fine . ' What happened between yesterday and now ? If you say that the last change has started , just tell me . . . tell both of us how . " Slowly , the doctor let Deborah come closer and closer to speaking the truth . Slowly , bit by bit , Deborah told her about asking for the pack . " It has a kind of humor in it , too , " she said bitterly . " It was like what sane people do when they see a rattlesnake . They scream for help , run for safety , lock the doors , crawl under the bed , and then , when the snake is caught , they faint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot that I was standing on their ground and all they had to do was to dissolve it under me . " She told about the long time calling out , and the pain and laughter from Yr , and she took a righteous pride that was almost gleeful in answering Furii 's questions . " Are you sure it was that long ? " " Absolutely . " " Now , you did call for help ... " " You were never a mental patient , were you ? " There was no smile at all , and Furii , as grave as Deborah had ever seen her , said , " No . . . I am sorry , too , because I can only guess at what it must be like . But it will not stop me from being able to help you . Only it makes it your responsibility to explain everything fully to me and to be a little patient with me if sometimes my perceptions are a bit slow . " She went on and the quizzical look returned . " I think now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself for thisp159trouble you have . I think you are giving up too easily , so let me say again that I will not betray you . " At last Deborah had her tinder . " Prove it ! " she shouted , remembering with what good cheer the teachers and doctors and counselors and family had dispensed deceit and misery over the years . " A hard proof , but a valid one , " Furii said . " Time . "  |p160In  the same kind of restraints as those in which Miss Coral had arrived , and with the same thrashing and profanity , the safari brought its new tigress to captivity , and , as before , the ward was laced with tension . Such arrivals always mirrored this patient 's anguish , threatened that one 's violence , and blew like a shifting wind over those to whom any change was a symbol of death . Outwardly there was little acknowledgment of the presence of new patients ; many came to " D " and many went from it , but the fighting ones always bound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller , proud of her veteran 's status on the ward , watched with faintly amused tolerance until she looked into the face of the tigress proceedingdown the hall . Then , recognizing it in the swarm of attendants , she turned , went to her bed , and lay down.  |p161Later  , when Deborah went to Lee Miller and asked her who it was ( knowing that certain patients usually learned by grapevine days in advance who was coming , Name , Age , Occupation , Religion , whether Married or Single , Previous Hospitals , Shock treatments  --  what kind and how many  --  Other Treatment , and Remarks ) , Lee replied , " Why ask me ? " and pulled her blanket over her face . Deborah was reduced to seeking out an attendant . " It 's a readmission , " the attendant said lightly . " Is n't much written . Her name 's Doris Rivera . " With a sick feeling Deborah moved back against the wall and the attendant went by her . Fear and anger , fear and vindictivejoy , fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surfeit . The great Doris Rivera had broken her back on the wheel of the world . It was proof of something . Suddenly , the envy burst out of her mouth in a great gust of bitter laughter . " So much for Rivera , the North Star ! Who did she think she was anyway ! " " Napoleon ! " Lena shouted , and grabbed the heavy ash tray she was using and threw it , missing Deborah and hitting the wall beside her . The attendant said , " Come on , now , Lena , " but there was no force in it . Later , Deborah heard her in the nursing station saying , " Damn that Blau bitch ! Mommy and Daddy are shelling out plenty on that bitch who is n't fit for saving . " Someone else demurred , but it was only for form 's sake . Deborah turned slowly and walked past the doors of the seclusion section to the front of the closed box where Doris had been taken . " That 's where you are , Presumptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who was she to have tried , challenging them all ? And how dare she have failed under the grinding of the world ! But there also came a long surge of pity , which was also pity for herself , and an answering terror , which wasp162also terror for herself . So they come back ; the ones who are too stubborn to accept that their nganons are poisonous and who are beaten to ruins . They come back , and slowly , they get up off the ward 's floors , shaking like the loser in a prizefight , and after a while stagger back toward the world again and again , and come back , not on the canvas , but in it . How many times will it take before they die at last ? And you , Bird-one , Lactamaeon said , smiling a little . Darknessand pains and hard fear and mindlessness , and yet your heart is still going and your pulse still makes you a part of the census . Why ? she shouted at him in Yri . Because your keepers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doris . Doctorsand nurses rang the keys of their authority in her locked door . Packs and sedations , consultations and counselings kept the ward excited and angry . A multitude of little sisters were consumed with envy for the attention given to a sibling who had come home to violate their sovereignty . Dowben 's Mary stood outside the door groaning wordlessly as the members of the parade emerged , and Lee Miller sat in her place on the hall muttering angrily , " So you 've botched the job , Doc . Pick up the marbles and go home . . . She 's lost . Doctors never know when they 're beaten . " By the time Doris herself appeared , very pale and haggard , a few days later , she had a whole hall of secret enemies . Deborah appraised her in the light of the myth which she and Carla had made . Doris was very thin and she had graying hair , but even exhausted and dizzy with sedatives , there was an abundant sense of life thrumming through her . In whatevermanner she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been on her knees . She saw Deborah looking at her with the merciless eye of the wlole ward.  | " What are you gawking at ? " she said in a hard , honest voice . " You do n't look like a fashion model either . " " You were here before , " Deborah said , blurting out unexpectedwords to answer the unexpected remark . " So what ? " " How come you are back ? " " It 's none of your goddam business ! " " But it is ! " Deborah shouted . Before she could explain , the anxious cordon of attendants flanked Doris and led her away . Deborah was left with the anger strong in her ears and the question still held unasked . Yr began to rumble and the Collect prepared its brittle laughter . " I will , too ! " she said to the phalanx of her other dimension . She went to the closed door of Doris ' seclusion Qnd pounded on it . " Hey ! Was it too tough  --  is that why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot happened , " the door shouted back . " Like what ? " " Like none of your goddam business ! " " But they talk about getting well  --  and going out . Everybodydoes , and She had been heard . The attendants moved to nip trouble in the bud . " Get away from that door , Deborah . You have no business there , " the white blurs said . " I was talking to Doris , " Deborah insisted , not knowing if any of her questions would be answered , but feeling that she had to ask that door  --  even if it gave no answer  --  if she would be forced to take the Censor back , and the semblance of sanity , and all the other lies and horrors , in order to live in the depthless , colorless world outside . " Okay , Blau . . . come along . " Their voices were warning her : pack or seclusion or both if she did n't come along . " Hey , you ! " the door said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy bitch 's questions . I wo n't know until she asks them . " " Rivera , this is n't your affair , " the attendant on one side said righteously . " Blau . .. " " All right  --  " Deborah said . " All right . " That afternoon , Dowben 's Mary tripped and fell and her shoe flew off and Deborah caught it . She threw it back to Mary and for a while four or five of the patients began to play catch with it , sending it around corners and into the dormitory . On a high catch , Deborah came down hard on her ankle . The next morning the ward doctor examined it and said that he thought it was broken . " Our X-ray machine is out of whack , " he said . " She 'll have to be taken to St. Agnes ' . " And so , two uniformed students , terrified that she might escape , took Deborah in a taxi to the hospital . At St. Agnes ' , set apart in a private room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deborah alternately laughed and swore . Other nurses and aides kept creeping by the door to her room . " Is that the mental patient in there ? " ( Whispered outside , as though she were a movie star or a carrier of the plague . ) Heads turned , eyes turned as she made her way down the hall to X ray . ( Elaborate disinterest  --  " If I look , will she look ? " ) The students who accompanied Deborah felt very important and did not fail to tell the others in the X-ray room that their duty was the " disturbed ward . " " Are they violent ? " Perhaps the reply was a wink ; Deborah did not hear any answer . Suddenly she saw herself as they must be seeing her : lank hair , dirty , flabby from inactivity , wearing an old ward bathrobe over her own miserable pajamas ( they had thought that she might stay at St. Agnes ' , and dressing was a nuisance ) , the Crazy Look maybe . She could never tell what thep165mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here it was  --  what Doris Rivera had faced and what Carla might soon face  --  the World . She fainted . Looking up at the avid faces outside the X-ray room only a few moments later , Deborah realized how much she would hate to have a broken ankle and have to stay where she was so much more insane than she was on the " violent " ward of a nuthouse . She sat up . " How do you feel ? " her own nurses asked ( as if they were the only ones with sufficient knowledge to approach her psychologically ) . It occurred to Deborah that if she frightened them all enough , they would let her go back , ankle or no . " It 's one of my attacks "  --  she tried to look ominous  --  " coming on . " Well ! " the doctor said very heartily , " that 's a nasty sprain she has there  --  but nothing 's broken ! " A long sigh of release from everyone ; out the door she limped with a bound-up ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab and fast-fast to highway to road to smaller road to gate and into the back door of South Building ( Wards B to D ) and up in " the meatwagon " to " D " and home and Thank God ! Thank God ! In the evening , at night wash-up , she limped into the big bathroom and looked at herself in the steel plate that served as a mirror . The self-hate of hundreds upon hundreds of patientshad been vented on it and tempered steel can not endure such an onslaught . Even the weaponless had found weapons to scratch it and dent it and no inch of its surface was clear . " E nagua , " Deborah said to it ; the formal Yri for : " I love you . " " Off to the physical hospital . . . " she told Furii , " . . . I never wished you used strait jackets until yesterday . I would have loved to make the picture complete . I 'm a fool , though ; I did n't even think about frothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are trying to hurt yourself now , " Furii said . " What happened ? " When Deborah told her , she sighed . " It goes very slowly , this prejudice , " she said , " but it is gettingbetter . I remember how much worse it was before the Second War and really how much worse before the First . Be patient about this . Because you know so much more about mental illness than they do  --  you are freer to be understanding and forgiving . " Deborah shifted her gaze . Again , there was Furii 's subtle , all-pervading message to cast with the world , to help it , even while sick and estranged . " I ca n't help anyone , do n't you see ! Do n't you understand anything I 've been telling you ? The nganon cries from itself ! " " What ? Try to tell me what this is . . . perhaps I do not understand . " " I 'm separated from the good . There 's a saying in Yr , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate it for you . In silence , in sleep , before action or breath , utterly and immutably , nganon cries from itself . ' It means that the poisonedsubstance , the enemy-self can cry out and draw to itself all the other few poisoned ones that there are in the world . It draws them without my knowing , magically , no matter how or what I do . " " I think you mean it has drawn one or two or three , " Furii said . " I want you to tell of them . " Beyond all of the forces of Yri magic , gods , and worlds , Deborah was sure that there was another proof of her intrinsicunworthiness . This proof lay in the world , in the simple , daily matters of an earthly youth . It was the seemingly magic force which attracted her to others . One had to choose or be chosen as a partner at camp , a seatmate at school , the member ( in a certain order of importance ) in all kinds of cliques and groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be served . Deborah had found thatp167she could meet the demands of this membership only with the tainted , the very poor , the crippled , the disfigured , the strange , the going-insane . These pairings-off were not planned or thought out even secretly ; they came about as naturally as the attraction of magnet and metal , yet many of the fragments which had been drawn together thus knew why in their hearts and hated themselves and their companions . One summer at camp there had been a brilliant girl named Eugenia . The time before the last great change was running out , and Yr was demanding more and more of Deborah 's days in service to it , and giving less and less of its comfort in return . Eugenia and Deborah found each other and they knew why and sometimes they tormented each other for it . Yet there was a sympathy , too ; a knowing without needing to be told what suffering there could be behind the simplest act , an understanding of how hard the Semblance was to hold up before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  towalk to the dining room together , to the ball field together , to the lake together , to comfort each other withoutthe words being utterly lies or only lip service to the Semblance . Although they needed walls between themselves and the others , they most needed  --  just sometimes , with just someone , to break through that sound-proof plate-glass partitionthat was the Semblance , and for a little time , to say things as if the whole world were not the Collect . After a while the camp accepted them as friends of each other and wrote them out of its anger and hard judgments . Deborah had known , of course , that Eugenia was different , alone , bitter , and unquiet , but she had tried to shield herself from the thought that Eugenia was a carrier of the poisoned nganon . One day Deborah had managed to slip away in order to be quietly in Yr on the Plains of Tai'a where she could fly if Yr allowed it . She had many hiding places at the camp where she could find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call and look for her . One of the best of these wasp168the deserted shower-house , but when she went there on this day , she sensed that someone else was there . She began to sing to warn the one who could not see her . Too many times she herself had been intruded upon while laughing or speakingYri aloud , and had had to bear the torments of the Censor for it . Now , there was a frantic scrambling in one of the stalls and the sound of Eugenia 's voice . " Who is it ? ! " " Deborah . " " Come here . " Deborah went to the shower . Eugenia was standing naked in the stall of the dry shower . She was sweating heavily . As Deborah came toward her she held out a heavy leather belt . " Here , " she said . " Beat me . " " What ? " " You know what I am . I do n't have to lie to you . Take it . Use it . " " What for ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pretending you do n't understand . You know what it 's for  --  it 's for me , and you have to  --  " " No --  " Deborah began to back away . " I ca n't . I wo n't . " Eugenia 's need filled up the space between them . Sweat was running from her face and beading on her shoulders and arms . " Do n't forget what I know about you ! I 'm going to make you beat me with this belt , and you will . . . because ... you . . . understand . " " No  --  " Deborah moved farther away . It flashed through her mind that perhaps her nganon had reached Eugenia and combined with Eugenia 's own waiting virulence to bring this about . Deborah might be Ruin  --  Pernai shackled and shod in destruction  --  but it was for herself alone ; she had never asked anyone else to partake of it . Then it suddenly came to her that Eugenia 's nganon might be more virulent than hers . Even so , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . Herp169nganon had called to Eugenia 's , thus opening , thus causing ... Deborah went to Eugenia , took the belt , threw it down , and ran from the showers . She never looked at or spoke to Eugenia again . " Then the one who is a friend  --  anyone who likes you or is attracted to you  --  is ruined , if not by you , then by closeness to you . . . " " Yr puts it as a joke , but you say it more to the point . Yes , that is true . " " Is it true of your mother and father and sister ? " " Men are not poisoned by female poison . I think that they are broken in some other way . I never thought of it before , but I see men here . They have whole wards of them , just like us . " Indeed so , " Furii said . " It is true for women though ? You still have this fear of contaminating ? " " I have been slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of this ? " " I think that my sister will be insane . " " You still think so ? " " Yes . " The phone rang and the doctor rose and went to the desk to answer it . There were few hours when the phone did n't ring at least once , and during one amazing session there had been five calls . Furii shrugged in a little helpless sign of apology and spoke for a few moments . " Now . . . " she said , sitting down , " where were we ? " " In the bell-clanging world , " Deborah said acidly . " Some of the calls I can not stop  --  they are long distance or made specially from doctors who have no other time . I free us from as many of them as I can . " She looked at Deborah with a little grin . " I know how hard it is to succeed with a great , famous doctor . ' There is always such a desire to even up the score a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her from an imaginary perfect record . ' I tell you I have many failures ,  |p170too   --  in spite of my being in such great demand . Will we work together ? " " We were talking about contaminating . " " Ah , yes . I 'm curious , " Furii said . " If this incident in the showers had happened to you now , would you be as fright-ened ? " " No , " and Deborah laughed because it seemed ridiculous . " Well , why not ? " " Well . . . " Deborah came into a sort of sunshine . " I 'm crazy now . As soon as you admitted that I was sick  --  as soon as you admitted that I was so sick that I had to be in a hospital , you proved to me that I was saner than I had thought . You know , saner is stronger . " " I do n't quite understand . " " I had known all those years and years how sick I was , and nobody else would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the reality to which you were closest and which you could discern as clearly as daylight . Small wonder that mental patients have so low a tolerance for lies .... " " You look as though you are seeing this for the first time , " Deborah said , still in the light . " Is it true ? Did I bring you something ? " Furii paused . " Yes , in a way you have , because though I knew other reasons why lying is bad for the mentally disturbed , I never saw it in this particular way . " Deborah began to clap her hands , smiling . " What is it ? " Furii said , seeing that the smile was not bitter . " Oh , well .. " You are happy to give then , as well as to be given ? " " If I can teach you something , it may mean that I can count at least somewhere . " " I weep , " Furii said . " I weep big crocodile tears for your Yri gods . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are wasting the time of a real humanp171being who will someday recognize it and break their houses down and send them away . " " You make me see a pinnacled white cloud . . . " Deborah said , " but behind it is still the same Furii of the fire-touch and the lightning bolt , " and she trembled to think of having to endure without Yr . Later , they began to explore the secret idea that Deborah shared with all the ill  --  that she had infinitely more power than the ordinary person and was at the same time also his inferior . The poisoning nganon had been such an idea for Deborah , but she saw into the intricacies of it coldly , with her reason and not as a truth of the spirit . One evening , as she sat in the hall waiting for the sedative call , she looked at Miss Coral , sitting like an ancient owl on one of the heavy chairs , and at Lee and at Helene , who had just come walking toward them . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you talking to me ? " Lee said . " To all of you . Can you read my thoughts ? " " What are you trying to do  --  get me sent to seclusion ? " " Go to hell , " Helene said pleasantly . " Do n't look at me , " Miss Coral said , with the genteel horrorof a countess visiting an abattoir , " I ca n't even read my own . Deborah looked around at the figures decorating the walls of the hall . They were always waiting , always seeming never to have moved or changed . " If you 're seeking objective reality , " she muttered to herself , " this is one hell of a place to start . "  |p172It  was spring , the season of passion and impatience . The terrible vacuum caused by the rushing by of time made Jacob feel empty inside . He sat at the grammar-school graduation exercisesof his younger daughter , heard the singing and the speeches , the prayers and the promises , and felt the emptiness deepen as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was Suzy 's day and that Deborah was to be no part of it . But against his conscience , his wishes , his promises to Esther and himself , he could not get the thought of Deborah out of his mind . Why was n't she here with them ? It was the second spring that she was gone , and how much closer was she to the modest , obedient , womanly being that his heart cried out to have as a daughter ? No closer . There had been no improvement at all . The young girls began to filep173out of the auditorium , all innocence and white dresses . Jacob turned to Esther , who , for Suzy 's sake , was dressed stunningly in what the family called her " coronation clothes . " " Why ca n't she come home for a while . We 'd go to the lakes ? " he whispered . " Not now ! " Esther hissed . " She 's not committed there by law ! " he whispered back . " It may not be good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; me , once in a while ! " In the evening they took Suzy out to a fancy restaurant . She had wanted to go to the class party , but Jacob , feeling that time and beauty and all his days of them were slipping away , had wanted this one evening at least . Because he wanted it so badly , it was a failure from the start . Suzy was subdued , Esther , saddened because the present daughter was being stinted again for the absent one . Jacob knew that the symbol breaks when it is too heavily weighted , but he could not help himself . The whole evening had a forlorn quality to it . Esther , trying to sound natural by naming the name , said , " Debby wanted to come to your graduation  --  and if she could , she would have sent something . " Suzy looked at her quietly and said , " She was here . I saw you talking about her when we were getting our diplomas and again when we were getting ready to march out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't talk about anyone . " " It 's okay , really , even if you did n't really talk out loud ; it was that look you get . . . " She thought of describing it , in case they did n't know how it showed on their faces , but the words that came were so painfully embarrassing that she could not say them . " Nonsense ! " Jacob said again , waving it away . " A certain look  --  nonsense ! " Suzy and Esther caught each other 's glance . He was hidingagain . Be merciful to him , Esther said with her mind . Suzy looked down at her white graduation dress . She fussed with ap174button for a moment . " You know the girl who stood in front of me when we got the diplomas ? Well her brother is a real dream Although those in the hospital wondered how springtime could come in spite of their particular pain , it came and was triumphant . It made the patients on D ward angry that the world which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , seemed to be thriving . And when Doris Rivera tied up her hair , put on a suit and a shallow smile , and left again for the world , it seemed to many as if she were in league with the springtime against them . The Wife of the Abdicated had a theory : " She 's a spy . I knew her years ago . She takes it all down and the opposition gives her money for it and later when it 's publishedit becomes indigenous . " " We must be charitable , " Dowben 's Mary said because she was Saint Teresa . " We must be charitable even though she has every social disease it is possible to have . Not to mention infections in private places put there by men of no social standing . Not to mention schizophrenia of a dirty , filthy nature . " She had gotten very loud and her tone had the hard , familiar edge of terror . " You mentally ill are so amusing , " Fiorentini 's Mary said . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen into a whirlpool of anger and fear and fights broke out with wild and pointless spontaneity . " There are so many patients in seclusion , " a new student mused . " When they get a few more , they will start to double them up , " Deborah answered . " Yes . . . yes . . . " the student agreed ( Number Three with smile , fleeting ) . Deborah turned away and had another try for the clock with her shoe.  | " I 'd like to stop that smile . " " Your face alone should be sufficient , " Helene said . " At least you can be superior to me ! " And there was another fight . " You get these times on the ward , " the old attendants assuredthe new ones . " It 's not usually this wild . " But the new ones did n't believe them . In all of the new groups of student nurses there was the usual fear , but for the latest group there was a particularly poignant one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shortly after having left their psychiatricaffiliation and were now themselves patients in mental hospitals . " What you see , " it was rumored , " can drive you crazy . And so the four new students assigned to D ward stood in a tight , scared little clutch , the only beauty , youth , and health present , and in the spring of the year . Never did the bearers of poisonous nganons feel their separation so much as on this day . Helene and Constantia would fight the new enemies until their strangeness wore off , and Deborah would obliterate them in her own way until they faded into the ward 's daily anonymouspattern . She would not see them except as blurs of white . She would seldom hear them unless they spoke of her or gave specific orders . This protection against their newness and beauty was more successful than fighting . Although it was not a conscious act , she was grateful for it . It was not only the beauty and sprightliness of the students that hurt , but their strangeness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting on the floor near the nursing station and measuring the stare of the enemy clock , Deborah heard two of the students talking . " A new one from B ? Where 'll they put her ? " " I do n't know , but she really must have blown if she 's comingup here . " " Remember what Marcia told us  --  they do better and thenp176they do worse . I hope she 's toilet trained at least and knows where to put her food ! " And they giggled . The giggle was a reflex of anxiety and Deborah knew it . but when they brought Carla up later , all sprung inside and with the beaten look that Doris Rivera had had , Deborah was bitterly angry at the white unseens for having laughed . They had not been talking about some nut , but about Carla , a Carla who was good all the way to the bone ; good enough even to be kind when Deborah had struck her at the core of her pain . No one , seeing Deborah and Carla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an imposition , incomprehensible to the sane , for Deborah to greet Carla , who was in distressand who would be sorry later if a greeting drove her to violence or even rudeness . Deborah did not look at Carla ; she only waited behind her stone mask until she would see the secret sign from Carla that meant recognition . When the sign was given , they moved toward each other appearing as elaborately unconcerned as they could . Deborah smiled very slightly , but then a strange thing happened . Into the flat , gray , blurred , and two-dimensional waste of her vision , Carla came three-dimensionally and in color , as whole and real as a mouthful of hot coffee or coming-to in a pack . " Hi , " Deborah said , on a barely rising tone . " Hi . " " Can you smoke ? " " No privileges . " " uh . " Later Deborah passed Carla outside the bathroom , waiting to be let in by an attendant . " Supper on my bed , if you want . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brought her tray to the back dormitory where Deborah was now staying . " Okay ? " Deborah moved aside so that Carla had the choice place , on the foot of the bed where it was level . ( " Hello , hello , myp177three-dimensional and multi-colored friend . I am so glad to see you . " ) Aloud she said , " Doris Rivera was back , but she left again . " I heard . " Carla looked up at Deborah and by another miracle , perhaps like the one which had made her clear to Deborah 's eyes , she seemed to see through the mask . " Oh , Deb  --  it 's not so bad . I had to come back because I tried too much at once , and because part of what I did was against my father . . . and for lots of other reasons . I 'm not giving up ; I 'm just tired , that 's all . " Her eyes filled with tears , and Deborah , frozen with confusion and terror in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was in that awful , chaos-ocean of the world that made the drowning ones go back to it , still pale and choking , for another try and another and another . Why do they think they can float like others when the surfacetension of their nganons was broken by the first drowning ? Deborah cried to Lactamaeon . Idat only knows , he said . For some , nothing is impossible . Deborah 's inner muscles tightened with fear . Then youthink that her nganon is not intrinsically evil , but is . . . is cir-cumstantial ? " Yes . " But I am a friend of hers . If she is not of my substance , I will poison her ! " Exactly so . " Can a thing go so against the Laws ? Even the Law says , " nganon calls forth itself . " Did I call forth a different essence , and if so , why ? Perhaps as a punishment , Lactamaeon said . Occasionally others are damned by you to punish you . Deborah looked from the god and saw Carla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed , to believe that one knew the code , that after years of suffering to find a way to outguess it ,  |p178the  final step gave way and there was the old chaos , anarchy , and laughter . She was my friend ! she cried to the departing gods . She seemed not to be hurt .. . You are not of the same substance ; the nganons are not the same . You will be her murderer , " they said . When Carla finished crying , Deborah 's body was still at the other side of the bed , but her self was not with her body . For some unfathomable reason , one of the students attached herself to Deborah . Busily and with the gratuitous , meddling ; heeriness of her dedication , the student followed her , a white blur and a blurred voice in the gray background , whenever Deborah poked her face out on the " public " part of the ward . You must be sicker than you think , Deborah said to herself in Yri . These people usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their dog and Deborahs are so many bones . Therefore shall my name be Bone . It seemed very funny indeed in Yri , and she laughed aloud and then she made the symbolic Yri gesture with her hands and the mimicry of laughter , mutely , as it was in Yr . Who laughs there ? Anterrabae joked with her . It is I , the God-Bone-Thing ! she answered , and they laughed until she felt the torment of the earth easing inside her . Whatwill happen to that one 's dear glory when God smells what her offering is ! and they laughed again . And the surprise on the face of the sweat-borne studentstorming Heaven ? " And there was more laughter , but it ended in sorrow because Deborah knew that she was not strong enough to ask the student not to track her and bother her with solicitous noises . The spring went on and although Deborah gave and gave to Furii the secrets and fears and passwords of the passages between her worlds , she was surrendering them only to hasten her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep179Juggernaut or the falling of Anterrabae . She did not lose the chill feeling of detachment before the doom and for a while she even posed a little in drama of that doom , making a high art of dying beautifully . Furii threw up her hands . " Not only sick , God help us , but adolescent , too ! " " Well ? " " Well , there is no help for it  --  you must do what you have to , parodies and all . Only please help me to see which is the sicknessagainst which we pit our whole strength , and which is the adolescence that is only another sure sign that you are one hundred per cent Earth-one and woman-to-be . " She looked at Deborah keenly for a while and then smiled . " Sometimes the work gets so intense  --  all the secrets and the symptoms and the ghosts of the past to be met  --  one forgets how arid and meaningless this therapy can all seem before the world comes to be real to the patient . Deborah looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often been a relief ; on it lay a paperweight , whose odd shape resisted definition and eased the eyes and the mind from the tension of those hours . She was going to it now because , though it was familiar , it could not hurt . Furii saw her looking at it . " Do you know what that is ? " " Agate ? " " No , not agate . It is a rare kind of petrified wood , " Furii said . " My father took me on a trip to Carlsbad when I graduatedfrom what you call the high school . There the strangest sorts of rocks and formations are made , and he bought this for me as a souvenir of the trip . " Furii had never once said a personal thing about her own past or self . Early in their time together , when the first trust was coming and Deborah had wrestled with her understanding and had forced herself to stay tankutu ( unhidden ) while Furii 's questions probed , Furii had risen at the end of the hourp180and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cyclamen in her flowerpot . She had said , " I do n't ordinarily break flowers , but this you have earned . I do n't often give presents either , so take it . " It had been worth the cost of the two terrible punishments from Yr that Deborah had received for accepting flowers from the Earth , although when she had come clear from the second , it was days later and the beautiful flower had long since wilted and dried . Now Furii was giving a second gift , a little piece of herself . Its delicacy meant more than a small respite from the probing or an unsaid message to " take heart " ; it said , " I will trust you with one of my memories as you have trusted me with yours . " Once again , adolescence or no , it made of Deborahan equal . " Did you like the trip ? " she said . " Oh ; it was not exciting or fun ' such as young people have now , but I felt so grown-up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the two of us in the adult world . " Her face had the memory-shine of the old happiness . " Well ! " She put her hands on her knees with finality . " Back into the salt mines . All right ? " " All right , " Deborah said , getting ready to bear inward again . " Oh , no ; wait . There is something else . I want to tell you now so that you can get used to the idea . I am leaving for my vacation early this summer because of a conference in Zurich . Then comes my vacation and then I go to join in a symposium for some writing which has been long put off . " " How long will it be ? " " I plan to leave on June twenty-sixth and be back on Septembereighteenth . I have arranged for you to have someone to talk to while I am gone . " In the sessions that followed Furii talked about the colleague 's qualifications , the possibility of resentment at what mightp181seem a rejection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go deeply into the work , but would be there to stand for the world in the battles between Deborah and her censors , collects , and the forces of Yr . It was all deft and sure , but Deborah sensed the fait accompli , the oiling of the ancient wheels on which one was broken . " I know lots of doctors here , " Deborah said wistfully . " Craig ; and Sylvia 's doctor , Adams  --  I 've seen her at work and I like her . I talked to Fiorentini once when he was on call at night , and then , the best one is Halle . He says he was the one who saw my parents when I was admitted . I 've talked to him and I trust him . . . " " Their schedules are all full , " Furii said . " Dr. Royson will see you . " The gears were oiled , the wheel ready ; her acceptancewould merely be form . " My third rail , " Deborah said . " What is that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means : I will comply . "  |p182Deborah  worked against time , wishing to resolve everything before Furii left . She asked for and got a transfer to B ward  --  still locked , but not " disturbed . " Paper and pencil and books and privacy were possible there , but it was like a tomb cornoaredto the rampant craziness of " D. " Because she had beenD " a patient , the others on " B " were afraid of her , but she knew a few of them and there were some good nurses who remindedher of McPherson by mentioning him . The therapeutichours were infused with the desperate urgency created by Furii 's leaving , and if the insights were not brilliantly lit , they were at least hard-worked and honest . " I leave you in good hands , " Furii said on the last day . " You know the B-ward administrator well and there is Dr. Royson to talk to . I hope you have a very good and profitable summer . "  |p183Because  Yri law wove into the world 's laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had excised the love and memory of Carla from her feelings when her friend had left " D " for the first time , now Deborah forgot Furii as if she had never been and never would be again . From the silent self-conscioushall of B ward , she went to see the New One . She found Dr. Royson sitting stiffly in his chair in one of the offices on the main floor . " Come in , " he said . " Sit down . " She sat down . " Your doctor has told me a lot about you , " he said . Deborah turned her mind for something to reply , thinking only : How stiffly he sits ; I told her I would be fair . . . I told her I would try as hard with this one . .. . " Yes , " she said . He was not a friendly person . She understood and set out to try the first directions . " You 're from England , are n't you ? " " Yes . " " I like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is one-by-one from the jawbone ! Anterrabae groaned a little scornfully . After a short silence the doctor said , " Tell me what you are thinking . " It seemed to come like a demand . " About dentistry , " Deborah said . " And what thoughts do you have about dentistry ? " he said in his unchanging tone . " That it can be more expensive than we think it will be , " Deborah said . She caught herself and tried again . " I 'm out of Novocain because Furii took it away with her . " " Who is that ? Who took it away ? " He jumped on it as if it were some prize . " The doctor  --  Dr. Fried . " " You called her something else  --  what else did you call her ? " The same demand , like a pickax . " Just another name . "  | " Oh , the Secret Language , " and he leaned back . Comfortablyon safe ground , it looked to her . It was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Fried told me that you had a secret language . " Withdraw ! Anterrabae said . He used the poetic Yri form and in her heartsickness it seemed newly beautiful  --  Te quaru : be as the sea and ebb and leave only a moment of the sandshine . But I promised her . Deborah insisted to the firelit fallinggod in the black place . She is dead , Lactamaeon said on the other side of her . " Tell me one of your words in that language , " the outside voice insisted . " Quaru , " she said absently . " What does it mean ? " " What ? " She came to look at him suddenly and at the brutally hard lines of his disapproving face . He even sat austerely . " What does it mean , that word you spoke ? What was it ? " " Quaru . . . " she repeated . She was flustered with the confrontation , and she heard her own voice tell the gods , But I promised . . . " It means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imply something more of the sea , sometimes the coolness , or that soft , swishing sound , too . It means acting the way a wave acts . " " Why do n't you merely say wavelike then ? " he said . " Well . . . " She was beginning the black sweat that was prelude to the Punishment . " You use it for anything that is wavelike , but it gives the sea-connotation with it and sometimesthat can be very beautiful . " " I see , " he said . She knew that he did n't . " You can use it for the way the wind is blowing sometimes , or beautiful long dresses , or hair that is rippling , or . . . or leaving . " " It also means leaving ? " " No , . . . " Deborah said . " ... there is another word that means leaving . "  | " What word ? " He demanded . " ... It depends on whether one has the intention of coming back . . . " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is also a saying " ( She had made it up that minute to try to save herself and them . ) " It is : do n't cut bangs with a hatchet . " " Cut bangs ? " he said . An Americanism , perhaps , so she tried again . " Do n't do brain surgery with a pickax . " " And what does that signify to you ? " he said , perhaps forgettingthat if she could speak truly to the world , she would not be a mental patient . " It suffered and died in translation , " she said . There followed a long silence between them , and though she tried at the next hour and the next and the next , his humorlessand automatic responses brought down the muteness like a night . He worked hard to convince her that Yri was a languageformulated by herself and not sent with the gods as a gift . He had taken the first words she gave him and shown her the roots of them from scraps of Latin , French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she tried . He analyzed the structure of the sentences and demanded that she see that they were , with very few exceptions , patterned on the English structure by which she , herself , was bound . His work was clever and detailed and sometimes almost brilliant , and she had many times to agree with him , but the more profound he was the more profound was the silence which enveloped her . She could never get beyond the austerity of his manner or the icy logic of what he had proven , to tell him that his scalpels were intrusions into her mind just as long-ago doctors had intrudedinto her body , and that furthermore , his proofs were utterly and singularly irrelevant . At the end she marshaled all of her strength , and with as good a clarity as she could give him , she said , " Please , Doctor , my difference is not my sickness . " It was a last cry and it went unheard.  |p186Now  , with Furii dead and the warmth of Earth 's summet contradicting Deborah 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty universe , there could be nothing else but muteness . She stopped reacting at all and her surface became as dead as the moon . As time went on , her motion ceased also and she sat like a fixed display on her bed . Occasionally , inside , Yr would present her with its alternatives and she would ride with Anterrabae in the hot wind of his fall or soar for a second with Lactamaeon on the rising columns of air over the Canyons of the Sorrow in Yr , but these times were all too rare and took incessant ceremonial tolls . Now even Yr seemed far and not to be apprehended . She named the new doctor Snake-tooth , drawing the implicationof the name from the hot summer-dry shaking of rattles , a senseless but evil sound , and she would think of it as she sat rigid and mute before him hour after hour . Slowly a volcano began to form beneath her still and masklike face , and as more days dragged by , voices and counter-voices , hates , hungers , and long terrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them grew and mounted . At a certain time Idat , the Dissembler , came to her in the shape of a woman . Idat was always veiled when she came so , but she was beautiful and never came without reminding her queen and victim of her beauty and saying also that she , Deborah , might someday aspire to being simply ugly . On this visit , the veil was lowered slightly , and Idat all in white . Suffer , Idat . Why do you flow white ? Shroud and wedding gown , Idat said . Two gowns that are the same gown . Behold ! Should you not dying , live ; and living , die ; surrender , fighting ; and fighting , surrender ? My road will give all opposites at the same time , and the same means for the opposite ends . I know you from the veil outward , Idat , Deborah answered . I mean that men set backfires , one to kindle yet quench the other.  |p187Is  it applicable also to stone ? With my help , Idat said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backfire that would assuage the burning kiln of the volcano , all the doors and vents of which were closed and barricaded . And by this same burning she could prove to herself finally whether or not she was truly made of human substance . Her senses offered no proof : vision was a gray blur ; hearing merely muffled roars and groans , meaningless half the time ; feeling was blunted , too . No one counted matches on B ward and what Yr wished her to obtain was always clear to her vision , freed from the blur . She soon had the matches and a supply of cigarettes picked up here and there . With five of them glowing , she began to burn her surface away . But the volcano only burned hotter behind the stone face and body . She lit the cigarettes again and put them out slowly and deliberately against the inner bend of her elbow . There was a faint sensation and the smell of burning but still no abatement of the volcano . Would it take a conflagrationthen , to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her something . Perhapsshe smelled the burnt flesh , for she forgot what her messagewas and left , and soon a doctor was there . Deborah saw through her mask , with relief , the picture of the face of Dr. Halle . That it was summertime somewhere else and that the picture was in fact a living being , she accepted on faith , like facts too remote to be worth debating  --  the number of miles in the earth 's circumference , or the statistical variations of waves of light . " What do you mean by a backfire ? " he was saying . " It seems necessary , " answered a representative of the volcano . " Where ? " " On the surface . " " Show me . " The words were careful but not critical or hypocritical.  |p188The  sleeve was now stuck to the burned place , but she pulled it off before he could cry the civilized " Do n't ! " , instinctivelywincing a little and thrusting his hand out as if she were made of real flesh . After he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think I 'd better take you up to D. ' " " Whatever . " ' Well " ( and with a hint of a gentling ) , " you 'll be one of my patients there . I 've just taken over the administration of that ward . " She gave the Yri hand-gesture of compliance with the slightly upward tilt , meaning that whether or not there was darkness , at least she felt safer because Halle could be spoken to and never gave the number three with Smile . He took her , with his usual decent lack of fuss , back to the D ward . When they stood inside the double-locked doors , someone from Yr said , Look athim . See ? He feels safer now . Poor man , she answered . " You 've made pretty much of a mess there , " Dr. Halle said , studying the burned place . " It 'll have to be cleaned up and it 's going to hurt . " A student , delighted to be " medical " again , was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Halle began to scrub and clean the burn . A faint sensation followed his instruments , but there was no pain . For his concern and the time he was taking , Deborah wanted to give him a present . She remembered Furii and the gift of the cyclamen . She is dead , though , Anterrabae said . But you can give him a flower , Lactamaeon whispered . I have nothing tangible . Furii gave you a memory of hers , Lactamaeon said . She thanked Lactamaeon with the Yri thanks : Go warm-shod and well lighted in the mind . She tried to think of a truth to tell the doctor as a present . Perhaps it might be the one about seeing  --  that even whenp189seeing every line and plane and color of a thing , if there was no meaning , the sight was irrelevant and one was just as well blind ; that perhaps even the famous third dimension is only meaning , the gift which translates a bunch of planes into a box or a madonna or a Dr. Halle with antiseptic bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he was saying . She looked at him sharply to see if he was trying to burden her with the responsibility of gratitude . No . She wondered if he was immune to her poisonous nganon . She decided that her gift would be a reassurance that he could touch her and not die . " Do n't worry , " she said graciously , " the time of contact is so short that there is no chance of infection . " " That 's why I 'm using this , " he said , swabbing away . As he was bandaging , she realized that he had not understood , so she decided to tell him about the meaning of the third dimension of sight . It came out in a single blurted sentence . " Vision is n't everything ! " " No , I guess not , " he said , finishing up . Then , as if he had caught something , he said , " Do you have trouble with your eyes ? " " Well . . . " Deborah was embarrassed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I get upset . . . I usually have troubleseeing properly . " Oh , really ? How interesting , the Collect said sarcastically . " Shut up ! I ca n't hear myself think ! " Deborah shouted at them . " What ? " Dr. Halle turned . Deborah looked at him in horror . Her words to Yr had pierced the barriers of the earth 's hearing . The clamor from the Collect built higher until it was an overwhelmingroar and the gray vision went red . Without warning the full Punishment fell like an executioner 's hand and the testimony of light , space , time , gravity , and the five senses becamemeaningless . Heat froze and light hurled tactile stabbing rays . She had no sense of where her body was ; there was nop190up or down , no location or distance , no chain of cause and effect .... She endured outside of time and beyond exhaustion , and then she came up in world 's daytime , a pack , a strange doctor . " Hi . " " Hi . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . How long . . . " But she realized that he could not know when she had started down . " How long since I have been up here ? " " Oh , three days or four . " She became aware of aching in her hands and little aches along her arms and shoulders . She became terrified . " Did I hit anybody ? Did I hurt anybody ? " " No . " He smiled a little . " You were having quite a go at the doors and windows , though . " In revulsion and shame she tried to turn away , but a neck cramp caught her so that she began to cough and had to turn back toward him to work it away . " I do n't know you . How come you are here ? " " Oh , I 'm on call today . I stopped in to see if you were okay . " " Good God ! " she said in awe . " I must have torn the place down . They never call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . " That 's not true for me ; I 'm a new doctor . Can you come out ? Do you feel ready ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " Well , we 'll give you another half hour . Do n't worry about that aching . A lot of it is just tension . Well  --  so long . " She heard his key busy in the lock and the inexpertness was strangely moving . When she returned to her bed on D "  --  it was one which she had had before in the front dorm  --  she found it surrounded by woe . In the shuffle of comings and goings , the Wife of the Abdicated had been moved two beds down and Deborahp191was now between Fiorentini 's Mary and Sylvia , still mute and vacant about the face . The Punishment had exhausted Deborahand she lay on her bed watching the world 's shadows draw long , shading the world 's time toward evening . Mary lay resting on the next bed . After a while she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in you . You can really fight ! " " I did n't hit anyone . . . " Deborah said , feeling a little sick at the mention of it and wondering if she had , in spite of what the young " new " doctor had said . " Oh , but the talent is there ; the talent is definitely there ! " Mary laughed her laugh like breaking glass , an imitation of mirth from one who had never understood it . " But , you are insane of course , out of your mind  --  did n't know what you were doing . " Again she used a light voice , a parody of an actress in a sophisticated comedy . " Yes , " Deborah said quietly , " but I ca n't figure out why I came out of it . . . why it stopped ... " " Well , really , every case like you ought to realize that that hell "  --  and she began to shake with shudders of high , shrill laughter  --  " ca n't last any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical pain  --  tee-hee-hee  --  there 's just so much and then , no more ! " " You mean that there is a limit to the thing ? " " Well , more would be obscene , my dear , simply obscene ! " and the high , young-girl giggle broke again into a sharp , back-bristling laughter . Deborah wondered if Mary were right and if , in the nightmareof no laws , there were at least boundaries . The light faded and the dormitory grew dim . Perhaps there was mercy even in Hell . Her vision cleared a little and the softened lines of the beds and the walls and the bodies of the breathing dead around her took on the faint glow of the summer dusk . The overhead lights went on and with them came the knowledge that Mary , agony and all and with her awful laughter , had reached outp192with what little help she could summon , if only to say that there was , indeed , a limit . Even poisonous persons could , if they threw all their courage and energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Helene had done it , Sylvia in her death as furniture had done it , and now Mary had offered from herself a fragment of hard wisdom . Deborah remembered her first meeting with Mary and laughed . She had said , " I 'm Deborah , " and pointed to her bed , " over there . " Mary , with her omnipresent mirthless grin had replied , " I 'm bedlam as seen by Walt Disney . " In the evening Deborah felt a need and got up to scout the ward for fuel for another backfire.  |p193For  Deborah , the backfires became the only way of easing the pressure of the stifled volcano inside her . She continued to burn the same places over and over , setting layers of burns on top of one another . Cigarette butts and matches were easy to obtain , although they were supposedly guarded with great care ; even D ward 's precautions were no match for the intensity of her need . Because the effects of the burnings lasted only an hour or so and because she could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , she had to have a large supply of used cigarettes and the matches to relight them . For a few days the wounds remained secret , even though she had to change the site of the burning when they began to infect and drain . She was amused but not surprised at how oblivious the nurses and attendants were . The wounds drainedp194and stank and no one noticed . She thought : It 's because they do n't really want to look at us . At the end of the week , the new doctor came up to the ward again . " You look a lot better , " he said , stopping by Deborah in the dayroom . " I ought to , " she said a little acidly , " I 've had to work like hell to keep it up . " " Well , with such an improvement , you should be ready to go back to B ward very soon . " When she heard this , she realized that B ward , with its unprotectedtime and free matches , was a perfect chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed that she was terrified , and wondered why . If he was letting her die as she wished , why was she angry ? " I have some more burns , " she said simply . He looked shocked , recovered quickly , and said , " I 'm glad you told me . " She began to pull on her sweater , twisting it like wet laundryin her hands . If I want to die , what am I saving myself for ? she demanded , still angry at the mental image of him permittingher to burn herself to death on B ward . You told him because you are a coward ! the Collect said . They began the old jibes again . " How is the old sore ? " the doctor said , loosening the bandagedplace . She did not answer him because he was seeing for himself . The burn was stubbornly refusing to heal . " You have n't done any more to this ? " he asked , a little bit accusingly and afraid to make it stronger . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage . Let me see ' the new burn . " He looked at the other arm . " How many times did you burn this ? " " About eight . " He bandaged both places and left , no doubt to scold the nurses about the carelessness of leaving dangerous , fire-makingp195materials on the ward . The burning cigarette he left behind him in the dayroom was long enough for two series of burnings . When the lawgivers of D ward discovered that its patients were not so safe as they had thought , they swept the ward up and down with reforms to widen still further the distance betweenthemselves and the patients . The fork that had been introducedon " D " a year before was now rescinded . The Age of Metal gave way to the Age of Wood and fire prevailed only within the precincts of the nursing station , the modern era . In the pleistocene beyond , Pithecanthropus erectus shambled and muttered gibberish , ate with its fingers , and wet on the floor . " Thanks a lot , kid , " Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted place where Modern Man supplied the patients with his status-symbols  --  cigarette and match . " Go to Hell , " Deborah answered , but her tone lacked conviction . Later , the Wife of the Abdicated accused her of being a spy and in league with the Secretary of the Interior , and as Deborah already knew , the Secretary of the Interior was one of the worst Enemies . Getting matches and butts now became difficult , but by no means impossible . Modern Man was careless with the firetippedcylinders he burned and breathed , and waiting beside him was a fire-hungry primitive whose gray and flat world magically included the cigarette in sharp focus , color , smell , and three dimensions of form . But firing back at the volcano did not change its surface , its granite garment , as Anterrabae called it . And gods and Collect and Censor were wildly and inexplicably free with the Punishment . Even the logic of Yr seemed to have been erased and the laws overturned . Deborah began to believe that the volcano would erupt and explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The days had long since become an Earth-form that wasp196only a grammatical nicety . She woke up in one of them and found herself in pack , as so often before . A key turned in the lock of the door and a nurse entered . Behind the nurse , lookingunbelievably different because she had not changed at all , stood Furii . " All right , " she said , and came in . The nurse brought a chair for her , and Deborah began to wish that she might escape the woman 's face and the disgust she saw in it . Furii looked all around , sat beside the bed , and nodded with a kind of awe . " My goodness ! " " You 're back , " Deborah said . The self-hate , terror , shame , pity , vanity , and despair never crossed the stone surface . " Did you have a good time ? " " My goodness , " Furii repeated . " What happened ? You were doing very well when I left , and now , back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah was afraid of the joy she felt in seeing Furii alive . She said , " You 've seen this . . . awfulness before ; why are you so shocked ? " " Yes , I have seen it . I am only sorry to see you in it , and suffering so much . " Deborah closed her eyes . She was stricken with shame and she wanted to escape to the Pit , to be dark and blank , but Furii was back and there was no hiding place . Her mind held . " I did n't know you were coming . " " It is the day I said I would be back , " Furii said . " Is it ? " " It is , and I think maybe you got in this bad shape to tell me how angry you are that I went off and left you . " " That 's not true  --  " Deborah said . " I tried with Royson  --  I really did , but you were dead  --  at least I thought you were  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how smart . I forgot that you would come back .... " She began to thrash again , even though she was exhausted . " I 'm all stopped and closed . . . like it was before I came here .. . only the volcano is burning hotter and hotter while the surface does n't even know if it is alive or not ! " The doctor moved closer . " It is one of these times , " she said quietly , " when what you say is most important . " Deborah pushed her head hard into the bed . " I ca n't even sort them out  --  the words . " " Well then , just let it come to us . " " Are you that strong ? " " We are both that strong . " Deborah took a breath . " I am poisonous and I hate it . I am going to be destroyed in shame and degradation and I hate it . I hate myself and the deceivers . I hate my life and my death . For my truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after time , but I saw that all he wanted was to be right . He might as well have said , Come to your senses and stop the silliness '  --  what they said for the years and years when I was disappointing them on the surface and lying to them with the inmost part of Yr and me and the enemy soldier . God curse me ! God curse me ! " A soft scraping sound , a breathed rasp , came after , as she tried to cry , but the sound of it was so ridiculous and ugly that she soon stopped . " Maybe when I leave , " Furii said , " you can learn to cry . For now , let me say this : measure the hate you feel now , and the shame . That quantity is your capacity also to love and to feel joy and to have compassion . Also , I will see you tomorrow . " She left . That evening Miss Coral came to Deborah holding a book . " Look , " she said timidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a book of plays and I wondered if perhaps you might not wish to read them with me . " Deborah looked over at Helene , who was sitting against the wall . Had Helene been offering the book , she would have kicked it across the floor to Deborah , perhaps with a taunt . Didp198any two people even in the World , speak the same language ? As she answered , Deborah could hear herself mirroring some of Miss Coral 's elaborate form of speech and also her shyness . " Which one would you prefer ? " Miss Coral asked . They began to read The Importance of Being Earnest , with Deborah doingmost of the men and Miss Coral doing most of the women . Soon Lee and Helene and Fiorentini 's Mary were reading , too . With the actors parodying themselves , the play was uproarious . Mary , laugh and all , was Ernest as a well-born bedlamite , while Miss Coral as Sybil reeked with magnolias and spiderwebs . Oscar Wilde 's urbane and elegant comedy was being presented on the nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , and then another , aware that the attendants were laughing with them as well as at them , and thinking , for all the fear it caused , that it was a good night ; one which , magically , was not included in their damnation . Esther Blau faced Doctor Fried unable to speak . Then she cleared her throat . " Did I understand you correctly ? " " I think so , but first " " Why ! Why ? " " We are attempting to find out why . " " Ca n't you find out before she 's all burnt up ! " Esther had read the carefully general report , but something in its tone had alerted her and she had come down again , full of foreboding , to see Deborah . She had been told that it would be unwise ; she had demanded to see Dr. Halle , and once in his office , she had heard the facts no words could modify or ease . Now she sat before Dr. Fried , angry and frightened and despairing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I tell him now so that we can keep her here where she gets sicker and more violent all the time ! "  |p199Through  her fear the doctor 's words sounded long and slow . " I think perhaps that we are all letting ourselves go overboard with this burning business . It is , after all , a symptom of the sickness which we all know is there , and which is still responding to treatment . " " But it 's so . . . so ugly ! " You mean the wounds ? " " I have n't seen the wounds  --  I mean the idea , the thought . How could anyone do that to themselves ! A person would be in " Esther gasped and put her hand before her mouth , and tears spilled over the rims of her eyes and rolled down her face . " No , no , " the doctor said , " it 's the word that is making you so frightened . It is the old evil word insane , ' which once meant hopeless and forever , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never let myself think that word for Debby ! " The facade is broken and what is behind the facade is not so bad , Dr. Fried thought . She wondered if she could let the mother know it in some way . It might be a small comfort . The telephone rang and Dr. Fried answered it in her affable voice , and when she turned again to face Esther , she found her cornposed . " You do think , then , that there is still a chance for her to be ... normal ? " " I think that there is certainly a chance for her to be mentallyhealthy and strong . I will say something to you now , Mrs. Blau , but it is not for your daughter and I will appreciate it if you never mention it to her . I am approached at least four times every week to do therapy with a patient . I have doctors ' analysesalso to supervise for the university School of Psychiatry , and at every session I must turn many away . I would be worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . I do not keep her one moment longer than I think I can help her . Tell them this at home . You need not keep telling lies  --  the truth is not unbearable at all . "  |p200The  doctor saw Deborah 's mother out of her office , hoping that she had helped . Easy comfort might do for some other branch of medicine ( placebo was a prescription more common than doctors themselves liked to admit ) , but the whole weight of her life and training was against it . And after her experiences , anything that sounded even faintly like placating would frighten Esther Blau ; if she had been strengthened by this talk , the whole family would be strengthened in turn . Dr. Fried understood that Esther had outgrown her subjectionto her father . She was now a strong , dominant , even dominating person . The same force in her that had tried to conquer all of Deborah 's enemies , to her detriment , might be the saving force as well . If she believed in this therapy for her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was carried out . Deborah 's illness had done more than shake the portraits in the family album . Some of the family had had to question why , and had grown a little themselves because of asking . If this were true , it was a source of hope seldom mentioned in the psychiatric journals , maybe because it was beyond " science " and beyond planning for . Outside the doors of study , Dr. Fried 's father had once told her , an angel waits . Coming out of the doctor 's house into the brisk autumn day , Esther looked toward the high , heavily screened porch behind which she knew was D ward . ' What was it like there ? What was it like inside the minds of people who had to stay there ? She looked away from it quickly , finding that it was blurred by a sudden overwhelming of tears . Deborah sat on the floor of the ward having her burns dressed . She had begun to be of medical interest ; the wounds refused to heal . The student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfully and busily with their unguents , potions , bandages , and tape . The smokers were still angry at Deborah , holding her responsible for the new rules , and even Lee , who needed to talk , was sending scornful looks at her.  |p201While  the nurses worked , Deborah watched what she had come to call the Breathing Frieze of other patients , sitting and standing , expressionless except for a look of great awe that their blood could move its ways so steadily , their hearts could beat beyond will or passion . When the nurses finished dressing the recalcitrant burns , they left the hall for a moment . Out of the corner of her eye , Deborah became aware that Helene was looking hard at Sylvia , who was standing next to her , immobile as ever . The next moment , Helene came close and struck Sylvia heavily once , and once again . Sylvia stood beneath the blows and gave no sign of being conscious of them . Challenged , Helene exploded into a whirlwind of rage . A wild creature seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched and flapped , spitting and redfaced , her hair flying . Sylvia reacted only by closing her eyes slowly . Her hands were still limp at her sides ; her body , it seemed , was totally commended to the forces of gravity and inertia ; she appeared to take no interest in the beating . The sudden , swift happening was interrupted by the standard six attendants required to get Helene away . Soon she was borne off drowning in a wave of khaki and white . Deborah remained standing ten feet from Sylvia . Both of them seemed alone on the planet . Deborah remembered the time two years earlier when Helene had rushed at her to destroy the face that had witnessed , and be safe from its knowledge . Everything had been Helene  --  doctors , nurses , attendants , the ward 's quickened rhythm , the wet sheets , and seclusion  --  all , all Helene , and Deborah had stood alone and shamed , because she had been too degraded to defend herself . She had stood as Sylvia was standing now , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out , almost as if she were snorting . Deborah was the only one who could know why Sylvia , who had failed to defend herself , needed as much attention as Helene was now getting . I should go to her and touch her on the shoulder and sayp202something , Deborah thought . But she stood still . I should go because it happened to me and no one knows as I do , how it is . . . . But her feet were in her shoes and her shoes were not moving toward Sylvia , and her hands stayed at her sides and were not moving . In the name of the dark night together when she broke her silence for me , I should go . . . . And she tried to wrench free of her granite garments and stone shoes . She looked at Sylvia , the ugliest of all of the patients , with her drooling and her pale , waxy face in its frozen grimace , and she knew that if she went to give what she of all people knew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fear came up to consume the wish to act . In another moment the subduers of Helene began to come back from the battle and the chance was lost . From the subsiding fear , shame rose . It grew up over her face so that she stood for a long time stone blind and wishing for death . Later , she stood before Furii in the office and told her what she had seen and had not done . " I never told you a lie ! " Deborah said . " I never told you that I was human . Now you can throw me out because I have a guilt with no apology . " " I am not here to excuse you , " Furii said , looking up at Deborahfrom the chair , and lighting a cigarette . " You will find no shortage of moral issues and hard decisions in the real world , and , as I have said before , it 's no rose garden . Let us bless the strength that let you see , and work toward the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . We have now to work hard on the roots of this burning which you do in your anger at me and at the hospital . " Almost at once Deborah knew that Furii was wrong about the reason for the burning and the need for it , and most wrong about its seriousness . While it had the semblance of terrible aberration , Deborah felt that this was as deceptive as the quiet slopes of her volcano . " Do you think the burning is very serious ? " she asked Furii.  | " Most serious , indeed , " Furii answered . " You are wrong , " Deborah said simply , hoping that the doctorreally believed what she had so often said about the patient trusting her own deep beliefs . There were over forty bums , inflicted over and over again on flesh scraped raw to receive them , and yet they did n't seem worth the fuss that was being made about them . " I do n't know why , but you are wrong . " Deborah looked around the cluttered office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows , but its goldenness and warmth were only there for her to perceive from a distance . The air around her was still cold and dark . It was this eternal estrangement , not fire against her flesh , that was the agony . " Restricted or not , " she murmured , " I will do penance . " " Louder , please , I can not hear you . " " Selective inattention , " Deborah said , laughing at the words of psychiatry , whose private language and secret jargon had not the beauty or poetry of Yri . Furii saw , too , and laughed . " Sometimes I think that our professional vocabulary goes too far , but we speak to one another after all , and not only to ourselves and the falling gods . Was it to them that you spoke just now ? " " No , " Deborah said , " to you . I have decided not to be immoral , because of what happened to Sylvia . If I could n't do what I should have done after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in my burnings , since you say that they are serious . " " How do you mean this ? " " She smokes sometimes , but she is forgetful . She has put cigarettes down when I was there to pick them up quickly and be gone . Both Marys smoke like wild women and all I have to do is make sure that no one spots me . They are contributingto my delinquency , are n't they ? "  | " I suppose , in a way they are . Actually you are taking advantage of their symptoms . " " That must not be allowed to happen , " Deborah said quietly . She wondered why Furii had left matches in her waiting room , and cigarettes , too . The nurse who had accompanied her was easily distracted ; Deborah wondered if Furii knew how trying those minutes of waiting had been . When the time was over , Deborah got up to leave , saying , " I am cutting my throat now myself . I wo n't steal burning butts from the patients unless they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't let you contribute either because you would n't want to . " Then she reached into her sleeve and drew out the two packs of matches she had taken from Furii 's table and threw them angrily on the paper-littered desk.  |p205When  the volcano erupted at last , there was no backfire in the matchbooks that was big enough to stave it off . Deborah had not anticipated anything more unusual than dark-mindednessand howling from the Collect when she began to feel the familiar whip of fear and hear the one-tone whine of accusation from the invisible hating ones . She had been in the tubroom behind the front bathroom by herself because all the seclusion rooms were full . ( Often the nurses would unlockthe door for her and let her be alone in there until someone needed the toilets up front ; for half an hour after the evening wash-up , solitude was almost a certainty . ) It had been evening and soon it would be bedtime . She had n't wanted to carry her hell to bed with her , kicking the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glasses and went down like burning celluloid.  |p206She  lay down on the cold floor and began beating her head slowly and methodically against the tiles . The black in her mind went red , swelling and growing out of her so far that before she knew it she was engulfed in the furious anger of eruption . When her vision cleared , it was only enough to see and hear as if through a keyhole . She was aware that she was shouting and that attendants were in the room and that the walls of the room were covered with Yri words and sentences . Ranged around her were all the outpourings of hatred and anger and bitterness in a language whose metaphors used " broken " to mean " consenting " and " third rail " to mean " complying . " All the words were extreme . U guru , which was " dog-howling " and meant loneliness , was written in its superlativeform in letters a foot high the length of one wall : U G U R U S U. The words were written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a broken button . There was a look of horror and surprise even on the faces of a hardened D-ward staff , and it was that look which brought the full fire from her . The world 's fear and hatred were like the sun , common and pervading , daily and accepted  --  a law of nature . Now its rays were focused in their look , waking fire . The words Deborah spoke were not loud , but they were full of hatred and they were Yri . " Where is what you used to scratch this , Miss Blau ? " " Recreat , " Deborah said . " Recreat xangoran , temr e xangoranan . Naza e f ango xangoranan . Inai dum . Ageai dum . " ( " Remember me . Remember me in anger , fear me in bitter anger . Heat-craze my teeth in bitterest anger . The signal glance drops . The Game "  --  Ageai meant the tearing of flesh with teeth as torture  --  " is over . " ) Mrs. Forbes came then . Deborah had liked Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rising steadily and too much of what Deborah said could not wait even for the Yri logic and frame of words , and went sailingp207off into gibberish with only an Yri word here and there to let Deborah know what she was saying . Mrs. Forbes asked Deborah if she could send the others away , and Deborah , grateful for her courage in offering this , showed the two open hands and tried for form in her speech that was only going further and further into meaningless sounds . " This word here  --  the biggest one  --  I think I heard you say it . Has it a meaning ? " Deborah groped wildly for gestures , words , or sounds to convey the impact of the volcano 's eruption ; the word she had written in the blood from a cut finger was the third form of anger , which she had never spoken or written before and which was more extreme than black anger or red-white anger . After moving about restlessly for a while , she threw back her head in a soundless scream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word fear ? " she asked . " No  --  not fear  --  anger . " And then looking at Deborah again : " An anger you can not control . " After a pause she said , " Come on , we 'll try seclusion until you can take care of yourself . " The seclusion room was small , but the force of the volcano would not let her rest . It kept hurling her from one side of the room to the other ; walls and floors pounded her head and hands and body . Now her lack of inner control matched the anarchic world with an Yr gone newly mad itself . After a while they caught her up and put her in a pack . She fought with them , terrified of what she might do to them now that she had no law . English , Yri , and gibberish all flowed together . Gradually , the anger was overtaken by the fear , but the words to warn them that she was wild could not be framed , and she fought them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied , trying , doglike , to bite , herself , her wrappings , the bed , the beings . She fought until she was exhausted and then she lay still . After a while Deborah could feel the constriction of bloodp208in her legs and feet that usually brought a familiar pain , but there was no pain . The burns , she knew , had had their raw surfaces ripped open under the bandages , but there was no pain from them either . How cold the wind was blowing above the law ! . . . She lay shivering , although the sheets had been close for many hours and she should have been warm . Beyond even the laws and logic of Yr she breathed out in wonder : My enemy , my virulent , plague-pouring self  --  and now not even control of it ... . " There was a gear . . . " she cried aloud , and it came in Yri loud and mingled with strange words which were not hers . " There was a gear all teeth , two at least world-caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " You are not of them , the Censor said . It was an old phrase , perhaps the oldest one in Yr , but its context changed from comfort and pity , to anger and terror , and now to the last deceit , the final move of the game which was part of the world 's secret purposes and her damnation . She now knew that the death she feared might not be a physical one , that it could be a death of the will , the soul , the mind , the laws , and thus not death , but a perpetual dying . The tumor began to ache . Furii looked at her and said , " Are you ill ? " and Deborah laughed with the same ugliness that her cry had been . " I mean , is something physically the matter ? " " No . " She tried to tell Furii , but the walls began bleeding and sweating , and the ceiling developed a large tumor which began to separate itself from its surface . " Can you hear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt , but she could only gesture the Yri gesture for insanity : flattened hands thrust toward one another but unable to meet . " Listen to me . Try to hear me , " Furii said seriously . " You are afraid of your power and that you can not control it . "  |p209When  Deborah could speak at last , she could only say , " Yri . . . in the world . . . collision . . . " " Try again . Just let it come . " " Gears uncaught . . . n'ai naruai . . . uncaught ! " " It is why you need a hospital . You are in a hospital and you do not need to fear the terrible forces that seem to have been opened in you . Listen hard now , and try to stay in contact with me . You must try to talk to me and tell me what is happening in your collided worlds . We will work with all our strength to keep you from the excesses of your sickness . " Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came Yri , English , nonsense . Wild . . . hitting . Anger . " " Were you angry for all the years , in the way that anger gets when it grows old and is rotted with guilt and fear  --  like bad-smelling pebbles inside ? " " Much . . . " " The suffering was not because of your anger then , was it ? " " No . . . Yri . . . on earth . . . collision . Censor . . . death penalty . . . the last . . . " She began to tremble in a cutting cold . " Use the blanket , " Furii said . " Yri cold . . . nacoi . . . earth blankets . . . " " We will see if Earth warmth helps , " Furii said . She picked up the blanket and covered Deborah with it . Deborah remembered that there was no Yri word for " thank you . " She had no word to give Furii her gratitude . It remained a mute weight inside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see it and be glad . " Tell me this , " Furii was saying , " of the emotion you felt as you heard yourself cry out in these languages , how much was anger and how much was fear ? " " Ten , " Deborah said , thinking of the emotion by letting a stroke of it come up and engulf her once again , " three anger , five fear . " " That is only eight . "  | " I suffer , " Deborah said , helping herself with Yri handmotions . " After you I suffer smarter . Now I never fill them . Two is for miscellaneous . " Furii laughed . " Anger some , fear quite a bit , and what are those little two miscellaneous ? Relief , maybe , not to have to give everything to that wall between Yr and the world ? Also , was there not something overt to remind me that I went away and left you with it all ? " Deborah felt that the last idea was only half true , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she said , " Fear ... Censor  --  doing the forbidden . . . destroy me .. . and ... " " And what is it ? " " Then . . . no . No-ness ; not Yr even . Loud gibberish and just No . Noll " " Not even the gods for friends , " the doctor mused . She drew her chair up closer to where Deborah was huddled shivering under the blanket whose warmth stopped short of her interior climate . " You know , Deborah , you have a gift for health and strength . Before you let go for this breaking of walls , you trusted our work together and you trusted me . Beforeyou let the anger come , you got yourself on D ward and in the sort of seclusion that was at hand , and when a nurse was on duty , mind you , whom you liked and trusted . Not so dumb for someone who is supposed to have lost her marbles . Not so bad at all , that talent for life . " Deborah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are worn out , " Furii said , " but no longer so very frightened , are you ? " " No . " " The anger may come again . The sickness you have built may also come and fight you perhaps , but I have faith that you will conquer it enough to get the help and control that you need . Half of your fear is that you will not be able to be stopped , and it is this fear which makes it impossible to speak so that others can understand . "  |p211When  Deborah got back to the ward after her session with Dr. Fried , she found that another holocaust had visited it . " Your good friend . . . " Lee Miller said under her breath , " ... sweet , genteel Miss Coral . " " What ? " " She took that bed there , and threw it ! She picked it up and threw it at Mrs. Forbes ! " " And it hit ? " " Sure it hit . Mrs. Forbes is now in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cuts and bruises , and who the hell knows what else . " Lee Miller was angry because Mrs. Forbes was one of those rare elect whom the patients themselves , consciously or not , tried to save from harm . She took time , she was intelligent and unselfish , and  --  most rare  --  she was happy in her work and the patients knew it . " Mistake , " Deborah said , like talking wood . " By mistake . " She remembered others : a patient who had aimed at one personand hit another , the student nurse who always seemed to be walking where fists and chairs were landing . If this one could somehow be made to fit in with the others .. . " Maybe the dear patient was temporarily insane ! " Fiorentini'sMary chimed in gaily . " Temporary Insanity  --  that 's a legal term . It means before and during and a while after , but they never say how long which way . Very exact , the law . . . a science , you know . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a new giggle and leaving the old one to grate against their senses . " Is Mrs. Forbes coming back ? " Deborah asked , feeling sick to her stomach . She understood that Lee was taking out her anger at her because Miss Coral was in seclusion and not to be approached , while Deborah was standing before her , available . Deborah had not thought of herself as being anyone 's friend , but it occurred to her that Lee thought otherwise . She turned very slowly to Lee , and with overdrawn dignity , because dignity was new to her and strange and worn un/comfortably , she said , " Okay , Lee , Carla , too . " ( She was still afraid to say the word " friend , " because of its transcendent danger . ) Lee walked to the door of the nursing station and beat on it . When it opened , she asked for a cigarette , and when it was lit for her , she growled , " What am I doing here with all these crazy people ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . The more she thought about it , the more she wanted to know why Miss Coral had hit Mrs. Forbes ; why one of the Good Ones ? After the line-up for sedation that evening , she moved unobtrusively to the corner beyond the nursing-station door , and stood completely still with her head against the water pipes that were placed there . The hot pipe was jacketed with insulation , but the cold , though uncomfortable , was sometimes used by the patients as a listening device . If a personput the whole side of her head against this pipe and held her breath , she could hear the conversations going on inside the nursing station , even with the door closed . Deborah had assumed that the sounds were transmitted by the faucets , because the reception was better when the speakers were near the steel sink . She was not noticed where she stood ; the whole ward had been darkened for the evening , and the attendants who were out on the halls were busy getting the reluctant patients to bed . Inside the nursing station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a voice was saying . It sounded like Miss Cleary . " No , there  --  by the coffeepot . " The idea of having coffee anytime , now or whenever , set off a water of desire in Deborah 's mouth , and she pushed her head harder against the pipe to get her mind off it . They began to talk about allotment of days off . The hall was clearing fast . If they did n't get down to it soon , she would have to move . " Jesus , I 'm tired . " ( That would be Hanson. )  | " You ai n't the only one . " ( Bernardi . ) " I do n't know , but seems to me they 're all getting sicker . " " You mean crazier . " " Tch , tch , tch . Watch your language ! " They laughed . " No , honest  --  the damn ward is never a day without fights , a couple more in seclusion , half of ' em in packs . Now that old Coral Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern belle  --  I 've heard people talk about her , but I never seen it myself ' til this afternoon . " " God ! You ever think an old lady like that could lift a bed , no less chuck it ? " Deborah wanted them to talk about Mrs. Forbes , and when they started to , she smiled against the cold pipe . " You seen Lou Ann ? " ( Mrs. Forbes ' first name was Lou Ann . ) " Hudson and Carelle went down with her . Sophie 's going down to see her tomorrow , and I will too , if I get off . " Deborah ground her teeth with impatience . They were beginning to get ready to close the night on their charges . If the evidence was not given now .. . " Hey , you seen Blau last night ? " " No  --  I missed that one ; I was back with Whitman . " " Oh  --  ( laugh ) brother . " Deborah did n't want to hear about Blau . She had come to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was feeling about Coral vs . Forbes ; some reason to hold against all of her knowledge that always deceived her and ended blind and mad . " Lord ! In the bathroom and yelling all kinds of nonsense . Filled the wall with some kind of crazy writing and come out fighting like a tiger . All the time we was packing her she was swearing in that kind of babble-talk  --  not anything you could understand , but you looked at her face and there was that hate . Brrrr . " " She did n't talk at all today . "  | " Well , put it in the records . " Deborah sank down along the cold track of the pipe to the floor . She covered her face with her hands . It was hot with shame . She crawled a little away from the pipe so that she would be on neutral ground , and disassociated from the source of her knowledge . She began to cry with the incredible sounds she had made before , murmuring to all the worlds and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of them . " She was still heaving and holding her face when Martonson , the student nurse , came and stood over her . " Come on now , Miss Blau , " she said , " let 's get to bed . " " Okay , " and she stood up , still hiding in the dark behind her hands , and stumbled into the dorm and to bed . She continued to sob . " What are those obscene noises ? " Fiorentini 's Mary chirped . " Some new sort of homosexual perversion , I am sure ... . Oh , you insane are all so inventive  --  it 's because you have time to think things through . " She began to murmur and laugh . The Wife of the Abdicated became disturbed by Mary 's laughter and the choked-out noises of Deborah 's crying and began to protest . " Have you no respect , you filthy whores ! I am the secret first Wife of Edward , the Abdicated King of England ! " " Well , Hail Columbia ! " said Jenny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hail Mary , Full of Grace . . . , " called Dowben 's Mary , who always brought out the atheist in everyone with her endlessprayers . " Oh , Christ ! Now you 've started that bitch up again ! " The tumult mounted and Deborah heard it as a counterpointto the ugly sounds that were still working inside her . The attendant came and shut them all up , and there was silence , with each soul sealed away in a seclusion to the limits of which no eye could seem to reach . Deborah lay in bed , and her thoughts returned to thep215puzzle . Dust motes blown and floating all the patients were , but even so there were some things that were not done . Deborahknew very well that she could never ask Miss Coral why she had thrown the bed or how it was that Mrs. Forbes 's arm had been intruded upon by that bed . Beating , stealing , swearing , blaspheming , and sexual eccentricity were not sins on D ward . Spitting on the floor , urinating , defecating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than horror , but to ask how or why was not forgivable and to oppose another patient 's act was a sign of crudity at best and at worst a kind of assault  --  an attempted mayhem at the barriers which were the all-costly protectors of life . Lee Miller had cursed Deborah for the burnings which had resulted in the whole ward 's restriction , but she had never asked why they had been done or expressed a wish that they be stopped . There was ridicule and anger , but never intrusion . Miss Coral could never be confronted with throwing the bed , and her friends , such as they could be , would henceforth delicately expunge the name of Mrs. Forbes from their conversation in the presence of the one who had caused her to be hurt . Where then could Deborah get the answer to her question ? Through the days of wondering , Deborah 's surface registerednothing , and when she spoke her words were the mangled Anglo-Yri-gibberish and there were only enough to try to answer a question or to hint at a need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anyone . When an attendantasked her if it was her day for a bath , she tried for a purely English answer , but it emerged as , " It never goes deep enough . " In the bathroom : " Blau  --  are you in there ? " " Here is cutucu . " ( The second degree of being hidden . ) As she struggled to translate , finding it almost impossible to span the light years of distance between herself and them , the confusion of tongues only alienated her further . She would become frightened , whatever she said next could not be trans/lated at all , and the formless sounds would make her even more frightened . Only with Furii was there any clarity . " They said we were getting sicker ; all of us . They said I was getting sicker . " " Well , do you think you are ? " Furii said , lighting another cigarette . " No games . " " I do not play games . I want you to think deeply and answer honestly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deborah said , with her voice rising in the wind of her sudden anger . " I 'm tired and scared and I just do n't care any more what happens . Work in the dark and work in the cold and what for ! " " To get you out of this damn place , that 's what for . " Furii 's voice was as loud as Deborah 's . " I wo n't tell you anything more . The more garbage I give away the more I have left . You can turn me off and go out with your friends or write another paper and get another honor for it . I ca n't turn me off , so I 'm turning the fight off , and do n't you worry  --  I will be nice and docile and nothing more will go on the walls . " The cigarette gave a long puff before the doctor 's face . " Okay , " she said , almost amiably . " You quit , poor little girl , and you stay in a crazy house the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed ward all your days . . . . Poor darling , ' the world will say , she could have been such a nice person ... so talented . . . what a loss . ' " The mobile features made a " tch-tch " purse of the mouth . " And more talented than I really am because I 'm here and will never test it ! " Deborah shouted because the bone-truth gave such a fine sound , even from Hell . " Yes , damn it , yes ! " Furii said . " Well , what ! " Deborah said , good and loud . " Well , did I ever say it would be easy ? I can not make youp217well and I do not want to make you well against your own wishes . If you fight with all the strength and patience you have , we will make it together . " " And what if I do n't ? " ' Well , there are lots of mental hospitals , and they build more every day . " " And if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy or sweet , and I told you that last year and the year before that . For your own challenge , for your own mistakes and the punishment for them , for your own definition of love and of sanity  --  a good strong self with which to begin to live . " " You certainly do n't go in for hyperbole . " " Look here , my dear girl , " Furii said , and thumped the ash of her cigarette on the tray , " I am your doctor and I see these years how allergic you are to lying , so I try not to tell lies . " She looked at Deborah with the familiar half-smile . " Besides , I like an anger that is not fearful and guilty and can come out in good and vigorous English . " They were quiet for a while and then Furii said , " I think it is time , and that you are ready , to answer for yourself the question that you raised before . Are you getting sicker ? Do n't be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever it is . " Deborah saw herself as Noah , sending out a dove to scout the fearful country . After a time the dove came back , quaking with exhaustion . No green branch , but at least it was a return . " Not sicker , " she said . " Not sicker at all . " " Not sicker ... " Doctor Fried said at the meeting of the D-ward staff . " . . . Not sicker at all . " The ward personnel listened politely and attentively , but it seemed unbelievable to them that the bursting stream of gibberishand the uncontrolled and useless violence was not ap218great change for the worse . Before , Deborah Blau had been morbid and silent or morbid and witty ; she had had an immobileface and a sarcastic and superior manner . These were real signs of serious mental illness , but now she fit the familiar form of D ward 's patients . She was " crazy , " a word felt and used by most of them except in the presence of the doctors or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrating but unspoken word in the air now . " Well . . . the burning business is slowing up a little ... " one of the attendants said , without much conviction . " That would be her new morality , ' " Doctor Fried answeredwith her little smile . " She said that she does not wish to involve other patients in her sickness , so she must get her fires elsewhere . She has made some restrictions on the stealing . " Do they . . . do they have considerations like that ? I mean . . , morals ? " It was a new man asking . They all knew what the answer was supposed to be , but few of them really believed it . Only a few of the doctors really believed it and only some of the time . " Of course , " Doctor Fried said . " As you work here , you will often see evidences of it . There are many examples of such ethics or morals , which have moved ' healthy ' ones to awe over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generosityof great cost to the patient , but present nevertheless to remind us and to kick the crutch from our complacency . I remember when I left my hospital in Germany , a patient gave me a knife to protect myself . This knife he had made in secret by grinding down a piece of metal for months and months . He had made it to save against the day that his illness would become too painful for him to bear . " " And did you accept it ? " someone asked . " Of course , since his ability to give was an indication of health and strength . But because I was coming to this coun/try , " she said with a gentle little smile , " I gave the knife to one who had to stay behind . " " She 's a good speaker , do n't you think ? " Doctor Royson said as they left . He had come to the conference as Doctor Halle 's guest and because he had worked for a while with some of the patients . " Blau is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , I forgot . Of course , you knew that . " " Yes , I took over while she was away , " Doctor Royson said . " How was it ? " " At first I thought it was her resentment that made the working so difficult  --  you know , having the regular therapist leave her  --  a rejection , you might say . But you know , that was n't the case . It was something we do n't like to face because we are doing medicine , and that 's a science which does n't admit of likes or dislikes . We just did n't get on . We did n't like each other . I think perhaps we were too much alike . . . . " " Then it 's no wonder you struck sparks . " " Do you think there 's any real progress in that Blau case . She seems to think so . " He turned a little and made a gesture toward Dr. Fried . " But . . . " " I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fine doctor  --  I wish I had her brains , " Royson said . " She is brainy , " and Halle looked back at the chubby little woman who was still answering questions in the conference room , " but after you know her a while , you 'll find out that with little Clara Fried , brains are only the beginning . "  |p220Through  the distortion of heat-watering air over the volcano , through the gray lava-flow desolation between eruptions , Deborahnoticed the onset of a certain kindness toward her from the ward staff  --  a kindness that seemed to be more than form . A new attendant by the name of Quentin Dobshansky , one of the Good Ones , like McPherson came to replace tired old Tichert ; Mrs. Forbes came back to work on Male Disturbed , in the other building , and another autumn yielded to another winter . Winter was a hard season . The ancient and erratic heating system wheezed and clanged , overheating everyone to dullness when it was on and letting them all freeze when it was n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lee asked , echoing eternal questions about eternal subjects . She was huddled with her coffee cup , trying to warm her hands.  | " It 's a system that Lucy 's Abdicated First Husband the VIIIth thought up , " Helene said . " The heating is taken care of by all the characters in the dreams we tell our doctors . " " They do n't hate us , though , " Mary chirped gaily , " at least not me . They despise me intensely , but they do n't hate me  --  because the Bible says not to ! " Deborah got up and went in search of warmth . Since the eruption of the volcano , the need to keep alert for backfire material had lessened , though the anguish had not . The volcano'sfear-rage would still come and throw her against a wall with the force of its eruption , or send her running down the hall until she was stopped by a closed door or a wall . She was in pack every day , sometimes twice , and once tightened in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently as it would . Yet . . . yet they were all kinder , all the nurses and attendants , joking even , and giving little gifts of themselves . " Do n't you know why ? " Furii said . " No . I am exploding and they take time with me . Lots of times I feel the thing coming and I ask to get packed and they do it , although it takes time and energy , and afterward , we sometimes even talk . " " You see , " Furii said gently , " when this volcano of yours broke , something else broke , too : your stoniness of expression . One sees you now reacting and living by looking at your face . " Deborah went ice cold with the special fear that was many years old and from which she had protected herself at such great cost . " Nacoi . . . nacoi . . . " " What is it ? " Furii asked . " It was always . . . unmatching . . . what the face showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , and Why are you scornful ? ' when I was not . It was part of the reason for a Censor and the set rules and Yri laws . " " You are free of them now , " Furii said . " Your face doesp222not make enemies for you ; it only shows a person reacting to what she feels . Anger and fear show also because you suffer them . But do not be frightened ; no need any more to lie about anger and fear , and , best of all , enjoyment shows too , and fun , and hope also , and these expressions are not unmatching , as you call it , but are appropriate and will become more and more subject to your own conscious wish and choice . " But Deborah was still frightened . Her facial expressions were a mystery to her , one that had never been solved . In memories whose meaning was still dark to her , she counted years and years of enemies made in ways which she could never explain . Part of it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some expression not hers which she had been wearing , a voice and a doer not herself and capable of turning allies into persecutors . Now that the volcano had melted her stone face it might all start over again : the nacoi-life of laws to which she had no key and realities to which she could lay no claim . The afternoon was cold and lowering , and coming back from the doctor 's office she laughed at herself and at the attendantwith her , shivering in the cold ( real cold ) , while she alone , although close to the attendant 's side , was also in cold ( intraregional fear ) and cold ( Yr-cold ) . " Like to freeze you to death ! " the attendant said . It was nice being spoken to in that way , so Deborah repaid the sense of equality with truth . " You 've only got one kind of cold ; the kind coats can fix . " The attendant sniffed . " Do n't you believe it , " she said , and Deborah remembered back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What makes you think you have a corner on suffering ? " " I 'm sorry , " Deborah said , " I did n't mean it as an insult . " But the attendant was bitter and angry , and began to tell Deborah about how hard it was to raise children and work for long hours and low pay . Deborah seemed to hear into thep223attendant 's mind , where the woman was saying also that the work was ugly : cleaning up messes from adult bodies and sitting in the midst of childish noises made by adult lungs and ingenuity . The woman was angry at Deborah , who was at that moment a symbol of " the job , " but Deborah felt that she was giving a confidence also . The dislike was impersonal and honest and therefore not hard to bear . At the door , whose lock and key were also symbols , the whole relationship ended ; the attendant erased it as if it had never been , and her face was impassive as she walked away from her charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the change of shift came on , she asked to be let into the bathtubroom to be by herself for a little while . Inside , the heat was turned off , but by force of habit she went to the old radiator and sat down on its covered top . A window above it looked out over the lawn part of the hospital grounds , where there were trees and a thick hedge that concealed the wall  --  Deborah had named it the Preserve . The sun , ready to set , glittered beyond the hedge like a cold star , and the trees seemed bare and gray in the diffusing light . It was quiet . Yr was quiet and the Collect , for once , was silent also . All the voices in all the worlds seemed stilled . Slowly and steadily , Deborah began to see the colors in the world . She saw the form and the colors of the trees and the walkway and the hedge and over the hedge to the winter sky . The sun went down and the tones began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Preserve . And in a slow , oncoming way , widening from a beginning , it appeared to Deborah that she would not die . It came upon her with a steady , mounting clarity that she was going to be more than undead , that she was going to be alive . It had a sense of wonder and awe , great joy and trepidation . " When will it begin ? " she said to the gradual night . It came to her that it was already beginning.  |p224The  night had fully arrived when she opened the door of the bathtub room and went out on the ward again . The third dimension , the meaning , persevered in the bare lines of walls and doors and the planes of people 's faces and bodies . There was a great temptation to watch  --  to keep seeing and hearing , sensing and reveling in the meaning and the light  --  the senses and planes of reality , but Deborah was the veteran of many deceits and she was cautious . She would subject this new thing to Furii 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper and found herself capable of suffering that she had to do it messily , with fingers and a wooden spoon . The food tasted . It was substantial under her teeth and afterward she remembered having eaten it . " Whatever this thing is . . . " she muttered , " . . . I wonderwhen they will pull it out from under . " She spent the evening listening to the attendants talking to one another like lonely outpost sentinels in a strange and barren land . They would n't know what this thing was , but it was beginning to frighten Deborah because she did n't know what it was going to turn into . Maybe it was another part of the Game , that always recurring last laugh of the world . When she gulped down her sedative and walked to bed she said to Yr , Suffer , gods . Suffer , Bird-one , we are waiting . . . I have a question : Two natives are in a comic strip , but they do n't know it , and think themselves alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really the back of a hippo who is standing in a river . They begin to cook their dinner . When the heat reaches through the hippo 's hide , he gets up and walks away , carrying the natives with astonished faces . Then the reader of this comic strip laughs and turns the page on which are natives , astonishment , jungle , river , hippo , and fire . The question is : What can their faces show now ? What can they do now ? One would have to wait in order to find out , Anterrabaep225said . Who knows , this happening may be gone by tomorrow . You may not even have to do anything about it , Lactamaeon said . You may not even have to think about it . Maybe it was just a symptom , Deborah said . In the morning she lay in bed awake , but wondering if it would be wise for her to open her eyes . Someone was screaming in the hall , and she could hear a student close by  --  rustling apron and apprehension  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes the light from the morning sun was red . The lucky ones by the windows got all the benefit of the sun , but every morning the day reached out for all of them for a little while at least , and this morning it made Deborah search in her mind for something that had changed in her . " Something happened to me . . . " she whispered to herself , " . . . something yesterday . What was it ? What was it ? " " Come on , Miss Blau , rise and shine , " the student said . " What 's for breakfast ? " Deborah asked , not wishing to give any of her questions away . " Typical regional cooking . " Fiorentini 's Mary chirped . " They never say what region , but I have some ideas ! " " What kind of regional cooking do they have for people who are out of this world ? " someone asked . Then it came to Deborah what had happened last night , with the color and the form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it still there , waiting beyond the eyelid ? She opened her eyes wide and at once . The world was still there . She got up , wrapped herself in her blanket , and went out on the hall and to the nursing station . " Excuse me , do I see my doctor today ? " She had been a thousand times a mendicant before that door , but this time it seemed to be different , although no one acted as if it were . " Just a minute . Yes , you 're down for off the ward today . Two o'clock . " " Can I go by myself ? "  |p226The  suspicion came up like a surgical mask over the nurse 's face . " I 'll have to get a written order from the ward administrator . You know that by now . " " Can I see him when he comes ? " " He 's not going to be on the ward today . " " Will you write my name down , please ? " " All right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maybe , but Deborah knew by now that it was not good form to seem too insistent , even though the world might be gone by the time the permission came through . At her hour she was shy and frightened that speaking of it might end it , but after a time of groping she told Furii about the seeing and , more importantly , about the meaning and the thing that had come attached to the meaning : the slow , openinghope . " It was not like what usually happens in Yr , " she said . " It reminded me of you because it was just a simple statement in my mind that I was going to live , to come up alive . " Furii gave her the familiar testing look . " Do you believe that this is a true prognosis ? " " I do n't want to say because I may have to hang by my thumbs from it . " " No , you wo n't . Nothing will change for us . " ' Well . . . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We prove it then , " Furii said . " We get to work . " They spent the time cutting ways to the old secrets and seeing facets of them that needed the new hunger for life to come real . Deborah saw that she had taken the part of the enemy Japanese as an answer to the hate of the ones at the summer camp , his foreignness and violence being an embodiment of anger . A part of the same insight opened on to the subject of martyrdom  --  that being martyred had something to do with Christ , the pride and terror of every Jew . " Anger and martyrdom , " she said , " that 's what being ap227Japanese soldier was , and I gave the doctors the good soldier ' that they wanted . Anger and martyrdom . . . It sounds like something more . . . like the description of something I know . . . " " What more ? " Furii asked . " It must have had many walls to have supported itself for all these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . why . . . why , it 's grandfather ! " Deborah cried , having unearthed the familiar tyrannical Latvianto whom she had given such an unrecognizable mask . It was a description of him and it fitted him better than height or weight or number of teeth . " The secret soldier that I was is a mutu  --  what Yr calls a kind of hiding image of my kinship with him . " " Coming to see this . . . does it hurt so much ? " " A good hurt , " Deborah said . " The symptoms and the sickness and the secrets have many reasons for being . The parts and facets sustain one another , locking in and strengthening one another . If it were not so , we could give you a nice shot of this or that drug or a quick hypnosis and say Craziness , begone ! ' and it would be an easy job . But these symptoms are built of many needs and serve many purposes , and that is why getting them away makes so much suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . will I have to give up Yr . . . all of it . . . right away ? " " Never pretend to give it up . I think you will want to give it up when you have the real world to replace it , but there is no pact with me . I do not ask you to give up your gods for mine . When you are ready , you will choose . " Then she said gravely , " Do n't let them torture you every time you let some of the world 's good light in your windows . " The " burn-squad " was waiting for her when she got back on the ward . It was Doctor Venner this time . She had nicknamedhim " Lost Horizons " because he never seemed to see anyone , but kept looking out as if to sea , past the people hep228was supposed to be treating . The name had stuck . Now he was impatient because she had not been ready and waiting for his ministrations in a properly chastened frame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because cleaning them should have given her the pain she deserved and yet she seemed always above it . Deborah did not like Doctor Venner and she expressed this by joking to Quentin Dobshansky , who held the bandages and winced whenever the doctor 's rough swabbing pulled the raw flesh away . " Hold that arm still , " Venner growled at the limb held motionless before him . In his anger he jerked the swab hard and blood from the healthy tissue underneath welled up and covered the wound . " Damn it ! " he breathed . " Heck , Doctor Venner , " she said softly , " you do n't have to get angry . I 've got a fake tumor that more than makes up for what I 'm missing here . " Dobshansky bit his lip to keep from laughing , but the instrumentdug sharply again and he drew in his breath . " Uhh ! Easy , Deb ! " " The hurting is only theoretical , Quentin , " she said . " What hurts is being kicked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts and not being able to tell anyone and have them believe you . Every time you double up with a theoretical tumor pain , some professor is there to tell you why it ca n't be hurting . As a courtesy , they give you a shot or two of the experience the other way . " " Keep quiet ! " Doctor Venner said . " I 'm concentrating on this . " Dobshanksy winked at the nurse who had come in and Deborah was grateful to them that they had permitted her to be a witness . The New Doctor came up a few days later to do his stint as call-doctor for the day . " It 's time for another look at those bums , " he said.  | " Venner was the last one and if he did n't hit bone , no one else will . " The comment was disturbing and took New Doctor by surprise . " I 've been worrying about those burns , " he said quickly to cover his unprofessional reaction , and she caught him in another professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that preached , " Never Tell a Patient You Are Worried . " His surprise at what he had said was plain on his face , and he began the wiping away of the look , hastily and piecemeal , so that a part of it was left . " Well , let 's say concerned , and I thought of something that might just work . " He took a little tube of medicine out of his pocket . Then he dismissed the massing burn-squad and the two of them smiled a little at each other like conspirators . They both breathed easier . He looked at her arms . The bandages were rank and the flesh around the bums was beginning to take on the mushiness of the burnt area . " Well , we 'll give it a try . " She saw in his face that the burns were worse than he had remembered . When he was through , he said , " I tried to go easy . I hope it did n't hurt too much . " " Do n't worry , " Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be capable of a smile . " Someday , maybe it will . " When the nurses cut the bandages two days later , the putrefactionwas gone . " What was that stuff he used ! " The head nurse shook her head in wonder . " He left it for her in number six cabinet , " said little Cleary . Deborah turned to the nurse . " I 'll have my contribution ready . " " And what is that ? " she said with the impatience of the expert . " Why , the smile . "  |p230Because  she was going to live , because she had begun to live already , the new colors , dimensions , and knowledges became suffused with a kind of passionate urgency . As form and light and law became more constant , Deborah began to look into the faces of people , to talk with them and hear them . Although she was shy and stunted in the subjects on which people spoke to one another , she began to find the D ward with its lost patients and harried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital 's ponderous wheel , she began her slow ascent ; she could almost hear a creak as the wheel groaned under her weight . Bit by bit she regained the distance by which the doctors measured responsibility : Alone to Her Doctor'sOffice ( i oo ft. x i hr. sane ) ; Alone on Front Grounds ( 2oo ft. x 3 hrs. sane ) ; Alone on Front and Back Grounds ( 1 mi . X 5 hrs. sane ) ; and at last she applied to go to B ward , where the foot-hour rule would be given the whole inward sweep of books and pencils and sketch pads . Now that she held this tremulous but growing conviction that she was alive , she began to be in love with the , new world . " If I 'm alive , then I must be of their substance  --  the same substance , do n't you see ! " she told Furii in her excitement , gesturing outward to the world . The last time she had been on B ward there had been only darkness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building up of the volcano . She had seen no one and nothing , but the way to the bathroomand the way to the food and sedative line . This time she took her bedding eagerly , looking into the faces of the nurses , and asked their names and hoped for a room up front where it was noisy and alive . The head nurse cocked her head . " You know Carla Stoneham , do n't you ? " " Is she back ? I . . . I thought she was gone . " " Well , she was an outpatient for a while , " the nurse said , trying to keep anything but the dead level from her voice . " She 's back now . " Carla was sitting on her bed . Looking at her , Deborah felt a special warmth in the eye . " Well , you girls know each other . " The nurse put the extra blanket on the other bed and left . " Hi , Deb . . . " Carla seemed glad to see her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Deborah'smind , warm as her eyes toward Carla , began to plead : I am your friend  --  do n't be ashamed because of this . She closed her eyes and pushed the English words of commitment across her Yri tongue . " I do n't care if it is selfish . I 'm glad you 're here because it 's where I am . " Then she began to make her bed and put her clothes away while they gossiped about this and that : Miss Coral , Helene , Mary 's latest crack , and the nurses on B ( whichp232one would come if there was trouble and which would not ) . Then Deborah said , " Grapevine never told me you were back . " She looked straight at Carla while she said it , and with that look she meant everything that would have been an intrusion had it come in words . " It gets awfully lonely out there , that 's all , " Carla answered . She had given Deborah the privilege of a question ; Deborah tried to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? " " Well . . . it 's being defeated , " Carla said , and she nodded the question away with her head and went off , gently , on a tangent . " I was all alone in my job . . . the long ride in the morning to work gets you kind of hypnotized and there was no one except the technicians and good morning ' and good night . ' In the evenings I went to the movie show or stayed in my room and read technical books to catch up . Soon the streets began to remind me of the other streets back in St. Louis and the way the days were back there  --  the feeling of it all seemed the same  --  " The look of the familiar pain was stamped on Carla 's face as she talked , but suddenly she pulled herself away from her thought . " I 'm not saying that no one succeeds , " she said hurriedly , " or even that I wo n't make it again  --  it 's just that I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " The ringing of a bell interrupted her . " The O.T . shop is open , " she said . " Come on  --  I 'll show you around . " Outside , the winter air was sharp with cold . Deborah found the world incomparably beautiful . Somewhere beyond the hedge of the Preserve there was smoke rising and she caught the smell of it occasionally . Next to her was a friend and in the craft shop a drawing pad waiting to be filled . She tried to stop the gratitude and hunger that were overflowing inside her , but her eyes filled with the colors and dimensions of the world and the laws of the consubstantial human race  --  motion and gravity , cause and effect , friendship and a sense of a hu/man self . She heard a sound high up and behind her , and turning , saw Miss Coral waving from a window on D ward . " She must be in seclusion again , " Carla said , counting the windows . They waved back and for a few moments drew signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in a fight ) Miss Coral said , spreading her gestures in the space of the fenced window . ( I am free ! ) Deborah answered , breaking chains and doing a caper . ( How far ? ) Miss Coral asked , making the sign of looking out to sea . Deborah made a wall with her arm and stopped before it with her hand . ( Nurse is coming ! ) Miss Coral shouted , hands to head for the two wings of the white cap and then the flip of a key . ( Good-by ! ) A quick wave and gone . An attendant had come out the back door and seen them gesticulating in the walkway . " What are you girls doing ? " she asked . " Just practicing , " Carla said , " just practicing . " They walked on to the craft shop that was in one of the outbuildings . The shop had a warm , normal look of work being done until one looked close and saw that it was only imitation . Patients were sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paste and bits of fabric . Most of their activity was make-work of the most obvious kind , and Deborah felt quietly embarrassed . Outcasts from the laws of the world seemed to be warming their hands before the illusion of satisfying labor . They were vainly seeking its textures , papers , and materials , and raveling out old woolen scarves to extract reality from them . In a land where usefulness was extolled above all , the " therapeutic " make-work seemed to Deborah an unconscious slap at the pride which the patients were supposed to be developing . An Occupational Therapy worker in her **28;5524;TOOLONG came toward them.  | " Well , hello , Carla , " she said , a little too cheerily ; then , looking at Deborah , " Have you brought us a visitor ? " " Yes , " Carla said . " We just wanted to look in . This is Deborah . " " Why , of course ! " the worker said enthusiastically . " I 've seen you before  --  it was up on D ward ! " Heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suddenvision of the occupational-therapy worker in the clothes of a hunter shooting over a wind-bent wheatfield and causing the scared and sudden rising of a flock of birds . Carla understoodwhat was happening and turned away for a moment . Then she turned back , and said , " She 's on B ward now , and she 's my roommate . " A few of the faces relaxed and a few of the hands moved to work again . They stayed for a while and Deborah was introduced to some of the male patients , wondering as she heard their names what could possibly make men sick . When the two girls left , they walked toward A ward , which was open and where there was a coffeepot for both patients and staff . " It 's mostly for them , " Carla said , " but it shows you what you can hope for , and maybe , if no one wants any coffee , they will let us have what 's left . " Deborah did not want to go in . One shot over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . you 've been out  --  I mean really out . Is that the way it is outside when one of us comes into a room ? " " Sometimes , " Carla said . " Getting a job , you have papers you have to show , and sometimes there 's a social worker checkingon you . It can be very , very tough , but people are sometimesbetter than you think they will be . In lots of jobs you have to show your sanity papers ' and they make a big thing of it , but the best people on the outside make you feel honored to share the name person ' with them . The part that 's hardest is the feeling you get when everyone is polite and says good morning ' and good night ' while the distance between you andp235them is getting wider and wider . The doctors say that it 's the fault of the sick one  --  my fault . If I were less anxious , they say , it would be easier for friendships to come , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors ever tried to break into a new group with a heavy stigma on their heads and having their first acceptance in that group hinge on pity or morbid fascination . " Deborah laughed . " Doctors ! Spend a glorious year in ForeignTravel . Visit your nuthouse as a patient ! " Carla laughed . " Tour without your prestige , your civil rights , or your self-respect ! Thrill to the false fine-fine when you are on the receiving end ! " For a while they indulged themselves in the game of getting even with all the doctors who used their prestige and a certain sense of private ownership of reality to separate themselves from their patients . It occurred to Deborah that Doctor Halle and Furii and New Doctor would not need Foreign Travel because they had never completely shut the gate between themselves and their patients . " I forgot to tell you , " Deborah said when they were walking back to the ward , " it 's about Helene . You know , we 've been laughing at her jokes , but until lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been something like a caring in her . " Deborah told Carla how Helene had been at the door when she was leaving the D ward . Helene had waited until they were alone for a moment and then had said , " Why could n't I be the one going ? " Deborah had said , " Well , why not ? " and she had answered abstractedly , " Maybe . . . maybe ... " as if she were thinking of it for the first time . Helene had never been so unguarded , even in her sleep . Of course , when the nurse came to take Deborah down , she had covered it up , putting out her fist and calling Deborah " a stupid bitch " and yelling after her , " Do n't you forget it ! " But Deborah had smiled , knowing that Helene had been cursing the Maybe and not her at all.  |p236They  went through the keyless south door and met New Doctor coming out . When he saw Deborah , his face brightened . " Hey ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your change of address . Congratulations ! " His tone had respect . She had not taken into account that there might be some heady wine in the first tasting of the new world . But he may not really know enough to judge , Deborah whispered to the gods of Yr in propitiation . " Something strange  --  something I never thought about before  --  " Deborah said to Doctor Fried , "  --  that Jews have their own form of intolerance . I never knew anyone well who was not Jewish , and I never gave my last particle of trust to someone who was n't Jewish . Doctor Hill , the new doctor , and Carla are Protestants , and Helene is Catholic , and Miss Coral has kind of a frantic-Baptist background ... " " Well ? " " Well , I 've been doing something funny in my mind . I 've been making them Jewish so that they could be close to me . " " How do you do this ? " " Well , it 's one step more than forgetting that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end . I also have to forget that they 're not Jewish , too . Yesterday , Carla asked me what I thought of someone . I said , You know that type  --  he wants to be an individualist , so he cries through Purim . ' It took her look , that sudden stop of surprise , and a long , long time to remind me that she did n't know what I was talking about because she is n't Jewish . " " Can you let them be what they are and be what you are , and still love them ? " " The hospital gave me that , " Deborah said slowly . " When you 're nuts , it hardly matters that you 're a nutty Jew or a nutty Holy Roller . ... " Doctor Fried 's thoughts drifted for a moment to an article she had written once discussing the question of how a doctorp237tells a recovering patient that her own newborn health must grapple with symptoms of madness in the world . The health in this girl might weigh someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and she said , " How glad I am that you have discovered this ! But beside the point . You know , I have listened to that memory you told me  --  the one about your almost having thrown your sister out of the window when she was a baby  --  and something has been botheringme about it ; something is not right about it . Tell me the thing again . " Deborah told the memory again : how she had reached into the bassinet for the little darling whose ugliness was so apparent to her and so invisible to everyone else ; about the windowout of which she had held the little creature , the arrival of Mother , and the shame of hating and being caught at it ; how later , when love came , she had shivered at thinking that she might have ended Suzy 's life that day . Over the whole happening brooded the spirits of the knowing , shamed , and sorrowful parents , silent in their charity . " Was the window open ? " Furii asked . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you open it all the way ? " " Enough to lean far out with the baby . " " I see . Then , after you opened the window and tested it by leaning out , you went and got the baby ? " " No  --  I picked her up first and then decided to kill her . " " I see . " Furii leaned back like Mr. Pickwick after a good dinner . " Now I turn detective , " she said , " and I tell you that your story stinks to heaven ! A five-year-old lifts up a heavy baby , carries it to the window , holds it on the sill with her own body while she opens the window and practices leaning out , lifts the baby out over the sill , and holds it at arms ' length out the window ready to drop it . Mother comes in and in a flash of speed this five-year-old whips the child inside where it starts to cry so that the mother takes it  | " No  --  by that time it was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furii said . " Now , am I crazy or did you make that story up when you were five years old and walked in and saw that baby lying there and hated it enough to want to kill it ? " " But I remember . . . " " You may remember hating , but the facts are against you . What did your mother say when she came in ? Was it : Put that baby down ! ' or Do n't hurt the baby ! ' ? " " No , I remember clearly . She said , What are you doing in here ? ' and I remember that the baby was crying then . " " What astonishes me about this whole business is that I was so busy listening to the emotional content  --  the hatred and the pain  --  that I lost the facts and they had to shout at me again and again before I could hear them . The hatred was real , Deborah , and the pain also , but you were just not big enough to do any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say your parents felt all these years was only your guilt at wishing your sister dead . With the false idea of your own power ( an idea , by the way , that your sickness has kept you from ever growing out of ) , you translated those thoughts into a memory . " It might as well have been real ; I lived with it for all those years as if it were real . " " Yes , that 's true , " Furii said smiling , " but no longer will you be able to flagellate yourself with that particular stick . Our would-be murderess is no more than a jealous five-yearoldlooking into the cradle of the interloper . " " Bassinet , " Deborah said . " Those ones on legs ? My God , you could n't even reach into it then . I turn in my detective badge tomorrow ! " Deborah was back in the room being five again and standing with her father for a view of the new baby . Her eyes were on the level of the knuckles of his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stand on her toes to peepp239over the edge . " I did n't even touch her . . . " she said absently . " I did n't even touch her . . . . " " As long as you are back in those days , we might as well see them together , " Furii said . Deborah began to talk about the year of brightness before the gloom had settled in for good . She explored the brief and magical time when looking forward had been with expectation . Now it came to her that for that one year , even with the false weight of the murder and her dethronement as princess , she had not yet been under the sentence of destruction . There had been that season  --  it came again now with a powerful surge of meaning  --  when she had still been committed to life and had lived with a joyful hunger because of a present and a future . She came from the sunshine of that fifth year with tears running down her face . Furii saw the tears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very early happiness was proof that she was not damned genetically  --  damned bone and fiber . There had been a time when she suffered , yet shone with life . She began to cry in full earnest . It was still a novice 's cry , harsh , random , and bitter , and when it subsided , Furii had to ask if it had been a " good one , " with healing in it . " What 's the date ? " Deborah asked . " December fifteenth . Why do you ask ? " " I was just thinking out loud . Yri time is internal . You know about the two calendars and how days are measured between meetings for trial by the Collect . " " Yes . " " Well , I just remembered that today is Fourth Engli f t towardAnnot . It means that we are on a rising calendar . " She was still too frightened to say that , by some miracle , it seemed to have raised her from Hell to Purgatory . When she left the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain was falling . Cold of the causal world made her shiver ,  |p240and  she was grateful because it was a cold responsible to the laws and seasons of the earth . In the Preserve the tree limbs were wet and black . She saw Idat high above her , walking on a great branch . Her veils were all shimmering like the air above a fire . Suffer , victim , Idat greeted her . Oh , Idat ! Deborah answered in Yri . The earth is so good now  --  why is it walking in ruin to have both Yr and Else-where ? Am I not beautiful in this tree ? the goddess asked . Questionshad a particularly poignant quality in Yri because they used a familiar form and because they gave hint of the quick and ephemeral quality of asking anything . Idat was the Dissemblerand her answers were always difficult . I think I shall be a woman always , she said now . You can have something on which to model yourself . Deborah knew that she could never use Idat for a model . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a goddess and impossibly beautiful , not bound to the world at all . When Idat cried , her tears crystallized into diamonds splashed on her face . Her laws were not those of earth . Stay with me , Deborah begged to Yr , using the word which meant forever . There was no answer . At dinner Carla seemed particularly nervous . Her hands were shaking and she had a pale , sick look . Deborah tried to warm her by looking at her with " pure " Earth eyes , but it was no use . When coffee came , Carla tried to pick up her cup , but it leaped from her shock-wired hands and fell , breaking like the brittle crust of reality on which they all walked . While the sound of the breaking crockery still echoed , the others at the table made quick reference to their own places on that crust , while the fright ran all along the familiar pathway traces inside of them . Then Deborah took Carla 's hands and held them . Thep241hands rested . Carla rested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recollection that Yri time and season were measured by the internal climate and that fourth Engli f t toward Annot was a strong position to venture from ; more sudden than the recollection that a debt to Sylvia still had to be paid and that she still wanted to give a kiss to McPherson , long away . She looked at Carla . The face was still pale and slapped-looking , but it was better than it had been . The hands relaxed . No one said anything and soon the nurse whose particular job it was to signal the end of the meal raised her discreet white arm , just enough to be seen , and everyone , more or less , got up and went . It was then , at the signal , that Deborahrealized that she had unhidden herself for Carla . On the way up the stairs it came to her that perhaps  --  no , perhaps was too strong  --  that three short of maybe , she might be more than only an ex-almost-murderess . She might be something more nearly  --  the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not cancel it or keep it out of her mind  --  more nearly good.  |p242Her  dream began with winter darkness . Out of this darkness came a great hand , fisted . It was a man 's hand , powerful and hollowed by shadows in the wells between bones and tendons . The fist opened and in the long plain of the palm lay three small pieces of coal . Slowly the hand closed , causing within the fist a tremendous pressure . The pressure began to generate a white heat and still it increased . There was a sense of weighing , crushing time . She seemed to feel the suffering of the coal with her own body , almost beyond the point of being borne . At last she cried out to the hand , " Stop it ! Will you never end it ! Even a stone can not bear to this limit . . . even a stone . . . ! " After what seemed like too long a time for anything molecularto endure , the torments in the fist relaxed . The fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Three clear and brilliant diamonds , shot with light , lay in the good palm . A deep voice called to her , " Deborah ! " and then , gently , " Deborah , this will be you . "  |p244On  the First of January , with eagerness outrunning terror , Deborah went home for a five-day visit . Although she knew that she wore a strange look , that besides the scars of scrapings and burnings , a subtler mark was on her  --  an aura of withdrawaland loneliness  --  hunger for the new world propelled her into it . She was received at home as if she had won the world . Suzy had been warned , Jacob had been warned , Grandmother and Grandfather had been warned , and all the old aunts and uncles , warned , so that they held their love up , quivering with pity and fear , to show her that it was still whole . All her favoritefoods were served and all her favorite people came to bear witness to the fact that " nevertheless " and " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and speak to the people who came to see her , but exhaustion would claim her as she sat . The hospital relationships had been brief and fleetingand never complicated by more than two or three people at a time and conversation ended abruptly when darkness fell on any of the speakers . Now there was chatter and threads of talk that wove in and out like a complicated cat 's cradle . It was not possible to tell them how immense she found the distancebetween herself and the rest of the human race , even if she were of human substance . Jacob 's warmth and pride , pathetic and vulnerable , flowed toward her as he saw her sitting again at his table . " I 'll bet they do n't serve a piece of meat like this at That Place . " Deborah was about to answer that the cutlery alone was sufficient challenge , but she caught herself in time . " Soon you 'll be home for good , " he said . Deborah paled so markedly that Esther threw herself into the talk like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see , we 'll see  --  I think the mushrooms are delicious  --  you see , Debby , all your favorite foods ! " Suzy sat across the table looking at Jacob and Esther and the homely , tired , older sister who was really younger than she , and who was being feasted and catered to as if her homecomingwere some kind of miracle . She knew that she had to protect this latest Debby . It was not the sister she had wanted  --  the prom-going sister , all boy-friends , college football games , and glamour  --  but in her somewhere , and by some mistaken magic , the family happiness and peace rested . " Look , Debby , " she said , " Mother and Daddy told me alreadyabout that place not being a school , so if everybody would stop dying over the big secret , it 'll be a lot easier . " It would be easier , she thought , to go into the bedroom and make a telephone call , and tell her friend that she would not go on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy needed her now , and Debby needed her , too , in ap246frightening sort of way . It was really too bad . . . . She felt the tears coming because she had wanted to go on this trip so much . She dared not wipe her eyes where they could see her . She got up , knowing that they wanted to talk without her . " Excuse me , I have to call Annette . " " You 're going with them , are n't you ? " Esther asked , rememberinghow long Suzy had been talking about their " weekend . " " No . . . I 'll go next time . " " Is it because I 'm here ? " Deborah said . " No  --  no , I just do n't want to , this time . " A bad lie . Deborah 's mind , already exhausted and dulled by another day in the world , grappled for Suzy 's feeling . " Were they supposed to come up here first or something ? " she asked . Suzy turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and she said , " You 're not here that much . I want to see you this week . " " Do n't mother me , tell me ! " Deborah said , sinking under the world . " No ! " Suzy shouted , and she turned and went in to make her call . " She really loves you very much , " Esther said . " The whole family is doing everything it can  --  all the roads have been smoothed over . " All Deborah heard were the sounds of her own gasps of exhaustion as she climbed an Everest that was to everyone else an easy and a level plain . As she reeled and pulled on the endless , vertical cliff , she felt that every favor , every easing , was an unpaid debt heaped upon her by loving tormentors and weighing like lumps of lead . Among equals gratitude is reciprocal ; her gratitude to these Titans , who called themselves average and were unaware of their own tremendousstrength in being able to live , only made her feel more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to bed , Esther and Jacob came embarrassedly to her bedside with the ration of sedatives prescribed by the hospital . As Deborah took them , Jacob looked away , but when he kissed her good night he said winningly , " It 's nice here , is n't it ? It 's where you belong . " The tumor heaved inside her . He continued , " Debby , you do n't need to stay with all those . . . those screaming women . " " What screaming women ? " Deborah asked , wondering if he had ever heard her louder than a whisper , and hoping with all her soul that he had not . " Well , when we visited . . . we heard it Y ) The pain of looking at him escaped in a laugh . " Oh , I know  --  that must have been big , dumb old Lucy Martenson . She gets even with everybody by playing Tarzan out the front windows of the D ward and scaring the visitors to death . " It had never occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be a person , someone named Lucy , and the realization eased him a little , but he hugged Deborah hard when he said good night . In the dark her room was luminous with Yri personages . We never hated you , Lactamaeon said , shining on his hardriddenhorse . The cruelty was for protection ! Anterrabae said in antiphon , waving a sheaf of sparks in his hand . We came in the era of dryness and the death of hope , calledLactamaeon . We came with gifts , said Anterrabae . When you were laughing nowhere else , you were laughing with us . She knew that it was the truth . Even now , delighting in a world of rich color and odors that actually referred to what one was smelling ; even profoundly in love with cause and effect , optics , conics , motion , and time all obedient to their laws ; she wondered if Yr would be a fair trade for all of it . Of course , the Yr she meant was the once-upon-a-time Yr ; not the anarchic Yr of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen hurtling endless distances into pits of mindlessness ,  |p248but  the ancient kingdom of the early years : with a crag for an eagle , an illimitable sky , a green landfall where wild horses grazed , and falls with Anterrabae that showered light behind them . The change had begun with the coming of the Censor after a long time of horror that she now knew had been the collisionof the two worlds . He had promised protection and had told her that he would keep the worlds separate so that she might go safely between them , paying lip service to the gray and lonely Earth while being free in Yr . In the times of greatest joy , the happiness was so great that her feet could not bear the ground and she went to flight . The time of the pure flight , the joyful and perfect flight , had been pitifully short , and the Censor had begun to rule like a tyrant in both worlds . Yr still gave beauty and great joy , but the beauty and joy were at the tyrant 's erratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this time the scale that weighed the earth 's virtues had a new quantity to add to the rest  --  hope , the little , little Maybe . Still the earth was a place full of peril and treachery , especially for an alien . The sedative began to dull her senses , but at the last moment of vision the brightness of Yr prevailed . Suzy stayed home the next day and the next . Members of the family were still coming for visits , carefully grouped according to the state of their ignorance about Deborah 's " condition . " She had brought a package of her drawings home to show Esther , who had always been her first judge , and Esther displayed them proudly to group after group of aunts and great aunts , who looked with the bemused and tolerant pride of relatives . There were no hospital scenes at all , but there was Helene , a string-haired vacant-eyed madwoman looking into a mirror at the lovely college friend of the photograph , and there was Constantia and the two nurses it took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preserve that went off into infinite distance . These and others she had Deborah explainp249for the technical aspects . Most of the visitors contented themselves with extravagant praise such as they always gave , leavingwith a kiss and a joke for Suzy about her latest conquest . ( " No , Aunt Selma , he was weeks ago  --  I just went to the party with him . " ) At dinner , Esther praised Deborah 's poise and charm , while it seemed to Deborah that Suzy had somehow darkened over these two days . She had been free to go out and leave the prodigal elder sister to all the praises , but she had stayed . Was it perhaps the virulence after all  --  the slow poison of Deborahnesswhich conscious will told her did not exist , but which still whispered , " They lie ! They lie ! " deep in the places beneathlogic and will . She took her sedative early that night and went to sleep . As she drifted away , she heard Suzy 's and Esther 's voices from the living room . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God help us ! " Deborah said , and slept . " You do n't hear them , " Suzy groaned , " because when it is n't about Debby , you just do n't hear anything , but I 'm more than just a careless and brainless dope ! " " You 're not being fair , " Esther said . " It 's that she 's only home for a few days so we seem to be making a bigger fuss . " " Every letter , " Suzy cried , " every visit that you make to her ! I draw , too ; I dance , and I wrote two of the songs for the camp follies last year . They may not be as profound ' as Debby 's pictures , but you never stop Grandma or invite Aunt Natalie and Uncle Matt to hear the new song that I wrote or the smart thing that I said . " " Do n't you see , you stupid girl , " Esther said almost savagely , " I do n't have to ! Praising you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so loud that Jacob came in from the bedroomangrily and growled , " Enough ! You 'll wake the dead ! " They all caught the slip , the unconscious but accuratep250allusion to the drugged and sleeping cause of all these years of heartache and argument . They went to bed guiltily and angrily , loving and despairing . When the visit was over , Deborah went back to the hospital with a suitcase full of new clothes.  |p251S|pring  moved in again and winter drew off the Preserve and off the streets that led to the town . Deborah , still in the first urgency of hunger and love for the world 's forms and colors , had radiated her artistic gift into a dozen mediums and styles . The materials in the craft shop were scanty , but she worked with whatever there was : silk-screen and block-printing , water color and gouache . She yearned to play with all the toys ofthe earth , while Yr and the world 's darker parts fought it out t inside her . To Earth 's usages and people she felt she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new access and freedom and great reward . A new patient asked her what she was , meaning her religion , and she found herself answering , " A Newtonian . " The new patient was very like Helene . Deborah felt that ,  |p252underneath  her vagueness and sudden crying out as if she had been shot , there was a trueness and a strength . Her name was Carmen , her father was a multimillionaire , and Deborah knew that she was destined for a long stay on D ward . The threemonth " honeymoon " that most people spent clutching the last rags of sanity to cover an awful nakedness was almost over for her . Sometimes , when Carmen passed , Carla and Deborah looked at each other and said with a look : When she blows , she 's going to cover the ceiling . " Hey , Carmen  --  let 's go over to A ward and play ping-pong . " " I ca n't . My father 's coming to visit this afternoon . " " Do you want us around or not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aid . Though they were no beauties , she and Carla would wash up , get combed and rigged , to help their ward-mate by running interference betweenCarmen 's father and the more bizarre-looking of ward B 's cuckoos . " No , " Carmen said in her listless way , " he would n't understand . I just hope I can do it . . . just right . " " Which is how ? " Deborah asked . " Agreement . . . always . Just absolute . . . agreement . " It was Sunday and the craft shop was closed . There was a weekend desertedness about everything . Even in the safety of the hospital , Sundays were hard to take . Carla described how agonizing they had been when she was " outside " working , and Deborah herself remembered how treacherous the world made its Sundays . On regular days the Semblance could be pulled up like a screen over body and mind , but Sunday called itself Rest and Freedom , and threw one off guard . Sundaypromised leisure , peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish for human perfection . But it was on Sunday that the Semblance never fully covered , and Sunday afternoon was a frantic struggle to hide the other worlds beforeMonday arrived with its demand that the lies be repeated and the surface be perfect.  |p253Deborah  and Carla ambled idly in the half-warm mists of the early spring , looking at the cracks that winter had left in the walkway and playing their dreamers ' game , which they had made up to pass the time . In it they would shatter the world a dozen times and rebuild it , half as a punishment , half in a secret , fragile hope . " In my university , we wo n't allow any special groups or cliques . " " In my factory , the bosses will work on the most routine jobs just so they can see how murderous they are . " But it was hospitals that they knew best and they built and staffed hospitals endlessly , equipping and administering them as the main part of the game . As they talked , they found themselveswalking far beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would do away with all the bars on the windows , " Carla said . Deborah was n't sure . " The patients would have to be strong enough to stand it , first , " she said . " Sometimes you have to fight what wo n't yield and put yourself where it 's safe to be crazy . " " Let 's make our doctors-on-call really on call . " " All my attendants will spend a week as patients . " They found themselves in the meadow far beyond the last hospital building . " Look where we are . " " I 'm not allowed out here , " Deborah said . " Neither am I. " They felt good . The afternoon was settling into evening and a light rain was beginning to fall , but neither of them could bear to part with this small and special mutiny against Sunday , supervision , and the world . They sat in the field , stupid with pleasure and let the Sunday God 's rain fall on them . The day went to twilight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes and began wistfully to walk back toward the hospital . As they neared the last building , they were seen by Henson and little Cleary , who had come out of Annex 3 and were going toward the main building . " Hey , you girls  --  do you have night privileges ? " " No , " Carla said . " We were just going in now . " " All right then . " The two attendants waited for them , flanking them when they came . It was not the way to go back ; they could not go back that way , not after the freedom , the laughing , and the good rain . They looked at each other . Their eyes said , " No . " When they came close to the door , the attendantsclosed in automatically ; and so , defeated , they went in . On the other side of the door the moment came . Carla and Deborah saw it together , and , as if they had been trained for it all their lives , they took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door was a set of swingingdoors , and when they had all passed through them , Carla and Deborah simply turned on the same footfall , back through the doors , which swung back on the surprised attendants , and out the front door without a break in stride . As they ran , they heard the buzzer that signaled to the hospital a patient 's escape . They ran , laughing until they were breathless , for a long , long time , down the dark back roads . The rain beat hard on them and there was a fast rack riding the sky . Anterrabae was singing gloriously out of Yr , songs of the beauties of the world which he had not given for many , many years . Deborah and Carla ran on until the breath sobbed out of them and their sides ached , and then they slowed down , shivering with cold and freedom . From a distance a light came on . It was a car . " They sent searchers out ! " Carla said breathlessly , and they dived together into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light had disappeared in the rain , the fugitives came out of thep255ditch and walked on , laughing because they were quick and able . After a while they saw another car . " More searchers ? " " Do n't flatter yourself , nut . It 's still a public road . " " Might as well play it safe , though . . . " and they dived again for the ditch . Huddled cold and alert in their hiding place , Deborah wondered for the first time what they intended to do . They had no dry clothes and no money . They had no plan and no desire to do any more than they were doing . She tried to remember what Furii had taught her about doing what she really wanted , and sat back against the embankment wondering what it was . Beside her , Carla was shaking a stone from her shoe . When the car passed they clambered up , looking like twins for the mud , and went on walking . " We have to turn back sometime , " Deborah said aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my doctor tomorrow . I just had to be alone , that 's all , not led or taken . " Deborah smiled in the darkness . " Of course . That 's what I wanted . " It was a long walk back . They sang through some of it and laughed at the way they slid in their sopping shoes . They were not " caught " until they were through the front gate and inside the front door of the B-C-D ward building . In retaliation , it seemed , for having gone and come with such sweet ease , they were phalanxed and separated . Two attendants guarded Deborah while she took a bath . They were Second Night Staff , which meant that it must be after midnight . " You 'll be in for it now , " one of them said self-righteously . " Do I have to go . . . up ? " " You behave here and take your sedative and go to bed and you 'll be here tonight , " the attendant said . " You girls will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah and her guard passed Carla andp256her guard on the way to the end of the hall , where a small group of rooms were kept for seclusion . Their glances , still free , caught over the heads of the nurses and they winked at each other . Later , when Deborah began drifting toward sleep , she thought : It may be a hell of a price . But she remembered the smell of the rain . A new doctor , a Dr. Ogden , was administrator for B ward . Deborah did not know him yet and could n't tell what he was like . She had n't seen Carla since they had exchanged the wink of complicity . All she could do was to try to remember all the grapevine talk about escapes in the past , and think of something that would make their reasons sound good enough . At i r : oo that morning , she was sent down to the administrationoffices under guard . The attendant knocked at Dr. Ogden'sdoor . " Come in . " Deborah went in and there , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delight she felt must have been spread all over her face , since he smiled slightly and said , " Doctor Ogden is down with the flu , so I am taking over the B-ward work for a while . Being here for B-ward duties keeps things straight . " Then he leaned back , rubbing his thumbs together . " What 's it all about ? " She told him where they had been . He stopped her twice for details and when she was finished asked , " Whose idea was this in the first place ? " She groped for an explanation . There was an Yri word that described how they had felt and its presence in her mind made it difficult to concentrate on speaking English . She decided at least to translate the single word and hope that he could understand . After her false start he looked at her and said , " Just tell me . " " Okay . . . " She hesitated because of the awful need to sound sane . " Well . . . if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are n't . Where ... I .. . Where I came from we called such people atumai . For suchp257people the extra step is not there to trip them , and the string that they tie packages with is never two inches too short . The traffic lights are always with them . Pain comes when they are lying down and ready for it and the joke when it is fitting to them to laugh . Yesterday , I got to have that atumai , just for a while . Carla had it , too . We both had it together . You do n't decide to sneeze , you just do it . No one had the idea or was the leader ; we just did it and were . " She thought of the way they had swung back together through that second door and the smile came back and broke away from her . " Was it fun ? " he asked . " It sure was ! " " All right , " he said . " I 'm going to talk to Carla for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She left the office and saw Carla , right outside , waiting her turn likewise guarded and looking very frightened . Her eyes questioned . Deborah shrugged the imperceptible shrug of the experienced patient , prisoner , spy , or nun . Carla 's eyes took the gesture like a blow . She went in . After what seemed a long while , she stuck her head out and motioned to Deborah . " Come in  --  he wants to see us together . " This time it was the guards who exchanged glances . Deborah went in , scenting the air . Doctor Halle looked very grim , but Deborah breathed out with relief when she saw that he was fighting a smile . " You broke hospital rules  --  eight of them , I believe , " he said . " Very reprehensible . Your descriptions of your actions tally with each other 's . It was fun , was n't it ? It was shared fun . That 's rare here . I 'm kind of proud of you . . . . " He rearranged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the status of your privileges . That 's all . " They left , closing the door behind them . Doctor Halle swiveled around in his chair to look out the window . Outside , the trees were in small leaf , the springtime filling out along the branches . The hedge was raining green . He thought ofp258the two girls in the stormy night , walking and singing , and of a trip he had once taken , running away . " Kids ! " he exclaimed . In his voice there was impatience , admiration , and a little kernel of envy . " Where 's Carmen ? " Carla asked Deborah . " I want to tell her that it 's all okay . She saw us go in the afternoon and she must have heard what happened . " " I do n't know , I have n't seen her . " They asked the nurse . " Carmen 's gone home . She left last night . " " But did n't her father come just to visit ? " " Yes , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . All I know is that she left with him about seven last night . " The nurse 's tone told them to ask no more , so they questioned each other . " What could it have been ? " " Terry , did you see Carmen yesterday ? " " Yeah  --  I saw her . " " What happened ? " " She disagreed . " Deborah and Carla looked at each other , shivering , with the world 's perversity and Doctor Halle 's praise circling each other in their ears . " My parents  --  " Deborah said . She knew that they had seen more of her hatred than her love , but they had let her stay . They had let her stay without a sign of improvement for a long , long time . They had never demanded of her a recovery to heal their prestige . She looked down and found her hands working in Yri again , passionately , framing words to speak to her own mind . Carla , sealed in her own cell and shut off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was freedom they gave me after all . Carmen 's did n't give her a chance , but mine ... " It came to Deborah that it was her parents who had boughtp259this fight for her . They could have cut her off from it the minute that she failed to make their progress . They had kept faith with a future which might never sing their praises . " Carla . . . if I were n't scared to death of it , I would be so grateful ! "  |p260Dead  pale , cold-handed , in a lilac flowered dress that ill suited the lithe tiger wearing it , Helene came to B ward . Her " normal " smile seemed wired , like a booby trap . When Deborahand Carla told her they were glad to see her , she told them they were hypocrites and liars , and her true smile crept behind the display one , so that they saw she was inhabiting her body and they were happy for her . They took her over to the craft shop when she was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that it was a wheatfield and that the hunter there had a very sudden gun . With Helene 's violent past , legends of which were still current , the gun would be a cannon . Carla left early for her doctor 's hour and they did n't see her again until just before supper . She came quietly out on thep261hall where Deborah and Helene were sitting with sketch pad and curlers , and walked over to them . " Deb  --  it 's about Carmen . " She handed her the newspaper clipping . Newspapers were not allowed on B ward , but there was a brisk bootleg trade going on . Deborah looked at it quickly and slipped it in her sketch pad . The headline said , MAGNATE 'S DAUGHTER SUICIDE . She held the pad so no one could see the clipping and read it through . Under the headlinethere was an article with details about the mess that can be made when a human being fires a gun into her ear . " Do you know her ? I mean did you know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " Just long enough to learn to disagree , " Carla said . " She could have made it , " Deborah said flatly , as she stood up . " Oh , Deb , how can you be sure ? " " You 're not just rubbing it in good to get a little free sufferingout of it ? " Helene asked in her bitter voice . " I did n't say that she would have made it , but that she could have . Their voices brought others out of their rooms . Everyone knew what the talk was about and there was a rippling tension on the ward . The nurses stood by , not knowing whether to speak or be silent , and Deborah began to feel the mood was less about Carmen 's suicide than an argument between the cynicism that was in each of them and the blind , small longing to fight . To her surprise , Deborah found herself on the side of the little Maybe . She knew what she was thinking , but wondered if she could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more terrified than the D-ward patients were . " Oh , Deb , you said yourself that Carmen was going to blow skv-high any minute , " Carla said . Deborah looked at Carla , wondering if Carla was trying top262keep her from saying something that would make trouble and need recanting , or spoil something between them that had weathered all the suffering . " Carmen could have made it , that 's all . She had a good , healthy sickness . " " That 's a contradiction in terms ! " " That 's impossible ! " " No , it is n't  --  think about it for a minute  --  a sickness with a good , hard hurt that 's direct and does n't cover with an appealingsurface or exercises in normal-faking the doctors . " There was an embarrassed silence and without meaning to , Deborah found herself looking at Linda , the " psychological authority , " who had read everything and gave jargon like currency , recklessly improvident because she hoped never to be touched by the pain that was wrapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definition , came back angrily . " Ridiculous  --  you 're just rationalizing your own defensive sys-tem ! " Deborah tried to say it better , and make it more real . " Look at that bunch from the Men 's Admitting  --  they 're all very rationaland sane ' and witty . The staff likes them , even as people , but they 're here and they 've been here for years and they are n't helped by anything or anybody . They do n't seem to suffer much because they do n't feel anything much . That 's sick-sickness . Miss Coral up on D may be sick , but she 's feeling and fighting and alive . . . " Her voice petered out in the face of their anger and disbelief , but suddenly she felt again the quiet power of the opening of the world which she had felt that evening on the D ward . Only now it came more urgently and passionately . " Alive is fighting , " Deborah said . " It 's the same thing . I still think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them then , and Deborah looked around at the faces suffused with anger against her . She had hit a particularlysensitive nerve . It was B ward 's nerve ; a desperate hope that the false " fine-fine " might see them through if onlyp263they acted long enough and tried to make it be the truth . Was it as frightened a clutching at convention on the outside ' ) " You sure like to rattle the cages around here , " Carla said later as they got ready for bed . " You 're wondering how I ever made it to this old age , as thorny as I am ? " " I 'm going to miss you , Deb . " In Yr 's distances a cannon went off . " Why should you ? " " Because I 'm going out to try again . " The fear , like a backhand slap , caught her unprepared , but her lessons with Furii had been well learned , and while she shook , she questioned : Fear for me or for Carla ? If for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ? Fear because soon I will have to go ? Part of it was of the same fear that had made the others back off from her definition of a " good , healthy sickness . " She smiled at it ruefully . " It should be strong enough , this therapy , " Carla said , " to go a lousy mile into town . I 'm going to start looking for jobs where I wo n't be sealed up in a little room somewhere . Maybe that was the main trouble before . " She sounded frightened and tired . " I 'll miss you , " Deborah said bleakly . " Maybe soon you can come , too . " Deborah tried to say " sure , " but she knew that her fear might translate the words into some other language , so she lay on her bed and felt the fear settle over her like fog . The girl who took Carla 's place in her room was a gentle , generous veteran of mechanical psychiatry in a dozen other hospitals . Her memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave herself dozens of sets of wildly divergent parents . " It was always a musical family . . . " she would say vaguely . " My father  --  he 's Paderewski , and my mother is Sophie Tucker . It 's why I 'm high-strung . "  |p264Deborah  liked her and after a while they did not speak of families at all , or the marital frictions of her parents , Greta Garbo and Will Rogers . The hunger for the new world which had awakened in Deborahforced her to seek more and more of it . She would sit near the student nurses on the hall and in the craft shop to hear them talk . She would question them about their lives and families and where they lived and what they wanted to do after they finished their training . She would walk into town and back often , learning all the ways there were to go and come , looking , smelling , watching the seasons change . The hunger made her go even where she was not wanted , into the social life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to the Methodist minister about the young people 's group . They both knew that belonging was a hopeless quest ; the hospital and its inmates had been feared and ridiculed far too long in the small , insular community . But the tired , quiet ladies of the church choir could not measure or reckon the passionatehunger of a new-born worldling for her birthright . Althoughthey ignored her , she came anyway . They made her invisible , yet she still came . And finally , in fear and excitement , restlessness and stubbornwill , she set into motion the request for her own way out of the hospital . When the machinery had whirred and the responsehad come , she saw in her roommate 's face the look which she , in turn , must have shown to Carla and before Carla to Doris Rivera  --  an awe , a fear , an anger , an envy  --  above all , a reality-shattering loneliness . " It does n't matter to me , you 're going , " the roommate said . " I 'm not really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchfor my degree and as soon as I 'm finished I 'll just pick up and go ! " When Deborah said good-by , the woman looked at her as if she had never seen her before . The social worker had a list of rooms in town that could bep265let to out-patients . Most of them , Deborah knew from the grapevine or from her walks , were poor and dark , and partook of the shame of the lepers who lived in them . " There are one or two places which are new and have no patients living in them . They are a little far , though  --  way over on the other side of town . " Deborah closed her eyes and put her finger on the list of names . " The law requires us to state " Yes , I know , " Deborah said , and suddenly remembering her sprained ankle and St. Agnes ( " Are they violent ? " ) she winced a little . " I 'll have to come along , " said the social worker . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old house , and when the landlady opened it , Deborah looked hard at her , waiting for the guarding of the eyes and the closing of the face as the social worker explained what she was . The landlady was elderlyand there was little subtlety in her . Deborah began to wonder if she understood what was being said . When the worker was finished she motioned to them . " Well , I hope you like the room . " " It 's a mental hospital , " the social worker said desperately . " Oh ? . . . Now , this room has more light , but the other is closer to the bathroom , you see . " When the worker left , the landlady only said , " Now , please do n't clog up this toilet  --  it 's old and a little cantankerous . " " Not if my life depended on it , " Deborah said . As it turned out , the landlady , Mrs. King , was a stranger in the town and had not been raised on the bogeymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening tales had bred fear and contempt in most of the town 's people . Deborah had often seen mothers call their children out of the range of " The Captain , " who had been in the Navy and talked to himself as he walked . To Deborah , who looked somewhat more normal ,  |p266the  town showed no such fear . It showed nothing . Although Deborah had gone to the choir practice at the church and sewingclasses at the high school , and even a teen-age outing club ( Come One Come All ) , she went and returned , sharing a sewing machine , a hymnbook , a map , and " good evening " and " good night " and no more . Everyone was most polite and so was she , but their lives had been walled against her . " Is it the town or is it my face ? " " Maybe both . . . " said Furii , " although your face looks all right to me  --  perhaps there is a certain anxiety in it when you meet people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of mental day labor , finding in the new freedoms new confrontations with the past . " I wanted to ask you , " Furii said , " to look back again to the past and tell me if you see any light breaking through that grayness of which we have spoken . " Deborah sank back into the memories . The reign of ruin and calamity , which had seemed so total , now , magically , admitted of some patches of sunlight all but lost under the conquering powers of Yr . " Yes . . . yes . . . I do ! " She smiled . " I seem to remember whole days of it sometimes  --  and there was that year in the house where we were before we moved back to Chicago  --  and there was my friend  --  how could I have for-gotten ! " " You had a friend ? " " Until I came here  --  and she was not one of the ruined either , at least not after she got used to the newness of the city . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was lonely and a foreigner  --  but she learned our ways quickly and she was good  --  I mean she was not ruined ! " " You heard from her in the last years ? " " Oh , yes ! She 's in college  --  why did n't I remember ? " " When you were so very ill , remembering a friend or a partial sunlight would have meant changing a view of theworld that could not allow change . One relinquishes claim to the world for a reason . You have to have all the reasons to make so big a renunciation . Now , when you have come again to the world , you are able to remember what was also there with the darkness . Much of it was darkness only because it was balanced against the light of loving and experiencing truth . "  | " But Yr is beautiful and true also , and there is love there , too . " " It is not the language , and not the gods in themselves , " Furii said , " but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sickness . " " It 's nice to walk with Lactamaeon when he is in a good mood . After the sewing class , where I do n't belong , or the church choir where I am a stranger , it 's good to walk home with someone who can laugh and be silly or turn beautiful and make you cry , looking at the stars while he recites . " " You know , do n't you , now , that you made him up out of yourself  --  that you created him out of your own humor and your own beauty ? " Furii said gently . " Yes  --  I know now . " It was an admission that gave much pain . " When were you at last able to see this ? " " You mean with all my eyes ? " Furii nodded . " Well , maybe I always saw it , partly , far in the place where it was safe , but I guess it 's been getting nearer and nearer to me for a long time . Last week I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a choral setting of a poem by Horace , and when they sang it , I said , That was one of the few texts I know by heart all the way through . And Anterrabae said , Of course . And then we started the kind of banter  --  the kind you have when you are kidding and hurting someone at the same time . I said , Teach me mathematics , and they laughed , but they admitted at last that they could not
