WILLEM Adolf Visser ' t Hooft is to the World Council of Churches about what Dag Hammarskjold was to the U.N . As the Council 's General Secretary , he builds church unity by accenting common beliefs , by deprecating differences , by shunning extravagant or unripe measures . Yet a quiet faith that all Christians , including Roman Catholics , must eventually unite gives his life a clear direction . It is a just barely permissible joke among his closest friends to call Visser ' t Hooft " the Protestant Pope . " He replies with a wintry " I 'm not infallible " - which is a rueful recognition that his job is touchy and hard , but also a proud admission that he has succeeded in shaping the World Council into an important organization . <P> If this is the Ecumenical Century , it is fitting that the leading ecumenist was born in the first year of it . His father was a lawyer in the Dutch city of Haarlem ; the family name ( pronounced fisser toaft ) means " fisher at the head ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for his thin , sharp face , but now nicknamed Wim-was the gayest of three brothers , excelling at hockey and tennis , and good , though not brilliant , in school . His father was shocked when Wim said he was thinking of becoming a pastor . " You will have a hard life , and I doubt if you 'll like the salary you 'll get , " he said . Wim and his father made a deal : he was to study law and theology in alternate years . He found the law so dull and the theology so interesting that his father relented and let him go ahead with it . <P> A Polyglot Family . He took his doctorate at the State University of Leiden with a dissertation on the background of the social gospel in the U.S. But he was not ordained because the Remonstrant Church , to which he belonged , stipulated that all ministers must be pastors , and young Yisser ' t Hooft had been tapped by the late great U.S. ecumenist John R. Mott to become secretary of the Y.M.C.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his headquarters ever since , and having since been ordained in the Swiss Reformed Church , he preaches every now and then . He married fragile-looking Netherlander Henriette Philippine Jacoba Boddaert , with whom he has three children , all now grown and scattered throughout Europe . " The problem of an international family is language , " grins Wim . " When we get together , if the conversation begins in French someone will switch it to Dutch or German , someone else to English . " <P> From the Y.M.C.A. , Visser ' t Hooft moved to the World 's Student Christian Federation , and ten years later became General Secretary of the Provisional Committee that became the World Council of Churches at Amsterdam in 1948.
