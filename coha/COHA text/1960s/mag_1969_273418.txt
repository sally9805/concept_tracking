Died . Dr. Courtney C. Smith , 52 , president of Swarthmore College since 1953 and American secretary of the Rhodes Scholarships ; of a heart attack ; in his office on the eighth day of an Admissions Office sit-in by militant black students . A Harvard man ( ' 38 ) and Rhodes Scholar himself , Smith was one of the country 's youngest college presidents when he assumed office at the small , Quaker-founded liberal arts school .

When 20 black students staged the current sit-in to dramatize their demands for greater black enrollment and a black studies program , the usually imperturbable Smith began to despair . " We have lost something precious here at Swarthmore , " he said , " the feeling that force and disruptiveness are just not our way " ( see EDUCATION ) . <P> Died .

And from his drawing board came buildings for ten of the U.S. 's top industrial firms , six of its leading banking houses and five of its largest insurance companies , as well as plans for Los Angeles ' $34 million Music Center and the 275-acre Century City . All told , he was responsible for $4 billion worth of construction during his 40-year career . <P> Died .

The Austrian-born wigmaker established the House of Louis Feder , Inc. , in 1914 , created his famous " Tashay " ( he abhorred the term " toupee " ) and advertised it as " a hurricane-resisting hairpiece that can be combed and brushed , kept on in high winds and when swimming , and worn for weeks without removal . " By the time he retired in 1964 , his company had sold wigs to more than 100,000 happy clients . When someone asked who his most satisfied customer was , Feder tugged at his Tashay and cried , " Who else ? Me ! "
