To St. Louis boys , especially Catholic St. Louis boys , kicking a soccer ball around is as natural as yanking girls ' pigtails . A husky youngster might be asked what parish he belongs to , but more likely he will be asked what parish he plays for . While most of the nation is perfectly content to let soccer superiority rest in Sao Paulo or Liverpool or wherever , the Catholic Youth Council ( CYC ) in St. Louis sponsors about 447 teams with 20 to 30 players each , in addition to strong Catholic high school squads . The non-Catholics have joined the fun in recent years with public high school teams and playground programs , the biggest of which has more than 100 teams . This tradition started in the early 1800s but picked up around the turn of the century when robust prospective priests played the game as a diversion from seminary studies . After they were ordained they naturally taught soccer to the youths of their churches . // All of this is very handy for St. Louis University , a midtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer tournament in 1959 , was chiefly known in the sports pages as a ) the alma mater of All-America Basketball Player Ed Macauley and b ) the owner of a strange team nickname  --  Billikens . ( A Billiken is a squat comic figure , not a cross between a billy goat and a pelican . ) Today , glutted with home-grown talent , St. Louis U. is known as the country 's premier soccer school , winner of four out of the first six NCAA championships and a close contender the other two times . Last Saturday afternoon at Francis Field in St. Louis the Billikens won their fifth title in a close , rough game against Michigan State , a game that was decided by a penalty . // Yes , the opposition was Michigan State , the same populous Big Ten school that is sending an unbeaten football team to the Rose Bowl . The Spartans go for soccer in a big way , as is demonstrated by the fact that four of their best players are graduates of the CYC Leagues in St. Louis . MSU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Illinois , has enough money in his budget to pay tuition for 10 boys . He has a 4,000-seat soccer field with a scoreboard , healthy turf , good drainage and a press box . ( " Nothing in St. Louis like it , " he says . ) He can entice high school prospects with a magnificent campus that includes five swimming pools in one block and enough lighted tennis courts to supply all of Australia . // With such impressive assets , Kenney should be doing splendidly , and he is  --  except against St. Louis . Friday night he discussed the St. Louis-Michigan State rivalry . He seldom sleeps well on the eve of a big game , so he was relaxing as best he could in the dark cocktail lounge of the Congress Inn , sipping rum and Coca-Cola . " Once the game starts , I 'm all right , " he said , speaking in staccato bursts . " I do n't go out and hit anybody in the mouth , but I 'm a hard loser . This is our 10th year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them to St. Louis . " Twice St. Louis kicked his boys out of the NCAA playoffs with 2-0 victories . Earlier this season St. Louis came from behind in the fourth quarter to beat State 3-2 . For a man who places soccer above anything  --  even fishing trips to the wilds of Canada  --  such frustration is difficult to endure . // When someone mentioned that poor little St. Louis had no soccer scholarships and no fancy field , Kenney scoffed . " St. Louis will always have great soccer teams , " he said . " It 's a natural draw . " // Earlier Friday , while Kenney hurried around to find a whirlpool bath for some of his athletes , argued in vain to gain admission to Francis Field ( owned by Washington U. ) and conducted a light workout , St. Louis Coach Bob Guelker took things much easier . He had to give interviews , attend a luncheon with Kenney and pick up jangling telephones , but he seemed calm . Coaching the Billikens is a part-time job for him . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soccer Association and a partner in a sporting-goods company . He carefully watches promising soccer players from the diaper stage on up through the CYC age-group ranks and has all of those years to prepare the boys for competition at St. Louis U. The antitrust department should investigate him . // One of Guelker 's little Friday duties was an interview with Ed Macauley , that All-America basketball legend who is now a TV sports announcer in St. Louis . Macauley , one local Catholic boy who somehow bypassed soccer , feigned good-natured surprise at all the commotion over " this silly game . " He woefully admitted his own son played on a crack parish soccer team . // " St. Louis has no soccer scholarships , " Guelker confirmed . " The school is in the middle of a big , expansive building program . We may have spoiled our administrators by winning the NCAA the first year without scholarships . But they 're generous with the travel budget . This year we flew down to Miami on a charter . Every boy on our team is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . We like to play this game and we do n't like to be second-best . We 're not bitter about Michigan State taking St. Louis players . We 're just glad they can get a free education . " // St. Louis U. and Michigan State did not waltz unmolested into the final game of the NCAA tournament . At Fairgrounds Park last Thursday night they had to fight their way past Army and Navy in semifinal games . State played Army in the opener and the Billikens met defending champion Navy in the main event . The night was cold and the lights were dim , but 5,500 spectators jammed the inadequate stands . Others , unable to get seats , lined the field 's boundaries . It was a surprisingly large crowd , for even in St. Louis soccer usually is not much of a gate attraction . People play the game but do not necessarily pay to watch others play it . This time they turned out . // The Spartans beat Army 3-1 , coasting at the end , and it was just about an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelke , a sophomore outside left from St. Louis . The assist was credited to stocky Guy Busch , another St. Louis sophomore . Busch himself kicked the other two State goals , his 23rd and 24th of the season , virtually assuring him All-America honors at center forward . Busch was a leading scorer on a CYC team that won the national junior title . // On paper , St. Louis University had a harder chore in playing Navy , unbeaten for two years . The Middies had beaten Guelker 's team in the semis last season 2-1 ; the Billikens remembered they had been pushed around somewhat in that game and came out battling this time . The game was scoreless until the last few seconds of the first quarter when Navy kicked a goal . It was disallowed . The timer had pulled the trigger before the score , but his gun had not fired until he had pulled it the third time . Judging by the ensuing furor , you would have thought somebody had called John Paul Jones a landlubber. // The silent shot sunk Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the way was one a Billiken defenseman accidentally deflected into his own net . St. Louis won 3-1 , led by the tricky mid-field ball-handling of Carl Gentile ( pronounced Jen-tilly ) , a little guy who , if his ears were pointed , could serve as a model for the Billiken symbol . He and a speedy Irishman , Pat McBride , were superb at bringing the ball through opposition kickers . Gentile kicked one of the goals and assisted on the two others . // The slogan for St. Louis thus became " 12 in a row and one to go . " Coach Guelker had never had an undefeated and untied season despite the four national championships . He did not get very daring in his pregame analysis , dropping such original asides as " this is anybody 's game , " and " both teams are well-conditioned . " Gene Kenney played it cool , too . " It 's a pleasure to come to St. Louis , " he told a luncheon audience . " It 's a great soccer town . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree . " Sweetness and light . // The best soccer town turned up an estimated 8,500 fans at Francis Field , complete with pretty girl cheerleaders dressed in white who did not have much chance to lead cheers because , darn it , the action is continuous in soccer . No nice girl-watching time-outs . Ed Macauley drank a soda pop in the press box and allowed as how he still thought it was a lot of foolishness . There was a bell to be rung , a timer 's pistol guaranteed to fire at the first hint of a trigger tug , and soccer-loving priests who remembered their seminary days . // Coach Kenney , whose team had not been allowed on the premises the day before , brought his boys out early to poke around , getting acquainted with a bare spot here , a thick tuft there and a bump over yonder . Then he took them back into the dressing room for a while before bringing them out for good . He hoped they would think they were in familiar surroundings . Kenney has Turks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student in engineering on his squad . He has to be , and is , a good psychologist. // For this big game Kenney had George Janes from Cincinnati and Detroit playing goalie . Janes was a front liner as a soph and junior but took the goalie job this year to help the team . // The first quarter was scoreless . The Billikens seemed to dominate with their fine short-passing game , again featuring McBride and Gentile , who can do things with their sensitive feet that some basketball guards can not do with their hands . Michigan State 's Guy Busch had a good angle on a free kick but was too high . Twice there was almost a brawl and once the referees , imported from neutral Chicago , brought the ball back to the center of the field because of ungentlemanly conduct by both sides . // St. Louis scored in the second quarter when Gentile booted the ball across the field , and Jay Moore deflected it into the net with his cranium , a heady play especially favored by Moore . But Jay was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time St. Louis ' Jack Gilsinn was doing a good job of guarding Guy Busch , who can kick like a mule with either foot . // The game-breaking and , for State , heartbreaking penalty occurred in the third quarter . A Spartan defenseman tripped Pat McBride in the never-never land , the rectangular territory marked outside the goal . This gave St. Louis a penalty kick from 12 yards out , with just the poor goalie , George Janes , facing the kicker . It was as if Jimmy Brown was given the football on the 12 and one poor soul was stationed between him and the goal line . Protecting the 24-foot-by-8-foot goal is next to impossible . Gentile was picked by St. Louis to try the kick and he made it , sneaking it into the left corner beyond the diving Janes 's fingertips . // Surprisingly , a State defenseman was called for shoving in the penalty zone just minutes later , but this time Gentile was wide right on the penalty kick . There was no more scoring , although McBride tried a sideways right-footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // In the last minute the Spartans were fighting desperately to regain control of the ball so they could get one more try for a tie and thus force the game into overtime . The excitement even got the best of Ed Macauley , who was half out of his press-box chair for most of the fourth quarter . The game almost turned into a full-scale Mississippi riverfront brawl in that wild last minute , but the referees and coaches joined forces and broke it up in time . // " It was a fitting final , " said phrase-maker Bob Guelker after the final gun . " Break up the Yankees , " yelled some soccer enthusiast ( probably Macauley ) . // Spartan Coach Kenney walked up to Guelker , gave him a perfunctory handshake and turned away quickly , his lips set in a thin , bitter line . He did not growl , " Wait until next year , " but he must have been tempted . In 1966 his varsity will be packed with nine boys from St. Louis . Maybe that will be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
