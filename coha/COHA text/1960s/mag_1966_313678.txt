Lieut . Colonel Seldon Edner . <P> First Lieuts . George Smith and Leland Williams . <P> First Lieut . Remer Harding and Staff Sergeant William Goodwin . <P> Lieut . Colonels Alfred Medendorp and Frank Lynn . <P> Major Rudolf Anderson . <P> S James Davis . <P> Lyndon Johnson 's extraordinary honor roll , from the first American killed fighting Communism in Greece in 1949 to the first American to die in South Viet Nam in 1961 , was a fitting reminder of the role in which the U.S. , like it or not , has been cast since the end of World War II. *It was particularly apt at a time when the nation was involved in its biggest and most bitterly disputed venture since Korea . In South Viet Nam , that involvement led last week to outbursts of anti-Americanism as students put the U.S. consulate in Hue to the torch and hoisted the Vietnamese flag . Nine Buddhist monks and nuns , women and teen-agers burned themselves alive to protest the U.S. presence and its support of Premier Nguyen Cao Ky and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. world involvement were clearly on the President 's mind as he called the roll at Arlington on a knoll overlooking the Potomac . " The conflict in Viet Nam , " he confessed , " is confusing for many of our people . " Yet , strangely enough , the President himself has contributed to that confusion . For weeks now , Administration policymakers on Viet Nam have seemed obsessed , to the exclusion of almost everything else , with the Buddhist crisis . To be sure , the U.S. can hardly ignore the bitter feud between Premier Ky and the <P> Buddhists . But by his preoccupation with South Viet Nam 's pagoda politics , the President has given the dangerous impression that the effort against the Viet Cong is also in disarray . <P> As far as the 260,000 U.S. servicemen in Viet Nam are concerned , that is scarcely the case . Since the Buddhist demonstrations first erupted in March , U.S. forces have suffered more dead ( 994 ) than they did in the previous comparable period ( 962 ) . But the war appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of demonstrations and burnings , would suggest . In the air , U.S. Air Force F-105 Thunderchiefs last week streaked over a big ordnance complex at Yen Bay , 80 miles northwest of Hanoi , and leveled it in the biggest , most destructive single strike of the war . On the ground , 1st Cavalry troopers reported killing more than 450 Viet Cong in Operation Crazy Horse northwest of An Khe , and a brigade of the 25th Infantry Division counted 371 Communist dead after a battle near Pleiku during Operation Paul Revere . " If you look at this war 's military aspect without regard to such political factors as instability in Saigon , or hesitancy in Washington , " wrote Columnist Joseph Alsop last week , " you have to conclude that the situation is full of promise .
