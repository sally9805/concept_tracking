txt Boycott-Eve Rally Brings Deep South Flavor to City The men and women behind New York 's school boycott ended their weeks of preparation last night with a rally that ) was like a victory celebration Their speakers denounced the Board of Education , its presi- ' dent , James B. Donovan , reluctant white liberals and , 1 occasionally , white persons in general . The tenor of the meeting , which was attended by more ' than 1,000 persons , was reminiscent of rallies in the Deep South . The gathering , at Concord Baptist Church in Brooklyn , was all the more remarkable because not one national civil rights leader sat on the stage or made a speech . The boycott sponsors have called their movement one that is truly being run by the people . Freedom Songs Sung The audience sang " We Shall , Overcome , " " We Shall Not Be Moved " and other freedom ) songs . Members of the audience of Negroes , whites and Puerto ! Ricans shouted words of encouragement at the speakers . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd that what happened today would be significant to the white leaders of the nation . " They know , " he said , " that this is the black capital of the Western world and whatever we do will be felt in every hamlet and . . . " The remainder of his words were lost in applause . The Rev. Milton A. Galamison , leader of the boycott , told the audience not to be frightened by newspaper criticism of the demonstration . " Let us ! think instead , " he said " about rescuing our children " from the ' perils of segregated education . Benefit of the Doubt " Even if you do n't understand the situation , " he added , " give us the benefit of the doubt tomorrow morning . " The Rev. Gardner Taylor , a Brooklyn minister , drew an ovation when he said the troublemakers in the city were the " slick-talking , foot-dragging , excuse-making mass segregationists . " He left no doubt that he was referring , at least in part , to the Board of Education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boycott headquarters , preparations drew to an end . For some , // the quiet there was unnerving . ' For others , it was ordinary . " Remember , " one veteran organizer of demonstrations told , the others , " it was like this right before the March , too . " . She meant . the March on Washington , which last Aug. 28 , resulted in the arrival of more . than 200,000 demonstrators in , the nation 's capital in peaceful insistence for full civil ? rightsj In many ways the New York boycott , expected to last one ' day and to keep thousands of children out of the city 's schools , has been modeled on the Washington effort . Mr. Rustin , who , directed the march , has an ' office in Siloam 's Sunday school : MOM . His desk , devoid of any butj the most utilitarian accessories , i was surrounded last night by1 volunteer workers in the last stages of preparing for the boycott . Some of them planned to , stay through the night to an- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom songs . Public Support Asked Miss Vivian Casey , a parttime model whose striking face ; sells toothpaste to readers ofl Ebony magazine , was hoarse but still working at one of nine , telephones . Beside her , a 19-year-olds white student from Boston UniH versity , Barbara Rosenbloom , was at a telephone too . Miss , Rosenbloom , of Westport , Conn. , , went down lists supplied by labor unions , civil rights groups and churches , calling people and astking their support . " I tell them that because New ! York City schools are running ' ; on the separate-but-equal policy ! of the South , the schools are not ; equal , " she said . " I tell them that we are try- ; ing to get the Negro kids here ; into the schools for two rea-1 sons . First , I tell them , we ! want to raise the level of edu-1 cation in the city schools . Sec- ; ond , I tell them we want to create a positive racial attitude , so : the kids 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tell them ; that if they keep them , apart , they 'll hate each other without ever knowing each other . " The work tables at Siloam ; which is in the center of the Bedford-Stuyvesant section , were covered with mimeographed lists , statements , plans , timetables and overflowing ash trays . A dozen venerable , rented typewriters stood quietly , no longer needed . Those whose work was finished leaned back in steel chairs and smoked , drank coffee from soggy paper cups , and . made Ismail talk . Two volunteers , a young man and a young woman , kissed each other from time to time .
