The Rev. James Robert Orr was finishing a rugged five-year tour of duty sowing the Protestant gospel on the stony soil of Brazil 's Parana state , near the Argentine border . Now the gaunt , 59-year-old Baptist was heading home for Canada . With his wife and their three youngest children , he jeeped into Laranjeiras do Sul ( pop . 2,000 ) and went to a local doctor for certificates of vaccination . Told that the Orrs had all been vaccinated six or seven years earlier , the doctor perfunctorily issued " certificates of immunity . " <P> Three weeks later , just as perfunctorily , health officers at New York 's Idlewild International Airport took the certificates at face value . They gave Missionary Orr a card on which was written : " As a precaution against introduction of smallpox : If you should develop suspicious symptoms of illness ( such as chills , fever , weakness , loss of appetite , diarrhea ) within the next seven to sixteen days , present this card promptly to a private physician or to health officers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word smallpox was in large letters . Orr pocketed the card and promptly forgot it . As a result , most of North and South America and parts of Europe waited anxiously last week while hundreds of health officers tracked down thousands of the traveling Orrs ' fellow passengers and casual contacts to have them revaccinated . For one of the Orr children had carried smallpox from continent to continent . <P> Flu or Chickenpox ? Rare in the U.S. and Canada for almost half a century , and unknown there since 1947 , smallpox is endemic in Brazil ; 2,644 cases were reported in 1960 , and 1,411 in 1961 . Near Laranjeiras the Orrs had visited a ranch where children were down with the pox , but nobody paid much heed or knew what kind. * By the time the Orrs got to bustling , ultramodern Sao Paulo , 400 miles away , James William Orr , 14 , complained of fever and a sore throat . A local doctor diagnosed influenza and hopefully dosed him vith medicine . The feverish boy lay around Viracopos airport for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Comet 4 jet to Idlewild . <P> From Idlewild the Orrs taxied to Manhattan 's Grand Central Terminal ( the driver tried to overcharge them ) . In the busy , navelike waiting room , with its constant turnover of travelers , Jimmy Orr lay on a bench for almost seven hours sweating out a train for Toronto . While his family went to a nearby lunch counter for a snack , a motherly Negro tried to make the boy more comfortable . Then the five Orrs boarded the North Star , and sat up all night as the coach made seemingly unlimited stops . As they neared Toronto , Jimmy opened his shirt , looked at the itching red spots , and said : " Dad , I think it 's chickenpox . "
