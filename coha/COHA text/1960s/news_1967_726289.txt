txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 42 Letters to the Editor of The Times Port Authority 's Role To the Editor : I should like to comment on your April 21 editorial and Port Authority Chairman S. Sloan Colt 's letter to you in reference to the proposed Trade Center . Regardless of whether conditions have changed or the proposal has changed , the Port Authority 's concept of the Trade Center should never have been accepted ? by the Commissioners , by the Governors , by The Times , or by the public . Contrary to Mr. Colt 's statement , that ' ' . ? . the Port Authority did not even study the feasibility of a world trade center until it had been requested to do so in 1961 by the Governors of New York and New Jersey and the Mayor of the City of New York , " the authority had a section in its Port Development Department engaged in a feasibility study in 1960 in respect to the authority 's avowed purpose to increase trade coming through the Port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be insignificant . This has been and will continue to be the most telling point that can be made against it . The time has come for someone or some agency to begin rethinking the Port Authority 's role . The authority is a creature of the 1920 's . While this alone is no reason why it should be considered less relevant for today 's problems , the conflict over the Trade Center raises the question of relevance . I with fourteen others was a prochict of the authority 's recruiting program in 1960 . Involvement With Rails In the mind of many trainees , the transportation problem in New York , of which the railroads were and are such an important part , should have presented the authority with its greatest opportunity and challenge . But we discovered that the organization entertained an almost neurotic fear of becoming entangled with railroad problems . We asked questions , but we were ignored , summarily put down , or regarded , as troublemakers . The retorts were that the Port Authority would wash away if it got involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Hudson Tubes deal came around , the word was that this subsidy operation would get the authority out of the railroads at least cost . When the Trade Center gathered momentum ( instigated by David Rockefeller in 1960 ) , the word was that soon the money would be tied up and safe . It became increasingly obvious to us that the authority was doing its best to ignore the port 's greatest problem . Its aces-inthe-hole were a charter written in the 1920 's and a number of public relations men running around to " educate " local editors . The essence of the problem is that the Port of New York Authority , like the New Jersey Turnpike Authority , is fed with substantial funds which should be mobilized to meet the truly pressing problems of the port , It Is plowing back millions of dollars into projects which , however valuable they may be in themselves , may be clearly inferior to others . The political status of the authority was designed to counteract a problem which may be minor relative to these resultant problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this Trade Center conflict , there will be many other stupid proposals and a much greater misallocation of resources . WM . FLEISCIIMAN Ann Arbor , Mich. , May 1 , 1967 ? Mr. Hebert 's Advice To the Editor : The House Armed Services Committee wants the Justice Department to prosecute those who counsel draft evasion . To pursue that end , Representative F. Edward Hdbert , Democrat of Louisiana , said , " Let 's forget the First Amendment . " According to The Times ( May 6 ) , his suggestion was supported by some other committee members . Is the Constitution of the United States a set of minor guidelines , to be followed or ignored according to our impulses in critical situations ? Representative Hdbert 's exhortation would seem to use it that way , in which case it would be entirely consistent to disdain , arbitrarily and peremptorily , any part of the Constitution which does not suit one 's purpose at a given time . In the heat of crisis , any article or amendment could be discarded , including no doubt Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators and Representatives . . . shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution .... " One could logically expect to find this clause as well as the First Amendment in Representative Hdbert 's wastebasket . Knowing that our Constitution is one of those hardy anvils which have worn out many a hammer , we can gratefully anticipate that it is likely to survive any new round of blows struck against it . At the same time , it is shocking to hear counsel for the overthrow of a venerable and revered clause by a Representative who has taken an oath to uphold and defend it . WILLIAM BROWER Assistant Director of Speech Princeton Theological Seminary Princeton , N. J. , May 6 , 1967 ? Autopsy Procedures in Israel To the Editor : In a letter to The Times ( April 18 ) Mrs. Charlotte Jacobson , national president of Hadassah , accused our committee of slandering the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem . If this be the case , we would welcome the opportunity to present our evidence in any legal action Hadassah may care to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem follows procedures in autopsies within the framework of the laws of Israel . " This is precisely the point . Israeli law in this matter is so permissive and its enforcement so lax that any hospital may virtually do as it pleases  --  and usually does . Our appeal was directed to the Israeli Government  --  for legal action  --  and to hospitals ( including Hadassah , ' as the pacesetter )  - -  to exercise ' voluntary restraints and not perform autopsies against the wishes of the deceased and/or . his kin . " It is the only hospital in Israel , " continues Mrs. Jacobson , " that also has entered into . agreements with the rabbinate on this matter . " Not so , We have a copy of a letter from the , office of the Chief Rabbinate in Israel , denying that any such agreement exists . " No autopsy , " writes Mrs. Jacobson , " is performed at Hadassah Hospital against the ex- , pressed objection of the family of the decedent , or of the patient himself , except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as homicide . " , , The news story in The Times , : of May 4 would seem to con-. tradict this statement . ( Rabbi ) HERTZ FRANKEL Chairman ' American Committee for Safeguarding Human Dignity in Israel New York , May 4 , 1967 ? For Ban on Autos To the Editor : I am very much in accord , with the April 19 editorial in The Times on midtown parking ' garages . As a resident of the midtown area I can testify that the garages in the aide streets con- ' tribute added congestion caused by the delay in entering and the delay in pulling out , which blocks the street already over- : . crowded with traffic . It is my opinion that effort - should be made to keep private cars out of the city rather than . to encourage any increase . The , problem can be best solved by wholesale transportation from * points on the periphery of the city . DoUGLAS L. ELLIMAN New York , April 19 , 1967          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
