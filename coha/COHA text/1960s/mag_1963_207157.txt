Designing to appeal most to the most , NBC has discovered a somewhat ultimate weapon . Ram a Hollywood movie into prime time ; fire one , fire two , and pom-the nearest enemy network goes down without a bubble . <P> <P> CBS , for example , has been cruising along in the early part of Monday evenings , comfortably ahead of all opposition with To Tell the Truth , I 've Got a Secret , The Lucy Show and The Danny Thomas Show . NBC was running a poor third with It 's a Man 's World and Saints and Sinners . It was TV show against TV show , and CBS was tops . <P> So NBC rolled in the big cannon : a new series called Monday Night at the Movies . The first show , with Robert Mitchum , was The Enemy Below ( 1957 ) , the superbly worked out battle between a U.S. destroyer-escort skipper and the captain of a Nazi submarine fathoms beneath him . <P> <P> With that one movie , NBC blew CBS out of the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly well in the same hours with The Dakotas , The Rifleman and Stoney Burke . The following week , as Gregory Peck went out manhunting in 20th Century-Fox 's The Bravados ( 1958 ) , CBS lost again . Then the next week Mitchum was back in Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison ( 1957 ) . The mere thought of Mitchum now starts small fires at CBS . NBC 's Hollywood movies were obviously as superior to CBS 's TV shows as the old ironclads were to the wooden gunboats.
