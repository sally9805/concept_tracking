Stop Train 349 . From West Berlin , a sealed U.S. military train rolls by night through the Soviet-occupied East German Republic . Destination : Frankfurt . Its passengers are the usual assemblage of harassed or abrasive or mysterious strangers . Most objectionable of the lot is Jos Ferrer as a famous newsman with a nose for international incidents . Sure enough , an incident occurs when a French nurse ( Nicole Courcel ) helps a frightened refugee to jump aboard the train . Thus a U.S. lieutenant ( Sean Flynn ) , commanding officer of the train , is caught between the quadripartite treaty and the Brotherhood of Man . When the Soviets uncouple the engine at the border station of Marienborn , demanding that the prisoner be surrendered-well , what 's a fellow to do ? <P> Instead of doing anything , Flynn just stands there . Meanwhile Stop Train 349 , which might have made a sizzling topical melodrama , is sidetracked by flaccid direction , routine performances , and a script that turns people into points of view . The biggest jolt is pitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist menace , and letting the Reds get the best of it . In this generation , Hollywood 's good guys appear to be all buckle and no swash.
