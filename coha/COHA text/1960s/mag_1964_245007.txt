According to the men who ousted him , Nikita Khrushchev was feverishly prone to " harebrained scheming . " Last week the 330-man Soviet Central Committee offered what it hoped would be a cure for that particular strain of political tularemia . Meeting for the first time since it gave Khrushchev the boot , it ordered a top-to-bottom renovation of the Russian Communist Party structure - and in the process assured itself of more internal chaos , discontent and power struggles . <P> Fix Needed . What the new Russian leaders are trying to correct is a system started two years ago when Khrushchev split the party bureaucracy into a brace of inevitably competitive economic units : agricultural and industrial . K. hoped that a bifurcated bureaucracy would give his underlings more chance to specialize and thereby help production . But he was only falling victim to a political extension of Parkinson 's Law : though the number of bureaucrats was doubled , each man felt bound to covet his opposite number 's authority and neglect his own job . <P> To fix all this , the Central Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikita and a specialist in party organization .

Once Nikita 's favorite whipping boy-he was publicly tongue-lashed by K. for failing to grow enough corn in the Ukraine , regained favor by doubling Ukrainian grain sales the next year-Podgorny resembles his former patron physically , including moon face and broad peasant shoulders . But he is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party Presidium , Dmitry Stepanovich Polyansky , 47 , is just as cool but not quite as stiff . A bright , backslapping opportunist , Polyansky shares his birthday with the Bolshevik Revolution , has been working quietly behind the scenes since Khrushchev 's ouster ( during which he delivered the recitation of Nikita 's agricultural sins ) . <P> Either man could move to the top in the months ahead , but both will have to keep an eye on a handful of ambitious apparatchiki who were elevated to positions of new authority . Among them : <P>
