A MATTER OF LUCK I T WAS eleven o'clock in the morning , and M. Mawar had just got out of bed in green silk pajamas . An immense , a monstrous figure , he seemed to overflow the fake Louis XVI chair . His belly hung low between his thighs and his ears stood out on each side of his head , while a twelve-carat diamond ring sank into the flesh of his little finger . You may , if no others have been available , have bought Mawar cigarettes . They are short , flat , and Egyptian . They smell of hay ; and you may well have said : " They 're not as bad as all that . " You may even have read , in an absentminded sort of way , the lines printed on the package under the gold medals awarded at International Exhibitions in the nineteenth century : Manufactured in Alexandria , Brussels , and Zurich . Make sure that the signature Alawar Brothers is on every box . Imitations are liable to prosecution . But it is unlikely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a M. Mawar , the heir to the two gentlemen in fezzes , whose profiles add distinction to the center of the lid . But there is a M. Mawar of flesh and ( it must be said ) fat . Every day of his life , he benefits from a small royalty paid him by some five hundred thousand smokers spread over the world . He spends two months every year in a luxurious suite in the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo and , during the course of his stay , regularly leaves several millions of francs on the gambling tables . Huge bunches of lilies were spreading their sweetly suffocating scent ; the sun was warming the windows of the corner drawing-room on the third floor , from which could be seen the gardens , the Casino , and the sea . On the low table in front of M. Mawar was a curiously shaped mahogany box from which his white and pointed hand , that looked as if it was molded in lard , was drawing cards one after another , pairing them , turning them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And at every pair , M. Mawar sighed deeply . For he was winning . " A hand eleven times running ! " he said to himself in a low voice . " And it never , never happens in the evening . It 's really too exaspera ting . " He knew that he would enter the Casino at about eleven o'clock that evening , his stomach importantly swelling his dinner jacket , while the employees bowed particularly low . He would take his reserved place at the big table ; a servant would push his chair under him , and another place a whiskey and soda at his left hand , while 78 A MATTER OF LUCK the money-changer placed a pile of chips in front of him . He would hear the whispering : " Mawar , it 's Mawar , Mawar 's here . . . " People would gather round to watch him play . He would note expressions of astonishment and covetousness on the faces of pretty women in decollet6 dresses . And then , as yesterday , the day before and every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another five or worse , and his opponent would turn up a nine . The worst of it was that Mawar 's mistress this year took no account of his fortunes at the Casino . She was excited by pearl necklaces and diamond bracelets but was bored at the gambling table . Neither cards nor roulette meant anything to her . She was young and delicious ; but quite maddening . N AWAR pushed the baccarat shoe to one side ; and tried to forget his imaginary opponents and magnificent cards . He had been concentrating so hard on his obsession , that he had failed to grasp just what the porter was trying to explain on the telephone . He had merely replied : " Send him up . " And now the man was standing before him . But M. Mawar had no need to raise his eves above the man 's waist He knew why he was here . The worn cloth of his trousers , even the way he held his knees , were sufficient indication . He neither raised his eyes nor uttered a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , read it with bored indifference , and dropped it on the floor . He turned his head away toward the window , and his left cheek fell into three rolls of fat on the collar of his pajamas . The slowness of M. Mawar 's movements very trying to the man standing there . He about fifty years old , frail and weak in appearance , and had that air of obsequious humility which is apt to result from long years of adversity . He was wearing a mourning band on his sleeve . He had spent sixty francs on a close shave and on having his single wispy lock of hair oiled into place across his bald head . He had wanted to look his best . He could still feel the smarting of the razor on his cheeks ; he would have a rash for the next forty-eight hours . And M. Mawar had not even looked at his face ! The little man was very unhappy . He felt as if his clothes were too big for him , and sweat was trickling down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him because of his anxiety , and he had difficulty in preventing his hands from trembling . Still gazing out of the window at the palm trees in the garden and the facade of the Casino , M. Mawar , his monumental fat quivering with anger , said in a sharp , high-pitched voice : " I do n't know why my friend Oudry sent you to me . He knows perfectly well I hate letters of recommendation . I have n't got a job for you ! I 'm neither an employment agency nor a charitable organization . If I listened to everyone , I 'd have two hundred people waiting at my door . I can do nothing for you , nothing at all . " The room with its windows and lilies , its carpets and rococo furniture seemed to reel about the little clerk , and M. Mai  --  ar , with his slack flesh and gleaming carapace , seemed to him for an instant . Like some monstrous green insect inside his cage of windows , hugely magnified under the lenses of a microscope . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock of hair and revealed a large purple birthmark on his bald skull . It had an odd shape . rather like an egg , or perhaps like an imperfectly closed zero . It might have been the symbol of his destiny , a rubber stamp with which Fate had marked him at birth in violet ink . " I understand . I can see it 's no use persisting , " he murmured , " I 'm just out of luck , that 's all . " M. Maw ar consented to look at him at last with his dark . gleaming , protuberant eyes . " That 's right , my friend . It 's never any use persisting . " The little man bowed vaguely and went to the door . For a moment there was a sort of void in Mawar 's mind . Then , through it , flickered the baccarat shoe , the violet zero on the little clerk 's head , and the sound of the last words they had said . which were still ringing in his ears . Suddenly , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage , he cried : " Hey ! Come back ! " The little man turned . " What 's your name ? " Mawar asked . " Florentin . " " Is that your surname or your Christian name ? " " My surname . On my father 's side , my family were of Italian origin , Florentini . . " " All right , all right , that 's of no importance . " Maurice Drnon ' . s newest novel published in th.is country is " The She-Wolf of France , " the fifth in a . series of historical novels about medieval France . Mr. Druon won the Prix Goncourt for an earlier novel , " La Grande Farnille . " The translator of " A Matter of Luck " is Humphrey Hare . The fat millionaire stared at the little man 's gray , pimply face , and the scrawny neck in the ill-starched semi-hard collar . " Honest , " thought Mawar . " Certainly honest . Not intelligent , of course , he could hardly be both . " He never made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them attentively for a moment . " Well . Monsieur Florentin , do you want to earn five thousand francs a day ? " " Oh , Monsieur ! " cried the other . " I 'm sorry , but . . " " No , no , I 'm not joking . But I shall require you at night , only at night . " Such a salary as that caused M. Florentin to wonder whether he was required for some vile and illicit purpose . There was so much gossip concerning the depraved pleasures of the very rich ! Five thousand francs a day , 150,000 francs a month , seemed utterly insane , when all he had hoped for , after twelve desperate weeks in search of a job , had been twenty thousand francs a month . Either the duties required of him were of an appalling nature , or there roust he some mistake . He felt quite stunned . " A day . . . " Florentin repeated in bewilderment . " Yes . And your duties will be far from difficult . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the fat man . " You will come and meet me every evening at ten o'clock wherever I happen to be dining : here , at the Sporting . or in a restaurant . I shall give you two hundred thousand francs You will go to the Casino . . . Have you ever been to the Casino ? Have you ever gambled ? " he asked , suddenly aware of M. Florentin 's astonishment . " Of course not . It 's quite all right , just what I expected . You will go to the Casino then , and you will lose the two hundred thousand francs . You will lose them , do you understand ? You will lose them as quickly as possible and by any method you please . And it 'll do you no good to cheat and put some of the money in your own pocket . As you may well imagine , shall take steps to make sure that you really do gamble with the whole two hundred thousand And then , when you 've done , you 'll come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've lost the lot . " 1 shall give you your five thousand francs and you 'll be free till next day . That 's the job ? Like it ? " Mawar no longer seemed to Florentin like a monstrous beetle , but rather like some Oriental god of carved jade with mysterious eyes . Was he involved with some millionaire lunatic ? What could it all mean ? And yet , there were lots of people , doctors for instance , who battened on the eccentric and the crazy . " Very well , Monsieur Mawar , thank you very much , " he said . " When do 1 start ? " " Tonight , " said the fat man . F I. ORENTIN made his way into the gambling room . He was struck by the height of the ceiling , the melancholy opulence of the bronze and corpse-green decorations , the deathly hush that lay over this place that seemed half temple and half morgue , and by the atmosphere of nervous tension that seemed to emanate from the several hundreds of people who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One might well have wondered whether chance was being worshiped here or merely committed to the grave . Impassive , black-clothed men were performing mysterious rites with the precision of surgeons , carving incisively into piled lengths of chips long as intestines on the green cloths of the tables ; while voices , sonorous and indifferent as archdeacons ' , announced mysteriously : " Rica ne va plus . Le sept . Impair , rouge et ? longue . Six cents Louis a In banque . Avec la table . " Balls turned in circular ebony troughs , cards were laid out in long rows as if in hasty divination of a future which seemed to content no one when it came , wooden shoes passed from hand to hand about a table which , as if at some unsuccessful seance , the participants seemed unable to turn . Everyone could apparently select his own cult , his particular Black Mass , his individual sorcery . For some time Florentin wandered among the silent crowd , trying vainly to understand and initiate himself ; meanwhile he read the notices announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes and giving people chips in return , which they then threw on the tables . He followed their example , and held out his wad of notes . " Chips of what value ? " asked the moneychanger . " I do n't mind . Small perhaps . " He was given a heap of assorted 80 A MATTER OF LUCK gathered up the chip with many others . Florentin gave a start of surprise and disappointment . But then he thought : " It 's all right , I 'm supposed to lose . " He noticed that the humpbacked woman was given back her chip with a few more too . He shrugged his shoulders , moved to another table , threw down a chip marked " 5,000 , " and saw it raked away like the first . He could not help feeling rather uncomfortable about it . For a time , he went on doing the same thing , though the whole performance was a mystery to him and he felt as if he were wandering through a dream , some curious scene of utter unreality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused in his mind . Surely this was all a nightmare ; humpbacked women , unreal croupiers ? He was simply dreaming that he had gone into a casino and was gambling . He was dreaming that a Buddha in green pajamas had ordered him to Jose . As his coat-pockets began to empty , Florentin felt that curiously insistent , nightmare terror of being drawn to the edge of a precipice by an inevitable but incomprehensible force . Could it really be true that the green Buddha was going to pay him for losing two hundred thousand francs ? Or was there some hideous plot behind it all ? Were the bank notes forged ? Would he be arrested on the way out ? Or perhaps the Buddha would suddenly rise before him , terrible and avenging , reproach him with losing each minute a whole week 's food for a family , and attack him with a croupier 's rake . And then Florentin would wake up in his damp sheets , and it would all be over . He felt his pockets . They were empty . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casino ; the lamps cast a soft light over the palm trees in the gardens . The Milky Way looked like a fisherman 's net full of bright little fish spread across the sky . As he made his way toward the restaurant where M. Mawar had told him to meet him , Florentin felt even more ill at ease than he had that morning at their first interview . For ten minutes he walked up and down in front of the door , not daring to go in . The doorman stared at him suspiciously . In the end he managed to pull himself together . M. Mawar was wearing a splendid white dinner jacket ; his stomach hung low between his thighs ; his ears stuck out arrogantly on each side of his head ; and his diamond was glittering on his little finger . He had finished dining long ago and now was drinking champagne with a few friends . Beside him sat a young woman with abored expression and a mechanical smile ; her neck and ears were laden with pearls ; and from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant . His legs felt weak under him and his mouth dry . " Well ? " Mawar asked . " I 've done it , Monsieur Mawar , I 've lost the lot , " Florentin replied . He dared not raise his eyes from the ground . " You 've taken your time about it ! " said Mawar . " However , it 's only the first day . No doubt , you 'll manage better tomorrow . " He took five thousand francs from his pocket and handed them to Florentin . " There you are . Tomorrow at the same time . Good night . " T H E next day , M. Florentin took no more than fifty minutes to complete his task . And on the following days he made even better time . He learned just as much as he required of the technique of gambling , for he very soon realized that the resufts demanded of him could be ensured quite quickly and with very little trouble . It was all over in a quarter of an hour , twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of shots at trente et quarante , and a banco or two . He divided his capital into chips of five , ten , and fifty thousand . If , on occasion , he doubled his stake on an even chance , he left it for the next turn of the wheel and the croupier 's rake inevitably gathered it in . It seemed both easy and sure . He had then only to walk a short way through the bright , warm night . " Good evening , Monsieur Mawar . " " Good evening , my friend , here arc your five thousand francs . See you tomorrow . " " See you tomorrow , Monsieur Mawar . " It was a well-paid job . Nevertheless , M. Floren tin soon discovered how easy it was to live at the rate of five thousand francs a day , particularly in Monte Carlo . He took a room in a decent hotel , ate his fill , enjoyed the leisure of his days , and bought himself some shirts and a new suit , which was at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recovered a certain vitality and now covered the violet zero on his skull with greater success . It never occurred to him to keep a penny of the money Mawar gave him every day . The two sums , the two hundred thousand francs and the five thousand francs , belonged , as far as he was concerned , to different currencies . The five thou-sand francs was ordinary money for common use , the sort of money people used in business and paid you for your work . But the two hundred thousand francs had , as it were , a different consistency ; it bore no relation either to your work or to your needs . It was a curious , a fabulous abstraction : gambling money ! At the Casino , the little man with the funny luck of hair , who looked like a bailiff 's clerk in a hurry to make an inventory before the chattels were seized , said not a word to anyone . changed two hundred thousand francs , lost them every night , and went off rubbing his hands , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a place so accustomed to the eccentric , the obsessed , and the crazy . Besides , everyone secretly hated him . The gamblers felt he brought bad luck . As for the croupiers , they had noticed that M. Florentin , whenever he did happen to have a lucky break , never left anything for /e personnel , which gamblers normally do , not from generosity but because it brings good luck . T H I S had been going on for precisely twenty-three days , when M. Florentin happened to throw ten thousand francs en plein on number 34 . It might just as well have landed on the 32 or the 35 . It mattered not at all . NI . Florentin had already turned away and was moving off , so he failed to hear the croupier announce : " Le trente-quatre . " The croupier called after him : " Monsieur , it 's yours , you 've won . " " Very well , leave it on , " Florentin said automatically . " It ca n't be done , Monsieur . The maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florentin was handed 360,000 francs . He placed another chip for ten thousand on the same number . " Bien or va plus . . . le trente-quatre , " announced the croupier for the second time . " Oh ! " sighed the crowd round the table in stupefaction , and Florentin received another 360,000 francs . M. Florentin was quite taken aback . Wondering how to lose his winnings as quickly as possible , he went to the trente et qvaronte table , where the maximum stake was a hundred thousand . And four times running a chip for another hundred thousand fell to him . Two and seven : nine , and four : thirteen . He had now one million three hundred thousand francs on his hands . " I shall have to hurry , " he thought , " M. Mawar will be waiting for me . " But even in Monte Carlo one million , three hundred thousand francs takes a little time to lose . However , that evening the habitu  --  s of the Casino were afforded a very remarkable spectacle indeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and an eggplant-colored zero on his bald skull was running from table to table , playing with a marl fury that took no account of any of the rules or systems of gambling . He never even left himself the opportunity of doubling up : he staked suicidally and yet never stopped winning . If he threw a chip into the air , it turned into a rain of chips . If he lost a stake at one table , he found it quadrupled on another . Chips flowed toward him like a river in spate , of which Florentin was anxiously watching the level . But if he said to himself : " It 's dropping , " he would find suddenly that some unconsidered tributary upset his calculations by becoming . swollen too . It was as if the numbers themselves were fantastically in league , all the thousands of numbers on all the tables , wheels , cards , and chips . They seemed to have some mutual understanding and to he pursuing each other , amalgamating with each other and multiplying each other . And among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost as a blind man amid wildly dancing revelers . Time was passing and Florentin 's chips were accumulating : over and over , he had to go to the money-changer for chips of a hundred thousand francs , which were more convenient . He sat clown at a rhernin de ter table , thought for a moment he was losing , and then saw the pile or chips opposite him assume prodigious proportions . He then did something which is never done . There was a huge sum at stake and he drew to a seven . He drew a two and turned up nine . The bank bad seven . His angry , disgusted opponents left the table . Florentin never knew he had been playing against the Maharajah of Pendura and the millionaire Zalkin , the greatest film producer in the United States . A crowd gathered round bins ; but he did not know why . He felt at once intoxicated and exhausted . He no longer knew whether he was playing to win or lose . He would have liked to go on playing simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numbers , but the gamblers were leaving the tables . Now there was nothing but the " tout-va , " on which he might still stake sums proportionate to his winnings . Once again , he staked a hundred thousand francs . His mouth felt dry and he drank a glass of soda water , for which he paid with what remained to him of his yesterday 's five thousand francs , 82 A MATTER OF LUCK He failed to notice that two very pretty women , taller than he was by a head , were lavishing interest and admiration on him . Hoping to attract his attention , they undulated to his side . They gazed at him avidly and provocatively ; but he did not see them . At the " tout-viz " the bank lost six times running . Florentin 's hundred thousand francs , which he left to accumulate on the table , produced twelve millions , eight hundred thousand . It was the end of the shoe . The banker took fright and stopped the game . The gamblers , the croupiers , and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Casino was closing down . Florentin alone seemed still alive , intoxicated by the miracle . His brow felt hot , his nerves were tingling . He was a prey to a singular excitement . In all , he had won sixteen millions , besides chicken feed . Lavish for the first time , he left the chicken feed , 340,000 francs , pour le personnel . T H E N , weighed down with the fortune that overflowed his pockets and his arms , he hastened out of the Casino and hurried to the restaurant . " M. Mawar is bound to have left , " he thought . But M. Mawar was still there , sitting motionless on a banquette , his stomach pendulous as ever , while his mistress , who was dripping with emeralds , danced . They were among the last customers , and the lights had been turned to blue . Florentin hurried in , nearly fell as he crossed the dance floor , and laid the fortune on the table . " Look Monsieur Mawarl " he cried . " Look what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fat man , his eyes dark as an Oriental god 's , never moved , never gave even so much as a quiver . He simply gave a brief , an almost imperceptible smile . " This is what I 've been expecting , " he said . " I knew it was bound to happen . You see , " he added , turning to his mistress who , at the sight of the great pile of chips and banknotes , had come over to the table , " you see , when one plays to win every day and invariably loses , there is reason to suppose that if one plays to lose a day will come when one is ineluctably bound to win . And that is what I wanted to find out . " He turned to Florentin . " Thank you , my friend , good night , " he said . And Florentin thought : " Surely he will give me a bonus out of all this . " " Do you think Monsieur Mawar . . Could you , perhaps . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a sort of calm surprise . " At least . . my five thousand francs . . " said Florentin , who suddenly felt himself growing pale . " Oh , no , my friend , " replied M. Mawar . " I gave you the five thousand francs to lose , not to win . Thank you . I shall have no further need of your services . " M. Florentin went out . His head was bowed . He shivered in the early dawn . His elation had suddenly turned to utter misery . He still had just enough from yesterday 's pay to go and drink a coffee and eat a sandwich in a little bar to which the croupiers went , when the Casino had closed , and where gathered chauffeurs , tramps , flower sellers , and the more unlucky gamblers.
