MUSTANGS AND COW HORSES edited by J. Frank Dobie , Mody C. Boatwright and Harry H. Ransom . 429 pages . Southern Methodist University . $7.50 . <P> <P> " The whole country seemed to be running ! Thousands and tens of thousands of wild horses running in immense herds as far as the eye or telescope could sweep the horizon . Time and again immense masses of mustangs , circling and circling around us , charging and threatening to rush over us , would wheel from our yelling and firing and go thundering away . " <P> As late as 1847 , when this scene was witnessed , the mustang myriads that wandered the great plains were one of the principal natural resources of the wild West . Broken to the saddle , harnessed to the plow , they became an instrument of manifest destiny , the brute force that bore forward the men who won the West . In this classic compendium of horse lore , republished for the first time since 1940 , a generation obsessed with horsepower is vividly reminded of the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texas translation of the Mexican mesteo , a general term for anything that looks more like a horse than a cow . The animal the word describes was principally descended from the fiery Arabs imported to the New World by Cortes and his conquistadors , and the rigors of the prairies notably improved the breed . The mustangs of 1850 were short ( 14-15 hands ) , hardy and fast : the stronger stallions kept manadas of 20 or 30 mares , and to defend the mares from randy rivals they fought frightful battles to the death . <P> Cunning as well as courageous , the stallions kept plenty of grass between manada and man , but during the 1850s the mustangers multiplied , and the odds in favor of the animals were disastrously reduced , Some were roped , some stampeded into pens , some " walked down " by patient riders who followed the herd for a week or two and imperceptibly and gradually assumed control of its movements . <P> <P> Three Methods . Once captured , the best of the mustangs were broken to the bridle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but brutal : the horse was slowly starved and beaten into docility . The American method was stupid but decent : a man jumped on the horse 's back and rode him till the man was thrown or the bronco was busted . The Indian method was noble and humane : immobilized by ropes , the horse was approached by his master , who spoke to him softly in " horse talk , " stroked his body until every part of it had been touched and every fear assuaged , then mounted the pacified animal and quietly rode away . <P> By whatever method they were broken , good mustangs made good riding horses-some of them , in fact , displayed undeniable genius . In the 1880s , the authors report , a horse in Texas was trained to run backwards-fast . And a cutting horse named Bosley Blue , who could handle 1,500 head of cattle without a rider to direct him , once grabbed the tail of a raging steer in his teeth , flipped the brute on his back , then calmly sat on top of him till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
