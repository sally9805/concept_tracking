In Louisville , where Democrats had controlled the city government for 28 years , Republicans reinvoked an old slogan : " It 's time for a change . " As it happened , it worked . Last week , over the opposition of the Louisville Courier-Journal and despite a lopsided Democratic registration superiority , the voters in Kentucky 's largest city ( pop . 390,639 ) elected Republican William O. Cowger , 39 , as mayor , his first political office , and gave the G.O.P. a sweep of the board of aldermen . <P> Labor leaders were impressed by Cowger 's flat condemnation of right-to-work proposals . Negroes ( some 15,000 of whom voted ) disliked the Democratic regime 's opposition to forced integration of eating places , were influenced by the rumor that the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens Council were supporting the Democratic candidate , William S. Milburn , 69.
