The Birds <P> Sir : Your story on Bauer and Baltimore Sept. 11 was especially well written and highly interesting . However , instead of saying " Finley runs his ball club like a child playing with a Roger Maris Baseball Game , " you should have given him credit for playing the best-the " Big-League Manager Baseball Game " of Duluth , Minn . <P> KEITH T. HENRICKSEN Publisher All Sports Digest Duluth <P> Sir : In 1958 , Hank Bauer 's middle name should have been " Hustle . " Maybe he was n't a DiMaggio , but he could get to a line drive pretty darned fast and still make it look easy . He played a good rightfield , and at Yankee Stadium that is n't easy . He was a pretty good man in the clutch too . Many was the time he would literally bend over backward or fall into the seats in right to catch aspiring homers . It 's a great pennant race this year . I 'd like to wish Hank Bauer luck , but since I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never relied on it before ; he wo n't now . <P> HALTON MANN Andover , Mass . <P> Sir : Why not the Phillies ' Gene Mauch on TIME 'S cover ? You 're a bunch of New York fish-cake finks ! <P> EDYTHE HURFORD Roslyn , Pa . <P> Sir : Would n't you know-I just recently let my subscription to TIME expire and you publish this wonderful article on Hank Bauer . Being an avid Oriole fan , a native Baltimorean , and knowing that Mr. Marsh Clark is an alumnus of St. James School made this article even more interesting to me . You can be sure that I shall renew my subscription immediately . <P> HELEN O. LOUDEN Baltimore <P> Democrats ' Choice <P> Sir : President Lyndon Johnson was wise in his selection of the Minnesotan for the vice-presidential spot Sept. 4 ; he put the awesome responsibility in the hands of a man who sees the problems of this age not as group against group , race against race , section against section , but rather , and more correctly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir : All I can say is that Humphrey must be a really good man to get the vice-presidential nomination . It 's a relief , in a way , to be able to appraise a man for his worth , not his wealth . <P> MARCELLA M. HENRY Clifton , N.J. <P> Sir : Past and pass do-goodies such as Eleanor , Chester and Soapy pale before the chubby-cheeked dynamo that is Horatio . Mr. and Mrs. Citizen must be taught in no uncertain terms that this Fabian gab-bag , one uncertain heartbeat from the White House , is the farthest out since F.D.R. tabbed Henry Wallace . <P> ROBERT GARY BYERLY Long Beach , Calif . <P> Sir : Certain programs of the Democratic Administration are those that not only allow but encourage social irresponsibility . The major programs of this sort are the war on poverty , medicare , and the beefing up of the Social Security plan . These new tacks on old New Deal programs can all be lumped under one heading : " Fresh meat for trie ravening wolves of society . " For heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. stand on our own two feet . <P> MARTIN J. COTE Pontiac , Mich . <P> <P> Sir : The Democrats have argued that Goldwater might cause war and have placed peace as their prime objective . I agree that war is a terrible thing , but should we place peace above freedom ? <P> ROBERT STALEY Ironton , Ohio
