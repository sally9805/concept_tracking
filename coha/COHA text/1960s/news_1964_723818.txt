txt A visitor strolling recently through the plush East Side offices of a Manhattan advertising agency opened a door marked " Library . " Behind it : An eight-foot coat closet lined with dripping galoshes . Such dissembling would n't be too surprising in many smaller ad agencies with shoestring budgets . But this office happens to belong to a subsidiary of Interpublic Group of Cornpanies , Inc. , which , according to company figures , recently ascended to the lofty position of world 's biggest advertising agency . The coat closet " library " is surely not typical of this ad agency colossus , whose research facilities for clients often are highly sophisticated . But it does point up that things at Interpublic are not always what they seem . On the surface , Interpublic 's maverick approach to building an advertising empire has produced a Cinderella success story . But its numerous critics in the industry say the company 's actual success is less than dazzling . And they complain that its methods are causing turmoil in the industry . Whether its critics are right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new style to Madison Avenue ( where , in fact , it has no offices , though the company is spread over the rest of mid-Manhattan and 82 other cities in the U.S. and 33 foreign countries ) . Interpublic 's approach involves broad autonomy for numerous subordinate units , while somehow retaining strong central control . This difficult organizational goal is similar to that achieved by General Motors Corp. , with which Interpublic is fond of comparing itself . Independent Subsidiaries Unlike the typical ad agency , which has neither divisions nor subsidiaries and slicks close to its basic function of creating and placing advertising , Interpublic is built around separate subsidiaries which strive to be independent of one another . The theory is that one subsidiary can handle an account , an airline for example , while a second subsidiary can work for a competing airline . This , says Interpublic , assures rival clients that market strategy of each is kept secret . In practice , all advertisers are n't convinced this works and Interpublic is having trouble holding some accounts . Interpublic 's corporate roof shelters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market research and sales promotion subsidiaries , some sundry services such as invention development , and even a Long Island dude ranch . The latter , 90 acres called Deep Hollow Ranch at the eastern tip of the island , provides 22 horses for city-weary employes of Interpublic plus room for " management seminars . " It also brings in cash during the summer months when it 's opened to the public . The largest subsidiary , and the springboard from which Interpublic began building its empire three years ago , is its McCann-Erickson agency with 1963 world-wide billings of $375 million . Others include medium-sized McCannMarshalk ( $40 million ) , Pritchard Wood ( $26 million ) and tiny Johnstone ( $2.3 million ) . Fast Growth Rate Gross billings to clients of all Interpublic subsidiaries doubled in the past five years to an annual rate of $530 million by the end of 1963 . That 's about twice the average growth rate of the 10 next largest ad agencies during the same period . But much of this growth came through the 21 acquisitions Interpublic made in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through acquisitions is not an unmixed blessing , the company admits . Interpublic does n't release earnings , but Frank A. Sherer , executive vice president for financial policy , says a trade source estimate of $1.8 million in 1962 net profit is " substantially correct . " Such a figure would put Interpublic 's ratio of profit to gross billings at ** far below the 0.81% average for agencies billing over $40 million a year , as reported by the American Association of Advertising Agencies . " When we make an acquisition , we entail additional expenses that are n't immediately compensated for by increased volume , " says Mr. Sherer . But Marion Harper , Jr. , chairman and president , declares the earnings trend is upward . " We 've had two years of record earnings ( 1962 and 1963 ) and we expect another record this year , " he says . Interpublic is running into opposition from some advertisers over its policy of different subsidiaries handling clients with competing brands . This problem came to a head last fall when Interpublic acquired Erwin Wasey , Ruthrauff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million boosted Interpublic into first place in the billings hierarchy , ahead of the previous pace-setter , J. Walter Thompson Co . Departing Clients ' Since then , five clients of Erwin Wasey , who contributed over $10 million yearly to its billings , have announced they 're quitting the agency . Among them is Minnesota Mining &; Manufacturing Co . A 3-M subsidiary , Revere Camera Co. , competes directly with Bell &; Howell Co. , handled by Interpublic 's McCannErickson . Interpublic 's acquisition in January of Fletcher Richards , an ad agency with $18 million in annual billings , is running into similar problems . Announced departures . by clients will cut its volume to $9 million . Among those leaving is National Distillers &; emical Corp. , Fletcher Richards ' top client , Amon is pulling out because several of its liquor brands compete with Schenley Industries , Inc. , handled by McCann-Erickson . The same type of conflict prompted Brown-Forman Distillers Corp . to quit Erwin Wasey after Interpublic took over . Interpublic executives blame rival ad agencies for stirring up a fuss over imagined conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the company 's Pritchard Wood agency in New York , declares , " We maintain a studied silence on these accounts . " His agency , he notes , handles British Overseas Airways Corp. , while McCann-Marshalk handles Sabena Belgian World Airlines . " We do n't talk to McCannMarshalk and they do n't talk to us , " he asserts . But critics in rival ad agencies note that Mr. Johnson led McCann-Marshalk 's bid last fall for the $8.6 million-a-year Eastern Air Lines account . Mr. Johnson , who can cite 20 years experience working for two airlines , explains it was a simple matter of McCannMarshaik " drawing on certain talent " to improve its chances of winning new business . The agency , however , failed to get the account . The loan of Mr. Johnson to McCann-Marshalk in the Eastern Air Lines bid " makes a mockery of Harper 's separateness doctrine , " charges the senior vice president of one competing ad agency . Interpublic 's unorthodoxy is evident even in the way executives describe its personnel policy . Such policy for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also devotes itself to planning broad financial and acquisition strategy . Unlike some ad agencies which seem to favor persons from a certain Ivy League college or those with a particular kind of buttondown appearance , Interpublic executives " come in all shapes and sizes and from all over the world , " claims Carl Spielvogel , vice president , personnel . And he notes that company employes do n't punch time clocks or sign check-in books . Many Madison Avenue agencies keep close track of workers , including even account executives . J. Walter Thompson , for example , hands out a monthly " score card " to employes , rating them on their punctuality at work . This does n't mean life is easy at Interpublic , Mr. Spielvogel hastens to add . " We 've got no room for the three-hour lunches or midweek golfer , " he says , noting that Mr. Harper , the chief executive , often puts in an 18-hour day . " One of our jokes around here is that ' you 've got to sleep fast to get ahead . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so some agencies believe , is to go public . Interpublic is neither encouraging nor denying published speculation that it may be the next big agency to sell its shares . Two other agencies previously abandoned the traditional reluctance of ad firms to sell their stock : Papert , Koenig , Lois , Inc. , in September , 1962 , and Foote , Cone &; Belding , Inc. , last September . " Within the next five years , as many as 25 agencies will go public , " predicts Mr. Harper . " I do n't include or exclude Interpublic from this group . We 've studied the problem of a public stock offering for four years , but we have no plans . " As a practical matter , he adds , it caw be ruled out this year . In the immediate future , Interpublic will concentrate on digesting its recent acquisitions , he declares . " We will grow with what we have , " says the executive , forecasting a 9% to 10% gain in billings this year . The company 's goal by 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 40% of the total from the present 35% . One certainty is that the merger mill will grind slower . " There wo n't be anything like " another 21 acquisitions in the next 18 months , says Mr. Harper , adding : " Another acquisition the size of Erwin Wasey does n't figure in our thinking . "
