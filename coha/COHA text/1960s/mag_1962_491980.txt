It Was a jinxed spot . Only the day before , While working in the same excavation . I had had a chilling sensation such as you might feel in a dark room when ou fear someone else is in there % ith you . I could n't escape the feeling that some uninvited creature had crashed our party . Normally I am as alert as a nervous cat when I 'm on the bottom , because there are a number of God 's creatures down there who refuse to agree that we odd-shaped , flesh-covered men are masters of the earth and the seas . They would rather think of us as something to eat . Although Fm not inclined to accept their point of ieN ? , I do have a certain amount of respect for it . At any rate , I had taken a good look around just a few minutes earlier . and everything looked quite peaceful . A gentle angelfish was fluttering around a beautiful golden head of brain coral to my right . " Fhree almost nuorescent blue fish were nibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stackpole and Schanche were about ten feet away from me , busily fanning sand away from the bottom , which ran like a flat , white valley between two high coral reefs . It was a peaceful scene  --  enough to stir a man 's soul . I turned head down to my o ? ? n excavation and continued with my digging . Suddenly I felt uneasy . Restraining an impulse to move too quickly , lest I appear to he a piece of squirming live bait , I raised my head slowly and turned around to see if  --  as my instincts seemed to warn me  --  some man-eater lurked nearby . The beautiful small fish were moving gently to and fro , quite unconcerned . The two other divers were intent on their task , staring fixedly into the hole they were digging ? % , ith no concern for what might be overhead . But just above them , after sliding quietly over my exposed body , moved a sharp-nosed blue shark . He was big enough to eat both of them and me as well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to warn my companions , I simply stared as the big , blue rascal swam over their heads . Without a pause he kicked his tail and glided down the sand valley , out of sight . The two other divers never knew the unwanted observer had been around . We saw a few more sharks , but only one of them made a threatening gesture . If he had got the meal he seemed to be sizing up . Bermuda would now be welcoming a new governor . Maj. Gcn . Sir Julian Gascoigne , the governor of Bermuda , is a vigorous soldier of fifty-eight who seems as contemptuous of age he does of the hazards of the underwater world . Many Bermudians speak fondly of him as " Sir Julian the Participator " because he takes such a vital interest in joining all of the pleasurable activities of this water-loving colony . Although he suffered a collapsed lung from a chest wound in Italy during the Second World War , Sir Julian eagerly took up skin diving and scuba diving when he cameto Bermuda . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dive with me . Last summer Sir Julian became interested in our expedition , and whenever he could spare the time from his official duties , he joined our crew as a diver . One day he sailed out with us to investigate the wreck of the old American clipper ship , the North Carolina . She is a beautiful old steel hulk , 220 feet long and still largely intact , standing upright on the bottom in sixty feet of water . Although listed in Bermuda 's records of wrecks , the Mirth Carolina 's exact position underwater had been forgotten , and no one in recent times had seen her until we rediscovered her last summer . So all of us were excited when we anchored above the old relic and started preparing our face masks and hoses for diving . My wife Edna and Sir Julian decided to don ordinary face masks and flippers , and snorkel around on the surface to size up the old ship while the rest of us scurried around the deck of my old diving boat , a surplus British Navy pinnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are good swimmers . Soon they were about 200 feet from the boat , paddling lazily along on the surface above the still-erect bowsprit of the old clipper ship . Suddenly Edna saw a large dark shape slide out from the sunken ship 's bow curve below . Sir Julian , about thirty feet away , was swimming in the opposite direction ; he could not see the creature . Edna noted immediately that it was a gray shark , about eight feet long . It began swimming slowly toward Sir Julian , as if it already had judged the governor a quarry worth pursuing . Without hesitation Edna swam to Sir Julian 's side , calmly told him there was an eight-foot shark right behind him , and suggested that they swim rapidly but not frenziedly to the boat . I believe sharks , like dogs , are more inclined to strike a frightened man , because in his panic he sets up such a stir that he looks as if he has been wounded . A shark likes nothing better than wounded , helpless prey . At any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat without bringing the monster with them and without getting so much as a nibble . Sir Julian was with us that day for more than diving . He wanted to take part in a historic event  --  the first use of a helium-filled balloon as a tool of underwater archaeology and treasure hunting . Ever since I began searching out old shipwrecks around Bermuda , I have dreamed of using a balloon as a floating platform . I have tried every other means olscanning underwaterglass-bottomed boats , which give you a limited view of the sea bottom directly beneath your window ; airplanes , which move too fast over the surface to give you time to study the bottom ; and a contemplative position leaning over the bow of my boat , from which I can survey twenty-five to thirty feet of sea bottom at a time . There is no commercial helicopter in Bermuda , so I haNe never tried one as a search platform . I doubt that it would work Nye I 1 . The whirling rotor blades would stir too much chop on the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the sea bottom . When we planned the expedition , Otto Winzen , president of Winzen Research Inc. and manufacturer of the record-setting high-altitude balloons in which Lt. Col. David Simons and Cmdr. Malcolm Ross ascended to the edge of space , donated a 6000-cubic-foot plastic balloon . Last August ninth , a perfect day with a glass-calm sea , we inflated the Winzen balloon . tethered it to my boat with 600 feet of line and set out to look for treasure wrecks . The balloon , candy-striped like a peppermint ball with alternating cerise and white polyethylene panels , reached for the sky , tugging fifty feet of mooring rope straight up as we steamed out of quiet Ely 's Harbor at the southwest end of Bermuda . When we reached the barrier reef , where I suspected that dozens of shipwrecks lay , I slipped into a flimsy bosun 's chair suspended from the balloon . For two hours I had the boat describe a lazy crisscross pattern along the reef while I rode comfortably under the balloon 150 to 200 feet above the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , of being a part of the sky , such as I have never had while flying in an airplane . By moving slowly , with the steady progress of the boat tugging the balloon along by its mooring line , I was able to study the bottom more thoroughly than I ever had from the close-up vantage point of the sea 's surface . I could see individual rocks and coral heads clearly for a quarter of a mile in every direction . Within five minutes I saw the first shipwreck . An untrained eye probably would have missed it . But about 1000 yards ahead I could see a long straight line . Every man who spends much of his life outdoors soon learns that nature abhors a straight line . Natural formations usually curve and wind about at random . Yet before me was a narrow indentation , straight as a taut rope and at least 100 yards long . It could be only the furrow plowed in the coral by the keel of a heavy ship . There was no trace of a ship . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within ten years under the onslaught of teredo and other shipworms , the borers of the sea which have plagued mariners ever since man set out in the first dugout canoe . Nearby I could see piles of smooth , ellipsoid rocks . Again , the untrained eye would overlook this evidence , But after years of studying the waters of Bermuda , I know every native rock , and these were not native . Clearly they were ballast stones from an old ship whose keel had plowed through the coral , digging the straight line . Her bottom had sprung open , spilling stones where she had foundered . Before two hours were up , I had spotted half a dozen more shipwrecks , four of which I had seen before . Even so , it may be years before I find time to dive on the new finds . For the present my hands are full . I know the locations of 112 shipwrecks  --  ranging in age from a Spaniard , which went down in 1595 with a fabulous treasure , to a modern yacht , which hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About sixty of these wrecks are known to other people , and none of them are particularly valuable . The remainder are mine until someone else discovers them . At least seven of them may be fabulously rich treasure ships . Although the balloon worked beautifully , it did not work for long . Despite our efforts to save it , the gas in our balloon became contaminated with air which slipped in through an open safety vent in the bottom . By the second day of balloon operations the helium had mixed with enough air to lose much of its lifting power . The balloon would still hoist Stackpole or Schanche or some of the lighter members of our crew . but it would not take me aloft . Mendel Peterson , who was eager to get high above a shipwreck in order to sketch its dimensions and trace its death throes as it plowed through the coral reefs , weighs about the same as I do and could not get aloft either . But we thought that Sir Julian , who at 196 pounds weighs slightly less than Peterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deck level and helped the exultant governor into the bosun 's chair . Then we heaved him over the side . Instead of rising , the governor descended . With great dignity he adjusted his straw hat at a rakish angle , extended his limbs , pointed his toes toward the sky , and plopped into the water , bosun 's chair and all . Dampened but not discouraged , His Excellency Maj. Gen. Sir Julian Gascoigne , K.C.V.O. , C.B. , D.S.O. , climbed back in the boat and quipped through his trim military mustache : " It was simply a case of too little gas and too much Gascoigne . " Locating old wrecks , whether by balloon or any other method , is the first , but by no means the most important , element of treasure hunting . The actual salvaging of long-lost cargo is far more difficult . Sometimes the work fairly drips with romance and mystery , but more often it is a painstaking affair , which calls for great patience , depending as much on scholarship as on brute strength and luck for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , demands a tremendous amount of historical research . Without it I would n't know what I was looking for . More important , I would not know what I had when I found it . For although precious metals and stones are he richest treasure , there are great historical treasures in the remains of everyday shipboard life on the ancient wrecks . Many quite ordinary-looking artifacts are of immense value to archaeologists and historians . We uncovered a wide variety of these seemingly worthless items from the old colonial ships Eagle and 1 " irginia Aferchant last summer . To an uninformed salvor our hard-won pile of clay pipes . bricks , cannon balls , tools , writing utensils , pieces of silverware and fragments of china and pottery would be only curios . But after studying the historical records of the early days of the Virginia Company , which colonized Jamestown and Bermuda , we knew their archaeological value . The Eagle wrecked on Bermuda 's Northeast Breaker between nine and ten P.Nt. , January 12 , 1659 , while sailing to the struggling colony at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers were saved and sailed on to Jamestown aboard the 1 irginia Merchant , which ran afoul of Bermuda 's reefs herself two years later , drowning 170 crewmen and passengers . Since 1934 , archaeologists at Jamestown have been systematically digging in the old colonial settlement . tryine to reconstruct the life of America 's earliest English settlers . But the evidence they find is often confusing and hard to date . A clay pipe found on the hearth of an old hut . for example , may date from 1625 or from 1675 . There is still controversy over the origin of some of the bricks used in the buildings . Were they shipped from England or were they baked in Virginia ? At what period was a certain kind of silverware in use ? Evidence raised from the Eagle and the Virginia Merchant will help to solve some of these puzzles . The archaeologists can take a piece of silverware from the Virginia Merchant and exactly match it to pieces they have found at Jamestown . They can examine a piece of pottery which they know without question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1659 , when the Eagle went down , and compare it with similar pieces found in their excavations . They can study bricks which came of the wreck of the Eagle , clearly made in England for shipment to America , and compare them with those found in Jamestown . To help them in their Jamestown studies . the Bermuda government , in co-operation with The Saturday Evening Post , has offered our collection of Eagle and Virginia Merchant artifacts as a gift to the state of Virginia and the U.S. National Park Service , which operates Jamestown . Many of the items , including cannons from both ships , will go on permanent display there . The Post prize includes hundreds of other important artifacts  --  cannon balls , musket stocks , tools , swords , buckles and buttons and remnants of ship 's cargoes ranging from thoroughly soaked tobacco to still-usable indigo the from two Spanish galleons . Eventually all of these objects which can be preserved will go on display at my Wreck Museum in Bermuda . We found treasure , too , but before describing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure hunter . Although I take athoroughly scientific approach to underwater treasure hunting nowadays , I must confess that luck was the thing that got me started , and I have not since equaled the great treasure I discovered with my first lucky break . In the late 1940 's and early 1950 's Robert Canton and I were partners in brass salvage , raising anything of value we found on modern-day shipwrecks . I had been a commercial fisherman , and many of my friends still were  --  sharpeyed , lonely men with little else to do but peer over the sides of their boats and study the bottom of the sea . Often one of them would spot the remains of an old wreck with a bit of brass on it and tell me where to find it . While looking for such a wreck one day in 1950 . I spotted a pair of old cannons lying on the bottom . A few days later Robert and I raised the two guns , as well as a huge copper pot full of lead musket shot . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pewter plate . The wreck was old and interesting , but we were too busy scrambling to make a living out of brass salvage to bother with historical artifacts . We sold the lot to the Bermuda . Monuments Trust for SIDO and vowed to return to the wreck when we had more time to look around . One late-summer day in 1955 we decided on impulse to stop at the old wreck . Slipping on a face mask. , I leaped into the water and made a free dive to the bottom . The water was as clear as new-washed glass , the way it usually is around Bermuda , and I could see for fifty feet all around me . The first thing I noticed was a bronze apothecary 's mortar . Fascinated by the find , I went back to the boat , started the air compressor , slipped on a full-face diving mask and jumped overboard again . Back on the bottom I started a shallow excavation by fanning sand from a small area near the bronze mortar . Soon I uncovered a handful of blackened pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt water , the coins had suffered from electrolytic action and turned to fragile silver sulphide . But I recognized them as Spanish coins and began to dig with more interest . Gradually I created a trench about eighteen inches deep . Suddenly a small . bright object tumbled out one side of the sand trench . It sparkled in the sunlight as if it had been polished only a few minutes before . I picked it up . It was a five-sided piece of gold . The chunk weighed only about two ounces . To us , then , it did n't seem very valuable  --  maybe $75 worth , perhaps $100 to a museum . But it was exciting . If there was a small gold piece there , I knew there had to he more . Forgetting brass salvage  --  our bread and butter  --  we set out to find the rest of the treasure .
