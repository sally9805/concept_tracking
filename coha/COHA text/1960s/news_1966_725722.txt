txt The city faces a projected deficit of ; 400-million in the 1967-68 fiscal year , the Temporary Commission on City Finances said yesterday in its final report Earl B. Schwulst , the chairman of the commission that was appointed by Mayor Wagner , said the deficit should be met by new taxes only as a last resort . Instead , he declared , Mayor Lindsay must continue his policy of rigid economy and the state and Federal governments must increase substantially their aid to the city . When . those sources have contributed their maximum shares , Mr. Schwulst said , " then , perhaps , the city may have to increase its revenues by raising charges for its services and by increasing city taxes further . " But , he declared , in no circumstances should the deficit be met by borrowing .

Mayor Lindsay has cut expenditures in his budget by $54-million , leaving a budget of $4.5-billion . Thus , the projected deficit is $35-million . But this assumes that there has - been no underestimate of expenses and no overestimate of the yield of the city income tax , the business income tax and the commuter earnings tax , fiscal instruments with which the city has had no experience . Mr. Schwulst criticized proposals to use $84-million received from the state as a transit subsidy . " That money is needed to balance the current budget , " he declared . ' Unfortunate ' Cutbacks The commission , in its report , said that " the unfortunate consequence of the State Legislature 's cutback of the city 's tax proposals is unmistakably evident . " " The city 's program , as submitted by the Mayor in March , would have given the city a fully balanced budget for the first time in six years , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , not only for essential municipal operations but also for rebuilding the city 's depleted reserves and ending revenue-anticipation borrowing . " Now the reserves will not be substantially rebuilt , revenueanticipation borrowing will not be stopped , and revenues will again fall short of expenditures ? though by much less than in recent years . " " In sum , " the report declared , " the fiscal situation of the city continues to be serious , but with improved attitudes and approaches toward meeting the recurring yearly crises . " Realistically , it is explained , the city can not hope to flatten the expenditure trend , " though it must everlastingly try . " National economic , social and technological trends , such as the movement of people from rural areas to urban communities and from Southern towns to Northern big cities , affecting all the large cities of the United States , are the basic causes of New York 's fiscal dilemma , the report declared . As the nation 's largest city , is particularly afflicted with problems that have their major roots in national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large-city services are national and regional services , it believes , and hence their cost must be spread to the wider jurisdictions , regional , state and national . Along with getting much larger outside assistance , the city , in the commission 's view , should deal with its financial troubles along three lines . First , it must continue to improve its management through over-all supervision and coordination by the City Administrator and through grouping agencies into administrations as Mayor Lindsay has begun to do . Second , it must step up its efforts to strengthen its economy through industrial development programs and improved basic services . Third , unless the city can obtain adequate increases in Federal . and state aid , it will need further increases in taxes , preferably through levying the income tax on commuters as well as residents at a higher rate and through higher user charges on motor vehicles . The commission has already gone out of existence and is now closing its affairs .                  @ @ @
