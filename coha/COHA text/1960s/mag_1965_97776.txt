The way defenses are operating these days , " says SMU Coach Doc Hayes , " the other team starts , picking you up when you walk out of the hotel lobby on the way to the field house . " // Hayes is barely exaggerating the case . He is referring to the amazing popularity of a technique that is sweeping college basketball  --  the pressing defense and especially the zone press . Twice UCLA has used this shattering weapon to win the NCAA championship , and now every coach in the country is either planning to use it or worrying about how to beat it , or both . Even the pros , who have a rule outlawing all zone defenses , are copying it . // The pressing defense is not a new basketball concept . Back in 1952 Coach Phog Allen 's Kansas team won the NCAA title with it . So did San Francisco in 1955 and 1956 , California in 1959 and Loyola of Chicago in 1963 . What is new is the way UCLA has used it . Soft-spoken , genteel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as UCLA 's basic style ; it is not just a sometime tactic when all else fails . In addition , it is thoroughly integrated with the UCLA offense , so much so that it is hard to say where defense stops and offense begins . // What makes the zone so intriguing is that it does not take a big man like a Russell or a superstar like a Robertson to make it work . The UCLA teams of the last two years were of average size and , though Walt Hazzard and Gail Goodrich are fine players , neither one is a Cousy , a Bradley or a West . Both teams , however , were made up of well-conditioned athletes , dedicated to a demanding philosophy of play through superb coaching . // In this age of remarkable shooters many a college coach , with the limited time available to him , has chosen to neglect defense . Why bother ? is the theory ; we can always outrun and outshoot our opponents . Forced to concede the efficacy of the UCLA system , these same coaches fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of personnel . With Wooden 's players , they say , we 'd win the NCAA , and with a press , too . This is a pat answer , but it simply is not true . Through hard work , patience and intelligent use of talent , Wooden has won with the kind of players available nearly everywhere in the country today . // Wooden 's preoccupation with the zone press did not come about accidentally or incidentally . Like many other coaches , he toyed with it for years , but used it mostly as a sudden " panic " defense when his team was behind in the late stages of a game . However , the idea of using it as a planned weapon intrigued Wooden , and he finally decided to take the gamble . Long before he actually began to use the defense , Wooden , with typical perseverance , taught his players fundamentals only and got them into top physical condition . Then he thoroughly schooled them in a man-to-man press . // That sounds like a curious way to approach a zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zone press is beaten , a team is in trouble if it can not fall back and properly protect itself . By first working on the man-to-man press we learned how to fall back naturally when we had to . " // Finally Wooden taught his players the zone . This was not a one-week or even a one-season affair . Over the years the Bruins mastered the exhausting technique , sharpening their reactions and learning to anticipate each other 's moves . And each new group of players absorbed both the inspiration required and some of the technique itself from the older players . What developed was a zone press that kept the pressure on an opponent almost constantly . It irritated , harassed and confused , and worked so well in 1963- ' 64 that UCLA won 30 straight and crushed Duke in the NCAA final . Last year Wooden changed his defensive alignment to put still more pressure on the offense . He moved a man up the baseline to play the opponent making the inbounds pass . The effect was devastating , because opponents then had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential qualities of the press were the same  --  quickness , precision and extreme confidence in execution  --  as Michigan sadly learned in the national championship playoff last March . For this season Wooden plans other changes . " If we do n't change , " he says , " coaches will soon figure out how to lick it . " // Basically , the press , whether it is full-court , three-quarters , half-court , 2-2-1 , 2-1-2 , 3-2 , 4-1 or UCLA 's 3-1-1 , is an attacking defense . Its immediate aim is to cause an otherwise good team to panic . It is designed to upset the rhythm of the enemy offense , create instant confusion and force errors . When it succeeds , it can overcome a 10-point deficit in minutes . In UCLA 's 3-1-1 the defense forms immediately after UCLA scores a field goal or a foul shot . The center plays the out-of-bounds passer tight , the guards protect the areas on either side and one man  --  usually the quickest and with the best reactions  --  assumes a position midway between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . The safety man lines up deep to guard against the long pass and to protect against penetration . When the opponents do put the ball into play UCLA usually will double-team the first receiver , trying to harass him into a fumble or into throwing the ball away . // Occasionally UCLA will permit the first pass , offering only token resistance , and retreat upcourt into a more conventional defense . Then , when the floor position suits them , the Bruins revert to their swarming and double-teaming . Often the swift change of pace upsets the opposition , and the panic is on . // The zone press does not always work , of course . Because of its concentration on the ball rather than the man it is a gambling defense , and once beaten it often results in an easy field goal for the other team . But more often than not it at least succeeds in upsetting a planned attack . At best it creates panic . Either way , it sets the tempo for the game . // " Before the presses came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Iowa Coach Ralph Miller , one of the earliest advocates of the full-court defense when he coached at Wichita East High School in the late ' 40s . " The defense had to wait to see what the offense was going to do . But now the defenses are forcing the issue . " Pete Newell , who coached the California team that won the NCAA championship with a press , cites other advantages : " The zone press promotes an unselfish style of play . It does not emphasize individuals on offense alone . There is great squad appeal in this type of defense ; it is a builder of team morale . The zone press is like a boxing pattern in which the boxer refuses to allow his opponent to get set , but stays in close , leans on him and makes him tire in the late stages . " // What Loyola 's George Ireland likes about it is its effect on the big man . " The zone press is basketball 's first successful attempt at neutralizing the big man , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt if he would be nearly as effective as he was in his time . I do n't think Mikan was agile enough to handle the press . " // " It 's the most effective defensive weapon in use today , " claims Michigan 's Dave Strack . " But you just have to have the quick , strong players to make it work . And they ca n't be lazy . The game is played at full speed all over the court , and every player must be ready to go all the time . The coach must be sold on the press , and then the players and the coach have to live and die with it . " // Since Wooden and his players are living very well with it , the press , regardless of its disadvantages , will be the fashion for some time . At clinics and informal bull sessions last summer , more hours were spent on the press than on any other subject . At the Clinic of Champions held in Kansas City for 210 coaches , it was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is welcome news to Wooden and other coaches who plan to use some type of press this season . " That 's the main value of it , " says Wooden . " The more worried coaches are about it , the better it works . " // Ohio State 's Fred Taylor , who has had excellent results against the press  --  he calls it " the rat game "  --  goes at the problem analytically . " There are several things you have to know about a press before you can attack it , " he says . " Like why are they pressing ? Does it complement the offense or become a total offense , the way UCLA works it ? Then you have to determine the type of press , its zone alignment and coverage of key spots . Does it become man-to-man in the second line ? Do they put pressure on the ball out of bounds ? Sometimes a pressing team wants you to have the ball inbounds and they play it soft . That gets the clock going . Then they swarm you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to them in a roadblock-type defense . Finally , you have to compare your own team to the opponent . " // Once all this is determined , Taylor says , " there are countless avenues of attack , but first we try to bypass as many defensive men as quickly as possible . We 'll look for the long pass . If it 's a true zone press , we 'll try to eliminate a couple of defenders in a hurry . Secondly , our basic premise is to get into the heart of the defense . Penetrate and get back out , because the ball draws a crowd . Then it boils down to the pre-game planning , whether you 're going to try to ram it down their throats if you beat the original press or set up and try to make them play half-court defense . The crux of beating the press is the way you determine what your personnel can do . You have to decide quickly whether or not you can ram it or if you must set up . But do it your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor will know soon enough whether his way works . His Bucks will try to handle UCLA 's " rat game " this Friday in Los Angeles . // The most important requisite , agrees California 's Newell , is for a team to have a plan of attack . " If a coach does not provide a plan , " he says in his book Basketball Methods , " he should not expect his players to react properly . The best way to force a pressure defense to retreat is to have the threat of men cutting to the basket all the time . " // When Newell was coaching , he always designated a forward or center to take the ball out of bounds . " This was done for two reasons , " he says . " A smaller player often has trouble passing over his defensive man , and his vision upcourt is impaired by the defensive man . Also we could more easily determine if the defense was playing man-to-man or zone . Next , we wanted to create a passing lane for the in bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baseline , head on to the player taking the ball out of bounds . He had the opportunity of breaking in either direction to create a passing lane . The other guard was parallel to the first guard on the opposite side of the court for an alternate lead . The two remaining men went upcourt , one on either side . They hesitated at the center line , to receive a long pass or to move back to help if needed . // " The out-of-bounds man passed to a guard , then moved into the lane for a return pass . One deep man cut back to meet the ball while the other guard cut upcourt . The player with the ball then had the option of passing to the deep man coming back or the guard heading upcourt. " // Theoretically , this causes the pressure defense to spread , and when it does it is licked . // Howie Dallmar of Stanford is probably more familiar with the UCLA press than most coaches , because he has to face it twice a season in the AAWU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " First , teams have to organize for the throw-in , and then they have to regroup to take the ball upcourt . Some teams , on the initial pass , like to have the guard throw upcourt to either forward . But they must be very careful , because the zone press can quickly adjust to 2-2-1 , with both defensive forwards rotating to cover the long pass . // " Others like to flood an area to overload the zone . But once the ball is in , you face another problem  --  bringing it from back court to front court through the meat grinder . For this you can use a 3-2 attack , with the two guards and your most active forward bringing up the ball , or the more standard 2-3 . In either case , the idea is to pass through the zone with a minimum amount of dribbling. " // Kansas State 's Tex Winter , on the other hand , does not believe in setting up definite play patterns against a press . " The defense can too easily size them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you can execute the skills of the game while moving fast you are difficult to press successfully . What I want to do is outpressure the pressure . A fast-breaking team is best suited for this . I want fast passes rather than a dribble , but if no pass is open , then I like a quick dribble to escape a possible double-team trap . // " I tell my center and forwards to keep the pressure on their defensive men by continuously working behind them toward the offensive basket . But if they see a guard in trouble , they must be alert to come back and help out , the forward on the ball side first . He keeps coming until he gets a pass or is within 15 feet of the ball and has not received a pass . Then he should reverse quickly and head upcourt fast for a possible long pass over the heads of the defenders . " A few of these for baskets , Winter figures , will soon discourage any press . // " My theory , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , and despite what happened to us in the UCLA game last season I still think the zone press is vulnerable to quick basketball . What we tried to do against UCLA was to get the ball to our strongest man , Cazzie Russell , and have Bill Buntin go to mid-court and hook back to help . " ( Interestingly enough , many press advocates believe it works best of all against a team with a star like Cazzie Russell . Says Harry Lancaster , Adolph Rupp 's astute assistant at Kentucky , " A Russell will take the zone press as a challenge and try to beat it singlehanded , even if he has to try to dribble through it . This is the worst thing to use against the press . We want to hold the dribble to a minimum . But a guy like Russell may try to go all the way with it . A poorer player , with less confidence , will be afraid of getting trapped by the zone press . He wo n't want to handle the ball and will get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) // One thing that has contributed to the recent success of pressing defenses , says Providence 's Joe Mullaney , is the lack of good ball handlers in the game today . " A press takes advantage of this lack , " he adds . " Some teams have one , or maybe two , ball handlers , but they must get rid of the ball sometime and eventually the weak men on your team have to touch it . That 's when you 're in trouble . You just ca n't bury a couple of bad ball handlers against a zone press . " ( One beneficial result of the trend to presses may be a return to thorough grounding in ball-handling fundamentals by coaches. ) // A man-to-man press is really no problem , says Mullaney , because " any kid who can put the ball on the ground will easily beat it . Everybody just clears out to let him operate one-on-one . But , regardless of the type of press we have to face , we teach our players one theory for attacking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even presses , bend so much that a player must be flexible enough to adjust quickly to any pattern . We want to split the defensive men , always giving them the problem of moving to us . Also we want to spread the defense and then get to open areas with the ball . The first receiver should be our best ball-handling guard , and if he is a good one he will escape the first double-team in backcourt . After that he heads upcourt on one side , almost inviting another double-team , with the other guard trailing on the other side at about a 45 ? angle . If the first man finds himself one-on-one , he tries to beat his opponent on the dribble . If he is shut off by a double-team , he tries to shoot the gap between it with a pass , or passes off to his trailer , who is in the only open area . " But , admits Mullaney , this can only work when you have the ball handlers. // Iowa 's Miller is sold on the aggressive approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , " he says . " But it does not have to be reckless . It can be careful , though not cautious , because caution implies fear , and fear is fatal to any offense . I do n't think it matters too much what kind of specific offense you use against a zone press . The best way to attack it is with a passing game . When you dribble the ball , the defense simply moves with it and the defense 's form remains intact . Coach Phog Allen 's theory is as sound now as it was in the 1920s , and I subscribe to it : ' Pass the ball to a man in the open and then move to a new position yourself . ' " // Notre Dame 's Johnny Dee favors the bounce pass out to the first man . He thinks there is less chance for an interception that way . " The basic fundamental of the zone press is that it is going to play the ball , " he says . " So we want to overload the zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose . I bring a third man to the ball to get four against three in the backcourt. " // Louisville 's Peck Hickman warns , " The team that presses the panic button against the zone press is the team that gets whipped by it . So it is of primary importance to retain your poise . For instance , if one of our big men is shut off by two guards , we tell him to take the five-second penalty of a jump ball rather than throw a bad pass . Then he still has a chance to control the jump . That 's better than giving up two points . Technically , we will try for area passes  --  passes into specific areas designated beforehand  --  and avoid throwing the cross-court pass . We also will screen to get receivers free from a defender , and we want our men to be cutting at angles at all times . " // Loyola 's Ireland , who uses the press himself , says he is not worried about it at all : " We had no trouble handling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times because of the press and picked up about six to eight baskets against it . We would have lost the ball three times against any defense . It 's easier to crack a pressing defense than an ordinary one , because the defense must cover more floor area . " // A corollary to this view is the opinion of Villanova 's Jack Kraft that " the team that presses will often get upset if this tactic is turned against it . You 'll see it happen many times  --  throw a tough zone against a pressing team and they 'll panic . " Kraft , highly respected by coaches for his well-coached squads , also takes positions directly opposed to those generally accepted on three points : use of the dribble , passing and avoidance of the sideline areas . He encourages his players to dribble the ball . " The first thing we want to do is break down their front line and then attack the basket under normal fast-break conditions , " he says . " The less passing you do the less chance there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handler to bring the ball up along the sidelines , because that makes it more difficult for the middle man to double-team . I keep my other guard behind the ball as a trailer for a safety pass , and if he gets the ball his move is to the other side . What this does is spread the middle man so that we can get the ball to the middle from the sideline . When we arrive there , then we have three-on-two , and that 's the way we want to be against a zone press . That should finish it . // " The second phase of our play  --  and the most difficult to get across to our players  --  is that you must attack the basket quickly . We do n't want to give the opposition time to regroup into a normal defense . But you 'd better have the ball handlers against the press . If you have n't  --  forget it . Do n't even show up . " // Because he agrees with that last statement and possibly because he is a frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends more time preparing to meet it than most other coaches . Hoping to develop player confidence as well as technique , he devotes two full weeks of preseason practice as well as part of every week during the season to playing against it . Meyer has several drills specifically designed to combat presses . His men work diligently on dribbling , releasing the passer and staying away from the man with the ball . " The idea behind that maneuver , " he explains , " is to isolate the man with the ball in a one-on-one situation . It is very difficult for one man to take the ball away from another without fouling . " // Meyer welcomes a zone press because , he says , " We operate on the theory that we can pass faster than our opponents can run . " His rules are : keep the ball in the middle to avoid being trapped on the sideline ; once you lose your dribble , get rid of the ball because you can be double-teamed ; do not bring your man close to the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every coach in the country has an opinion , all the way from Frank McGuire 's " Just get better ballplayers " to complicated maneuvers involving overloads and split-second screens . It is all music to John Wooden . " As long as so many coaches feel there are so many ways to beat the zone press , " he says , " that means no one is really sure . It is evidence that the press is hard to beat . "
