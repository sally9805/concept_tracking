txt The city , after two years of opposition , agreed yesterday to put into contract form what more than 100,000 city employes have come to expect every summer a shorter work day from June to September . The summer issue , together with cash pay for some overtime work rather than equal ' time off , were among the key subjects in a three-year contract agreement announced by the city and District Council 37 of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees . The agreement , praised by Mayor Lindsay as proof that logical and businesslike bargaining could ? occur here , will cover for the first time in one contract the working conditions for a wide variety of workers in different unions . Unions Negotiate on Own The agreement on general working conditions was designed to bring some orderliness to city negotiations . Each union , however , will negotiate its own wages and also those working conditions peculiar to its members . District 37 was chosen by the city to bargain for the workers because it represented more than 50 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept District 37 's bargaining and others indicated they would go along because they felt they had no other choice . Among the workers affected are hospital aides , clerical workers , engineers , social workers , laborers , chemists , park employes and motorvehicle operators . The agreement was reached with the assistance of the Office of Collective Bargaining , an independent body set up , last fall by the city and most public employe unions here to provide mediation and other help in labor disputes . The Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association , which struck earlier this month for nine days , declined to take its dispute with the city before the Office of Collective Bargaining . Arvid Anderson , chairman of the bargaining office , said at a news conference in its offices at 250 - Broadway that he was pleased that it had resolved peacefully its first major dispute . At his remarks , some newsmen quickly looked to Mr. Anderson 's left at ' Herbert L. Haber , the city 's director of labor relations , who had a large bandage on his forehead and two slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assured everyone that his appearance was a result of an operation , not the negotiations . The accord on the summer work hours means that the city employes will continue to stop work at 4 P.M. , instead of 5 P.M. , from June 15 to September 15 . But the union , represented by Victor Gotbaum , its executive director , agreed that each worker would give up one hour every 10 working days during the summer so that skeleton staffs could be on hand in all departments after 4 P.M. In theory , the skeleton staffs existed in past summers in the event of emergencies , but even skeletons were hard to find after 4 P.M. in many offices . Now the procedure will be more formal and organized . Mayor Lindsay tried to end the shorter summer work day almost two years ago , but after much discussion with unions , he agreed to submit the question to arbitration . The arbitrator said that a nine-year-old tradition could not be summarily abolished . The city relented , but promised to fight again in the 1967 contract talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of the new contract , which is retroactive to last July . One , difficulty in calculating the total cost , he said , was the new provision for cash payments for work after 40 hours a week . At present employes generally get equal time off for all work after 35 hours , the normal work week . In the new contract , they will receive equal time off for the first five hours of overtime , and then cash for everything over 40 hours . The overtime cash rates will be straight time pay beginning March 15 , until Jan. 1 , 1969 ; time and a quarter until Jan. 1 , 1970 , and time and a half to June 30 , 1970 . The parties also agreed to set up permanent labor-management committees to deal ( with problems as they arise . IMr . Haber said that the clues ; don of promotions and seniority , particularly with regard to the formation of new departments and agencies , would be considered by the committees .
