Beset by financial woes , California 's pioneering Douglas Aircraft Co. last week was 1 ) negotiating with eight banks for a loan of about $100 million , some $56 million of which the company hopes to have underwritten by the Defense Department , 2 ) understood to be seeking $175 million more , for a total of $275 million in financing , and 3 ) taking evasive action from what appears to be a strong takeover effort by the McDonnell Co. of St. Louis . <P> Although such a move has been rumored for weeks , confirmation of a sizable McDonnell holding of Douglas common stock surprised both Wall Street and Washington . Until early this year , the McDonnell Co. controlled 58,726 shares in Douglas . This block of stock plus Chairman James S. McDonnell 's private holdings were all that remained of McDonnell 's abortive 1963 effort toward a merger of the two companies . At the time , Douglas turned " Mr. Mac " down cold . <P> Unloading at the Right Time . In June , McDonnell gave notice that it had sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the time that it reached its peak of 112 , reaped a net profit of $2,600,000 . But by last week , after the stock had nosedived to 30 , then looped back up past 40 , sources close to both companies estimated that Mr. Mac and closely associated " interests " had between them amassed 800,000 Douglas shares out of 5,200,000 outstanding . Reportedly , McDonnell himself now owns between 200,000 and 300,000-at least 20 times more than those owned by Chairman Donald W. Douglas , 74 , and President Donald W. Douglas Jr. , 49 , who also unloaded most of their Douglas common early this year . At week 's end , Douglas common climbed to 46 , and there was talk about an imminent tender offer that would give McDonnell undisputed control . <P> Cowling-Deep in Red Ink . A merger at this time , some observers feel , might be the best thing that could happen to Douglas . Ironically , nothing has failed the company so much as success . Swamped with a $3 billion backlog of orders , Douglas has burned up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company reported nine-month losses of $16.4 million . And despite a record November output of twelve commercial jet transports worth $38 million , Douglas is four months behind in its delivery dates , slipping further because of continuing shortages of skilled aircraft workers and a lag in deliveries of jet engines and other items from outside suppliers . The marriage Mr. Mac pines for would neatly couple Douglas ' essentially commercial output with a McDonnell product line that is mostly military , under a McDonnell management team that is highly regarded throughout the industry .
