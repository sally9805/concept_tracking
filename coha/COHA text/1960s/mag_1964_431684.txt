 | I Rode teh Jet Freight to Shannon TIME : midnight . Pan American 's slick new sky truck glints in the lights of New York 's Kennedy Airport . She 's the newest thing in swept wings : one of 13 Pan Am all-cargo jets now flying the oceans . She 's a Boeing 707-321-C . The C stands for cargo . The 321 means she 's fan-powered for greater lift and range . They 've also beefed up her landing struts . Tonight she 's running Flight 160 , allfreight , no passengers , Chicago to Shannon via Detroit and New York . Four hours ago , Photographer Ed Lamme and I left Chicago in this glittering bird with eight tons of Midwest freight . Industry 's rush to get goods on sale in foreign cities the next day is on . Minutes later we swooped into Detroit , grabbed two tons more , and whizzed to New York at 585 m.p.h . Right now there 's a whole trainload of airport trucks rushing up to her , each with two tons more . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing like this mountain of stuff : tractor parts for Rome , auto tools for Beirut , frozen shrimp for Tokyo , suits and dresses for London , even a turbine blade for a steamship broken down in Bombay . Never have I seen freight loaded so fast . Takeoff is set for one a.m . At 12:45 Ed and I swing back up the ladder . Ed , camera in hand , beefs : " She 's so big I had to walk back a whole city block to get her all in . " I 'm wondering : How can she possibly lift all that stuff ? It 's crammed ceilinghigh from cockpit to tail . I 've ridden some pretty hot freight runs ? truck and train ? in the U. S. And I 've learned something about cargo . It is n't the tame stuff you think . It 's a negative force . As any truck driver knows , it has a mind of its own . It hates to go places . And most of all it hates to go uphill . It fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in a fast " Carolina " van . And I 've felt it trying to wrestle three locomotives to a stop on an Allegheny  | mountain grade . Tonight it will fight us , too . 1 a.m. : Someone slams the cargo door and hollers , " Good luck ! " When we start to taxi we 're as heavy as a duck with a belly full of pig iron . We sit right behind the crew . Turning , Ed and I can see the great piles of freight . Ahead , we see the blue lights of the taxi strips coming toward us . Four men are on our flight deck : Captain Donald Loomis , a tall , affable Midwesterner ; First Officer ( and copilot ) Roy Furphy , of Brooklyn , alert and full of wisecracks ; Second Officer ( and navigator ) Frank Stark of Levittown , N. Y. ; and Engineer Mike Torell of South Hempstead , N. Y. , who lives with his eyes glued to his fuel systems . While we taxi I see Torell reading the weight-and-balance report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fantastic : Cargo : 61,556 lb. 31 tons Fuel : 112,000 lb. 56 tons Wt. of plane empty : 309,269 lb. 155 tons That 's a staggering 482,825 pounds , or 241 tons . No wonder we 're crawling . Stark says : " There 's something else that does n't show . They gave us 4,000 pounds of extra fuel for taxiing . " I 'm thinking about our tires . Before we left Chicago I had walked under the wing . to see the beefed-up struts . They looked like the underpinnings of a skyscraper . But I 'd also seen our tires . After the few flights this 707 has made , they 're already scorched and tired . No one else seems to notice . But with the load we have tonight I 'd feel a lot better if Maintenance had given us new ones . Frankly - I had been impressed by Pan Am thoroughness . And I 'm surprised Maintenance has let us go on eight weary tread . Also : I know the maps show a big storm waiting for us . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tread would help . 1:17 a.m. : The freight feels every runway bump . We 're really dragging tai ' . Suddenly , the long , dark runway arrow out ahead . When we get to the end of the taxiwav we do n't stop ; we just whir ! around in a fast turn and keep going . This is a surprise , and a head start . The flight deck is suddenly tense . Every man , eyes are glued ahead ? except Torell's. and his are on the fuel systems . Our four Pratt &; Whitney fan jets , each of which packs a nine-ton punch , are singing the high nervous song that comes before takeoff . Then ... " Ninety-percent power ! " Loomis calls out . Furphy rams the throttles forward . @# I squeeze past the freight to look over our cargo . It 's spooky . Dim blue ceiling lights glint weirdly on acres of plastic sheeting that cover 13 huge piles of freight . A crewman explained the plastic : " We never know what the weather is going to be when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tied down with yards and yards of high-test nylon webbing and anchored to the floor .  | Those big Pratt &; Whitney blowtorches explode : whoom ! We start hard . You feel all that freight wanting to star in America . The fan jets roar . It 's obvious we 'll never fly . Better go back and off-load 10 tons . Furphy is calling off speeds : " Fifty .. . seventy . . . ninety . " Too slow . Our headlights are gobbling up runway . Then the tower goes past . " One-twenty ! " A passenger jet would be 500 feet up . But we 're still clown here . A sudden jolt shakes the plane . Our landing gear is up and we 're off the runway . Loomis never takes his eyes from the yellow runway stripe . A second jolt : The nosewheels are up . Loomis calls : " Full power ! " Furphy punches the throttles all the way . It 's a gesture that says : " Hell , let 's get with it ! " And suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One-thirty-five ! " Ed and I are flung hard against our seats . My suitcase says so long , and goes back to join the freight . Loomis hauls back on the wheel . Our nose leaps up like a happy porpoise . We go up like a skyrocket in a series of great power surges . We look back down the tilted cargo deck . Thirty-one tons of freight in there and we could n't care less . A feeling of great speed sets in , unusual in a plane . A pleasant whispering sound , the wind song , settles over the flight deck . Time : 1:20 a.m . THERE 'S a blue-green streak below : a turnpike where trucks are roaring east . In five hours , with luck , they 'll make Boston . In five hours this sky van will be homing-in on Shannon , Ireland . 1:37 a.m. : Lights of Providence , lights of Boston . Then blackness : the Atlantic . 1:40 : Lights of Portland , lights of Nova Scotia , lights of Newfoundland . Then blackness again . 3:26 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note on his big ocean chart : " OVHD 0726 + 6 " ( overhead Gander airport at 7:26 a.m . Greenwich , six minutes ahead of schedule ) . Now Stark quits the flight deck . Flashlight in hand , he goes back for a look at the cargo . I follow . First we climb through a spiderweb of nylon ? a net that 's supposed to catch anything that might break loose . We squeeze down the catwalk between the freight and the plane 's side . Stark casts his light on a bubble level  | in the ceiling that shows the p ' : . perfectly balanced . The cargo is all in 3:50 : The plane whistles on , smooth silk . No sign of storm ? yet . But tr four a.m. bells ring . Stark motions fasten seat belts . What 's up ? " A high cloud ahead , " he says . " It get a bit choppy . " Suddenly we quiver like a car on an cobblestone street . But in two minutes . shaking stops . You go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly the weather is changing . R ' hitched a ride on a 100-m.p.h. jets Frost forms on the round porthole by seat . Stark says : " It 's 59 below zero side that glass . We 're now at 33,000. our speed just jumped to 700 m.p.h. heating the fuel in the wing tanks . " Before we left New York someone tossed a Navy hammock aboard . Now drag it aft and sling it between the I " brain " and the turbine blade for the in Bombay . Dozing , I try to imagine 700-m.p.h. truck . It 's no good . It 's i to realize we 're really a 200-ton bullet I doze 90 minutes , during which Flight 160 talks with an ocean ship , flies miles , meets the dawn and then ? in brief minutes ? raises the sun dead ahead And suddenly bells are ringing again . I hurry forward . Stark jerks a theta toward clouds , three miles below . " We ' . going down , " he says . BEFORE you can land a 700-m.p.h. bullet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of doing . Loomis fiddles with the trim-tab control . Stark makes a last chi . mark on his chart . Torell is watching fin . We 've burned 80 tons ? but we carry m , reserve than a passenger jet . 6:10 a.m . ( New York time ) : We 're still 150 miles from Ireland when Loomis draw back on the throttles . The plane comes t a full stop in midair , then begins backing up . Or that 's how it feels when you suddenly throttle from 700 to 500 m.p.h . Stark whispers : " Not much power non . A loud buzzer sounds , warning that were slowing without lowering wheels . But Loomis is n't ready for wheels . At this speed they 'd rip off . And then we hit the storm and the light goes out . We 're in clouds so black we cant see our nearest engine . We quiver through @# e  | the oily stuff , and when we come out the w hole leading edge of our wing has folded dawn . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's startling but okay . Loomis has lowered the front-edge flaps , s imething few planes have . They start biting the windstream , and we 're down to 425 . " Losing 2,000 feet a minute , " says Stark . Nov the rear flaps , bigger and more powerful . ram down like claws behind the wing . They 're really big sails . They grab the wind and haul us down to 350 . Rain streams off the wing . The clouds come apart . There 's a cove below , and a boat in it , and a farmhouse on the shore . stark says : " There 's the auld sod , green as always ! " From the top of the wing rise two walls of steel , huge as barn doors , straight up . These are our great " spoilers , " the speed brakes . Suddenly the runway is reaching up for our eight main-landing-gear tires . Every eye is on that wet runway . Loomis fixes his on a cross of gold , the brilliant approach lights . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the threshold at 110 . But with our weight ? Furphy has looked it up on a chart ? our speed must circular saw hind saw jig saw sabre saw disc sander belt sander moulder lathe be exactly 137 . Furphy is calling out : " 200 . . . 180 . . . 160 . " We 're joggling down , and now again that freight comes to life . You feel 31 tons right over your neck . The runway leaps at us. " 130 ! " calls Furphy . We 're under speed . Loomis feathers the throttles . The Pratt &; Whitneys blow one quick puff . The plane jumps ahead . " 137 on the nose ! " Furphy calls . " Nice ! " When we touch I never know , so light is Loomis ' landing . He touches the reversethrust . It 's as if we 'd dropped an anchor . And so , abruptly , we come to Shannon . New York time , it 's 6:40 . Here it 's 11:40 . Back home , those trucks will be pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I climb down . The bottom of our wing , so recently 59 degrees below zero , is sheathed in ice . But what catches our eye is those eight main landing tires . They 're smoking-hot ? and they 're brandnew . So Maintenance had noticed ! While we 'd loaded in New York , every single tire had been changed . I begin to see why Pan American , at the moment of our landing here , safely achieved its 116,558th ocean flight ! .
