txt Mayor Lindsay , City Council President Frank D. O'Connor and City Controller Mario A. Procaccino made common cause today in appealing for what they called " desperately needed " financial assistance for New York . The city 's three top elected officials  --  a Republican and two Democrats  --  came to the Capitol to testify before the joint fiscal committees of the Legislature . They marshaled a wideranging set of statistics to support their position that the city was getting less than its fair share of state aid . But before the day was out , Earl W. Budges , the Republican majority leader of the Senate , and Joseph Zaretzki , the minority leader , said the city " did not have a chance " of getting significant additional aid . Legislators Warned At an afternoon news conference just before leaving Albany , Mayor Lindsay said that " in the last analysis those legislators , particularly from the city , will have to answer to the voters if they shirk their duty to give us our fair share of state aid . " Senator Zaretzki represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony before the Senate Finance Committee and the Assembly Ways and Means Committee , Mayor Lindsay held private meetings with legislative leaders at which he presented alternate plans for a unified city transit system that would place the Transit Authority and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority under a transit coordinator . The city 's appeal to the Legislature for more money had its dramatic aspe , cts . It was the first time within memory that all three of the city 's top elected officials had come to Albany to testify before the joint fiscal committees . The fact that the Mayor and his two associates in the city government were of different political parties underlined the urgency of their request . In his testimony , Mr. O'Connor said that " partisan politics " could have no place on an issue in which the financial wellbeing of the city was involved . " I take personal satisfaction in being an equal participant with my two colleagues in this joint enterprise , " Mr. O'Connor . said . " To some extent we may have broken with tradition in joining in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if it is ' precedent-breaking , it only underscores a vital fact  --  New York City 's needs are so compelling that no precedent can be an obstacle . " It is in the finest tradition of government , for city , officers , of different political ! parties , to submerge their party distinction and become welded ! together when issues of supreme , importance arise . " Tax Reforms Coming In renewing before the legislative committees an appeal he had made to Governor Rockefeller for $594-million more in state aid , Mayor Lindsay said that he was bringing new credentials because his administration intended to put its budgetary house in order by trimming unnecessary expenses and by increasing city taxes . " I believe the tax reform package , which will be presented to this Legislature , " Mr. Lindsay said , " will demonstrate unmistakedly that the officials of New York City are at last coming to grips with the runaway financial affairs of the metropolis . " The Mayor said that while the Federal Government 's obligation to give additional financial aid to the city was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " more direct , " because the prosperity of the state and the city were " interdependent . " Mr. Lindsay said the city faced budget deficits of morel , than $1-billion between now and ' July 1 , 1967 . The budget , which ' now totals $3.9-billion , is expected to reach $4.5-billion for the next fiscal year . beginning July 1 , according to the Mayor 's fiscal experts . Mr. Lindsay said that the city was not seeking " doles or handouts , " but rather to present a case for assistance , " which we believe we have every logical , equitable right . " The Mayor said that his largest request for additional aid$238-million  --  was for primary and secondary education , on which the city 's expenditures have increased by 50 per cent in five years . He , along with Mr. Procaccino and Mr. O'Connor , pointed out that , while the city was scheduled to receive $311 a pupil in state aid in the next fiscal year , all other districts in the state would receive $480 a pupil . Several Bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills to change the educational aid formulas so as to give the city " a more equitable share of aid in the light of the supplemental costs of education in the city . " Several factors contribute to this inequity in per-pupil assistance , including the fact that the formula measures real estate valuation against pupil attendance . Mayor Lindsay said : " In the city , the incredibly high value of Manhattan real estate falsely inflates the combined worth of all five boroughs . If the formula were applied individually to each borough , the city as a whole would qualify for at least $87-million additional in state aid each year . " In the realm of higher education , the Mayor said that Governor Rockefeller 's proposed budget provided $198.6-million for the state university , but only $45.4-million for the City University . " The state should do for the City University student what it is already doing for the State University student , " Mr. Lindsay asserted . He pointed out that the state collected $65-million annually in pari-mutuel taxes on bets placed at the Aqueduct Race track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Lindsay said , " But the city provides virtually all of the services enabling the bettors to get to and from the track . Our recommendation is that the state return 50 per cent of its tax revenues from Aqueduct to New York City , and from the Belmont race track when it opens . " Mr. Procaccino asked the Legislature to legalize offtrack betting . " The best estimates of the revenue to be derived through the legalization of offtrack betting are still in the neighborhood of $200-million annually after the first three years of operation , this revenue to be shared by the city and the state , " Mr. Procaccino said . He also said that the Tr -- borough Bridge and Tunnel Authority was " a prosperous concern doing a large business and making a large profit . " " There is little or no reason why the authority  --  the same as any other enterprise for profit  --  should not pay real estate taxes , or make payments in lieu of taxes , " the Controller said . In all , 33 witnesses testified today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance budget , compared with 23 witnesses last year . Among those testifying were Gustave G. Rosenberg , chairman of the city 's Board of Higher Education , and Bernard E. Donovan , Superintendent of Schools . Both protested that the city was not getting its fair share of state aid to education .
