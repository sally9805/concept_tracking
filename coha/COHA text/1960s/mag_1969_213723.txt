IT was the first full week of the spring semester on many campuses , and students responded to the symbolic change of seasons by provoking a spate of violent clashes with authorities . Almost everywhere , the " confrontations , " as the students like to call them , were precipitated by the now familiar demands of black students and their white sympathizers . They were asking for segregated student facilities , more courses in black culture , more black students and teachers , and a greater voice in the hiring and firing of faculty . Even where efforts are being made to meet their demands , they are still unsatisfied . In some cases , uncompromising campus militants seem more interested in disorganizing college administrations than in reorganizing curriculums . Often , they are succeeding . And school authorities and government officials , for the most part , are taking an increasingly hard-line approach to the student rebels .

Using clubs , tear gas and bayonets , the Guardsmen and police dispersed numerous bands of student strikers ; 21 students were arrested .

But just as it seemed that violence had been avoided by the administration 's firmness , a 90-minute brawl erupted between police , the black protesters and 1,000 white student supporters . After tear gas and clubs failed to break up the demonstration , the police departed under a fusillade of insults . By then , three dozen students and police had been injured ; five people , four of them Duke students , were arrested . Governor Robert W. Scott quickly placed the North Carolina National Guard on alert . <P> - At City College of New York , 100 members of an organization that calls itself " The Black and Puerto Rican Student Community " angrily spurned what C.C.N.Y. President Buell G. Gallagher called " affirmative answers to all their demands , " occupied the administration building , broke into Gallagher 's office and sampled his private stock of liquor . Despite the provocations , C.C.N.Y. officials tried the tactic of ignoring the demonstrators , and it worked-for the moment . After four hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
