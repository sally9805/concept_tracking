txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 22 ? President Nixon has had a sorry time of it since his return from San Clemente . The price index keeps rising . The Civil Rights Commission abruptly called his hand on the Administration 's backdown on Southern school segregation . The Governors are saying the new revenue-sharing plan is only a drop in the bucket . The House put egg on the famous five o'clock shadow by rolling up a huge majority for direct Presidential elections . which Mr. Nixon had said could n't pass . And the students and the Vietcong derided his draft cuts as trickery . Innovative Act Nobody need feel sorry for a President , whoever he is ; in fact , more people ought to figure out ways to hold his feet to the fire , whoever he is . Even so , the recent bombardment of Mr. Nixon makes this an appropriate time to point out that , despite obvious and flagrant deficiencies , his welfare reform proposal is the most courageous and innovative act of his Administration . Its adoption of the so-called income approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nixon , unfortunately , is ludicrous . He suggests $1,600 a year in Federal money for a family of four ; but the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' lowest estimate of living costs is $5,500 for the same family , and even that amount would not include ? for example  --  anything for furniture or clothing replace . ment . The state equalizing principle , which is equitable on its face , in fact will penalize some of the neediest welfare recipients ? black , Puerto Rican or Mexican-American female heads of family , These tend to be concentrated in big cities in the major industrial states  --  most of which now provide more than $1,600 annually for a family of four . It is to the credit of the Nixon plan that the equalizing feature is designed to raise some outrageously low state payments ; the $1,600 figure , for instance , would quadruple Mississippi 's niggardly outlay . But nothing in the plan guarantees that welfare recipients in 31 states that now have a higher standard than $1,600 will not lose money . Mr. Nixon apparently plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is poor assurance ; many states regularly circumvent welfare regulations . The Nixon plan would require all recipients , including mothers of school-age children , to accept jobs or training . This may make the plan more palatable politically , but it is not one ofilts ' more enlightened ideas . Recipients would not have even the standards written into the unemployment compensation laws to protect them against unsuitable or exploitative jobs , and the new work rules would be imposed whether or not unemployment again becomes a considerable problem . Progressive Features But against these deficiencies must be set a number of progressive features . Since most certifying of need would be done by affidavit , there would be far less of the onerous policing of the poor that results from the present investigatory system . Moreover , the plan would make eligible perhaps 1.5 million more families with dependent children  --  about 6.5 million more people  --  than the present program ; altogether , Mr. Nixon 's proposals would aid four million additional families , or about 19 million more people , and that would at last begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether Congress will be as inclusive as the Nixon proposals , of course , is doubtful indeed . But the Nixon welfare reform is notable above all for its acceptance of the principle of a right to income . Its $1,600 annual standard does not begin to be enough for a family of four , but the so-called " work incentive " is well-conceived . Before losing any part of the basic $1,600 , a working recipi : ent would be entitled to retain the first $60 of monthly earnings , plus half of the remainder of his earnings . A family of four would be entitled to earn up to $3,920 a year before losing 100 per cent of the $1,600 basic standard . That is still more than $1,500 less than the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' - lowest estimate of needs of a family of four . But it is important to establish the principle of a right to money income , in place of the crazy quilt of food programs , handouts , social services and grants of assistance relied on so ineffectively in the past ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and want to work be given a real money incentive to do so , rather than having their earnings taxed at 100 per cent , , , as at present . The Income Principle The income principle , in fact , gives some of the poor a real chance to make their way upward in the best free-enterprise fashion . But since it aims at giving all the poor a subsistence ' income , it will undoubtedly be bitterly opposed as " something for nothing . " Mr. Nixon 's disregard for this danger is the ' most notable act of his Administration .
