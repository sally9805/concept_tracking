The search for a successor to New York Stock Exchange President Keith Funston took a full seven months . This week , unless there is a last-minute change of mind , the Big Board will announce that it has found the man for the $125,000-a-year post . He is Robert W. Haack , 50 , who as head of the National Association of Securities Dealers has been policeman of the nation 's over-the-counter securities market for the past three years . <P> Haack 's elevation , which is expected to be formally approved by the exchange 's 33-man board of governors in May , will come none too soon . Because of Funston 's lame-duck status , the Big Board has been more or less marking time in its imminent showdown with the Securities and Exchange Commission , which wants some basic reforms in brokerage commission practices-notably , the elimination of " give-ups , " by which brokers doing business on behalf of mutual funds split their commissions . In fact , one reason for the difficulty in selecting a new president was the resistance of conservative members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat too much . <P> <P> Although he is no windmill-tilting crusader , Bob Haack will bring to the Big Board presidency a deep knowledge of the securities business and a proven knack for prudent reform . An amiable , soft-spoken man with a ready smile , Haack was born in Milwaukee , graduated from Michigan 's Hope College and Harvard Business School , in 1940 joined the Wisconsin Co. , a Milwaukeebased investment banking firm , as a $125-a-month securities analyst . After a Navy hitch in the South Pacific during World War II , Haack returned to the firm-subsequently renamed Robert W. Baird &; Co. - and worked in underwriting , sales and trading before becoming a partner in 1950 . Haack further broadened his experience as a governor of the Midwest Stock Exchange , moved to Washington in 1964 as the $80,000-a-year president of the N.A.S.D. <P> Created by act of Congress , the quasi-official association had , until then , been less than effective in regulating the rapidly expanding but hopelessly decentralized over-the-counter market . Haack quickly stamped himself as a man who could work closely with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's member firms in mind . He strengthened the association 's staff , made available more realistic stock quotations , stiffened requirements for dealing in securities . At the same time , arguing that more thorough study was required , he held out against SEC insistence on tighter supervision of mutual-fund sales practices . <P> Aside from an occasional round of golf , Haack is pretty much of a homebody , insists that his family ( he and his wife , Catherine , have four children , aged 14 to 22 ) is his only real hobby . At the time he joined the N.A.S.D. , he characteristically expressed regret at abandoning the " relatively uncomplicated " life he had been living in Milwaukee . What with the SEC and member firms looking over his shoulder , Haack might find that his life as capitalism 's No. 1 salesman is quite complicated .
