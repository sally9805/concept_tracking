txt The Johnson Administration is becoming increasingly intrigued with a far-reaching new goal : Ending poverty via a Government guarantee of a minimum income for every American family . Vietnam-induced budget strains and Johnsonian political caution are ruling out a direct frontal approach , however , in favor of a more gradual sneaking-up on the objective . Out of the question for the considerable future are the so-called negative income tax and other novel , dramatic and costly " income maintenance " schemes for direct Government cash payments to all families whose incomes fall belgw certain " poverty levels . " This week Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith spoke up for such a plan , and New York Mayor John Lindsay supported /um . ) Instead , there will be a series of smaller moves , some to be unveiled in next January 's legislative program and budget , to patch up and fatten up existing Government programs that head in the same direction : Bigger Social Security benefits , a modest expansion of public-assistance coverage and payments , more rent supplement money and other subsidies for low-income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't find private work . New Route , Same Goal Year by year . the theory goes . benefits under these and other programs would be increased , and more and more poor folk would be given some sort of help . A few years hence . it 's figured , almost every needy family would actually be getting enough Government help to rise out of poverty . Thus the end result would he much the same as that of the negative income tax and kindred schemes . " Right now . " says one White House aide . " Government payments to poor people are made only if they 're old or blind or disabled or have little kids or worked a certain length of time before . There is a definite desire shaping up  --  you might almost say a consensus ? to try and make some form of payment based simply on the fact that a person is poor and ca n't seem to do anything about it . The question is just how best to reach that system , and how fast . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and the Job Corps and all the rest . " says another highranking Administration man . " and you have to keep trying to improve the poverty environment through ' demonstration cities ' and community action and similar programs . But you 're still going to have large groups of poor people  --  the old or handicapped or the woman with no husband and four kids  --  who are n't helped by any of these , and you need something else to give them minimum living levels . I do n't think it matters too much just how you do it . " Impact of Vietnam The negative income tax , which would use the tax system as the channel for direct Government payments to the poor , and similar schemes began getting attention in late 1964. when budget surpluses and more tax cuts seemed likely . But now the Vietnam war and Great Society programs threaten to soak up every available Government dollar , and farreaching and expensive new antipoverty schemes are clearly out for the duration . Estimated costs of the more comprehensive income-maintenance proposals range all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government officials reckon it would cost at least $6 billion to S7 billion to move the more than 30 million " poor " people just halfway from their present incomes to the minimum desired levels-53,000 a year for a family of four . Though a start could be made for much less , even the advocates agree the effort would be pointless if less than $3 billion or $4 billion were available . Besides , the more Administration official , - look at the negative income tax and such schemes , the harder such proposals seem to " sell " to Congress and the public . The thought of a Government cash handout for no work at all , merely to make people less poor , appears alien to a work-oriented society and makes most politicians shudder . And Lyndon Johnson 's tendency to take the path offering the best hope of practical political success , most officials reason , means patching up and increasing existing income-boosting programs rather than striking out in bold new directions . Longer Jobless Benefits ? Some patch-up moves are already being made , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Senate-House conference committee is considering a bill that would provide Federal funds to induce states to pay larger and longer unemployment benefits ; the present maximum is 26 weeks . If the committee rejects the idea for this year , the Administration will surely try again . Also , the antipoverty bill now going through Congress includes funds for the Government to hire 30,000 to 40,000 untrained , unemployed poor people to work as hospital orderlies , nurses ' aides , - playground helpers , waterfront clean-up men , teacher assistants and library helpers , and the like . This would expand a program started last year under the sponsorship of Democratic Sen. Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin , putting the poor to work on conservation and beautification projects . Within the Health , Education and Welfare Department , a task force headed by Assistant Secretary William Gorham is reviewing the entire problem of " inadequate " incomes . He 's getting help from Harvard economist Otto Eckstein , former member of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , and cooperation from officials in other departments . Recommendations will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President already has promised a " substannal " increase in Social Security benefits next year : officials are Milting of anywhere from 74i. to 15 ' : . Congressional pressures are working for steeper increases : Democratic Sen. Robert Kennedy of New York heads a group of 10 Senators seeking a 50e ; jump . The planners even think of making all old people eligible for Social Security benefits . inch.tmg those who never contributed a nickel to the system during their working years . Perhaps one-fourth to one-third of existing poverty could be eliminated with more generous Social Security and unemployment insurance . estimates Social Security Commissioner Robert Bali . Encouraged by a recent report of a prestigious HEW Advisory Council on Public Welfare consisting of non-government welfare authorities . Administration officials also are talking of making public assistance programs more generous . Now , it 's estimated , less than 8 million poor people are helped by the Federally-aided state programs for the aged , blind , totally disabled and dependent children , and welfare officials consider the payments very low . The average public assistance payment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faintly of four with dependent children is $1,728 . Among changes being discussed in the Administration : Requiring all states with programs of public assistance to families with dependent children to make payments e ' . en though the unemployed father is living with the family ( at present . 29 states and the District of Columbia make payments only if the father is dead or missing , and critics say this proviso frequently forces a father to desert his family ) : banning of lengthy state residence requirements as a condition for receiving Federal/y-supplemented state relief payments : permitting welfare recipients to keep some of their outside dollar earnings . rather than reducing relief payments dollar for dollar of outside income and thus discouraging the recipients from looking for work ; relaxing welfare workers ' time-consuming and exhaustive investigations of relief recipients ' eligibility and substituting simple affidavits by the poor and spot-checks by welfare investigators . Farther down the road , most likely , is action on a proposal featured in the welfare avisory council report : it ** for the Federal Government to set minimum levels for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many states ) and pay most of the cost of the higher payments . There surely will be expansion of literacy and job training programs to **upgrade people " and in , reared Goxernment " payments-in-Isind " to the poor On top of mech. cat e and various ** state medical programs for the needy , the President has promised a program of dental care for children . And there are moves in the Government for more free school breakfasts and lunches , more food stamp plans and rent subsidies , neighborhood health centers , dayrare centers for children so mothers can work , legal aid and visiting nurse progrt.ms for the poor . " I ca n't see the President submitting a message to Congress in January 1967 or even 1068 or 1969 or 1970 saying he wants these five or six hills as part of a package to guarantee every family at least 33,000 a year of income , " one Presidential aide declares . " But I can see him hacking bilk each year that gradually move in that direction , and perhaps in the 1968 campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone out of poverty within a few years " The reason for all the interest and activity is clear enough : A concern that despite general prosperity . over 30 million people . in some 12 million families , remain " poor " -a drag on U.S. society and the national economy . iThe last official figure was 34.1 million in 1964 , but Government statisticians figure rising employment and incomes have probably dropped the total a few million . ) About 3C of all the poor , officials say , are in families where because of sickness or age no one is likely to he employed ; many others are in families where the sole breadwinner makes woefully small sums . Government help for the poor 1.9 already massive and expensive , of course . The President 's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that in the fiscal year ended in June 1965 some SO billion was spent on public assistance , Social Security , job training and other aid programs , with over one-half going to persons below the poverty levels . But most Govern . ment officials argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing enough to help its poor . The whole subject has been getting intensive study in the past couple of years . The negative income tax has twice been urged on the White House by Sargent Shriver 's poverty-fighters , once in 1964 and again in 1965 . Early this year the National Commission on Technology , Automation and Economic Progress , consisting of business , labor and academic leaders , and more recently the planning council for the White House conference on civil .
