The lord mayor then framed a notice and had it hung on his residence , the Mansion house . Butler , in Exeter all day , had the easiest day of any home secretary in centuries . Until 1948 he , by custom . would have been required to remain at the palace until the royal child arrived . Until Queen Victoria 's day , cabinet ministers thought they were as necessary as the physicians to certify the birth .

Princess Margaret , sister of Queen Elizabeth , drops from third to fourth rung . The last child born to a reigning British monarch was Princess Beatrice , born in 1857 to Queen Victoria . Expected Up Soon The queen probably will be up soon . Dr. John Peel , her obstetrician , likes his patients to get up in two or three days . The new baby was n't weighed immediately .
