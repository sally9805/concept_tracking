THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE have had occasion in the past , in this space , to take note of the words of ex-Presidents , our living repositories of history , our oracles without portfolio . Some days ago , in Independence , Missouri , former President Truman , at the dedication of the Harry S. Truman Center for Advancement of Peace , in Jerusalem , delivered himself , with an unblinking pungency that belied his eighty-one years , of a melancholy pronouncement indeed . " It all seems to have been in vain , " he said , speaking of his own Presidential career , in which he dealt  --  rather successfully , it appears in retrospect  --  with the international ambitions of the Soviet Union . " Memories arc short and appetites for power and glory are insatiable . Old tyrants depart . New ones take their places . Old differences are composed , new differences arise . Old allies become the foe . The recent enemy becomes the friend . It 's all very baffling and trying . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope he does not really believe that his courage and resourcefulness at the frigid height of the old Cold War were in vain . Since Heraclitus , mankind has been in possession of the truth that everything flows . Flux is the ground whereon men and states alike achieve their provisional victories , which are not meaningless because they become obsolete . The search for peace is a search not for a fixed object but for a temporary adjustment , a balance of aggressions ; we do not agree with those who view a master of patchwork Iike , say , Metternich  --  as somehow absurd because an eventual holocaust unravelled everything . In an interim of truce , thousands of babies can be born healthy and thousands of old people can die in their beds . There is nothing undignified or futile about buying time ; it is the only item on the counter .

The next day was Eid al Fin- , a holiday that is celebrated throughout Islam , and the Islamic Foundation of New York , which attends to the religious needs of the city 's Muslim community , had arranged for a namaz , or prayer service , to he held in the Albert Hall of the Americana Hotel at nine-thirty on the morning of the twenty-third . We were invited to attend by a friend of ours from Bengal , Nazre Moin Neazur Rahman , who was planning to take his seven-year-old son , Abu Mahmoud . It was a little before nine on that gray Sunda ) morning when he picked us up , and we drove through deserted , snow-lined streets to the corner of Fifty-fifth Street and Seventh Avenue , where we parked . Abu was wearing a brown duffel coat , and he had put on a new dutali lopi  --  a starched white cap , shaped Like an Army garrison cap , that is worn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families who had come for the service , and in their company we headed for the Albert Hall , which is in the lower lobby , oppo site a gold escalator . There was a long line waiting to go through double glass doors into the temporary prayer hall -- a large room , with squat c.ream-colored columns and blue-damask-covered walls , that is ordinarily rented for banquets or press conferences . The Islamic Foundation had provided a registry book inside , and everyone who entered stopped and wrote his name and address . The improvised mosque was by then half full . About twenty long rows had been formed by men sitting cross-legged on the blue wall-to-wall carpet . Behind them , sitting either on the floor or on chairs , were their wives , daughters , sisters , and mothers . Phrases from the Koran were being recited over a public-address system . Here and there a man was performing his nem= privately , first standing , then prostrating himself in the space between his row and the row ahead . We removed our shoes and , in our stocking feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading down to the room . The landing was crowded with people . Some of them stood on one leg , tugging at galoshes ; others were slipping out of their shoes ; and still others were bending over to untie their children 's shoelaces . There was a row of shoes on each step . As we descended , we saw workmen 's heavy shoes , thin-soled Italian-style shoes with pointed toes , brogues , desert boots , red high-heeled shoes , low patent-leather slippers , shoes still inside their rubbers , children 's new shoes , the thin sandals worn by Indian women , and a pair of white boots . We took our place at the end of a row near the front and gazed about us . The congregation looked as if it had gathered from all over Islam . There were dark-haired , da rkeyed men with olive skins who had probably come from the Arab countries ; there were Africans , wearing 30 FEBRUARY 5 , 196G cloaks held at the shoulder by a pin ; there were Indonesians , some of whom wore long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloths to sit , and later kneel , on ; there were Turks , with fair hair and light eyes and ruddy complexions ; and there were Indians and Pakistanis , a number of the latter wearing wide-bottomed white cotton trousers and long , buttoned-up black coats . There were Europeans  --  people . from Yugoslavia , Albania , and Russia  --  and we saw men with flat faces and Mongoloid eyes and very pink cheeks , whom we took to be descendants of the Tatars . There were also quite a few people whom we took to he Negro Americans . Nearly everyone wore some kind of head covering . There were several men wearing the white cloth headdress hound at the temples by silken cords that we have learned to associate with the Bedouins ; red fezzes with long black tassels , which we have learned to associate with the Shrincrs ; the high black velvet pitii of Indonesia ; turbans of every variety , some tight and neat , and some large and conspicuous ; small embroidered hats like pillboxes ; and knitted skullcaps . The men we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers on a white background . Some worshippers had tied pocket handkerchiefs over their heads , knotting them behind . Only Abu had on a new dupan top , and he kept touching it cautiously as we waited for the service to begin . At nine-thirty , the ifiurm who was to lead the prayers appeared , wearing a loose-fitting , long-sleeved robe of gray and white , and a small white turban . A lectern and a microphone had been set up at the front of the room , and after tapping the microphone with his fingertips the ; MUM began the namaz . After he had given the congregation some instructions , it rose , and he repeated the Arabic words " Allah akhar " ( " God is great " ) seven times , with his back to the congregation ; everyone was facing the east and Mecca . The members of the congregation repeated the words after him , raising their hands to a position slightly below their ears , with the palms forward and the thumbs extended toward the earlobes . After the seventh repetition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imam began reciting the opening verse of the Koran : " Al hamdu Lillah Rahil ( " Praise be to God , the Lord of the Universe " ) . The imam bent over , put his hands on his knees , and spoke the words " Subhana Rabil Azim " ( " Glory be to God the Almighty " ) , and then , after straightening up , prostrated himself twice , each time touching his forehead to the floor and saying " Allah akbar . " As he did this , the rows of men followed his example , and so did the women behind us . The imam read another verse from the Koran , and the prostrations were repeated . He then recited still another verse , and when he had finished , everyone , now in a half-kneeling posture , turned his head first slowly to the right and then slowly to the left , speaking words of greeting : " A salaam u aleikum " ( " Peace be upon you " ) . Then the congregation settled hack into a more comfortable position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some papers on the lec-tern and began addressing us in lightly accented English : " My dear Muslim brothers and sisters , wel-come ! Though we may he far away from the holy shrines associated with the life of our Prophet Mohammed , we arc all united here in this great city in the brotherhood of our faith . Some of us have not seen for many years those holy places and the lands of our birth where our brethren are congregating today , across the ocean , thousands of miles away . Some of us present this morning have never seen those places at all . But we are all brothers , wherever we are on this day , whoever we are . As you kneel next to your brother , you do not say , ' Oh , his skin is black , ' or ' His skin is light , ' or ' Tie is from this country , ' or ' He is from that one , ' or ' I am so rich and he is very poor . ' No , you greet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u aleikum . ' I know all of you are good Muslims , and because you are good Muslims you have no quarrel with your brothers , or with those whose faith is different from your own , or with those who govern the community in which you live . " When the sermon was fin-ished , the people got to their feet and began to converge on the rows of shoes , and on piles of coats that had been stacked on the floor near the stairs . We went up to speak to the imam , a man of medium height with a long face , heavy black eyebrows , and a forthright manner . We learned that his name was Dr. Mohammed Abdul Rauf , and that he was from Cairo and had been in this country a very short time . We asked him who the people are who make up the Muslim community of New York . The diplomatic representatives of the Middle Eastern countries are the largest group , he told us , but there are also many Muslims in business here , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries like Russia , Yugoslavia , and Turkey who are very devout Muslims . We said we had observed a number of Negro Americans , and wondered whether they were recent converts . The imam said no , and went on to explain that although there are recent American converts , some of whom are Negro , most of the people . we had noticed were descendants of African Muslims who had come to the United States generations ago . We had one more question to ask Dr. Rauf : Why , at the end of the prayers , did each member of the congregation look first over his right shoulder anti then over his left ? The imam told us that this was because on the right shoulder there is an angel who records a man 's good deeds and on the left there is an angel who records his evil ones . As a man turns his head , he greets the angels with the words " A salaam u aleikurn , " and that salutation is intended for his brother on each side as well , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined our friends , who were waiting for us at the foot of the gold escalator , and together we went out into the slush of Seventh Avenue . protective device that fills the gap between the foot patrolman , who covers a neighborhood in depth but can not always get to the scene of a crime fast enough , and the patrol car , which moves rapidly but has a limited field of observation . Scooters provide mobility and flexibility . They reduce the opportunity for crime , because they can reach any part of a precinct in a matter of minutes . " This pithy pronouncement was made to us by Inspector Johannes Spreen , the man in charge of the experimental motor-scooter program launched last summer by the Police Department . The scooters have proved so effective in dealing with parking violations ' and with crime on the streets that the Department has decided to expand the program , and the 1966 budget has asked for funds with which to acquire a total of six hundred and eighty-five scooters , the present total being fifty-nine . The expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a huge , rather rumpled-looking man who , as a captain and later as a deputy inspector , fought for the scooter program over a period of five years ; as a sign of his and its success , he was promoted to full inspector late in November . " Scooters have been used in Central Park and Prospect Park for the past two years , " Inspector Spreen told us . " At the moment , we have nine scooters patrolling the parks , thirty on traffic duty in midtown Manhattan , and twenty assigned to what we call our Tactical Scooter Units , for experimental work . Each T.S.U. consists of seven men and six Vespas  --  the spare man fills in when a regular rider is off duty , sick , or in court . The men wear the usual police uniform , plus a light-blue Fiberglas helmet , and they have a two-way Motorola radio slung over the shoulder , and carry a nightstick , either in the hand or fitted into a rack on the Vespa . The scooterrnan is basically a more mobile foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , unlike the radio prowl car , which is controlled by a borough-wide communications unit . The scooter itself is very nimble . It can weave through stalled traffic , jump the curb and travel along the sidewalk , cut through a narrow alley , and patrol a park that is chockablock with benches 97r-v6 , tvA.i " Pardon me , Madam . As I was- going home just now , I could n't help noticing you standing here , wet and weary and a little distraught , and it occurred to me that you , too , might be longing to get home , so . . . " and playground equipment . Moreover , it is relatively cheap . I estimate that a man on a scooter , which costs us three hundred dollars , and equipped with a two-way radio , which costs us seven hundred , can patrol from ten to fifteen foot posts in a quarter of an hour . We may never be able to afford sufficient manpower to put a policeman on every corner , but , with scooters , we can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our crime rate by as much as thirty per cent . " Inspector Spreen suggested that we watch an experimental T.S.U. in action , and soon we found ourself in the back of an unmarked patrol car with Sergeant James P. 1Llarron , of the Central Park scooter squad , who had been assigned to evaluate the unit . The unit was operating , for the first time , in the Seventh Precinct , on the lower East Side ; on this occasion , only four of the scootermen happened to be on hand , the others being off duty ( the unit operates from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. seven days a week ) or in court to testify on arrests made earlier in the week . Sergeant Marron said that the four men , working in pairs , would have to patrol the entire precinct , an area of about twenty blocks . " At first , they 'll be working out sweep patterns , " he said . " This helps them to learn the neighborhood and also to test the reception on their radios  --  sometimes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to keep them moving around as much as possible ; we think they reduce crime simply by being so visible . " Sergeant Marron 's car was equipped to pick up scooter calls , and the first call we heard was for Scooter 20 to check on a noisy motor reported to be outside 54- Ludlow Street . By the time our car reached that address , Scooters 20 and 59 were parked at the curb , and the men had dismounted and were rapping on the windows of an enormous refrigerator truck , whose motor was indeed making a fearful racket . The scootermen roused the driver , who was taking a snooze , and advised him to move his truck along to a non-residential area . As they remounted , another radio call ordered them to the site of a sidewalk injury , at 94 Orchard Street . Our car followed the scooters as far as the corner of Canal and Orchard Streets , where a trailer truck that had failed to round a sharp turn was blocking the intersection . The scooters nipped up onto the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscissored itself and freed the intersection ; by then the scootermen had long since reached 94 Orchard Street , and we found them giving first aid to a young truck driver who had injured himself in an unloading accident . In the course of the next couple of hours , the scootermen flagged down a woman who had driven through a red light , and handed her a summons ; broke up a disorderly group of winebibbers at the corner of Suffolk and Broome Streets ; checked a complaint by a woman that her black raincoat had been spattered with paint from a painter 's bucket standing on a windswept scaffold ; and completed a special sweep of the warehouse district down by the river  --  a favorite dumping ground for stolen automobiles . We were just about to call it a day when Sergeant Marron 's radio crackled into life and we heard one of the scooter-men asking precinct headquarters for a license-plate check of two automobiles parked on Monroe Street . A few minutes later , the precinct dispatcher reported that one of the plates belonged to a stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marron said . " That 's what it takes , and that 's what the scooters give us .

" Ambassador AYEAR ago , when justice Arthur Goldberg was in the Supreme Court , he lived in a house , strolled to work through residential Washington , and had time to read , reflect , and even spend a quiet evening with his wife . Now that Ambassador Goldberg sits in the General Assemhly , on the Security Council , and wherever else he may he needed at the United Nations , he lives in a hotel ( the Waldorf Towers ) , dodges Manhattan traffic in a government limousine , and is so busy trouble-shooting and problem-solving that during the three-month plenary session of the Assembly just concluded he has been able to spend a total of five evenings at home . In his first six months as our Ambassador to the United Nations , Mr. Goldberg has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis , a Rhodesia crisis , and a China-representation crisis ; he has shuttled between Washington and New York with the aplomb of a New Canaan commuter ; and he has recently returned from a whirlwind trip to Europe on a peace mission for the President . From time to time during the latest session of the General Assembly , we watched the Ambassador at work , and we found him to he a remarkably energetic man , with a tough , eager mind , a walk that suggests important business just around the corner , a delivery that is reasoned , clear , and to the point , and a matter-of-fact manner , which is particularly refreshing at the United Nations , where diplomats are apt to behave more like courtiers than like highly placed tacticians of peace . His black-rimmed glasses , which somehow help him to look either judicially objective or fiercely partisan , as the occasion demands , and his head of thick , wiry white hair have made Ambassador Goldberg one of the most instantly identifiable diplomats around . In fact , last fall the reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the Ambassador 's head as a sort of guide to less conspicuous delegates sitting near him on the Assembly floor . " Most heads tend to blur when you look down on them from here , " a reporter in the gallery remarked one day during the China debate . " But if you can spot Goldberg , way over on the right , then you can count two rows over and see if Fcdorenko 's there , or three rows over and two down for Pakistan . " Shortly after Ambassador Goldberg returned from his European trip , we learned that he would he at his desk long enough to receive an afternoon visit , and we called on him at his office in the United States Mission , which is directly across the street from U.N . Headquarters . We arrived outside the Mission just as the Ambassador 's black limousine pulled up at the front door , and we followed him into the elevator and up to his office suite , on the eleventh floor . The Ambassador 's private office is a spacious , sunny corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are wood-panelled . There are gray carpets and a bright Persian throw rug on the floor , two flags , photographs of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson , several green leather armchairs , and a New Frontier rocker . Mrs. Goldberg is a talented painter , and the Ambassador , who is an ardent fan of hers , hangs only her paintings on the walls of his office . While Mr. Goldberg went through a stack of mail that had accumulated during lunch , jotting notes on incoming letters and signing outgoing ones , we admired the paintings and then glanced over at a bookcase , where we noticed several fat legal texts , a book called " Negotiating with the Russians , " and a book called " Everyman 's United Nations . " After a few minutes , Mr. Goldberg put down his pen and picked up the pile of letters he had signed . " TMs , along with dictating , seems to constitute the better part of my day , " he said , rocking hack and forth . We recalled that before his appointment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment to the Court , he was special counsel to the A.F.L.-C.I.O . On several occasions lately , he has compared his old work in labor negotiations with his new work at the United Nations , and we asked him about that . " Well , in labor disputes -- -in this country , anyway  --  no one 's trying to overturn the established order , " he said . " Both sides accept the system . Oh , unions have their demands , but they 're pretty much in tune with the structure of the society . Now , this is not true in international disputes . At the U.N . there is  --  to use the jargon of the place  --  great ideological disorder , and that makes negotiating quite a different sort of thing . Still , maybe because of this disorder , we have to rely more and more on accommodation to settle our differences  --  on a kind of mediation . What I learned as a labor lawyer helps . I do n't think that being absolutely overwhelmed by one 's own cause necessarily makes you a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer or a good negotiator . In both fields , what you have to have is objectivity . " The Ambassador sat hack , and we asked him how he was enjoying his new job . " I would n't call this business exactly enjoyable , " he replied , chuckling . " International affairs are much too frustrating to actually enjoy . Now , the Supreme Court , where I could mull things over and write  --  that 's my idea of the enjoyable . But this work , here at the U.N. -- this I 'd call interesting , fascinating , satisfying , what-have-you , but I 'd never say enjoyable . You know , I left the Court with considerable reluctance . I think it is a great force in perfecting democracy . And then , too , it is an independent institution , whereas here I 'm part of an administration , and that makes my job more difficult in many ways . What motivated me is my real conviction that the great issue today is the issue of war and peace . When I was a judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and now , the way I see it , I 'm trying to bring some rule of law into the world . The U.N . ' s job is really the making of international law . Now , that 's a long-range goal and we 're far from reaching it , but it 's my idea of what the United Nations is all about . There 's a lot of misunderstanding as to what international law is . The common idea of what constitutes the law is too narrow . People often ca n't see the U.N . ' s role as an international lawmaker and an international court of law . But law , really , is conduct  --  conduct that has sanctions behind it and agreement behind it . And that means that any and every agreement between nations is part of international law . The treaties of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land . ' That 's what our Constitution says , you know . Of course , in international law you have completely different problems of enforcement . What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or resolution is purely and simply an instinct for self-preservation , for survival . That , and world opinion . Governments know that world opinion and national interest just ca n't be separated anymore . " ? THE Del Sol Hotel , in Mexico City , offers its guests " self-conducted tours . "
