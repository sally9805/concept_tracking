" After five months of fighting the Communists with the Ukrainian army during the 1918 revolution , young Boris escaped to the Black Sea , where he boarded a ship that eventually deposited him in New York with 14of Turkish money in . his pocket . He celebrated his 20th birthday on Ellis Island . <P> <P> Having carried out his father 's first instruction , Boris transliterated the family name , set out to make a reputation for himself in America as Boris Artzybasheff . At 61 , he has made a reputation around the world as an artist who stands alone in the field of humanizing machines and mechanizing humans .

All of the other satellites shown on the cover have , in Artzy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . <P> All of this brings up the thought that if there are beings on other planets watching these things sent up from earth , are there Boris Artzybasheffs up there who can do as good a job of depicting the devices they are sending our way to sniff and probe at us ?
