notic . Sometimes they were joined by a rough peasant lad with a dirty shirt and a battered accordion , sometimes ? when the melody was too haunting and too well-known ? by everyone around . Slowly it grew hot . Elderly couples opened rain umbrellas . Young people changed into bikinis and passed around tins of Soviet suntan cream . I had never before seen such scanty suits on such ample figures . Some of the women wore simply shorts and brassieres . Many of them were dark and took their sunbathing seriously . ( When we had arrived at Yalta the previous morning at seven the beach was already crowded and by one thirty too packed with flesh to tell from the quay whether the surface was sandy or rocky . ) We lay on the worn planks ; there were no deck chairs .

The pool became the center of attraction . It was a tiny rectangle . A schedule was posted on the railing ? alternate hours for men , women , and crew , not in order to segregate but to keep the numbers down ? and ignored . Anyone dived in . Pretty girls were coaxed or propelled ; grandmotherly types were helped . There was room enough for three strokes lengthwise and two across . In this cramped space the crew had devised a water polo game and taught it to all corners . The sailors were in splendid shape ? thick chests , sleek arms , powerful legs . Their skipper appeared two decks above , sextant in hand , watched his lusty men , smiled , shouted a word of banter , shot the sun . When it was very hot , an elderly lady passenger in white lacy gloves approached me from the shade and lectured : " Young man , you are getting sunburnt ; put on a shirt .

He was in his late twenties , my age , trim , dashing in his blues , a smart sailor . We talked about military service , Dave Brubeek , baseball and soccer , and quickly made friends . Then he led me out to the signal bridge to whisper his sad story while taking bearings . Three years before he had been serving on the overseas fleet as second officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been going abroad . One Christmas Eve the ship was in Venice ( much Soviet oil was being shipped to Italy those days ) , his duties were finished . Officers had an eleven o'clock curfew but he and a buddy ? " Do n't ask me why " ? had decided to forget it and run wild . Precisely at eleven , an open Lancia , with two local lovelies whom he and his friend had met in the afternoon , arrived at the pier . and the whole crew watched as they stepped ashore and into the car . After a glorious champagne supper , they returned at 2:00 A.M. Discipline was swift : a discharge when the ship put in at Odessa , cancellation of sailing papers . After a time , he found this place on Peter the Great but was confined to the Black Sea fleet . He yearned to return to international waters , What was holding him up now ? the administrative debarment to work abroad had expired ? was the Party reprimand which he had also received . " The Party Commissar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules and he hated me . " But he hoped that the Party ban , too , would expire in another year . " Funny , is n't it ? Life for almost every Russian has improved a hundred per cent in these last years , but for a few ? for us , when we went abroad ? it was better in the old days . No curfew ; you could bring back twice as much to sell in our secondhand stores . For us , it was freer under Stalin . " He walked me to the ladder . " I guess you do n't have any of this in America , huh ? Well , that 's the worst part . Everything else is fine . I have no real complaints ? but you ca n't run wild every once in a while . Some damn apparatchik will label you ' bourgeois . ' " * 4 ' The cabins were small and Spartan , adequate for a three-day cruise . Men and women were bunked together helter-skelter . I was sitting in Maya 's compartment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wife of a submarine skipper based " somewhere in the Black Sea " ? nibbling her treat , dried , salted fish , when two unknown men walked in and sat down ; they had boarded at Yalta . Neither Maya nor the men batted an eye at the sleeping arrangements . She offered them fish , then drew the curtains around her berth . Later I was in the ( curtainless ) shower on B deck when someone walked lightly in : a youngish woman ! Flattened against the bulkhead , I said that I had thought the door was marked " M. " " Oh you have n't made a mistake , " she said airily , " it 's just that the women 's room is full right now . I 'll just be a minute . " She closed the door to one of the cubicles and in time the toilet flushed . 0 Georgia ! Lush and hospitable and far from Moscow ! Tbilisi is to Moscow what a bottle of wine is to a can of beans . The Crimea too was luxuriant ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh vegetables and fruit . Then why was the Peter 's first-class dining room in June as sour as Moscow 's third-class cafeterias in February ? Nothing was green and nothing fresh ; the food was fried , thick , gray . Only the Beef Stroganoff was palatable , but frightening three times a day . There were no eggs ; the tomatoes had run out ; the rump steak was emetic . It took two hours to be served , about a half-hour for the waitress to take the order , an hour to get the food ? it was the standard system : the waitress stood in line first at the cashier 's to buy chits with her own money and then in line at the kitchen for the chow , and by the time it arrived the grease had begun to congeal ? and another half-hour to pay her . No one complained . Aft , there was a bar where a sweating , hulking barmaid ? she could say , " Van yoo hall ?

Great in shirring sun , as we sang , swam , dozed , played dominoes and Queens . For all the world , it could have been anywhere in the world except that there was a reproduktor in every cabin and at strategic places along the decks , and that Saturday they were tuned up full blast . There had been sensational news the day before , more important ( it seemed ) than Cuba , Berlin , the Summit , or Tests . " Attention ! Attention ! Announcement of the Central by George Feifer S1 Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ! " The price of meat was increased 30 per cent and of milk products 25 per cent . On the ship , that dismal announcement ( which caused foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) stirred no passion . Because there had been rumors for weeks that it was to come ? Or because the passengers were on holiday and queues at meat stores belonged to another world ? Two men alone were excited ; they kept on trying to find out for certain whether there had been a change in the price of vodka . ( There had not . ) The others seemed not to have heard . But today , as the loudspeakers relentlessly broadcast the nation 's reaction reported by Pravda , the passengers grew visibly annoyed . S. Belova , a Moscow housewife , M. Antonik , a welder from the Minsk tractor factory , K. Kolcsalov , chairman of a collective farm , A. Volovchenko , Hero of Socialist Labor , the entire Party , all progressive people , the whole Soviet nation , all the peace-loving people in the world ( read Pravda ) hailed the price rise and promised their full support . An essential measure ! A realistic and well-timed decision ! Soviet people thank the Party for its frankness ! The government knows what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we cheer it ! The passengers lost their patience . " Oh , God , stop that drivel ! " " Give us a price rise , but give us peace from nonsense ! " " Turn the bloody speakers off ! " One by one enterprising vacationers found the plugs , the speakers subsided , and the ship yawed on in peace , in a slightly stiffening sea . You do n't , by chance , " said the nondescript young man on the port rail , drying himself after an after-dinner dip , " have a copy of The New Class with you ? Then how about Zhivago ? The Bible ? in Russian ? Lolita ? Could you get these books to me in Moscow ? I would be very grateful . I could reward you . " Who was he ? scholar , speculator , or spy ? Sehto-to-rte-to ? something was fishy ; such things are not asked for by strangers right from scratch . I went back to the pool . So you are from America ! Well , come have some vodka . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the man across the passageway as I put 82 A BROTHERLY CRUISE ON THE BLACK SEA my key in the door en route to a nap . We sat on his bunk . He jerked his glass to his mouth and cut a thick slice of black bread but forgot to nibble at it . His fingers were stodgy and creased , the khaki-green of his cuffs edged with grime . " A Russian man drinks . He drinks vodka . Za vashe zdarovo ! " The tumbler was again filled to the lip . He downed it in one gulp without a wince . We started talking about him . He was in uniform ; he was on leave . He was serving in Warsaw . " Life will be all right as soon as I can get the family settled with me ? damn the red tape . Not that ever love Warsaw , but one can live there , as we saw . " I asked , was n't it exciting to be abroad . " Hell , no . I 've been abroad before , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuisance . I 'll take service in Russia any day . Really , there is something warmer about our life ? have n't you felt it ? Now the Poles are a brotherly people , democratic , socialist , anti-imperialist ; but they do n't have that human feeling ; if you want the truth I doubt that they 'll ever build communism , I 'm not complaining , you understand ; I serve where my job takes me . " " What is your job , if it 's not a secret ? " " Of course it 's not a secret . I 'm a military attache . Know what that is ? " " And those four little stars ? I could neversorry ? identify Soviet ranks . " " Podpolicovnik . " He grinned . This was too much , too typical . Ivan Petrovich , a bear of a lieutenant colonel , short , thick , bald , blunt , in black boots and gold teeth . A Herblock cartoon . " To the American people ! They have that human feeling . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery , I take it ? " " Right , artillery . Nu , have a cigarette . " " Have one of mine . " I gave him the whole pack , not entirely out of generosity . The cabin was dense with the fumes of his Papirosi ( mixed with the flavor of his woolen uniform ) and I hoped Pall Mall would be easier on the nose and eyes . " Why thanks , my friend , always wanted to try American tobacco . Do you mind if I save them until Odessa so my wife can share them ? . . . Nu . maybe try just one . " We were taking some groundswells ; a few drops of vodka went astray as he poured another round . " To peace ! " He clicked my glass . " If there ca n't be friendship , let ( here at least be peace . That 's the main thing ; we need peace . We Soviet people know war ? three of my brothers were killed in the last one . We must prevent another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches , it was all I could do . He put his thick hand over mine and squeezed it , then took a cigarette . I asked why he chose the army . " Oh fate , my friend , fate . Who would have dreamed that I 'd wind up a military man , a soldier , of all things . I would have said anything but a soldier . I wanted to be a doctor . " " Then , why ? " " Fate , my friend , one of those things . I was nineteen when the war started , went in as a buck private . Wounded twice . ( He opened his shirt on a ghastly scar which had taken off his left nipple . ) By the time it was over , I was a senior lieutenant . The army offered me an education and a permanent commission ; my wife was pregnant . I stayed in . " " Are you sorry ? " He lit another Pall Mall and undid his tie . " Too late for that now . The army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me is that it 's all so stupid . We want peace ? you know that if you 've been here a year . You want peace , too . Yet both of us spend colossal sums for arms . Crazy . It hurts us more than it hurts you . I say this as a military man , who lives off this foolishness in a way : T think we should melt down all the cursed guns and build apartments with the steel . " " What a good idea ! " " Of course , you want the same thing , Only a few people in the world want war . You act like an ordinary fellow ; who is your father ? " " An ordinary fellow . " " I thought so . " The bottle was nearly empty , but Ivan Petrovich 's words were still distinct . I concentrated on his sausage and black bread . He was a chain smoker . " Will they let you back into America after this ? . . I guess it 's harder for you in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He contrived a look of sympathy . " Whose ? " " The capitalists . The imperialists . I mean seeing your own resources used for militarism by a little clique of generals and monopolists . Ah , do n't worry , I know how you ordinary Americans must feel . For us , it is easier , at least we know our arms are only for defense . " " For defense , " It was not a question . I wanted to get to my nap . " Of course . We are a socialist country , we have no need of war . Nu , I guess I 'm telling you what you already know . Those capitalists are not going to give up their millions without a struggle , eh ? Well , do n't let them get you down . " I knew what was coming and it came . Hungary : a brotherly country helping against fascist counterrevolution . Cuba : a brotherly country helping against Yankee imperialists ? and American bases have surrounded us for seventeen years . Russia : Stalin was bad ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now democracy has been restored . America : monopoly capitalism sliding toward fascism , George Rockwell , John Birch . " We know all about America , we keep up ; the political officer arranges lectures . " The bottle was in the garbage tray . " Why do n't you force the Pentagon to make peace , for heaven 's sake ? " I kept quiet . To put up a good show ? the best that can be done in these cases is a show , disagreement , indication that one is not an ordinary fellow , or brainwashed ? would have taken reserves of energy . The vodka had made me very sleepy . " It 's terrible . I hate it , but we must build up our Soviet army . You understand that now . As long as imperialism exists , we must strengthen our guard . We have an obligation to protect the democratic world . History would never forgive us if we failed . We know that the American people are with us in this . Long live the American people ! Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lay down , top berth , for the long-delayed nap . But sleep would not come ; I was bothered by how I should have handled Ivan Petrovich . I got up and knocked on his door ; one boot was off and he was unwrapping the foot rags underneath . I handed him another pack of Pall Malls ? he had given the last few of the first pack to a passerby and the stewardess who cleared away the glasses ? to save for his wife . " Greetings to the American people ! " I lay down again , just as annoyed , frustrated , uncertain about how I ought to have acted . Two seamen were chipping and scraping the bulkhead directly outside my cabin . * * * Seven bells . On the prow as the sun went down ? a splendorous orange Mediterranean sunset ? four of the crew were playing dominoes . They slapped the tokens onto the deck with glee . Watchers had gathered , some leaning on a Volga automobile lashed to the forward bits . " What 's better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crew-cut lad with no shirt . " What a stupid question ! " cracked his buddy . " Each system has its faults . Is n't that right ? " " Well , we do n't have faults like they do . Is it true that there are five million workers unemployed ? And that Negroes must ride in the back of buses ? Why ? I heard that you have to pay for doctors there , too . " " Knock it off . Why do they have the best jazz in the world ? And the biggest and the best ? the highest living standard ? " " And the most cars . You forget that every man has his own car there because they make seventeen million of them a year . We wo n't make that in the next twenty years . " Seven million , I said . Not seventeen million . " Seventeen . I read it somewhere . Maybe you do n't know yourself . Seventeen million cars a year . Do you have one ? " " Then why do they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly . If you have a car , you can pay for a doctor . You can sell your car and pay for ten doctors . " " I still do n't think it 's right . I read that some people spend more to support a pet dog than others to support a family of children . Is that true ? " " For God 's sake , leave him alone ; he 's on vacation . What does he care about dogs ? " " I just want to hear if it 's true . Are you going to be able to find work when you go home , or will you be unemployed ? Or will you have to beat your comrade out for a job ? " " He 's going to stay in Russia , are n't you ? Life 's more friendly here . How can he go back to those skinny American girls ? " " Look , I have a serious question : why do n't Americans play soccer ? " " Yeah , Why ? " Dancing in the evening on boatdeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to music my grandfather used to try to follow with his awkward little hop . Scratchy records and slow , amateurish movements and no one ? men or women ? shy about asking anyone else . Couples gripping each other around the waist with both hands in the current style . No change of clothes ( except extra sweaters ) , no romantic pretensions , but almost everyone joining in . The natural festive flavor of a Vermont square dance . The older generation drifted off to bed by ten . All music was switched off at twelve . Regulations . ( The beer bar had long since boarded up . ) Then the fun began . The life of the party was a group of twenty or thirty young men and women who worked at a machine-tool plant in Gorky and were taking their vacation together . ( The trade union paid . half their fare . ) Verichka , Andriusha , Tanya , Seriozha ... I never knew factory workers like this before , so full of warmth for each other and their factory . They were exuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEA naturalness and solidarity and enthusiasm which the best military units are lucky to attain . They were the new proletariat which here was far more than a propagandist 's invention . They were the young New Soviet Men , the sons of Revolutionary Socialism . Healthy , happy , perfectly at ease . Or were they simply the offspring of carousing old rural Russia ? A balalaika appeared , an accordion ; hands clapped and feet flashed . Each nationality -- -Russians , Ukrainians , Georgians , and Armenians ? displayed its songs and dances , urged on by the clapping circle . The Americans were called : " Home on the Range " and " Blue-tail Fly " and ? by universal demand ? demonstration of the " tweest . " Four Georgians picked it up immediately . It was one world in many delicious parts ; it was the natural health of Soviet youth . the old-fashioned pleasures relished in overalls . * * * Romance made the night air heavy . There was Raya , x ( bleached ) blond willow in sandals , Tamara from Tashkent , pert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong swimmer with a classic figure plus ten pounds ( she had been seen climbing into a lifeboat with one of the crew ) . They wore their hair long , made up only their eyes , with which they flirted openly . Their torsos strained at their blouses ; they smelled strong and asked to be danced with . But the fairest of all could not flirt . Mealtimes , she had sat silently with her mother and husband at the center table , cool in an off-the-shoulder dress , demure , regal . She ought to have been sailing on the France . Silky straight hair framed her cameo face . I could not help staring . She looked only at the portholes . Picture , then , my astonishment when after the dancing , she suddenly appeared to slip her arm under mine as I stood on the starboard quarter watching the foam . " Young man , my name is Alla , shall we become acquainted ? " Her voice was exquisite , like her manner . " I do n't like my husband . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff old thing . I long to be free , to express myself , to live . " I was spellbound , but seized , too , with rIgja vu . She was straight from Chekhov 's " The Lady with the Dog . " " And what 's more , I 'm with my admirer , not my husband , and I do not like him either . Have you noticed him at our table ? It is so distressing how he worms his way in with my mother . A smooth-talking Bulgarian . I should never have consented to take a voyage with them . You areso tall . I like the way you look , like one who plays basketball . " She looked out to sea , like Princess Grace at the races . I did n't know what to say , nothing was grand enough . I stuttered and talked small . She gave me two Leningrad addresses . " We are less likely to be disturbed at the second . " Finally I took her to my cabin , twenty paces away . I locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon kissed her on the lips . She kissed back . Perfume and passion and mystery ; she arched her back . Shortly she stopped me . " Not here . You must go to Cabin B-23 on the second deck ; it will be empty . I shall expect you in ten minutes exactly . Oh my dushka . You are so tall . " She slipped away . Eight horrible , sweet , tantalizing minutes of waiting ; I was so nervous that the ship 's wake seemed smooth . Then I dashed to B-23 and knocked . It was ten minutes exactly . There was no answer . I knocked again , pounded , shook the handle ; f waited an hour but there was never an answer . The stewardess watched me suspiciously . At breakfast Alla looked only at the porthole , cool again , a trace of contempt on her lips . * * * At 0230 , running lights of four or five homeward-bound tankers dipped over and under the horizon . Peter the Great throbbed soothingly . From somewhere aft the peasant girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the darkened dance platform above , a single Middle Eastern guitar was being plucked . Curled in blankets on their chairs , the deck-class workerpassengers had settled for a short night . The few people still awake had linked arms , girls with girls , girls with boys , boys with boys . " Hey , hey , one more time , once more many many times . . HEY ! " I reached for something to lull me to sleep ? the cruise brochure . It began in typical style : " The Communist Party and the Soviet government demonstrate great concern over the development of the marine passenger fleet . . . " On it went ad nauseam about the Party , but said nothing relevant about the genealogy of Peter the Great . But I did n't care , I did n't care , because the one thing I had learned for certain in that year was that Soviet society , like every other , has no straight answers and if you depart from Russia not confused , you have only fooled yourself .
