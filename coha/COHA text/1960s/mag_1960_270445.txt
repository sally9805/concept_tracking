Like a mountain village in the path of a gathering avalanche , the world helplessly awaited the approach of one of the least promising international conclaves in history . In all probability , the results would show that seldom have so many traveled so far for so little in terms of progress achieved . <P> But as the Baltika steamed ever closer to its East River dock with Nikita Khrushchev and his satellite claque , the prospect of the greatest diplomatic spectacle ever proved almost irresistible . Already , 26 heads of government , either in name or fact , were publicly committed to attend this week 's U.N . General Assembly meeting . And when Washington announced that President Eisenhower planned to speak to the Assembly ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , other heads of state began to get itchy feet . India 's Jawaharlal Nehru , who had originally been minded to stay away , now seemed likely to come . So did Tunisia 's President Habib Bourguiba . Even Britain 's Harold Macmillan was aching to come-despite advice to the contrary from his own Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so would Canada 's Prime Minister John Diefenbaker . Only Charles de Gaulle , who dislikes what he refers to as the " socalled United Nations , ' ' seemed totally immune to temptation . <P> Playing Blocs . The fact that so many heads of government wanted to get in on the act following Khrushchev 's original lead was by no means a sign that he could count on their support at the U.N . The only General Assembly votes Khrushchev could be utterly sure of were those of the Soviet satellites ( see box ) , plus that of Cuba 's ineffable Fidel Castro-who was put into his proper slot by a State Department decision to restrict him to Manhattan Island along with Khrushchev , Hungary 's Janos Kadar and Albania 's Mehmet Shehu . <P> <P> Some of the visitors , in fact , were coming with the express purpose of countering Khrushchev 's gambit . Yugoslavia 's Marshal Tito boarded the Queen Elizabeth for New York only after he and his fellow neutralist , President Nasser of Egypt , had jointly decided that the U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide bloc of nations uncommitted to either East or West . Others were coming out of national pride : for the leaders of nine new African nations of the French community , the lure was a chance to preside at their countries ' U.N . debut-and , judging from hints out of Washington , to meet Dwight Eisenhower . Ghana 's U.S.-educated President Kwame Nkrumah was coming to advance his own claims to leadership of all the Africans . <P> Targets of Opportunity . In capitals throughout the West , Soviet diplomats and sympathizers carefully dropped hints that Nikita planned all sorts of diplomatic spectaculars ranging from a call for " complete , universal and immediate " disarmament down to a proposal for the elimination of all means of delivering nuclear warheads-an idea that is espoused by France 's Charles de Gaulle and which , therefore , Khrushchev might invoke in hopes of dividing the Western allies . <P> Behind all the Soviet muscle flexing and the Western counterplanning lay a common awareness that at the General Assembly Khrushchev , either as wrecker or as propagandist , will be presented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictable targets :
