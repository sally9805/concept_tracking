The incident came as the mar -- shal sought to shoulder his way through 20 unarmed but resist , ing highway patrolmen to enroll Mr. Meredith . It marked the third time that Gov . Ross R. Barnett and his aides had flouted the desegregation orders of the Federal District Court , Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court . In Washington , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy reiterated that the Federal Government was determined to execute Federal appeals court orders in Mississippi . He said that " the question of Federal troops is the same as it has been , " adding : " We 'll use whatever is necessary . " The Governor , who had been cited twice for contempt of court , first denied Mr. Meredith admission last Thursday after ' having had himself appointed as a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office doorway at Jackson , the capital , and thus prevented the student and Federal officials from reaching Robert B. Ellis , the official university registrar . Mr. Barnett , who has said he would go to jail to keep the university segregated , apparently had intended personally to turn the student away this morning . But low clouds forced him to cancel plans to fly here from Jackson . He arrived in his blue Cadillac 20 minutes after Mr. Meredith had left . The 29-year-old student seemed undismayed as he climbed into a Border Patrol plane with Mr. and John Doar , first assistant in the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division . " At least , I 'm getting in a lot lof flying time , " the Air Force ' veteran said . The three were flown to Memphis to await the Kennedy Administration 's next move in its efforts to resolve one of the most serious Federal-state conflicts ever faced by the nation . Despite Mr. Meredith 's show of confidence , he and those who have assisted him were reported tonight to have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reluctant to risk a further trip here with only a handful of Federal officers to protect him . Their concern likely will force cancellation of plans to make a fourth attempt tomorrow to enroll him at the university . Governor Barnett has been ordered to appear Friday before the Appeals Court in New Orleans to answer contempt citations obtained by the Justice Department and the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund . Thus , no major step to put An end to the defiance of the courts ' decrees is expected until after that hearing . It was reported today that ' Federal officials were prepared ' to use troops to force compliance if no other solution could be found . Many in this town of 6,400 persons in the hills of north-central Mississippi have expressed the belief that only military forces could accomplish the task . Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy informed Governor Barnett yesterday by telephone ' that Mr. Meredith would seek to register this morning and begin classes . Apparently at the Governor 's order , highway patrolmen remained on duty throughout the night at entrances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear . The two-tone green , twinengine Cessna carrying the Meredith party dropped out of the rolling gray clouds that hovered only 600 feet above the University-Oxford Airport at 10:20 A. M. Eastern standard time . Confer With Patrolmen Mr. and Mr .. Doar conferred briefly with state Highway Patrol officials , who confirmed that they would provide an escort to the campus . Fifteen minutes later Mr. Meredith entered a green ssdan with . Louisiana license plates . The convoy was stopped at South Fifth Street and ' University Avenue , a block and a half from the main campus entrance by the 20 troopers under the command of Dave Gayden , chief of the Highway Patrol . Fifteen or more sheriffs from surrounding counties formed a rank 100 feet behind the patrolmen and three patrol cars were parked across University Avenue to block the campus entrance .. Lieutenant Governor Johnson moved into the front rank of the troopers as the chief marshal and Mr. Doar , followed by Mr. Meredith , got out of the . ear . Mr. asked who was in charge and the Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meredith in under the direction of the Federal Court and have him registered , " said the marshal . " I 'm going to have to refuse Mr. Meredith , " replied the Lieutenant Governor , explaining that he was doing so on the ground cited by Governor Barnett . The Governor has contended that the state has " interposed " its power between the university and the courts , thus nullifying the desegregation orders . Mr. Johnson said he was representing the Governor , " acting in his stead , by his direction and under his instructions . " Mr. Doar then stepped forward and introduced himself by name and as " an officer of the court . " He called attention to - the injunction prohibiting interference with Mr. Meyedith 's admission . The Justice Department official then sought to give Mr. Johnson a copy of the contempt citation obtained by the department against Governor Barnett . " I would not accept the papers , " said the Lieutenant Governor . Mr. Meredith , dressed in a neat gray suit , white shirt and red tie , stood between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking on but saying nothing . Moving toward Mr. Johnson , the chief marshal said , " Governor , I think it 's my duty to try to go through and get Mr. Meredith in there . " The troopers crowded in behind the Lieutenant Governor . " We are going to block you and if there is any violence it will be on your part , " said Mr. Johnson . " I 'm only doing my duty as a United States Marshal , " replied Mr. . " I would like to go in . " The chief marshal then sought to shoulder his way past the Lieutenant Governor , who , with the troopers , pushed him back . Mr. Johnson said he did not think the chief marshal should be " doing this for the television cameras " to be seen throughout the nation . " You people understand that you 're in violation of a court order , " said Mr. Doar . And he began calling off names from the metal tags on the troopers ' shirts while the marshal took them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the Lieutenant Governor 's right side but Mr. Johnson and the troopers pushed him back again " We have told you you ca n't go in and vie intend to use whatever force is necessary , " said Mr. Johnson . " Governor , are these men acting under your authority , physically preventing us from going in ? " asked the marshal . " They are , " was the reply . Mr. Doar again warned the Lieutenant Governor and the troopers that they were defying the orders of the courts . And Mr. made another futile attempt to clear a path for Mr. Meredith . At one point , the chief marshal ordered the state officers to " stand aside and let this man in . " But they refused to budge . " You 're trying to make a big show , " asserted Mr. Johnson . Mr. denied this . He and the Lieutenant Governor then shook hands and the two Federal officials and the student got back into the car . The troopers and the sheriff cheered and applauded the Lieutenant Governor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six unidentified Federal officials , drove away . Mr. Johnson told newsmen he would remain on the scene to turn back Mr. Meredith if he ' appeared again . Asked what ' further plans he had , he replied , " We 're just taking it as it comes . " The state official , who was not named in the various injunctions , was asked if he would appear before the Federal Court if cited for contempt . " I do n't know , " he replied . " At this time , it would be hard for me to say . " Then with a smile , he remarked : " They 'll probably put me away for a long time . " One of the first to congratulate Mr. Johnson was William J. Simmons , national coordinator of the Citizens ' Councils of America and a top adviser to Governor Barnett . He attended a conference of highway patrol officials and county and city law enforcement officers here Tuesday night at which the strategy executed this morning was planned . " It 's all in a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Feeling all over the state is just as cocky and confident as it can be . " Mr. Simmons and his militantly segregationalist organization possibly have more at stake in the controversy than others . Desegregation in Mississippi , the one state in which the councils wield considerable political influence , undoubtedly would weaken their campaign for support elsewhere in the South . Support for Barnett BIRMINGHAM , Ala. , Sept. 26 ( UPI ) ? An official , of the segregationist National States Rights party told Gov . Ross R. Barnett today that members of his organization were ready to take up arms to support his stand against racial integration . Dr. Edward R. Fields , an officer of the party , sent Mr. Barnett a telegram offering " to place our lives and fortunes at the disposal of your supreme authority as Governor of the sovereign state of Mississippi . " " We feel patriots from every state in the Union will rally to the defense of Mississippi .
