txt New York , Dec. 19 Vfi  --  The publishers , chosen by the Kennedy family , of William Manchester 's " The Death of a President " said tonight they want to go ahead with the book over Mrs. John F. Kennedy 's bitter objections , " in the interest of historical accuracy . " This brought a reply from a spokesman for the Kennedy family , who said : " No amount of rhetoric about ' historical accuracy ' or the public 's ' right to know ' can alter the nature of this controversy ? whether Mr. Manchester and the publishers broke a written agreement , from which breach enormous profits will apparently flow . " Seek a Compromise The exchange came amid reported maneuverings by attorneys for a compromise on passages in the book which Mrs. Kennedy regards as too personal for publication . A spokesmen for the publishers , Harper &; Row , had reported " continuing efforts to patch things up . " A court hearing on a suit to block publication of the book is eight days away . The Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the book 's ' right to live ' ? no one has denied that right . The question is the right of Mrs. Kennedy and her children to live with a minimum of privacy and dignity , free from the publication of intimate details of their lives at a time of great sorrow ? details which bear no conceivable relation to history . " Argues " Right to Know " Cass Canfield , chairman of the executive committee of Harper &; Row , had said in an earlier statement that his company wanted to go ahead with publication of the book " in the interest of historical accuracy and of the people 's right to know the true facts of the awesome tragedy . " " Understandably , " he continued , " the members of the Kennedy family were unwilling to read the manuscript themselves and hence they designated representatives to do this for them . Had they read it themselves , the present situation might have been avoided . ' , Disputes Profit Talk As to profits from the book , Canfield said the publisher 's advance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the press . " Canfield said all Harper &; Row profits from the book will go to the Kennedy memorial library " except for a small return to Harper 's on its first printing . In no event will this limit be exceeded . " He said Manchester also was making " substantial contributions " to the library from his earnings on the book . The reply from the Kennedy spokesman read : " Altho neither Sen. Robert F. Kennedy nor Mrs. Kennedy has read the Manchester manuscript in its entirety  --  authorized representatives have done so  --  both Manchester and the publishers knew that Mrs. Kennedy was well aware of the personal passages to which she objected . " Indeed , Mrs. Kennedy spoke directly to Manchester on at least one occasion , outlining her objections to those parts of the manuscript which sbe felt unnecessarily invaded her privacy and that of her children . Denied Manuscript View " And altho he agreed to delete them from the published version , neither Manchester nor Harper &; Row nor Look magazine has done so , or have they even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her representatives access to the manuscript . " And this despite repeated assurance thruout the entir e period ? by Harper &; Row that the contract would be honored . Since representatives of Harper &; Row participated in making the agreement this lawsuit is based on , it is surprising that Mr. Canfield 's statement does not mention it . " Mrs. Kennedy 's lawyer , Simon H. Rifkind , said he did not rule out the possibility that the Kennedy family 's suit might be settled short of a trial . The hearing on Dec. 27 before a Manhattan judge of the New York Supreme court will be on a petition by Mrs. Kennedy and Sen. Kennedy for an injunction to bar publication . The injunction hearing will be based on affidavits filed by Mrs. Kennedy and the senator . If Manchester and the defendant publishers decide to resist an injunction , the case would go to trial , Mrs. Kennedy then would face the ordeal of a witness stand appearance . Kennedys Claim Veto Meanwhile , Manchester denied in a statement that publication of the book would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator . The Kennedys insist that the book was written under an agreement giving Mrs. Kennedy and the senator veto rights over its content and publication time . Manchester says the senator gave him a go-ahead in a telegram last July . The senator denies this . Manchester , in his statement , insisted that " in the summer of 1966 , authorization w a s given by the family for publication of the book in early 1967 , to be preceded by serialization in Look magazine . " My Book , Author Says " In the last analysis , this is my book , " Manchester said . " Neither Mrs. Kennedy nor any member of t h e Kennedy family nor anyone else is in any way responsible for my research or the content of my work . " It is my responsibility , and I am confident that my book can withstand any objective test , particularly the test of time . I ask only that it be given the chance . " When Manchester decided he was free to proceed with publication of the book , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening Post , Ladies ' Home Journal , McCall 's , and Good Housekeeping for bids on serialization rights . Look won with a bid of $665 , - 000 . The Kennedy suit places Look in a dilemma . The serialization is scheduled to begin in its Jan. 24 issue , which normally would reach newsstands on Jan. 10 . The issue has gone to press . Look has declined to say how many copies might have to be withheld if the court grants an injunction against publication . A number of persons who have read the Manchester manuscirpt say that in addition to the intimate personal references which upset Mrs. Kennedy , the book is generally uncomplimentary to President Johnson . It thus might prove politically embarrassing to Sen. Robert Kennedy . In Johnson 's State One publishing executive who saw the manuscript told the New York Post it relates a feeling about the Kennedys after the assassination that " this was Johnson 's state ? Texas ; that it happened in ' his state . " They did n't think he had anything to do with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was in Dallas that Adlai Stevenson had been spat upon . And they , the Kennedys , felt that Johnson was part of this thing , this conservatism , and there was n't anything he could have done that would have changed their minds . " He represented everything President Kennedy was n't  --  the crudity , the southerner , the professional politician . "
