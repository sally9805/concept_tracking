txt The French Cabinet , meeting today for the first time under the chairmanship of Interim President Alain Poher , fixed June 1 as the date for the presidential election . If no candidate obtains a majority , a runoff will be held two weeks later . The atmosphere at the meeting was " cold and glacial , " in the words of one minister , ' with Mr. Poher sitting in the chair that had been occupied for more than 10 years by General de Gaulle . Maurice Couve de Murville , the Premier , sat in his usual place opposite the president . And two stalwart Gaullists , the Foreign Minister , Michel Debre , and the Culture Minister , Andre Malraux , flanked Mr. Poher . The tension between the Interim President and the 30 Gaullist ministers was clearly expressed in the official texts that were published . Mr. Poher first spoke of the " great Frenchman " who had preceded him in the presidential chair . He noted that the transition so far had been " without the slightest difficulty , " contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil by Premier Couve de Murville and virtually all the ministers present , during the campaign leading to last Sunday 's national referendum . Then , in what sounded almost like a warning , he said he was " duty-bound to advise " the ministers that his prime function as Interim President was to assure the Government 's impartiality in the forthcoming election . Mr. Debre , in a report on foreign affairs , said : " The week 's only notable event on the international scene was the departure of General de Gaulle . " French ambassadors almost everywhere were reporting " deep and sincere regret , " he said , adding that only the enemies of France were rejoicing . " To sum it up , France suffered a defeat last Sunday , " Mr. Debre told the ministers and Mr. Poher , who had been a chief architect of the Gaullist upset . The text of Mr. Debre 's statement was made public . Rebuke From Poher In a sharp rebuke later in the day , Mr. Poher 's office issued a statement saying that the Interim President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet were secret and could not be disclosed by the ministers . For a decade , Gaullist ministers had always kept strict silence , at least in public . The Information Minister would issue an authorized report to the press  --  after first checking with President de Gaulle on what could be made public . Some of the ministers expressed their bitterness today in statements to reporters as they left the Elysee Palace . Philippe Dechartre , the bearded State Secretary for Housing , said : " When General de Gaulle presided at a Cabinet meeting , history was always present . This is not the case today . " The Minister of State , Roger Frey , shook his head and spread his arms as he said : " What can I tell you that you ca n't imagine ? " Mr. Poher drove to the Elysee Palace for the Cabinet meeting . He still lives and works in the Luxembourg Palace , the seat of the Senate , of which he is president . Praise for Pompidou . Former Premier Georges Pompidou , meanwhile , was hailed today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal , a financial newspaper that reflectsilhe business and financial community 's attitudes . Under a four-column rontpage headline , " The Credo of a ' Liberal ' Pompidou , " the newspaper reprinted long excerpts from a speech Mr. Pompidou made last ? February before an audience of business leaders . This was in effect his first campaign speech , the newspaper said . It quoted him as having defended the " law of profit , " and as having said that " there can be no social policy except to the extent . . . that the companies have already earned money . in France a company that is making money is often a priori suspect . It is in the general interest that our concerns increase their profits . " " French taxation has reached the limit of what is bearable , " the newspaper quoted Mr. Pompidou as having said . The Gaullist candidate also called on " the state to loosen its hold on the econ ' my , insted of constantly seeking to direct and control it .
