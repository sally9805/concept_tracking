The patients who hobbled , or were carried , into the emergency room at William Beaumont General Hospital in El Paso were young Army or Air Force men ; all had been shot in the leg . But not in defense of their country . Most had delayed for many painful hours-one as long as eight days-before seeking help , and they were extraordinarily sheepish about telling how they had been wounded . After Captain Michael M. Duffy of the Army 's Medical Corps wormed the story out of the first such patient , he learned to spot similar cases quickly . They were victims of the fast-draw craze that has swept the country , and especially the West , in the last five years . Each one had shot himself . <P> In three years , reports Captain Duffy in the Annals of Surgery , he saw 24 such cases in El Paso , and surgeons elsewhere have seen scores more , mostly around military bases . For whereas the organized fast-draw clubs , encouraged by the firearms industry , make sure that their would-be Wyatt Earps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too many young servicemen practice the game with full-load ammunition complete with lead slug . For economy 's sake , they usually content themselves with a .22-caliber weapon . This can do plenty of damage , but a heavier weapon is far worse . One of Captain Duffy 's patients used a .38 , which broke his leg and left it partly paralyzed after 48 days in the hospital . Another used a .45. and the massive slug drove three coins in his pocket an inch deep into his thigh .
