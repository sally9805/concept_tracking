Of all the things television does badly , the stock market may be the worst . Despite the fact that 24 million Americans now own stocks , TV coverage of the market is almost universally restricted to a brief and bewildering recital of the Dow-Jones averages and the ten most active stocks . But now , from the never-never land of UHF comes a startling switch . Eight U.S. TV stations , most of them new , have gone on the air with a play-by-play account of market transactions from open to close , Monday through Friday . <P> Originated 18 months ago by Los Angeles ' Channel 22 ( " The Station That Means Business " ) , the programs run nonstop for six to eight hours , as computerized figures sweep constantly across the picture , reproducing the tapes of both the New York and American Stock Exchanges . Behind the figures , an announcer or a licensed stockbroker answers telephone inquiries from viewers and delivers a running commentary on market trends , business news and transactions on local exchanges . <P> The comments are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began broadcasting only two months ago , hired a former science reporter and a dark-haired young actress to keep its audience informed . " We are only now at the point , " admits the show 's M.C. Jeff Thompson , " where we can spot trends and correlate what is happening . " There are other dangers involved . To avoid SEC charges of stock manipulation , all stations forbid their commentators from paying particular attention to any single stock . They also discourage their employees from playing the market . Says News Director <P> Ben Larsen of Chicago 's Channel 26 : " I sold out all my stocks when we started . I 'm scared to death of someone accusing me of jockeying a stock . " <P> So far , the exchange programs seem to be accomplishing their intended purpose : to attract a marketable audience for potential advertisers . The fare obviously appeals to a large number of elderly people who otherwise would have to trudge downtown to the broker 's office to watch the tape , although some studies show that the average viewer earns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age . <P> So enthusiastic is the audience that country clubs now keep their sets tuned to the market action , as do expensive bars , barbershops , beauty salons and doctors ' offices . The most ebullient response , however , comes from businessmen 's wives who suddenly find that they can talk intelligently about the market with their husbands . One overwhelmed Dallas woman recently wrote Channel 39 that " your stock-market show is the greatest thing that has happened to me since sex . " And Seattle 's Channel 13 , which because of the time difference begins its Wall Street report at 7 a.m. , received a telephone call from a housewife who said that " for the first time in 17 years , I had breakfast with my husband this morning . "
