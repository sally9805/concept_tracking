Illustration By CHARLES V. DE VET monkey on his back Under the cloud of cast-off identities lay the shape of another man  --  was it himself ? Illustrated by DILLON He was walking endlessly down a long , glass-walled corridor . Bright sunlight slanted in through one wall , on the blue knapsack across his shoulders . Who he was , and what he was doing here , was clouded . The truth lurked in some corner of his consciousness , but it was not reached by surface awareness . The corridor opened at last into a large high-domed room , much like a railway station or an air terminal . He walked straight ahead . At the sight of him a man leaning negligently against a stone pillar , to his right but within vision , straightened and barked an order to him , " Halt ! " He lengthened his stride but gave no other sign . Two men hurried through a doorway of a small anteroom to his left , calling to him . He turned away and began to run . Shouts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut to the right , running toward the escalator to the second floor . Another pair of men were hurrying down , two steps at a stride . With no break in pace he veered into an opening beside the escalator . At the first turn he saw that the aisle merely circled the stairway , coming out into the depot again on the other side . It was a trap . He glanced quickly around him . At the rear of the space was a row of lockers for traveler use . He slipped a coin into a pay slot , opened the zipper on his bag and pulled out a flat briefcase . It took him only a few seconds to push the case into the compartment , lock it and slide the key along the floor beneath the locker . There was nothing to do after that  --  except wait . The men pursuing him came hurtling around the turn in the aisle . He kicked his knapsack to one side , spreading his feet wide with an instinctive motion . Until that instant he had intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were five of them , he saw . He should be able to incapacitate two or three and break out . But the fact that they had been expecting him meant that others would very probably be waiting outside . His best course now was to sham ignorance . He relaxed . He offered no resistance as they reached him . They were not gentle men . A tall ruffian , copper-brown face damp with perspiration and body oil , grabbed him by the jacket and slammed him back against the lockers . As he shifted his weight to keep his footing someone drove a fist into his face . He started to raise his hands ; and a hard flat object crashed against the side of his skull . The starch went out of his legs . " Do you make anything out of it ? " the psychoanalyst Milton Bergstrom , asked . John Zarwell shook his head . " Did I talk while I was under ? " " Oh , yes . You were supposed to . That way I follow pretty well what you 're reenacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you before ? " Bergstrom 's neat-boned , fair-skinned face betrayed no emotion other than an introspective stillness of his normally alert gaze . " I see no connection , " he decided , his words once again precise and meticulous . " We do n't have enough to go on . Do you feel able to try another comanalysis this afternoon yet ? " " I do n't see why not . " Zarwell opened the collar of his shirt . The day was hot , and the room had no air conditioning , still a rare luxury on St. Martin 's . The office window was open , but it let in no freshness , only the mildly rank odor that pervaded all the planet 's habitable area . " Good . " Bergstrom rose . " The serum is quite harmless , John . " He maintained a professional diversionary chatter as he administered the drug . " A scopolamine derivative that 's been well tested . " The floor beneath Zarwell 's feet assumed abruptly the near transfluent consistency of a damp sponge . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far wall . Bergstrom continued talking , with practiced urbanity . " When psychiatry was a less exact science , " his voice went on , seeming to come from a great distance , " a doctor had to spend weeks , sometimes months or years interviewing a patient . If he was skilled enough , he could sort the relevancies from the vast amount of chaff . We are able now , with the help of the serum , to confine our discourses to matters cogent to the patient 's trouble . " The floor continued its transmutation , and Zarwell sank deep into viscous depths . " Lie back and relax . Do n't ... " The words tumbled down from above . They faded , were gone . Zarwell found himself standing on a vast plain . There was no sky above , and no horizon in the distance . He was in a place without space or dimension . There was nothing here except himself  --  and the gun that he held in his hand . A weapon beautiful in its efficient simplicity . He should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he could not bring his thoughts into rational focus . His forehead creased with his mental effort . Abruptly the unreality about him shifted perspective . He was approaching  --  not walking , but merely shortening the space between them  --  the man who held the gun . The man who was himself . The other " himself " drifted nearer also , as though drawn by a mutual attraction . The man with the gun raised his weapon and pressed the trigger . With the action the perspective shifted again . He was watching the face of the man he shot jerk and twitch , expand and contract . The face was unharmed , yet it was no longer the same . No longer his own features . The stranger face smiled approvingly at him . " Odd , " Bergstrom said . He brought his hands up and joined the tips of his fingers against his chest . " But it 's another piece in the jig-saw . In time it will fit into place . " He paused . " It means no more to you than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zarwell answered . He was not a talking man , Bergstrom reflected . It was more than reticence , however . The man had a hard granite core , only partially concealed by his present perplexity . He was a man who could handle himself well in an emergency . Bergstrom shrugged , dismissing his strayed thoughts . " I expected as much . A quite normal first phase of treatment . " He straightened a paper on his desk . " I think that will be enough for today . Twice in one sitting is about all we ever try . Otherwise some particular episode might cause undue mental stress , and set up a block . " He glanced down at his appointment pad . " Tomorrow at two , then ? " Zarwell grunted acknowledgment and pushed himself to his feet , apparently unaware that his shirt clung damply to his body . The sun was still high when Zarwell left the analyst 's office . The white marble of the city 's buildings shimmered in the afternoon heat , squat and austere as giant tree trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to rest his hand on the flesh searing surface of the stone . The evening meal hour was approaching when he reached the Flats , on the way to his apartment . The streets of the old section were near-deserted . The only sounds he heard as he passed were the occasional cry of a baby , chronically uncomfortable in the day 's heat , and the lowing of imported cattle waiting in a nearby shed to be shipped to the country . All St. Martin 's has a distinctive smell , as of an arid dried-out swamp , with a faint taint of fish . But in the Flats the odor changes . Here is the smell of factories , warehouses , and trading marts ; the smell of stale cooking drifting from the homes of the laborers and lower class techmen who live there . Zarwell passed a group of smaller children playing a desultory game of lic-lic for pieces of candy and cigarettes . Slowly he climbed the stairs of a stone flat . He prepared a supper for himself and ate it without either enjoyment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed . The visit to the analyst had done nothing to dispel his ennui . Illustration The next morning when Zarwell awoke he lay for a moment , unmoving . The feeling was there again , like a scene waiting only to be gazed at directly to be perceived . It was as though a great wisdom lay at the edge of understanding . If he rested quietly it would all come to him . Yet always , when his mind lost its sleep-induced lethargy , the moment of near understanding slipped away . This morning , however , the sense of disorientation did not pass with full wakefulness . He achieved no understanding , but the strangeness did not leave as he sat up . He gazed about him . The room did not seem to be his own . The furnishings , and the clothing he observed in a closet , might have belonged to a stranger . He pulled himself from his blankets , his body moving with mechanical reaction . The slippers into which he put his feet were larger than he had expected them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was familiar , but only as it would have been if he had studied it from blueprints , not as though he lived there . The feeling was still with him when he returned to the psychoanalyst . The scene this time was more kaleidoscopic , less personal . A village was being ravaged . Men struggled and died in the streets . Zarwell moved among them , seldom taking part in the individual clashes , yet a moving force in the conflict . The background changed . He understood that he was on a different world . Here a city burned . Its resistance was nearing its end . Zarwell was riding a shaggy pony outside a high wall surrounding the stricken metropolis . He moved in and joined a party of short , bearded men , directing them as they battered at the wall with a huge log mounted on a many-wheeled truck . The log broke a breach in the concrete and the besiegers charged through , carrying back the defenders who sought vainly to plug the gap . Soon there would be rioting in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the invaders , only a lesser figure in the rebellion . But he had played a leading part in the planning of the strategy that led to the city 's fall . The job had been well done . Time passed , without visible break in the panorama . Now Zarwell was fleeing , pursued by the same bearded men who had been his comrades before . Still he moved with the same firm purpose , vigilant , resourceful , and well prepared for the eventuality that had befallen . He made his escape without difficulty . He alighted from a space ship on still another world  --  another shift in time  --  and the atmosphere of conflict engulfed him . Weary but resigned he accepted it , and did what he had to do ... Bergstrom was regarding him with speculative scrutiny . " You 've had quite a past , apparently , " he observed . Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment . " At least in my dreams . " " Dreams ? " Bergstrom 's eyes widened in surprise . " Oh , I beg your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is so routine to me that sometimes I forget it 's all new to a patient . Actually what you experienced under the drug were not dreams . They were recollections of real episodes from your past . " Zarwell 's expression became wary . He watched Bergstrom closely . After a minute , however , he seemed satisfied , and he let himself settle back against the cushion of his chair . " I remember nothing of what I saw , " he observed . " That 's why you 're here , you know , " Bergstrom answered . " To help you remember . " " But everything under the drug is so ... " " Haphazard ? That 's true . The recall episodes are always purely random , with no chronological sequence . Our problem will be to reassemble them in proper order later . Or some particular scene may trigger a complete memory return . " It is my considered opinion , " Bergstrom went on , " that your lost memory will turn out to be no ordinary amnesia . I believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nothing I 've seen under the drug fits into the past I do remember . " " That 's what makes me so certain , " Bergstrom said confidently . " You do n't remember what we have shown to be true . Conversely then , what you think you remember must be false . It must have been implanted there . But we can go into that later . For today I think we have done enough . This episode was quite prolonged . " " I wo n't have any time off again until next week end , " Zarwell reminded him . " That 's right . " Bergstrom thought for a moment . " We should n't let this hang too long . Could you come here after work tomorrow ? " " I suppose I could . " " Fine , " Bergstrom said with satisfaction . " I 'll admit I 'm considerably more than casually interested in your case by this time . " A work truck picked Zarwell up the next morning and he rode with a tech crew to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean muck from the converter plant at the seashore his bulldozer was waiting . He took his place behind the drive wheel and began working dirt down between windbreakers anchored in the rock . Along a makeshift road into the badlands trucks brought crushed lime and phosphorus to supplement the ocean sediment . The progress of life from the sea to the land was a mechanical process of this growing world . Nearly two hundred years ago , when Earth established a colony on St. Martin 's , the land surface of the planet had been barren . Only its seas thrived with animal and vegetable life . The necessary machinery and technicians had been supplied by Earth , and the long struggle began to fit the world for human needs . When Zarwell arrived , six months before , the vitalized area already extended three hundred miles along the coast , and sixty miles inland . And every day the progress continued . A large percentage of the energy and resources of the world were devoted to that essential expansion . The reclam crews filled and sodded the sterile rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted rivers to keep it fertile . When there were no rivers to divert they blasted out springs and lakes in the foothills to make their own . Biologists developed the necessary germ and insect life from what they found in the sea . Where that failed , they imported microorganisms from Earth . Three rubber-tracked crawlers picked their way down from the mountains until they joined the road passing the belt . They were loaded with ore that would be smelted into metal for depleted Earth , or for other colonies short of minerals . It was St. Martin 's only export thus far . Zarwell pulled his sun helmet lower , to better guard his hot , dry features . The wind blew continuously on St. Martin 's , but it furnished small relief from the heat . After its three-thousand-mile journey across scorched sterile rock , it sucked the moisture from a man 's body , bringing a membrane-shrinking dryness to the nostrils as it was breathed in . With it came also the cloying taste of limestone in a worker 's mouth . Zarwell gazed idly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beri-rabza ridden . A cure for the skin fungus had not yet been found ; the men 's faces and hands were scabbed and red . The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency , would soon have a moderate prosperity , yet they still lacked adequate medical and research facilities . Not all the world 's citizens were content . Bergstrom was waiting in his office when Zarwell arrived that evening . He was lying motionless on a hard cot , with his eyes closed , yet with his every sense sharply quickened . Tentatively he tightened small muscles in his arms and legs . Across his wrists and thighs he felt straps binding him to the cot . " So that 's our big , bad man , " a coarse voice above him observed caustically . " He does n't look so tough now , does he ? " " It might have been better to kill him right away , " a second , less confident voice said . " It 's supposed to be impossible to hold him . " " Do n't be stupid . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " What do you think they 'll do with him ? " " Execute him , I suppose , " the harsh voice said matter-of-factly . " They 're probably just curious to see what he looks like first . They 'll be disappointed . " Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to observe his surroundings . It was a mistake . " He 's out of it , " the first speaker said , and Zarwell allowed his eyes to open fully . The voice , he saw , belonged to the big man who had bruised him against the locker at the spaceport . Irrelevantly he wondered how he knew now that it had been a spaceport . His captor 's broad face jeered down at Zarwell . " Have a good sleep ? " he asked with mock solicitude . Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge that he heard . The big man turned . " You can tell the Chief he 's awake , " he said . Zarwell followed his gaze to where a younger man , with a blond lock of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded and went out , while the other pulled a chair up to the side of Zarwell 's cot . While their attention was away from him Zarwell had unobtrusively loosened his bonds as much as possible with arm leverage . As the big man drew his chair nearer , he made the hand farthest from him tight and compact and worked it free of the leather loop . He waited . The big man belched . " You 're supposed to be great stuff in a situation like this , " he said , his smoke-tan face splitting in a grin that revealed large square teeth . " How about giving me a sample ? " " You 're a yellow-livered bastard , " Zarwell told him . The grin faded from the oily face as the man stood up . He leaned over the cot  --  and Zarwell 's left hand shot up and locked about his throat , joined almost immediately by the right . The man 's mouth opened and he tried to yell as he threw himself frantically backward . He clawed at the hands about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suddenly reversed his weight and drove his fist at Zarwell 's head . Zarwell pulled the struggling body down against his chest and held it there until all agitated movement ceased . He sat up then , letting the body slide to the floor . The straps about his thighs came loose with little effort . The analyst dabbed at his upper lip with a handkerchief . " The episodes are beginning to tie together , " he said , with an attempt at nonchalance . " The next couple should do it . " Zarwell did not answer . His memory seemed on the point of complete return , and he sat quietly , hopefully . However , nothing more came and he returned his attention to his more immediate problem . Opening a button on his shirt , he pulled back a strip of plastic cloth just below his rib cage and took out a small flat pistol . He held it in the palm of his hand . He knew now why he always carried it . Bergstrom had his bad moment . " You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun . He tried again . " You must be joking . " " I have very little sense of humor , " Zarwell corrected him . " You 'd be foolish ! " Bergstrom obviously realized how close he was to death . Yet surprisingly , after the first start , he showed little fear . Zarwell had thought the man a bit soft , too adjusted to a life of ease and some prestige to meet danger calmly . Curiosity restrained his trigger finger . " Why would I be foolish ? " he asked . " Your Meninger oath of inviolable confidence ? " Bergstrom shook his head . " I know it 's been broken before . But you need me . You 're not through , you know . If you killed me you 'd still have to trust some other analyst . " " Is that the best you can do ? " " No . " Bergstrom was angry now . " But use that logical mind you 're supposed to have ! Scenes before this have shown what kind of man you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin 's makes little difference . If I was going to turn you in to the police , I 'd have done it before this . " Zarwell debated with himself the truth of what the other had said . " Why did n't you turn me in ? " he asked . " Because you 're no mad-dog killer ! " Now that the crisis seemed to be past , Bergstrom spoke more calmly , even allowed himself to relax . " You 're still pretty much in the fog about yourself . I read more in those comanalyses than you did . I even know who you are ! " Zarwell 's eyebrows raised . " Who am I ? " he asked , very interested now . Without attention he put his pistol away in a trouser pocket . Bergstrom brushed the question aside with one hand . " Your name makes little difference . You 've used many . But you are an idealist . Your killings were necessary to bring justice to the places you visited . By now you 're almost a legend among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on that later . " While Zarwell considered , Bergstrom pressed his advantage . " One more scene might do it , " he said . " Should we try again  --  if you trust me , that is ? " Zarwell made his decision quickly . " Go ahead , " he answered . All Zarwell 's attention seemed on the cigar he lit as he rode down the escalator , but he surveyed the terminal carefully over the rim of his hand . He spied no suspicious loungers . Behind the escalator he groped along the floor beneath the lockers until he found his key . The briefcase was under his arm a minute later . In the basement lave he put a coin in the pay slot of a private compartment and went in . As he zipped open the briefcase he surveyed his features in the mirror . A small muscle at the corner of one eye twitched spasmodically . One cheek wore a frozen quarter smile . Thirty-six hours under the paralysis was longer than advisable . The muscles should be rested at least every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adequate disguise now . He adjusted the ring setting on the pistol-shaped instrument that he took from his case , and carefully rayed several small areas of his face , loosening muscles that had been tight too long . He sighed gratefully when he finished , massaging his cheeks and forehead with considerable pleasure . Another glance in the mirror satisfied him with the changes that had been made . He turned to his briefcase again and exchanged the gun for a small syringe , which he pushed into a trouser pocket , and a single-edged razor blade . Removing his fiber-cloth jacket he slashed it into strips with the razor blade and flushed it down the disposal bowl . With the sleeves of his blouse rolled up he had the appearance of a typical workman as he strolled from the compartment . Back at the locker he replaced the briefcase and , with a wad of gum , glued the key to the bottom of the locker frame . One step more . Taking the syringe from his pocket , he plunged the needle into his forearm and tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more steps and paused uncertainly . When he looked about him it was with the expression of a man waking from a vivid dream . " Quite ingenious , " Graves murmured admiringly . " You had your mind already preconditioned for the shot . But why would you deliberately give yourself amnesia ? " " What better disguise than to believe the part you 're playing ? " " A good man must have done that job on your mind , " Bergstrom commented . " I 'd have hesitated to try it myself . It must have taken a lot of trust on your part . " " Trust and money , " Zarwell said drily . " Your memory 's back then ? " Zarwell nodded . " I 'm glad to hear that , " Bergstrom assured him . " Now that you 're well again I 'd like to introduce you to a man named Vernon Johnson . This world ... " Zarwell stopped him with an upraised hand . " Good God , man , ca n't you see the reason for all this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Quit ? " Bergstrom did not quite follow him . " It started on my home colony , " Zarwell explained listlessly . " A gang of hoods had taken over the government . I helped organize a movement to get them out . There was some bloodshed , but it went quite well . Several months later an unofficial envoy from another world asked several of us to give them a hand on the same kind of job . The political conditions there were rotten . We went with him . Again we were successful . It seems I have a kind of genius for that sort of thing . " He stretched out his legs and regarded them thoughtfully . " I learned then the truth of Russell 's saying : ' When the oppressed win their freedom they are as oppressive as their former masters . ' When they went bad , I opposed them . This time I failed . But I escaped again . I have quite a talent for that also . " I 'm not a professional do-gooder . " Zarwell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a normal man 's indignation at injustice . And now I 've done my share . Yet , wherever I go , the word eventually gets out , and I 'm right back in a fight again . It 's like the proverbial monkey on my back . I ca n't get rid of it . " He rose . " That disguise and memory planting were supposed to get me out of it . I should have known it would n't work . But this time I 'm not going to be drawn back in ! You and your Vernon Johnson can do your own revolting . I 'm through ! " Bergstrom did not argue as he left . Restlessness drove Zarwell from his flat the next day  --  a legal holiday on St. Martin 's . At a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered in the shadow of an adjacent building watching workmen drilling an excavation for a new structure . When a man strolled to his side and stood watching the workmen , he was not surprised . He waited for the other to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can spare a few minutes , " the stranger said . Zarwell turned and studied the man without answering . He was medium tall , with the body of an athlete , though perhaps ten years beyond the age of sports . He had a manner of contained energy . " You 're Johnson ? " he asked . The man nodded . Zarwell tried to feel the anger he wanted to feel , but somehow it would not come . " We have nothing to talk about , " was the best he could manage . " Then will you just listen ? After , I 'll leave  --  if you tell me to . " Against his will he found himself liking the man , and wanting at least to be courteous . He inclined his head toward a curb wastebox with a flat top . " Should we sit ? " Johnson smiled agreeably and they walked over to the box and sat down . " When this colony was first founded , " Johnson began without preamble , " the administrative body was a governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be elected biennially . At first they were . Then things changed . We have n't had an election now in the last twenty-three years . St. Martin 's is beginning to prosper . Yet the only ones receiving the benefits are the rulers . The citizens work twelve hours a day . They are poorly housed , poorly fed , poorly clothed . They ... " Zarwell found himself not listening as Johnson 's voice went on . The story was always the same . But why did they always try to drag him into their troubles ? Why had n't he chosen some other world on which to hide ? The last question prompted a new thought . Just why had he chosen St. Martin 's ? Was it only a coincidence ? Or had he , subconsciously at least , picked this particular world ? He had always considered himself the unwilling subject of glib persuaders ... but might n't some inner compulsion of his own have put the monkey on his back ? " ... and we need your help . " Johnson had finished his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled in a long breath , and let it out in a sigh . " What are your plans so far ? " he asked wearily .  --  CHARLES V.
