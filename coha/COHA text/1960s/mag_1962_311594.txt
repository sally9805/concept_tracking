One big killer among the various kinds of cancer is losing its punch . Overall , between 1930 and 1959 , the death rate per 100,000 from stomach cancer has dropped from 25.4 to 9.8 , which multiplies out as 20,000 deaths in 1959 . This drop , writes Buffalo 's Dr. George E. Moore in Surgery , Gynecology &; Obstetrics , " is adequate proof that gastric cancer is not inevitable . " But the factors in the victim 's way of life that might cause the disease remain to be identified . <P> Stomach cancer , which is often undetected until it is far advanced and likely to prove fatal , shows puzzling variations in frequency . The poor , says Dr. Moore , are more likely to get it than the rich . This suggests that the recent decrease reflects an improvement in the diets of the poor . At Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo , ethnic groups with high rates of stomach cancer have only one dietary peculiarity in common : they eat a lot of cabbage . Dr. Moore comments : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several decades . " <P> In other countries , other food habits are blamed . Japan has one of the highest rates of stomach cancer , and the disease there is commoner among men than among women . Says Honolulu 's Dr. Walter B. Quisenberry : Japanese men usually eat first , while the food is very hot ; they drink scalding tea ; they then drink more alcohol than their womenfolk . He also suggests that traditional stoicism may predispose Japanese men to psychosomatic stomach ulcers and later cancers . In the Scandinavian countries , doctors blame high rates of stomach cancer on diets rich in fish , with home-smoked fish particularly suspected in Iceland .
