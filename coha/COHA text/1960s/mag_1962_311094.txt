As the drama critic for the New York Herald Tribune , Walter Kerr has a special irritation . He has trouble enjoying a play when he has to worry about reviewing it . <P> Now , at book length , he invites others to share his discontent by showing how Americans have let their work spoil their pleasures . " I 'm going to start out , " Kerr warns in his first sentence , " by assuming that you 're approximately as unhappy as I am . " <P> In The Decline of Pleasure ( Simon &; Schuster , $5 ) , Kerr blames not the usual scapegoat , the Puritans , but the British Utilitarian philosophers of the last century , who declared : " Value depends entirely on utility . " As a practical people . Americans readily accepted this practical advice . Americans , he argues , feel that all their acts must serve some useful purpose , and when they do not , they feel guilty . Thus Americans work harder at their leisure than at their jobs , play bridge or tinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . " It is in the privacy of our passing from kitchen to bedroom . . . that we are most conscious of a fundamental unease . . . The sense of going nowhere overtakes us precisely when we are going home . " <P> Burdened by Abstractions . Since the Utilitarians taught them to value only what can be put to use . Americans no longer appreciate a thing in itself . They are immersed in abstractions . Kerr insists , and have lost touch with life in the raw . Modern abstract art mirrors abstract lives ; so does the avant-garde theater with its often meaningless chatter . Even business has become abstract . By a mere " shuffling " of papers , a financier can buy the Empire State Building without going near it . " Does he feel on solid ground , clothed in steel and concrete that have become part of himself ? " asks Kerr , " or has he simply brushed wings with a form in a dream ? " <P> To restore happiness , Kerr prescribes purposeless fun . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that dictates keeping the arms limp in an Irish jig . Art is the finest form of fun so long as it is not overburdened by a " message . " Americans must learn to relax and surrender to contemplation , which is " almost like falling in love . " When they have exhausted the pleasure of comic books , they will automatically graduate to Sherlock Holmes , then to Shakespeare , without having to ponder whether it has all been worthwhile . <P> Kerr 's men and women should expect nothing from pleasure but a " memory of delight , an increase of well-being so deep and so central that it can not even be located , let alone measured and codified for future use . " As precedent , Kerr might ( but does not ) cite Plato , who in the 4th century B.C. told the overworked Athenians : " God alone is worthy of supreme seriousness , but man is made God 's plaything , and that is the best part of him . Therefore every man and woman should live accordingly and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
