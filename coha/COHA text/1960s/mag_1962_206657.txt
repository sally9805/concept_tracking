In Chicago , Charlene Scanland was primping in front of the bathroom mirror one morning when a hoarse voice came out of the medicine cabinet saying : " Mirror , mirror , on the wall , who 's the fairest one of all ? " Replied Charlene , without pausing to analyze the situation : " You are . " Later , the owner of the mystery voice came around to find out who had answered the query so sweetly . He was a handsome bachelor who lived in the next apartment , but the story had no romantic ending for Charlene : he married her roommate instead . <P> Gargle , Rattle . Dwellers in the new " luxury " barracks in many U.S. cities have discovered that the bathroom is no longer humanity 's last haven of privacy . Built back-to-back in most buildings for reasons of economy , with thin walls , echoing acoustics and interconnecting ventilators , bathrooms have turned into monitoring booths . Whether they want to or not , tenants soon become all too familiar with the showering , gargling and flushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not confined to the bathroom : occupants of Manhattan 's vast Washington Square Village have long complained that they can lie in bed at night and hear magazine pages being turned in the bed next door .

Tales of recalcitrant electronic elevators with wills of their own , narrow corridors ( " Every night when I come home it looks more like a cell block " ) , warping floors , woofing plumbing and cracking plaster have become standard cocktail lore . <P> In fact , some of Manhattan 's speculative builders have plainly overreached themselves . Though buildings with names like Something East or Something Tower or Something House continue to push up like hoarfrost , and ask staggering prices ( one recently built co-op on Fifth Avenue wants $129,940 for a seven-room apartment , and $18,576 a year maintenance ) , some of the tinder-traps-on-Hudson are finding it hard to land customers . Apartment seekers frequently are offered half a year 's rent free as a lure .
