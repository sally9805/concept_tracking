The battle began in 1963 , when American Airlines offered half-price seats to servicemen on a standby basis . Ever since , U.S. airlines have been competing for traffic with an ever proliferating and vastly confusing array of cut-rate fares . As a result , more passengers than ever are crowding aboard planes . But the cheap promotional fares are putting such a squeeze on profit margins that last week four major trunk carriers agreed that the time had come to dump some of the discounts . <P> In separate petitions to the Civil Aeronautics Board , United , TWA , American and Eastern Air Lines asked permission to curtail use of the almost industry-wide " Discover America " excursion fares . Generally , such fares offer a 25% discount from regular round-trip jet coach rates , while requiring travelers to return no sooner than the following calendar week and no later than 30 days after they start . The fare can not be used during two peak travel times : noon to midnight Fridays and noon Sundays to noon Mondays . <P> The First Step . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a businessman who had been counted on to pay full fare has learned to juggle his travel to take advantage of the cut-rate schedules . TWA figures that $20 million worth of business that otherwise would have produced full fares will be diverted to discount fares this year , adding only $16.7 million to revenues . " In this respect , we 've been our own worst enemies , " says Executive Vice President G. Ray Woody of National Airlines . Despite a 17% rise in total operating revenues , the nation 's eleven major domestic carriers and Pan American World Airways suffered a 9% drop in operating profits during the first half of this year . <P> It was with such statistics in mind that United , TWA and American , in addition to seeking to restrict the hours and days their " Discover America " fares may be used , proposed to abolish their $200 excursion fare for transcontinental round trips and get the price back to $217 . United President George Keck describes such moves as " a logical first step " toward raising airline profits . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may ask for a general fare increase , their first since 1962 . <P> Cupcakes in Hot Pink . For all their financial pinch , the carriers are still revving up frills and frippery to woo customers . Pacific Airlines not long ago put its stewardesses in " hot pink " uniforms and advertised them delectably as " cupcakes . " Staid Northwest Airlines added a mink collar to its stewardess attire last month-and lifted hemlines just above the knee . To whip up interest in its South American routes , Braniff has just introduced such gourmet dishes as Cebiche Peruano de Pescado ( raw fish steeped in lemon juice ) and Arroz con Pato Chifa ( marinated duckling in soy sauce with date , rice and walnut dressing ) even aboard domestic flights . Reinforcing its $2,000,000-a-year take-the-wife-along campaign , United has been spending its own money to promote the availability of reduced rates for couples at the Hilton and Sheraton hotel chains and the Hertz and Avis rent-a-car companies .                    @
