TWENTY years ago , when the red , white and blue flag of the new Republic of the Philippines was hoisted over the islands , replacing the Stars and Stripes , which had flown during 48 years of U.S. colonial rule , TIME carried a cover story on President Manuel Roxas and the problems facing his country . At that time , the future looked bleak . " There is no national economy , no export trade , " we reported . Threatened by 150,000 Huk guerrillas , the " newest and poorest nation on earth could never hope to outlive its first free month " without massive U.S. aid . <P> Today , under President Ferdinand Marcos , the Philippines stand on their own feet . The country has serious problems ; but as this week 's cover makes clear , it has taken its place as a full-fledged member of the Asian community of nations . <P> When TIME scheduled the Marcos cover , the reporting team dispatched to Manila found itself with a double duty . Hong Kong Bureau Chief Frank McCulloch and Correspondent Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they also had to prepare TIME 'S coverage of the Manila Conference next week , which will draw 600 newsmen , with a resulting strain on hotels , communications and transport . <P> Our correspondents traveled from the Huk-ridden Pampanga province north of Manila to Cebu , 400 miles to the southeast . McCulloch spent 20 hours at Malacanang Palace , the presidential residence . Zich managed to interview several outlaw Huk leaders in a brandy-braced session that broke up at 4 a.m. , when the bandits and gun-toting bodyguards disappeared into the jungle . <P> Associate Editor Robert Jones , who wrote the cover story , spent six months in the Philippines during a tour with the Navy in the 1950s . " At first it all seems kind of scruffy and jungly , " he recalls . " Then it starts to grow on you , and you want to go back . It has a crazy kind of charm . " <P> <P> TIME is written by 40 individualists , each too intent upon his own stories to compare notes with fellow writers . Yet somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally run through the pages of an issue . This week seems to be animal week . <P> Some of the animals are metaphorical , like the ten-ton mouse that turns up in the Cinema review of Hawaii , or the plump bird who nests alone in another movie review , or the pug dog with brain damage in a Show Business account of a new comedienne . One of the beasts is mythological : the angry river dragon who threatens the forthcoming Laotian election as reported in The World . Another is symbolic : the burnt butterfly in Show Business ' report on Viet Nam protest plays . <P> But many of the animals are real . <P> Sport takes a look at hunting falcons , while a Medicine story on the latest Nobel Prize tells how a Plymouth Rock hen helped in cancer research . Singing lizards show up in The Nation 's report on U.S. civilians in Viet Nam , and World Business relates how German businessmen are up in arms over a frozen pig . <P> One of the more intriguing animals-the bedbug , being considered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deleted by the editors for lack of space .
