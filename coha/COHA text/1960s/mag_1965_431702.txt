 | the teenagers who saved a town As he climbed to the top of the old clay dike and stared out at the swollen Missis-sippi , eighteen-year-old Bill Stengel understood why his mother had been reluctant to let him go down to the river front that gloomy Sunday morning , last April 25 . The river was frighteningly broad , deep and fast , rolling south in the most violent flood of its history . And the dike , even to Bill 's untrained eye , seemed about crumble under the onslaught . The clay wall had been erected thirteen years before for three miles along the waterfront as a protective barrier between high river waters and Bill 's home town , Rock Island , Illinois . But , for the last three days , hard rain had beaten down , gradually turning the dike into little more than a gooey , slippery mass . As he slogged along , remembering his mother 's admonition to be careful , the high school football star chucked a few sandbags against places that seemed weak noted that the turbulent water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Then he saw the break . " Muddy water was gushing through a hole , near the bottom of the dike , about the size of a milk carton , " he remembers . " Cracks were spreading up to the top . I knew the dike was going to go . " He had just enough time to race back down the dike to a police car parked nearby and sound the alarm . With a terrible roar , a tidal wave exploded through the clay mound , gouging a trough six feet deep in the ground , flattening a steel fence and rolling unchecked into Rock Island 's far west end . Swiftly the water rose around two factory buildings , then rushed across open fields toward the city 's sewage-treatment plant . If it flooded the electrical system there and knocked out the pumps , raw sewage would back into streets and homes . Beyond the plant were unprotected residential areas and the downtown business district . In a matter of hours , nearly one-fifth of the entire city could be under water . And the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at least three days upstream . " If ever things looked black , " recalls City Manager Ray Botch , " that was the time . " But days later , after the river had crested at Rock Island and the flood had dissipated downstream , Federal inspection teams hailed Rock Island as the bestprotected town on the Mississippi . In scores of other eon-tinned on page 243 hunt  | communities , flood waters roaring down from Minnesota and Wisconsin racked up a grim toll : fourteen dead , more than 40,000 homeless , at least $200 million in property damage . It was the worst upper Mississippi flood on record . Yet , despite the break in the dike and dozens of other flirtations with tragedy , Rock Island , a town of 52,000 that nestles along a bend of the Mississippi , was spared . The force that turned the tide was youth . Thirty minutes after Bill Stengel 's alarm and a radio bulletin that the dike had burst that Sunday , 600 young @# people had swarmed to the scene . " They poured in like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor James Haymaker recalled recently . " I never saw anything like it . " They came by bicycle , cab , sports car , and foot . Nearly half were girls . Most were teenagers from Rock Island 's Augustana College and two high schools , but some were school dropouts and known troublemakers . " I saw a lot of my juvenile delinquents down there , " says State 's Attorney Richard Stengel , Bill 's father . " And a lot of blue bloods . " They had only one thing in common : they wanted to help . " You looked at that river , " recalls Arvid Sponberg , an Augustana junior from Topeka , Kansas , " and it made you mad . All the misery it would cause , all so needless . You just had to fight . " At that point , though , the situation looked hopeless . If only a dike of sandbags could be built atop a railroad embankment that curved past the sewage plant , the flood might be held in check , saving the downtown business district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residences . But engineers at the scene told Ray Botch , chief of the city 's flood-fighting team , that such an effort would be wasted . In less than three hours , the water , rising incredibly fast , one foot an hour , would top the embankment . Even before then , the experts declared , the sand-and-cinder rail bed would wash cut . Botch , the father of six children , rooked out at the young volunteers and decided to play the long shot . " You came here to work , " he announced , " so we 'll all toss sandbags ' til the water washes over us ! " The kids cheered . Quickly , they divided into work gangs . Some sped to an old sand deposit in an urban renewal area a mile away to begin the tedious job of ladling sand into burlap bags . Others heaved the heavy bags onto huge dump trucks and rushed them to the embankment , @# @#  | where other groups , stretched along the tracks in human chains , slapped the bags into place as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them work , especially the girls , " Botch recalls . " A full bag weighs thirty to seventy pounds but they wrestled them hour after hour without stopping . " While they worked , they watched the flood waters move toward three railroad cars parked on a siding twentyfive feet away . Inside were hundreds of bags of cyanide , a compound whose poisonous gases would , be released on contact with water . If the flood rose high enough and the cars leaked , the area for blocks around would be turned into a gas chamber . Meanwhile , the river was gaining . By midafternoon , it was neck-to-neck with the workers , lapping to the top as they slapped down each new layer of sandbags . By five o'clock , the makeshift barricade stood three feet high and four feet wide and stretched for half a mile along the tracks . Then , suddenly , the water stopped rising . Three inches from the top of the new dike , the water that had burst through the old clay barrier seven hours before had now reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but holding . Like the one-day supply of oil that caused the ancient Hebrews ' lamp to burn for eight miraculous days , the dike that could n't be built at all held for a week and a half . The students did n't stop with the first victory . Instead of drifting away , now that the novelty had worn off , they became the shock troops of virtually every flood battle . Spurning offers of three dollars an hour to sandbag industrial firms upriver , teenagers in steadily growing numbers worked night and day patching Rock Island 's sievelike dike without any pay at all . Augustana College officials , bowing to their commitment , canceled classes and arranged for an old gray school bus to run a shuttle service to the waterfront . The two high schools , required by law to stay in session , resigned themselves to absenteeism which some days topped 600 ? one-fifth of the total enrollment . " A mania gripped those kids , " says Vince Lundeen , an Augustana coach . " They seemed to feel they could n't do enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenagers by two-way radio , organized them into synchronized work gangs and kept them advised of the latest trouble spots . But no one had to tell them how to work hard . At the inland urban renewal site , they dug so much sand ? twenty feet down in one pit ? that they struck ground water . With hands blistered raw , they swung the rough sandbags down human conveyor belts 100 yards long , singing I 've got sixpence , jolly , jolly sixpence to maintain the rhythm . When rats , routed from the flooded city dump , scampered past the line or splashed nearby in the water , the teens squashed them between sandbags ? " making rat sandwiches , " they called it . Often they worked in water hip-deep and choked with raw sewage from flooded cities upstream . " It was as dirty as water can get without turning to mud , " a reporter remembers . The wind off the river was bone-chilling , and cold rain pelted them for hours . Some used dry-cleaners ' plastic bags for raincoats , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " recalls Barb Lundblad , an Augustana co-ed from Gowrie , Iowa . " Our jeans were so caked with filth they stood by themselves . " For twenty hours at a stretch some of them worked , until their eyes grew puffy and red and their speech slurred from fatigue . Many had to be ordered to quit . Then they catnapped on piles of sandbags or on the marble floor of City Hall or in the city jail . Those who went home ' slept with their clothes ? and the radio ? on , ready to rush back at word of any new crisis . As the flood crest moved closer to Rock Island , the crises piled one on top of another . Monday evening , Ray Botch drove his red station wagon along the dikes , pleading over a loudspeaker for all volunteers to report immediately to Centennial Bridge . There a hard north wind was slapping waves against the downtown waterfront dike. which appeared doomed to wash out by morning . Again engineers insisted that nothing could be done , but Botch proposed building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . It was a fantastic proposal . But the students eagerly dug in for another tense race with the angry river . Once , about midnight , they ran out of sand bags , but with **29;486;TOOLONG timing , a young man in a n sport jacket picked his way thro the mud and told City Councilman Mosenfelder : " I represent a milling c pany upriver in Clinton , Iowa . We ha 200,000 sandbags loaded on trailers there that we do n't need . Can you them ? " By dawn Tuesday , the wall was ished ? just as the old dike failed the river surged through . The newly laid sandbags stopped but , by eight A.M. , another emerge threatened the city . A dike failure the riverfront railroad yards half a upstream from the bridge was begin @#  | ning to push water toward downtown . Again Botch proposed a long-shot , even longer and more unlikely than the others . What was needed this time , he told the teens , was a dike twice as long as the one they 'd built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have offered a contractor a million dollars to build that dike , " says Mosenfelder , " and he would have turned it down as impossible . " But the kids set to it . By ten o'clock that night , they 'd finished the job . In the twenty-five hours beginning with the crisis at the bridge , the volunteer task force that swelled to 1,500 at times had laid in place more than a quartermillion sandbags . By that time local teenagers , living on Salvation Army sandwiches and hidden reservoirs of energy , discovered they were not alone . Growing numbers of adults , encouraged by the teens ' remarkable morale , joined the fight , and other young people were beginning to swarm in from as far as 200 miles away . " They had no personal stake whatever in our city 's survival , " says a Chamber of Commerce official , " yet we counted kids from thirty-five high schools and colleges from throughout Illinois , Iowa and Missouri . " They came by jalopy , chartered bus and thumb , some with less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cutting classes , some studied by flashlight during rest breaks and left by four A.M.to get back for morning exams . One Rock Island merchant who worked beside an exuberant college boy from out of town remembers : " This kid kept slinging the sandbags hard with his left hand , hitting me in the chest . I was getting ticked off . I said , ' Why do n't you just pass them to me with both hands ? ' " He said , ' I 'm sorry , sir , I wish I could . ' He turned around then , and I saw his right arm . It was artificial . " At five A.M. Wednesday , Ray Botch received a phone call from Jack Holzer , superintendent of Rock Island 's riverfront waterworks . It was news he did n't seed . Flood water " boiling " through a weak section of the old dike had turned the levee around the water plant into a lake and now was beginning to pour through the plant 's front door . " We 've t four inches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boomed . " Two ' feet more and it 'll hit the electric pumps . That 'll be the darndest fireworks you ever saw , and the city will be out of water . It 'll be chaos . " As he sped to the scene , Botch discovered water also rising steadily higharound two huge gasoline storage s on the levee . Perhaps they were ong enough to withstand the prese , but , if they should rupture , the ee could become a lake of fire . City employees and dozens of volteers were busy fortifying other critspots on the dike . The townspeople re exhausted from days of floodting . But it was clear to Botch and Holzer that the waterworks were doomed less help came fast . Just then a bus rolled up carrying teenagers , the entire senior high  | school class of private Francis Parker School in Chicago . With $250 of their own money , they had rented the bus and traveled 175 miles to Rock Island with three of their teachers to help . They could n't have picked a better senior-class project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dike sturdy enough to protect the gasoline tanks and save the city 's water supply . " I 've never done anything more strenuous than take ballet lessons before this , " seventeen-year-old Lee Sahlins said , surveying the dike . A classmate standing beside her in knee-deep water observed : " My mother told me not to get my feet wet . She should see me now . " Not all the soldiers were on the front lines , however . In emergency relief shelters set up by the Red Cross , teens were filling jobs from baby-sitting to show business . Jammed into the shelters were 1,900 men , women and children forced to flee their homes when islands and towns around Rock Island were flooded in the river 's mad rush to the sea . Many had been able to salvage only what they could carry in cardboard boxes . Some watched on TV newscasts as their homes floated away . In the makeshift shelters , they had only cots for sleeping , and blankets hung on clothesline rope for privacy . The children among them got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boost morale generally , a dozen Augustana students hastily staged a touring variety show , featuring a stuffed monkey that played pat-a-cake , a folk singer " talking the blues , " and a comic professor who lectured hilariously on " How Columbus Discovered America . " " One of our cars had no reverse gear , " recalls Greg Johnson , an eighteen-year-old Augustana freshman from Racine , Wisconsin , who organized the troupe , " and we were always having to pile out in costume and makeup to push it . But we managed to hit six shelters a day . " At one show , a crochety , overworked shelter guard glared sternly at them during the acts , but when the finale struck up and the troupers led their young audience on a snake dance through the shelter , he grabbed a toddler in his arms , took another by the hand , and skipped with them around the room . " I do n't know if we 'll ever be @# able to recapture the feeling we had then , " Johnson says . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went looking for trouble . Early in the flood crisis , Augustana ham-radio buffs had set up a communications network for the Red Cross , and they used it now to dispatch volunteers from Rock Island to other towns . The workers often found local teens already on the job , but more help was always needed . And the work was not child 's play . At Moline , Illinois , two boys slipped off a dike and nearly drowned when their hip boots filled with water and dragged them under . At Point Mississippi on the Iowa shore , Augustana students worked in driving rain on a dike so shaky that girls were forbidden near it . Midway through the job they ran out of sand and had to fill the bags with a mixture of lime and cement , which solidified in the rain . After working for hours with the heavy bags , they returned to shore ? to find that rats had broken into their food supply and devoured every crumb . Fred Behnken , a championship track star from Augustana , worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milan , Illinois . He lugged sandbags , one on each shoulder , until an excruciating backache forced him to stop . Doctors say he slipped a disc and will risk permanent back injury if he ever runs again . " Before we went down there , " recalls Arvid Sponberg , " we were studying Thoreau . He has a phrase about ' backing life into a corner . ' That 's how it was . It was real . " At ten P.M. Wednesday , April 28 , the feared flood crest began rolling past Rock Island . It stretched a mile wide across the river and fifty miles long and it brushed river markers at 22.48 feet ? seven feet above flood stage , four feet above the twentieth-century high mark and two and one-half feet higher than the city 's old clay dike . Yet not a drop of water crept into downtown Rock Island , and only a - handful of homes suffered any damage . City officials estimate that more than 6,000 young people were involved at one time or another in winning this remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to California , plus a dozen foreign countries from India to North Borneo .

Speculation ran ; the cynical ( " They liked get of school " ) to the idealistic felt they were working for and " They had a deep sense of sibility toward people in nee ( the consensus , it seems , lies assessment by an Augustana from Michigan .
