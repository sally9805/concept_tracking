INSURANCE companies generally tap salesmen , lawyers or investment specialists to become their presidents . Gilbert W. Fitzhugh is one of the few actuaries heading a large firm , but his happens to be the biggest : the venerable , 96-year-old Metropolitan Life . Last week President Fitzhugh announced a 1963 premium income of $2.8 billion and $7.5 billion worth of new insurance issued , which keeps Metropolitan well ahead of runner-up Prudential . The Metropolitan 's insurance in force ( $106.5 billion ) covers 44.5 million people . One life-insurance policyholder ( for $500,000 ) is Fitzhugh , 54 , who by his own tables enjoys a life expectancy of 74.7 years . Not figured in , however , is the fact that Fitzhugh does not diet , shuns exercise and is " all thumbs " around his Sutton Place apartment in Manhattan . Still , since graduating from Princeton ( ' 30 ) he has rarely missed a day 's work , progressed steadily through the ranks until last year he took over as chief executive from retiring Chairman Frederic Ecker , who died last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Chrysler-Plymouth division , Philip N. Buckminster , 47 , runs a bigger operation than the chief executive of many a major company . Buckminster is considered one of the fastest-rising automen in Detroit , has become the favorite troubleshooter of Chrysler President Lynn Townsend . Under Buckminster , the Chrysler-Plymouth Division is readying a racy new sports car , the Barracuda , for Spring introduction ; last week the division raised its prestige with a 1-2-3 upset victory for Plymouth over Ford in the Daytona 500 stock car race . Trained as a financial analyst at Ford under Robert McNamara , Buckminster is a quiet , thorough executive . Before taking over the division in January , he raised Chrysler 's share of U.S. auto exports from 16.2% to 22.3% , increased Dodge truck sales from 40,000 units a year to 74,000 and saved the money-losing Dodge truck operation just as Townsend was ready to scrap it . Buckminster is now busy trying to boost Plymouth from a sad seventh to the No. 3 sales position it once held behind Chevrolet and Ford .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
