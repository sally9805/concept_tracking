" Every morning I awake with an empty feeling , as if there had been a death in the family , " says white-haired Floyd Rinker , veteran of 32 years of English teaching at Newton ( Mass . ) High School . What depresses Rinker is the generally sad state of the 90,000 English teachers in U.S. secondary schools-public , private and parochial . <P> Rinker well knows that English teaching can be impossibly hard . The " normal " high school teaching load is 125 to 150 pupils a day . If a teacher assigns 125 pupils one 500-word essay a week , allowing 15 minutes apiece to correct them , he faces more than 30 hours of extra work . ( One result is that some teachers assign no essays , and high schools are graduating students who never wrote a single composition in four years . ) Nonetheless , Rinker thinks that the deeper problem is simply incompetence ; few teachers , for example , read enough , and many can not write with style and clarity . <P> " Germ Carriers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad called the Commission on English , which the College Entrance Examination Board launched in 1959 with $1,000,000 . A top priority : re-educating teachers . Says Harvard Professor Harold Martin , chairman of the commission : <P> " They 're doing a damned poor job in education schools-75% of the time is wasted time , filled time . " <P> This summer Rinker &; Co. set up " institutes " at 20 universities from Cornell to California , gave 900 teachers a stiff dose of everything from satire to syntax . Supposedly the nation 's best English teachers , they are expected to go home as " germ carriers " after a graduate-level summer tour of literature , linguistics and composition . Rinker is pleased-but not nearly as pleased as he hoped to be . <P> Reformer Rinker 's problem was clear last week at Harvard , which wound up an institute for 45 New England teachers . Their ages ranged from 25 to 62 , and 85% of them had master 's degrees . As the course ended , a few were plain flunking ; many others had barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " Born Again . " In teaching the literature course , Harvard 's Professor Martin dug deep into the " ethos " of King Lear . His charges scribbled copious , precise notes ( only one or two actually dozed ) . At length Martin paused to ask : " What happens to Edgar at the end of the play ? " <P> A long silence followed ; apparently no one remembered Edgar . Finally Martin said , a little ruefully , " He 's king . " <P> Professor Scott Elledge ruthlessly ripped apart the teachers ' compositions-the first creative writing for some of them since adolescence . " Full of hazy thought , " he snapped . " This kind of rhetoric we do n't need-it 's unliterary . " The teachers , who tend to see correcting essays as sim ple proofreading rather than criticism of meaning , giggled nervously , or sat in stunned embarrassment . <P> Happily , they remained undaunted . " It 's like being born again , " said one woman teacher . Inspired by their encounter with Greek rhetoric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in high schools . Still to be seen is how much of an epidemic such germ carriers can start back home .
