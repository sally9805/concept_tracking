They were pro basketball 's old men , the team the experts wrote off as has-beens after they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the National Basketball Association play-offs last year and finished a distant second to the 76ers in the N.B.A. 's Eastern Division this season . Over the long haul , the Boston Celtics might be the most successful team in the history of pro sport , but now they were over the hill . Their coach and center , Bill Russell , was 34 . So was Guard Sam Jones . Forward Bailey Howell was 31 ; Captain John Havlicek was a youngster at 28 . It sounded mostly like pride talking when one Boston player said : " What difference does it make if you are 90 , as long as you can play basketball ? " <P> None , apparently . Last month the Celtics spotted Wilt ( " The Stilt " ) Chamberlain and his heavily-favored 76ers a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Division playoffs , then ran away with three straight games-two of which were played in unfriendly Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion Los Angeles Lakers 124-109 on the Lakers ' home court , to capture the final playoffs by four games to two , and win their tenth N.B.A. championship in the past twelve years . <P> The Celtics ' final victory was as complete as it was effortless : the old pros beat the young pretenders at their own game . A fast-breaking team that depends heavily on the accurate shooting of its " hot hands , " Elgin Baylor and Jerry West , the Lakers were both outrun and outshot . Baylor scored 28 points and West accounted for 22 , but Boston 's Havlicek dropped in 40 and Howell hit for 30 . The Celtics opened up a 70-50 half-time lead , and after that the Lakers never really came close . One big reason : 6-ft. 10-in . Center Russell <P> played as if he were 24 instead of 34 <P> grabbing 19 rebounds , scoring 12 points , blocking several shots and intimidating the Lakers with his ferocity under the basket . On one incredible play , as Lakers Guard Archie Clark was driving in all alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making up fully five strides in a single bound , leaped high , and clamped a huge hand over the ball before Clark could drop it into the hoop . " Russell , " acknowledged Los Angeles ' West afterward , " is the best basketball player I 've ever seen . They talk about Wilt Chamberlain , but Russell always rises to the occasion . He is really the most valuable player . "
