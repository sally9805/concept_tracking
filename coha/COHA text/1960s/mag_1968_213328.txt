Hemophilia is not just " the disease of kings , " although it was so called after Queen Victoria transmitted the deadly trait to Russia 's Romanovs and a dozen other royal-blooded descendants . As many as 40,000 Americans , commoners all , are estimated to suffer from the severe , " classical " form of the ailment . Doctors have learned to control most victims ' bleeding episodes with transfusions and intravenous injections . But the techniques involved have been complex , cumbersome and costly . Only recently has medical research advanced sufficiently to simplify the process and cope with the problems of supply . <P> What the hemophiliac 's blood lacks , because of a genetic defect transmitted from mother to son , is a clotting protein known as antihemophilic factor ( AHF ) or globulin ( AHG ) , also called Factor VIII . Because of this deficiency , the hemophilia victim lives in constant danger of severe bleeding from the most minor wound , such as a finger cut or a tooth extraction . Even with no external injury , he may bleed internally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to happen inside his joints , causing arthritis with progressive deformity and disability . <P> Fast Freeze . Since all normal blood contains AHF when fresh , transfusion is an obvious answer . But the volume needed may amount to several pints a day , more than the patient 's system can stand if the treatment has to be repeated often-as it usually does . And all transfusions carry the risk of hepatitis infection or severe allergic reactions . It was not until 1965 that a Stanford University physiologist , Judith Graham Pool , developed a technique of freezing , thawing and centrifuging fresh plasma to concentrate the AHF . ( The rest of the plasma could still be broken down into a dozen other life-saving fractions . ) <P> In its frozen state , this cryoprecipitate kept indefinitely and could be quickly processed for intravenous infusion in a solution averaging ten to 20 times the potency of plasma . But infusion took up to an hour , and the hemophiliac usually had to go into a hospital to get it . The material could be extracted from only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mobile blood unit and delivery at a blood center was long enough to destroy or damage the AHF . <P> Grateful Beneficiary . Now solutions are being found for even these problems . The Health Fund of Greater Cleveland has just begun sending around , along with its normal mobile blood-collecting unit , the nation 's first auxiliary van equipped with a freeze-centrifuge apparatus . And recently Dr. Kenneth M. Brinkhous , a blood scientist at the University of North Carolina , collaborated with Dr. Edward Shanbrom of the Hyland ( Los Angeles ) division of Baxter Laboratories to perfect a new AHF six or seven times as strong as Dr. Pool 's cryoprecipitate . The new preparation , 30 to 50 times as active as plasma , has just gone on the market .
