Welcome banners bedecked Lusaka 's postage-stamp airport , and 2,000 jubilant Africans pressed against its wire fence , their faces daubed festively with red ink , and frantically waving ceremonial palm fronds . Out of the Dakota transport stepped a shock-haired , anthracite-black man in a natty suit . To cheers of " Ken , our Zambia boy ! " he unfurled a banner that proclaimed : REPUBLIC DAY , OCTOBER 24 . Then he said : " I told you before we left we were going to collect a republic . We have brought it back to you . " <P> Thus last week Northern Rhodesian Prime Minister Kenneth ( " The Black Lion " * ) Kaunda returned from London bearing a long-coveted gift for his 3,500,000 people : a fixed date for independence . Next Oct. 24 , Northern Rhodesia will become the Common wealth Republic of Zambia . <P> Going It Alone . For ten years Northern Rhodesia formed part of Britain 's ill-starred Central African Federation , in which the black-dominated protectorate was bound awkwardly to equally black Nyasaland and white-ruled Southern Rhodesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence , London reluctantly cut the ties among the three . Nyasaland is to gain independence in July , but is poor in resources and rich in unemployment . Southern Rhodesia is rent with racial strife because it refuses to grant equal representation to blacks , has received no independence date . Of the trio , Northern Rhodesia 's future looks by far the brightest . <P> <P> One reason is that , despite its need to develop educational and agricultural resources , Northern Rhodesia is inherently richer than its two neighbors-thanks to fabulous copper reserves that net $336 million a year . A more important cause for optimism is Kenneth Kaunda himself . A teetotaling preacher 's son and ex-schoolteacher , Kaunda , 40 , is a fiery nationalist who has spent his share of time in British prisons . But he has since convinced his former masters that he has the makings of a moderate African statesman in the mold of Tanganyika 's Nyerere . Kaunda advocates a " multiracial society " that will protect the rights of the white minority . He favors foreign investment , has promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local share of the take . <P> <P> No Nonsense . During the 16-day independence conference in London , Kaunda so impressed the Colonial Office that Northern Rhodesia will be the first British-ruled territory allowed to make the jump to full independence without the usual period of dominion status under the symbolic tutelage of a Queen 's governor-general . Under a new constitution that includes safeguards for individual rights , Kaunda will take over as President . <P>
