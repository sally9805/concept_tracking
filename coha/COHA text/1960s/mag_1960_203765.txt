A brash and bushy-haired Kentuckian named H. Keith Williams breezed into Dallas two years ago , determined to break into the Big Rich . Williams , 23 , son of a prosperous Louisville furniture manufacturer , announced to all who would listen that he was going into the oil business . True , he had only a $1,200 stake , but that did not faze him . Said he : " I 've had experience in road construction and furniture manufacturing , and there 's a lot in common between those two and oil . They all use heavy machinery . " That seemed to satisfy investors anxious to get in with a possible challenger to oil-rich Clint Murchison . Williams soon collected more than $800,000 from some 100 to 300 investors , much of it from " people my daddy knew . " <P> Williams formed a company , drilled some 30 wells . For a time things appeared to go swimmingly . Paying himself $500 a week out of the oil funds ( " We would draw money against anticipated profits " ) , he wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company-owned Buick , and bought a $67,500 house in a fashionable suburb . In the living room , he hung a portrait of Robert E. Lee and one of himself posed dramatically in front of a towering oil derrick . But the derrick was about as near to gushers as he got . Oil dribbled out of only six Williams wells , and in unimpressive amounts . <P> Williams was hauled into federal court in Dallas fortnight ago in bankruptcy proceedings against his Williams Petroleum , Inc . Besides losing the money his backers invested , Williams ended up owing $264,471 to more than 200 creditors for everything from flowers to drilling rigs , including a $340 bill to the Diners ' Club . In fact , he told the court , he had no money to pay for a lawyer . Asked by his creditors ' attorney whether he ever inspected his books , Williams replied politely , " No , sir . " Requested to examine his balance sheet ( which under " cash on hand " carried the terse entry : " None " ) , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I read ? I do n't know debits , credits . I did n't know how to read them if I saw them . I do n't know about these corporation matters . " <P> <P> Last week , as the case ground on , neither Williams nor his wife seemed overly concerned about the bankruptcy proceedings . Says Williams , who claims that some of his other oil investments have been profitable : " I 'm going to go right ahead . I 'm not personally bankrupt . Any oilman knows that just because one company is bankrupt , it does n't mean a thing . " For Mrs. Williams , the bankruptcy proceedings may have one incidental advantage . Her husband may change his invariable diet of " real thick steaks smothered in garlic salt . " Said she last week : " I 'm so sick of eating steak , I 'm going to go right out and buy us some chicken . "
