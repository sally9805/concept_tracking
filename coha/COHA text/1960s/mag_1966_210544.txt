There was a full Cabinet meeting last week in Argentina . That would not be unusual in most countries , but it set a precedent for President Arturo Illia , a onetime country doctor , who has always received his ministers separately or in groups of two or three . Only once before in his 21 years in office had he called in the entire Cabinet , and that was to pay formal tribute to John F. Kennedy after his assassination . So what was the occasion last week ? <P> As usual in Argentina , it was the possibility of a military coup . Dissatisfied with Illia 's laissez-faire philosophy of government , and particularly alarmed at the prospect of a Peronist victory in the gubernatorial elections next March , the army had just handed Illia a warning to get a move on-or else . So into the Casa Rosada last week filed his eight ministers , ten ministerial-rank Secretaries of State and Vice President Carlos Humberto Perette . When they filed out again , they promised the army that action would be taken . From now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President every week .
