txt Medicine A New Warning on Cigarettes HOW CIGARETTE SMOKING CUTS LIFE EXPECTANCY Average loss in years by persons 25 years of age who smoke amounts indicated below the rest of their lives . CIGARETTES SMOKED PER DAY : Fewer than 10 4.6 years 10 to 19 5.5 years One to 2 packs LL ** More than 2 packs ** The Public Health Service declared for the first time last week that there is a direct cause-andeffect link between cigarette smoking and heart disease . In its annual report to Congress the agency also cited figures to show that the smoker can expect to have his life shortened by his habit ( chart above ) . American Cancer Society ads , such as the one at right , are designed to discourage the young from smoking . WASHINGTON ? For years the argument against cigarette smoking has put strong emphasis on the risk of lung cancer and other diseases of the respiratory tract . The Public Health Service calls cigarette smoking " the main cause of lung cancer in men " and the most important cause of chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Indeed one of the earliest and most vigorous enemies of the smoking habit has been the American Cancer Society . But heart disease is the leading cause of death among adult Americans and , on this subject , the polemics against smoking have been more cautious . They have seldom gone farther than the charge that there is a statistical link between cigarette smoking and increased risk of death from heart disease . This kind of link does not prove cause and effect . Last week in its annual report to Congress on smoking and health , the Public Health Service went a big step beyond its past statements . Conclusion " It is concluded that cigarette smoking can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and particularly to death from coronary heart disease , " said the report . It said an " increasing convergence " of evidence points to this conclusion , suggests how the effects come about , and explains why the risk diminishes when a person gives up smoking . In forwarding the report to Congress , Wilbur J. Cohen , Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning statement on cigarette packages be made stronger and that this statement be required not only on the packs , but also on vending machines and in all advertisements . The latest report from the Public Health Service even put some numbers on the risk of death . On the average , the report said , a man in the 25-to35 year age bracket who smokes more than two packs a day , can expect to have his life shortened by eight years if he does n't stop . Even the light smoker In the same age group ? the man who uses no more than a half pack ( a day ? risks an average life shortening of four years . The report was prepared by the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health , directed by Dr. Daniel Horn . It supplements a report last year and the major research survey in 1964 by the Surgeon General 's Special Advisory Committee on Smoking . " The evidence attesting to the harmful effect of smoking on health has continued to mount during the past year . With new research findings confirming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking and many forms of illness related to it , " said Surgeon General William H. Stewart in a foreword to the new report . In its discussion of coronary heart disease , the report said the disease rate for men who smoke 26 or more cigarettes a day appears to be about three times as great as that for men who never smoked . It noted also that , altogether , coronary heart disease ? producer of heart attacks ? caused 31 percent of all the deaths in the U.S. last year . The degree to which cigarette smoking adds to the hazard of heart disease is unclear because so many factors are involved , the report said , but the probable manner in which smoking contributes is becoming clearer . Through several possible mechanisms cigarett smoking could increase the heart 's demand for oxygen while , at the same time , decreasing its oxygen supply . For example , the report said , there is evidence that carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke may reduce the blood 's capacity to give up oxygen to the tissues . There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to smoking and that this increases the heart 's need for oxygen . The report also listed several other ways in which smoking could complicate the oxygen supply problem for hearts compromised by pre-existing disease . Major Role " Thus , " it said , " the interaction of the factors which decrease oxygen supply to the myocradium ( heart muscle ) and those which increase the myocardial demand for oxygen may play a major role-in precipating the fatal outcome in some individuals with coronary heart disease . " The discovery that persons who stop smoking have a lower st tistical risk of death from heart disease could be explained , the report suggested , by the fact that these effects attributed to smoking would be expected to diminish naturally when smoking is stopped . " Effective preventive programs must be created if we are to meet smoking 's grave challenge to human health successfully and reduce the burden of suffering and economic loss involved , " said Dr. Stewart in his foreword to the 176-page document . - 1- H/kItOLD 111 .
