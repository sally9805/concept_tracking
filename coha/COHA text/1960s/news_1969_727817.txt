txt Defense powwow seeks to remap Pentagon path Drastic revision of Pentagon approaches to defense problems is imminent . Deeply convinced that the military establishment is in trouble , the Nixon administration is moving eagerly now to seek solutions to some of the more pressing problems . Top civilian and military aides have discussed various areas of difficulty at length with Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird and his deputy , David ' Packard . One such prolonged session was held over this past weekend at a retreat near Warrenton in Virginia 's horse country . It can be expected now that Mr. Laird will make some substantial changes in defense procedures in the next few weeks and months to get matters moving in what he considers the proper direction . The most drastic revision will come as a result of the studies of a " blue-ribbon commission " promised to look into overall defense approaches in great detail . But the Republican administration is eager to have the fiscal 1970 budget reflect as much as possible Republican thinking . And that must go far beyond budgetary allocations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that changes must be instituted in short order if the planning processes leading to the budget to go before Congress in January are to reflect the new approaches . The Pentagon 's efforts will be closely related to the comprehensive review of the nation 's security strategies now being conducted by the National Security Council . Options relating to the strategic balance are before the council/now . The second major part dealing with political approaches and the forces necessary to support them will be before the council by midyear . It is thus likely that the administration will not be able to develop precise guidelines before next year , when all of the studies have been completed and there has been time for coordinated decisionmaking . Until the national strategies are developed , the Defense Department can not move to develop precise force // By a staff photographer Secretary Laird Talk and change at the Pentagon U.S. defense powwow seeks to remap Pentagon path // structures and levels , as well as military strategies , to support the new policies . But that does not mean that the Defense Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiding concepts have already been developed , and the Pentagon hierarchy can be expected to move soon to realign defense-management procedures on a broad scale . In general , two broad trends will appear : : ? Military men will have a far greater role in the outlining of force structures and levels and in the day-to-day direction of the armed forces . ? Secretary of Defense Laird , who believes firmly in civilian control of the defense establishment , will continue to rely heavily upon his chief civilian assistants to keep a close watch and check upon defense activities . He wants very much to get the Defense Department under control , in all respects , and he apparently believes that a strong civilian advisory and control apparatus is necessary to that end . But to a definite extent , the civilian hierarchy will lose some of its bite . A particular example is the systems-analysis office , which can be expected to lose many of the prerogatives enjoyed under former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara . During those years , systems analysis was quite pervasive , often dictating force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes judged humdrum  --  details to the military departments : Those days are fast waning , although some few vestiges remain . In the end , it can be expected that the systems analysts will evolve more into a watchdog over , than a promulgator of , major defense approaches . Swinging the pendulum back During the 1950 's , the civilian hierarchy , particularly on the second and third levels , often was overwhelmed by the military . By the time Mr. McNamara had finished tailoring the defense establishment to his own liking , the military voice often was inconsequential in many aspects of defense . Now Mr. Laird , essentially a conservative in defense approaches , is in the process of swinging the pendulum back . The apparent goal is a happy point at which the military and civilians work together in common purpose to devise realistic goals and the defense structure to support those strategic requirements . It is expected that the military departments will play a far greater role than in the past few years in developing defense budgets . The theory behind this greater reliance upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and problems than are the secretary and his staff . But there is every intention apparently of making sure that the guidance given the departments is firm and clear . The watchword of this change , if there can be said to be one , will be realism . Mr. Laird is expected to seek a clear administration-wide understanding of what capabilities are expected of the Defense Department and what obligations the Defense Department must be able to fulfill . With that relatively firm , he and his principal military and civilian advisers will be able to work toward their concept of the proper defense posture . All the present study , both in the National Security Council and at the Pentagon , involves close attention to what the nation can afford . The administration does not want to set defense goals that are impossible monetarily . One of the problems that has led to some rather pronounced controversy between military and civilian sectors at the Pentagon . in recent years is the annual budget review . The military claimed opportunistic and prim budget-sniping by civilians ; the civilians claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outsiders often felt the overall result was a bit of a fraud and that the end result was not so much the same defense for less money but less defense for less money . The old procedure was to ask the military to provide a cost for a specific level of commitment by the defense establishment . When cost-cutting was done later , by the Pentagon civilian leadership , the reduced cost that was decided upon reflected not so much a saving on the same commitments : Instead a lower level of preparedness was sanctioned . That is going to be changed through the expedient of letting military and civilian officials involved in the decisionmaking process have a clear idea of budgetary limitations . Then , hopefully , the civilians and the military can work in concert to get the best defense they can devise within budgetary limitations . The budget and the budgetmakers will probably be more flexible than they were in the 1950 's , but the checking and revising can also be expected to be more severe .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
