txt The various Republican leaders could do a little less talking and a little more thinking . The shape of their party is not going to be reestablished overnight . There is no point in tearing one another asunder . Indeed , whether there is a Republican Party to lead is more important than who is to lead it . A good way to start strengthening the base would be to clarify the party 's basic viewpoint . Massachusetts Attorney General Edward W. Brooke 's suggestion of a national convention next summer to draft a new platform has much merit . There needs to be a new affirmation of true conservatism , rejecting the extremism and fanaticism which infiltrated the Goldwater campaign . " The Conscience of a Conservative , " which was the earlier identification of Sen. Barry Goldwater 's view , was far more adequate than the three or four paperbacks which later came to dominate the campaign . A new conservative manifesto needs to be written and published more in keeping with the needs and temper of the American people as we head toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the thesis that most of the Democrats and many of the Republicans are the authors or tools of a treasonable conspiracy . It should seek to unite rather than divide men and women of goodwill throughout the country . Its program should be positive , rather than negative . It should recognize the problems that have to be solved by governmental action , and outline its views on how solutions can be worked out . The new conservatism should nail down its right wing , abandoning the extremist fringe , and then spread its effort at consensus as far into the center as possible . This is the mood of the United States today . * Leaving world problems aside , the great need domestically is still that of adjustment to and utilization of the tremendous technologi. cal revolution through which we are moving .

There is a great deal of work to be done , in the United States alone . But it is work which falls partly in the public sector and partly in the private . It is work such as the replanning of our urban and suburban areas , and rebuilding large parts of them . It is work such as will provide better education and technical job training for those who have hitherto been unskilled laborers . There is very little need for unskilled labor any more . The new conservatism should ask : How can the public and private sectors of the economy best be coordinated , so that the strengths of each will be maximized ? What obstacles are there to the fuller expansion and imaginative growth of the private sector ? Do antiquated fetters , such as impede building construction , need to be removed ? Do labor 's many restrictions need to be reexamined , so as to promote job creation in the interest of labor ? In short , the new conservatism could turn to economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national solutions in the rest of the 1960's.
