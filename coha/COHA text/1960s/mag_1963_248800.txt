It 's only 92 days till Christmas , and if the U.S. Toy Manufacturers ' exhibit , which opened in New York this week , is any indication , it 's going to be a mechanized holiday this year . Make-believe is out , if not actually forbidden . <P> " Trassy 's " hair really GROWS when a key is turned in her back . The puppets have their own lines-eight or ten deathless phrases at the pull of a string . The toy car is not pulled by a string , not even attached to an electric cord with controls on one end , but operated by the young master by shining a flashlight on a built-in solar cell . The bear flees the juvenile hunter aimlessly around the room , uttering real bellows of pain when the blunted bullets find their mark . And while six-year-old space cadets are blasting off rockets with water pressure , their knee-high girl friends ( with whom they are presumably going steady ) will be usefully engaged in the dark arts of maquillage , practicing with a Charm Girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaming , rouging , eye-shadowing , and getting the fake eyelashes on straight .
