txt Last August , a drilling crew working for Skelly Oil Co. made a major natural gas dis : covery near Jai , N.M. , bringing in a well that alone could supply the rzas needs of a city the size of Fort Worth , Texas . This prize find , believed to be the biggest ever in the U.S. , would have touched off vigorous bidding by pipeline companies eager for new gas sources if it had been made a year or so earlier . But today , four months after its discovery , development of the potentially rich field is at a standstill as Skelly seeks a buyer for the gas . Skelly is n't the only natural gas producer having trouble finding customers . In the past 18 months , a long-standing shortage of natural gas has ended in the U.S. and a surplus has developed . " Hundreds of gas wells have no market and most others are precluding well below capacity , " declares Johnny Mitchell , president of the 6,050-member Texas Ind ? ? pendent Producers and Royalty Owners Assoc nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price Cuts But while the oversupply is a major headache for producers , it is good news for many of the nation 's 34 million natural gas users . After more than tripling in the last 15 years , the average price producers receive for natural gas has leveled off . Price cuts by producers are spreading and , in a few cases , they are being extended to homeowners . Northern Illinois Gas Co. , Aurora , Ill. , lowered its natural , gas rates to home heating users by $1 million . annually at the beginning of this month , for : instance . The gas surplus can be traced partly to an oversupply of crude oil that put a squeeze on oil producers ' profits a few years ago . Many reacted by switching to gas exploration . As a result , a record 4,915 gas wells were drilled last year . This year the figure will soar to about 6,000 . A record 532 new . gas Beide . have  --  been discovered this year . The new discoveries alone , would have gone , a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second factor is . further . increasing supplies . Many producers have begun . ti ) offer for sale trillions of cubic feet of gas they , heti left in the ground awaiting higher prices . Humble Oil &; Refining Co. , the chief do ; mestie subsidiary of Standard Oil Co . ( N.J. ) , has agreed to sell a Whopping 6.2 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in southern Texas to Columbia Gas System , Inc . If the deal is art ; proved by the Federal Power Commission if would not only be the largest sale ever of gas , reserves but would take Columbia out of the market for new gas for several ' years , according to Howard B , Noyes , vice president of gas procurement for the system . Columbia ; which plans a new pipeline to the reserves , id , the nation 's largest purchaser of natural gas , serving markets in the Ohio Valley . Gas Use Slowing While all this gas is being thrown on the market , the once-rapid growth in gas use is slowing . Gains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 10 years but increases in recent years have fallen below the average . This year , it 's estimated the growth will be between 5% and 6% . The figurt . Is expected to drop to around 4% next year , " Over the next decade we 're looking for growth of 4% to 5% in demand for gas , only half what it has been in the last 10 years , ' r says W. M. Elmer , president of Texas Gas Transmission Co. , Owensboro , Ky . Nearly ell areas of the continental U.S. , ( northern , New England is a major exception ) now are served by natural gas pipelines . " Some markets are near the saturation point , " Mr. Elmer says , " In others , electricity is becoming more corn : petitive and in still others coal is winning back some boiler fuel markets , " Natural gas has long been the cheapest among common fuels in most areas . But the gap has been narrowed in recent years and oil or coal recently have become more economical in some areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in on some gak heating markets by cutting rates on electricity for heating and promoting builder use of . electrio heating . The effects of competition and market saturation can be seen in Chicago . Until about two years ago , homeowners seeking natural , gas for heating their residences often faced long waits . G. P. Garver , president of Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America , which serves Chicago , says the backlog of applicants for gas in 1960 ran between 250,000 and 300,000 . " Teday , " he says , " there is no. backlog . As a result , the estimated total increase in our pipe ' line deliveries next year will be the smallest in years . " Austin to Save $8 Million ' . The growth slowdown ' has sent gas producers , pipelines and utilities scrambling for new business . Just a few weeks ago , for ex. - ample , Coastal States Gas Producing Co. : of ' Corpus Christi , Texas , sharpened its pricing pencil to win a big contract to supply two mt14 nicipal power plants operated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with Southern Union Gas to . of Dallas , Austin pays nearly 23 cents for'a quantity of gas sufficient to generate 1 million British thermal units of heat . Coastal States will drop the rate to 19.2 cents when its contract becomes effective at the beginning of 1965 . The rate will climb after 1970 but will average only . 22 cents through the 20-year life of the contract . Austin will save about $8 million over the 20 years , according to Dexter Kinney , - Austin 's director of elec. trical utilities . Some gas producers are getting into the pipelihe business , , a trend which could furWeZ increase competition . Shell Oil Co. and Pan American Petroleum Corp .. a Standard Oil Co . ( Ind. ) subsidiary , have joined with Fish En , gineering Co. of Houston to form Oklahoma Illinois Gas Pipeline Co . The new firm plans to build a 700-mile gas line from Woodward , Okla .. to St. Louis . It would compete In the same general area served by Mississippi River Fuel Corp . In western Texas , several smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their area . " There are more than 200 gas wells with reserves of over 750 billion cubic feet which are shut because there is no market , " reports Phil S. Kendrick , Jr. , an Abilene , Texas , producer . " We 've got to do something and we hope the answer is to attract gas-consuming industry here . " Utilities , equipment makers and producers are trying to develop new uses for gas . United Gas Corp. , a Shreveport , La. , utility , recently has installed gas-fueled turbine generators at motels in Biloxi , Miss. , and Beaumont , Texas . The turbine heats and air conditions the motel units and drives an electrical generator to supply all electricity needs . The whole system is cheaper , according to its backers , than the cost of separate utility services . " We used to beat customers away from our ' doors , but now we really get out and sell , " says Ed Parkes , president of United Gas . Efforts to steal markets from electricity show up elsewhere . Lone Star Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed 20 gas street lights in an Arlington , Texas , housing project and will put 19 more into a Dallas luxury homes development . Lone Star also has boosted its gas air-conditioning load 88% in the last five years . Shamrock Oil &; Gas Corp .. a producer based in Amarillo , Texas , started up an anhydrous ammonia plant In September to help consume some of Its unsold gas reserves . The firm also set up a new subsidiary , Emerald Gas Co .. to sell gas to Texas farmers as fuel for irrigation pumps . Shamrock . hopes to build a growing . gas market by promoting use of both fertilizer and irrigation in the Texas Panhandle , according to C. A. Cash . president . Pipelines often are able to drive harder bargains with producers because of the surplus . In the days of short supply , pipelines often signed contracts with producers agreeing to pay penalities if the amount of gas they took from a field fell below a certain level . Since that level was often keyed to the field 's reserves , producers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves . Some Industry officials ' feel these contracts have been partly responsible for the Mien supply . But many contracts signed in recent months require penalty payments only when the amount taken by the pipeline falls to 50% of contract amounts , compared with 75% formerly . In addition , A. M. Wiederkehr , vice president for exploration and gas supply for Southern Union Gas , says he has made five gas purchase contracts in the last six months that require producers to pay for all or part of the cost of building connecting lines from their wells to the pipeline . Many gas producers have switched back to drilling for oil . W. M. Vaughey , partner of Vaughey &; Vaughey of Jackson , Miss. , says he has made such a move because pipelines say they wo n't buy gas from his shut-in wells for about five years . Coupled with the competitive squeeze has been pressure by the Federal Power Commission on field prices of gas . In August , the FPC lowered price ceilings on gas produced in southern Texas to 16 cents per 1,000 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of their surplus problems , Texas producers last month asked state authorities to institute gas production controls such as those which regulate oil output in the state . But most observers feel such a move would face a tough fight , possibly from the FPC as well as pipelines . Some industry men think the technical problems involved in regulating gas production might be insurmountable . But the Federal Government has been expressing increasing . interest In limiting end uses to which gas can be put , with the idea of better conserving the nation 's supply . Currently , new reserves are being discovered at a faster rate than gas is being used . But the American Gas Association reports that geologists ' estimates of ultimate recoverable reserves in the U.S. are around 1.400 trillion cubic feet , perhaps as much as 1.700 trillion . At the current rate of use-13.5 trillion cubic feet In 1961 ? U.S. reserves would be depleted in 100 to 125 years .
