Two days after some 50 of the world 's nations agreed to the biggest slash of tariff barriers in the history of world trade , France 's Charles de Gaulle appeared before a crowded press conference to make the statement that , as far as he was concerned , liberalization had gone far enough . It was his intention , De Gaulle announced , to see to it that the European Common Market continued to restrict its own special trade privileges to its six original European members . <P> De Gaulle 's appearance was his first before the press since Great Britain had formally applied for entry into the Common Market , and the tensions and expectations were high . France 's five partners in the Common Market wanted Britain in , and the British were optimistic that De Gaulle would not repeat his 1963 veto . Foreign Secretary George Brown told Parliament two weeks ago : " We expect to get in . " Gaullists had even been circulating the word that De Gaulle would not impose another veto . <P> It took De Gaulle just 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Market partners . In words and tone that were more severe than when he vetoed the British the last time , De Gaulle raised every hurdle he could think of against letting the British in . " For our part , it can not be , nor was it ever , a question of a veto , " said De Gaulle . The problem was rather , he added slyly , how to surmount the obstacles to British entry that Prime Minister Harold Wilson 's own " great clearsightedness and deep experience had characterized as formidable . " De Gaulle made it clear that he will oppose British entry and . for that matter , that he takes a dim view even of negotiations . It was one resounding non-or , as the London Express put it in Franglais : " le brushoff . " <P> Haughty Dismissal . On technical grounds , De Gaulle objected to Britain 's imports of cheap foodstuff from the Commonwealth nations , to its restrictions on the export of capital , and to the role of the pound as a reserve currency . Adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , could ruin Britain economically , said De Gaulle . He further objected to tying the fluctuating pound to the now solid currencies of the Common Market members . He insisted that the Market partners would invariably be caught up in the pound 's fluctuations and haughtily dismissed as jeux d'esprit-mental exercises-Prime Minister Wilson 's assurances that Britain would never ask the partners to come to the pound 's rescue . <P> At heart , however , De Gaulle 's main objections to British entry were political . He could understand , he said , why Britain had at first refused to join the Common Market : because it " is not Continental , remains involved with the seas beyond " and " is tied to the United States by all sort of special accords . " De Gaulle feels that the British see themselves as a world power rather than as a European power-and would therefore pose a distinct threat to France 's current dominance of the Common Market . Letting the British in , he said , would force " the Continentals to renounce forever the making of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
