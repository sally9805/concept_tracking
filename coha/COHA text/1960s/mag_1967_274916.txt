A Guide for the Married Man is an illuminated lecture on How to Commit Adultery that happily has more illustrations than text . It begins with an irreverent quote from Oscar Wilde : " The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties . " It ends with a pious bromide : " Midst pleasures and palaces , there 's no place like home . " Sandwiched between the two views is a sprightly scenario that makes this the most sophisticated sex comedy of the season . <P> Its success is all the more remarkable because it is virtually plotless . A suburban husband ( Walter Matthau ) decides that the grass is greener and the lass keener in the other fellow 's backyard . A colleague with a wandering eye ( Robert Morse ) nominates himself as Matthau 's instructor in the arcane rules of high-infidelity . Like most modern teachers , Morse goes in for visual aids : every time he makes a pedantic point the screen lights up with a lively sketch from life , featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> In one of the funniest episodes , Art Carney demonstrates the simplest way to get away from a wife ( Lucille Ball ) for an evening with a mistress . He criticizes her cooking ( " Pot roast ? It tasted more like the pot than the roast ! " ) , waits for her counterattack , then , acting wounded , stomps into the night on the town . In another , Joey Bishop is discovered in flagrante delicto by his outraged mate . " What bed ? What girl ? " he replies . While his wife shrieks , he calmly cleans up the room , whisks the girl out , then settles down to read in the living room . Faced with his bland denials , the wife begins to wonder whether it was all an illusion , weakly wilts " What do you want for dinner ? " <P> Eager to learn by doing , Matthau finally entices a voluptuous victim ( Elaine Devry ) to a motel ; as she stands before him , stripped down to her black lace foundation , he decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scheming . Nervously he shows his date pictures of his family and prays for any interruption that will end the affair that never began . Moments later , deliverance comes when detectives break into a neighboring room and discover a couple in bed . The man : that satirical satyr Robert Morse . Gratefully , Matthau and the movie chicken out and head for home . <P> Director Gene Kelly has guided Guide flawlessly , making it as crisp and catchy as one of his old dance routines . But it is hard to see how any moviemaker could have gone wrong with one of Hollywood 's ultimate weapons : Walter Matthau . Underplaying the male norm pondering the female form , Matthau creates a triumph of taste in a role that could have been merely low-down and dirty-proving once again that the person who plays the common man must be an uncommon actor .
