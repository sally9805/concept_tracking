txt The Department of Defense is ready to try again to provide meaningful information on losses and deliveries of United States military aircraft . An earlier attempt brought on renewed questicining of the Pentagon 's credibility . Criticism has been apparent particularly in Congress and the press . At issue were figures released by the department last month on worldwide losses and delivery of aircraft since July 1 , 1965 , to United States forces . The Defense figures also included projections for the period from Feb. 1 to June 30 of this year . Shortly after the figures were released , Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara testified before Congress . Questions were immediately raised . No one challenged totals , but it developed after the figures were out that deliveries included planes taken out of stockpiles , as well as new aircraft . Loss  --  gain figure compared The figures showed that the United States had lost or would lose during the 1966 and 1967 fiscal years a total of 3,260 aircraft from all causes , including loss to enemy fire in Vietnam . Other losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,564 , of which 4,357 were helicopters . But the furor was over the figures in the fighter and attack category . Worldwide losses came to 1,517 in the period , as opposed to gains of 1,617 . As soon as critics found that 141 of the deliveries were A ? 4A Skyhawks and F ? 8 Corsairs taken from stockpiles , they ques tioned whether the Department of Defense was being completely straightforward . Before removal from the mothball fleet for modification and delivery , the Skyhawks and Corsairs had been considered obsolescent planes useful only for training . Rep. Glenard P. Lipscomb ( R ) of Cali ? fornia told Mr. McNamara he normally assumed deliveries meant " new craft , modern , not obsolescent . " Mr. McNamara countered with the argument that all losses and additions to the active inventory should be counted . But he said , " Perhaps ' deliveries ' is the wrong term to apply to the increases . Call them increases and decreases . " ? Reporters criticized High United States officials have taken reporters to task for their handling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses of all types of aircraft it should be permissible to count all gains . It is unfair , these officials say , to infer that the Department of Defense is trying to mislead anybody . Assuming , however , that the method of presentation was proper in intent , all is still not well with the figures . Defense officials say privately that further revision of sta ? tistics will be necessary . They say that the information given out last month was not checked thoroughly before it was released . A highly placed officer said in exaspera ? tion , " We were trying to be honest . We were not trying to hide anything . " But , Defense Department officials realize , the information released has raised many new questions in attempting to answer old ones . Thus , the decision has been made to try again . This result is expected to be more precise and detailed . It should . be made available shortly , probably within a matter of several days .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
