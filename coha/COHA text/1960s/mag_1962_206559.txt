With only 4,700,000 motor vehicles in a nation that covers one-seventh of the earth 's surface , the Soviet Union would hardly be expected to worry much about traffic jams . Yet Russia has a growing problem , for almost all the cars and trucks are concentrated in the larger cities or on the few major roads between them . Especially congested at peak hours are some of the main streets of Moscow , where dump trucks and haulers vie at a snail 's pace with taxis to get from one distant suburb to another . Last week a brand-new 68-mile superhighway was opened in the hope of speeding things up . The road , which forms a ring around the outskirts of Moscow , was begun in 1956 and completed two years before the target date with the help of more than 100,000 students , workers and other Muscovites who put in long hours of volunteer labor on weekends . Since this is the first modern divided-lane highway in all Russia , thousands of Muscovites swarmed out on the inaugural day to have a look . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who own cars excitedly opened them up to the maximum 80 m.p.h. , unmindful of the washboard ripples and wavy indentations on the brand-new roadbed . Even Premier Nikita Khrushchev had his driver take him out for a run around the circuit in his sleek Chaika limousine . Acknowledging the cheers of bystanders , Khrushchev paused to congratulate officials , urged them to put up some restaurants and motels along the way . And , suggested Khrushchev in an afterthought , next time they build a highway , a little more attention might be paid to the quality of the surface .
