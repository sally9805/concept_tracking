With the power of a one-megaton bomb , an earthquake shocked eastern Turkey last week , killing more than 100 people and injuring about 200 . The quake centered in sparsely settled Tunceli and Erzincan provinces , 80 miles west of the Varto area , scene of a violent quake that killed 2,477 people last August . It was the second earthquake to sunder Turkey within five days ; on July 22 about 100 people were killed and 300 injured in a series of shocks that struck 50 towns near Adapazari . Like previous Turkish quakes ( see map ) , the latest disasters were located along the Anatolian Fault , a particularly lethal segment of the earthquake belts that coil around the globe . Along the Anatolian Fault , some 40,000 persons have lost their lives in eleven earthquakes since 1938 . <P> Last week 's catastrophe came without warning . The outside world 's first indications were jiggles recorded on Russian seismographs after the destruction had started . Could the quake have been forecast ? <P> Some scientists believe that small foreshocks may signal an earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that changes in surface features and sea level are visible to the naked eye hours before some earthquakes . But none of this adds up to a workable warning system : earthquakes are caused by conditions so deep within the earth that they can not be studied with present tools and knowledge . <P> Long-range studies of earth disturbances are planned in the U.S. , Japan and Russia . Geophysicists will place ultrasensitive instruments deep in the earth . In such studies , tiltmeters will measure shifts in the position of vast subsurface areas , and , ideally , laser devices will be able to measure micro scopic expansion and contraction of bedrock , while strain seismographs monitor the kind of subsurface stress and crust slippage that occurs in fault zones . <P> Although such studies are highly expensive and painfully slow , scientists hope that a gradual buildup of information about the earth 's crust and interior will someday enable them to create a computerized earthquake-warning system . But that day is far off . For now , says Dr. Clarence R. Allen , former director of Caltech 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no assurance that they ever will be . "
