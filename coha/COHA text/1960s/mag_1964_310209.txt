A fortunate handful of West Berlin companies , ranging from a construction firm to a small hotel , last week received a total of $16 million in ten-year loans . By Continental standards , the companies will have to pay a surprisingly low ( 4% ) interest rate-but the real surprise was the source of the loan . The money came from the Marshall Plan , which ended a decade ago . <P> Though most of the $13.6 billion in economic assistance that the U.S. pumped into Asia and Europe disappeared long ago , remnants of the aid are still at work . Part of Japan 's $600 million leftover is being used to modernize the country 's rail systems ; most of Italy 's $71 million in old funds is being spent for public housing ; Britain uses its $2,800,000 balance for economic aid to its former colonies . These nations managed to keep Marshall Plan funds working by selling in their own countries their share of the $12 billion in equipment and commodities that the U.S. supplied in aid , then reinvesting the proceeds in worthwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well as West Germany , where the funds still play a vital role , particularly in harried Berlin . This year $120 million will be channeled into loans for Berlin businesses ; another $210 million will be used to help Germany 's ailing shipbuilders , to finance sales of German goods to underdeveloped countries and to provide $85 million in new credit for the capital-short German economy . Germany has made its Marshall Plan money work particularly hard from the very first by setting up a special Bank for Reconstruction to administer most of the funds . By judicious lending and reinvestment , the bank has already produced $4 billion in credit from its original $1.5 billion Marshall Plan grant . <P> Following the Marshall Plan 's precepts , the German government allows the money to be invested only in needed ventures . One nonutilitarian item is deducted each year from the fund . It is a Dankesspende ( gift of thanks ) to the American people , which this year amounts to $330,000 and will provide one year 's free study for 60 U.S. students in West Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
