The 2,500 elephants that roam South Africa 's huge Kruger National Park are normally friendly enough . Last week however , even park rangers kept their distance from the beasts . One elephant recently sat down on a Volkswagen and flattened it , though the two German tourists inside had time to escape . <P> Others try to scratch themselves by rubbing against autos , with unfortunate results for the bodywork . Some smash down boundary fences , uproot trees and chase African herdsmen ; occasionally , they kill someone . Whether they turn vicious or merely playful , all of them sway and totter about a great deal , as if they were drunk . In fact , they are . Once a year at this time , Kruger Park 's elephants go on one of the world 's biggest binges . <P> The cause of it all is the tall marula tree , which right after the rainy season a succulent , plumlike fruit that the elephants love . Local Africans use the marula fruit to make a highly potent beer , but one elephant can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village . Then the elephant goes to a water hole and drinks gallons of water . The result : its stomach immediately becomes a huge still in which the fruit ferments and forms alcohol . The elephant becomes hopelessly drunk , reeling around wildly and often standing up on its hind legs to reach more fruit . Each year the park 's rangers have to shoot about 30 elephants who become mean drunks , and tests of their blood show a staggering alcoholic content . Most of the elephants go away to sleep off their hangovers , but they always come back for more . Unmindful of their reputation , they seem to forget what happened last time .
