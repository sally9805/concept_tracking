txt ? President Kennedy set off a charge of TNT here today and formally started the construction of a huge earthwork dam . The , ceremony at the site of the darn , which is designed to relieve the perennial water shortage of California 's San Joaquin Valley , was the last official stop on Mr. Kennedy 's " nonpolitical " tour of the West : " It is a pleasure , " Mr. Kennedy quipped , " for me to help blow up this valley in the cause of progress . " He and Gov . Edmund G. Brown of California then pressed identical silver plungers in identical walnut-encased detonators . On the low-lying Los Banos Hills surrounding them , two tenpound charges of TNT exploded at the ends of what will be the San Luis Dam . The explosions threw dust high into the air and echoes boomed across the crowd of 15,000 persons standing on a dusty hillside . As the second of the blasts faded , smoke grenades set off by the same detonators exploded in a long stream across the 17,000-foot line where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red , green and purple smoke . Then a helicopter buzzed along the same line , more than 300 feet above the ground . It released red smoke to mark what will be the crest of a dam that will eventually back up 2,100,000 acre-feet of water . An acre-foot is 325,851 gallons . The smoke-bomb display was a dramatic finish for Mr. Kennedy 's first foray into the West since last spring . The tour , which began yesterday , is expected to prove valuable to Democratic candidates throughout the area . The chief beneficiary today was Governor Brown , who is locked in a re-election struggle with former Vice President Richard M. Nixon . Mr. Nixon , who was not invited to the ceremonies here , was reported to be sunning on a Southern California beach . Other California Republicans , including Senator Thomas H. Kuchel , Were in evidence here , however , lending a bipartiSan tone to the event . Mr. Kuchel was then introduced by Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall , who also paid tribute to former California Governor Earl Warren , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Governor Brown indirect credit for the dam project , which is part of an even bigger project designed to transmit spare water from the north of the state to its dry southern areas . " For many years , " Mr. Kennedy said , " some believed that the water problems of this state were too controversial and too complicated to solve  --  many state administrations in California wrestled with this problem and some gains were made . " " But I believe that all Californians will long remember the water leadership of your distinguished Governor and his associates in the California Legislature , " the President said . " And I salute him . " Mr. Udall went even further . He said that Governor Brown was " in a class by himself as the best water Governor in the fifty states . " It was in Governor Brown 's first administration , now in its last year , that the project was finally approved . Governor Brown was not to be ? outdone in pointing with pride . He said that California was " pleased and proud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the lifeblood of the West  --  a President who regards the West as an equal partner In the nation 's destiny . " He pointed out , that the project was " greater in scope " than the Tennessee Valley Authority . It will eventually add $12,000 , - 000,000 in new income and $35 , - 000,000,000 in investment to the wealth of the state , he said . He said that California would soon be the most populous state in the Union and " we intend to be first not only in people but in farming , industry and in sound business . climate . " " To maintain that leadership we must have water . San Luis will help provide it , " he said . Federal-State Project ' Mr. Kennedy pointed out that the San Luis Dam , for which he and Governor Brown broke ground today , was unusual in that " for the first time the Federal Government and a state government are joining hands as full and equal partners in a major water project . " Thus , he said , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative and administrative feat as well . " He said : " We have here the finest kind of Federal-state cooperation  --  and let us hope that this is the beginning of a new partnership concept of resource development . " That was an apparent thrust at the Eisenhower Administration 's " partnership concept " of joint public and private power development , a concept much criticized by Democrats . Mr. Kennedy was speaking of state and Federal partnership . The San Luis project is unusual in another way . The dam will not be built across an existing stream . Rather it will be constructed across the mouth of a dry , deserted valley in the Los Banos Hills . Water will be diverted to " he basin through manmade canals from the delta at the head of San Francisco Bay . Instead of escaping to the sea , it will be stored for agricultural and industrial use . Most storage will occur in the winter , when the runoff from the California hills is heavy . In summer , when the need is great , water will be distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canals . . , ? The project is eipected to cost - about $511,000,000 , with California bearing soniewhat more of the most than the Federal Government . The major construction will begin next year . He Stresses Interdependence Mr. Kennedy ' has been emphasizing in all his Western talks that such projects benefit not merely the areas in which they are built , but also enrich all the people of the nation . " What I preach , " he said yessterday at Pueblo , Colo. , " is the interdependence of the United States . " Today he added : " What this country needs is a broad , new conservation effort worthy of the two Roosevelts  --  an effort to build up an ample resource heritage for the next generation . " And he offered the following as a philosophy : " Things do not happen . They are made to happen . " To the program he outlined at Pueblo yesterday he added a new point . It was a steppedup program of converting sea water into fresh water , a project he said was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The other points of the conservation program he had called for were Congressional approval of national seashores on Cape Cod , Point Reyes , Calif. , and Padre Island , Tex. ; a wilderness protection bill ; a youth employment act , including a youth conservation corps ; and improved recreation facilities . Mr. Kennedy planned to spend Saturday night and Sunday in Los Angeles , making no public appearances . He will be back in Washington Monday . Kennedy in Los Angeles LOS ANGELES , Aug. 18 ( AP ) ?
