txt 140 Everyman His Own Poet Here is Ishmael 's version of Mapple 's faith . And what of Ishmael 's own ? The painting in the Spouter-Inn is what engages him . Except for the adversity of the two ships the pictures have nothing else in common . Mapple 's fervor has a counterpart in Ishmael 's stamina , in the fits and starts of his persistent speculations . But instead of preaching a sermon Ishmael crowds the facts and generates l hem into metaphors about the inscrutable universe and the impossibility of any doctrine except a plurality of doctrines . The truth , whatever it might be , is in the telling of it . This is time heresy that Melville built , and Moby Dick is its gospel , the record of its revelation . 1 Paradigm Four If I could diagram my subject I would draw a series of concentric circles and call the center of them " the drama of the author 's consciousness . " Let each circle mark the relative distance of a work of fiction from this center , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author had removed himself from the drama . This would be a descriptive figure measuring what is known in literary criticism as " aesthetic distance , " that is , the author 's apparent objectivity . The circles of shorter radius in this diagram would mark the romantic cosmologies t hat emphasize the drama of the author in his own person . Successively wider circles would mark those fictions that transfer to a persona and then to characters the attempt to build a cosmology . Labeling each circle would be a game of individual judgment . The circle of Thomas Wolfe 's fiction , for example , would be close to the center . The cosmologies would fall into some sort of progression with Moby Dick having the longest radius . This cosmology about a cosmology presents two versions of the Emersonian poet : Ahab and Ishmael ; and largely through Ishmael 's point of view the author appraises Ahab 's struggle to enforce a personal monism on the world . Successively wider circles on the diagram would mark the fictions of Henry James and some of the fictions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters in this study . James 's fictions dramatize a character 's attempt to enforce an ideal world on the intractable circumstances in 141 // which he lives . The necessity of idealism and its necessary limits constitute James 's subject . His intense characters discover themselves by discovering this circumscribing environment . Some of Faulkner 's fictions ? particularly The Sound and the Fury , Light in August , Absalom , Absalom ! and " The Bear " ? similarly dramatize the mind struggling with its environment ( which happens to be a hazardous combination of fact and hearsay evidence ) to try to find a complete system of cause and effect . Beyond these fictions of James and Faulkner there would be many more circles , stretching way off the page . This marvelous diagram would settle a great many questions of literary form , if it could ever be drawn . But of course it could not . Aesthetic distance is only apparent distance , an illusion of objectivity that the writer tries to create in order to separate his conflict from himself and bring it closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance and fix the radius of any such circle , so the diagram will not work . It is merely one conceit of a whole view of all fiction . Except for approximate relationships , such as the relativity of James 's fiction and Faulkner 's fiction to the cosmologies , the diagram will have to be abandoned . The only part we are left with is the center , which is the drama of the author 's consciousness . But this is worth the whole conceit , as long as it emphasizes the kind of energy that generates a fiction . The reason I keep returning to the idea of the author 's problem is that I think reading fiction effectively depends on the reader 's awareness of the real task the writer has set for himself : what he must do , no matter what he appears to be doing . With one strategy or another he must make the actual chaos of the material world that he has experienced reveal some ordered , comprehensive view of life . To need to know why is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually offer a satisfactory answer . The human mind must build some scheme of cause and effect to contain itself , to insulate itself from chaos . The more chaos one tries to // subsume to an ordered vision , the greater the struggle and the greater the odds against achieving any doctrinal or ideological success ? and occasionally the greater the achievement . So the writer builds a scheme to explain why . He must make it clarify itself . This is his liability . If a fiction does not show cause for whatever happens in it , that is , if it does not reveal why it is so and not otherwise , then it is not worth the reader 's effort . The true test of a fiction is its necessity . We are not expected to believe that a fictional episode either did happen or might happen . The fiction is a supposed system of events . Given his supposition , the author must persuade us that if these events were to happen they would convincingly happen the way they do in his system . His readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sense of the way things are . Given whatever we know about ourselves or others , he must persuade us that his supposed relationships between motive and action and between action and response are necessary , or he loses us . The better he conveys a sense of necessity , the more his fiction adds to our knowledge . Fiction is a strategy of gaining and conveying knowledge . It is a means of theorizing about events , a means of provisionally clarifying what can not otherwise be explained . As a process of supposing relationships that yield sonic theory of cause and effect , fiction is a discipline of the mind in the same sense that other reasoning processes are disciplines of the mind . Fiction is different from philosophical reasoning , which is a process of arriving at a conclusive statement by refining abstract concepts . Fiction is different from the empirical process of observing data for the purpose of measuring or describing whatever is observed . Fiction is different from mathematical reasoning , which is a process of describing the value of unknown entities by equating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these disciplines of the mind are valid ways of discovering relationships between one 's self and whatever is outside and beyond one 's self . But , like the other disciplines , the pro144 Everyman His Own Poet cess of fiction yields knowledge in proportion to a person 's ability to use it : to recognize why it exists , how it works , and what its limitations are . Every fiction is a process of selecting details of actuality and ordering them into some metaphorical scheme to show cause and effect . I do not know how I came by this statement , but I suspect a lot of it is based on George Santayana 's essay , " The Elements and Function of Poetry . " Santayana 's title reveals the historical habit of calling all fiction by the name of poetry , and the title of the book in which it appears , Interpretations of Poetry and Religion ( 1900 ) , accurately suggests the romantic philosophy of art that Santayana superbly states . Santayana begins with the familiar assumption that poetry is a process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less at the same time . He explains that the poet " disintegrates " whatever he perceives into its " sensuous elements , and gathers these together " into new combinations . Poetry is a process of disintegrating the particulars of one order and fusing them again into another order . Santayana also describes the nature of this fusion . This new order , he says , provides " appropriate occasions , " or " dramatic situations , " which localize feelings that can not otherwise be stated . The function of these " occasions " is not to offer a new entity for its own sake , but rather to clarify the relationships that already exist in actual experience . " Poetry is not at its best when it depicts a further possible experience ; but when it initiates us . . . into the meaning of the experience which we have actually had . " Santayana 's essay argues that the function of poetry is to turn back to actuality , to inform us of our own experience and clarify it . In the course of developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bear especially on the cosmologies and on the fictions related to them ( the stories of James and Faulkner ) . I have been talking about one of these characteristics since the beParadigm Four i45 ginning of my study , and that is the peculiar originality of the act of expression . " Expression is a misleading term which suggests that something previously known is rendered or imitated ; whereas the expression is itself an original fact . . . . " The other characteristic is somewhat more paradoxical . It has to do with the fact that complexity generates clarity . Santayana says : " The function of poetry , like that of science , can only be fulfilled by the conception of harmonies that become clearer as they grow richer . " This bold idea of a clarifying complexity helps to anticipate Henry James 's conviction that an artist must always strive to represent the whole density of his subject . In his novels and tales and in his literary criticism James developed the technique of narrative fiction as few other writers ever have . James wrote fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the largest edition of his novels and stories , thirty-six volumes , is incomplete . There is no collected edition of his criticism or his plays or his essays in autobiography or biography or travel . Prefaces to his novels , written late in his life , comprise the longest sustained work of literary criticism written iii the English language ; these were based on extensive notebooks , now published , and on dictated notes which no longer exist . I le wrote thousands of letters about his life and about his art , and the entire canon is not yet published . Piecemeal collections of his fictions , his essays , and his letters continue to appear . From all of this writing it is clear that he believed fiction to be a special kind of knowledge and a special way of knowing . James was preoccupied with the poetic process . No criticism of his work can ignore either his technique or his preoc cupation with the process of writing . James 's fiction is pre- 1 ponderantly about the nature of fiction , and the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it reflect its author 's intense involvement . The problem of finding a whole view of James 's work begins by acknowledging what his extraordinary technique served . James believed that his technique served // morality in the broadest sense , meaning an acute awareness of one 's relation to one 's limiting circumstance . He used the term " appreciation , " meaning the morality of the highly developed consciousness . James believed that he could represent moral awareness only by dramatizing the dense , intense complexity of the consciousness . His struggle was his joy and his despair . " As soon as I begin to appreciate , " lie said , " simplification is imperilled . " 1 Ile insisted that a fiction could offer the " irresistible illusion " of experience only in proportion to the attention it demands of the reader . " It is greatest , " he said , " when we feel the surface , like the thick ice of the skater 's pond , bear without cracking the strongest pressure we throw upon it . " 2 The consciousness was James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why his fiction is so complex . Curiously , James 's preoccupation with aesthetic distance deeply involved him in his own fiction . Over the course of many years he worked out ways of representing the illusion of a point of view within the story that appears to build the story by the way it reports events . James was so committed to objectifying the drama of his fictional point of view that his commitment drew him excitedly into the drama , in spite of himself . The prefaces to his novels and tales frequently allude to this sense of involvement . " The teller of the story . . . is primarily the listener to it , " he says in one place . ' It excited James to be the player and the spectator and the referee all at once in his own fictions ; but the real game , the writer 's game , was how to build the game that the reader sees . The object of the game for James , as he said , was to get the most meaning out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialectic with his own material . IIe saw it as a continuous conflict that generates new meaning : " The general sense of the expansive , the explosive principle in one 's material . . . but with its other appetites and treacheries , its characteristic space-hunger and space-cunning kept down . " 4 // The need to compress , the crisis of " Amount and Number " that made Thomas Wolfe despair , was precisely the problem that James celebrated . He spoke of the adventure of making an adventure , and he spoke of it as though it were a rollercoaster ride : " the thrilling ups and downs , the intricate ins and outs of the compositional problem , made after such a fashion admirably objective , becoming the question at issue and keeping the author 's heart in his mouth . " 6 Having said this much in general of the drama of the author 's consciousness , and about Henry James in particular , I can state an idea about reading fiction that is more specific than what I have been able to say so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximates what the writer 's experience was . Although the reader 's experience is less intense , his problem is also comparable to what the writer 's problem was . At any given time the reader does not know exactly where he is going . Neither did the writer . But the writer 's attempts to find out where lie was going are the most reliable guidelines for the reader . What the reader sees in any fiction is a sense of approximate statement , because the writer has had no other way of getting his idea across to himself . The writer has had some conflict in mind ; trying to define and evaluate it Ile has made repeated attempts to say what he could not quite comprehend at any given time until he said it . He has made overstatements and understatements and fragmentary allusions . Pondering his idea , he might even have made mirror statements . All of these are various repetitions of the idea he has had in mind . The important thing is to realize how these approximate statements occurred in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of variations on a musical theme without having first heard the theme . After a while the listener 's ear can recognize in the variations those repetitions that form the theme . Theme occurs differently in fiction and in music . In fiction it evolves through a series of . r 48 Everyman His Own Poet approximate statements . In the process of building his fiction the writer necessarily repeats himself , not literally but variously ; each repetition qualifies what has already occurred . Such qualifying repetitions are the common denominator of the writer 's experience and the reader 's . The strategy of reading fiction is to let the variations go without worrying over their explicit significance , and to listen , instead , for the repetitions a variation may contain of any other statements ( or episodes or metaphors or characters ) . You can test this way of reading with William Faulkner 's fiction , where sometimes the repetition ? the fact of it ? is the only meaning there is at the moment . Like Melville and James before him , Faulkner used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le tested the validity of a subjective ideal when it collides with the facts . His fiction is a series of statements whose sequence and repetition correlate the realization of the character that appears to be uttering them . The sequence of repeated recollections or sensations or impressions is often all we ever see of a character . The statements themselves do not constitute the meaning , but the series of statements does . In " The Bear , " for example , Ike McCaslin 's apprehension of his heritage is his heritage ; and Absalom , Absalom ! is a fiction about the making of a fiction . These stories represent uneven , spastic dialogues between a character and whatever it is he can not understand except by saying . The form is its own argument . CHAPTER SEVEN The Dense Totality of Henry James The possibilities of subjective reality fascinated Henry James . His famous statement to H. G. Wells ? " It is art that makes life " ? attests to this . Wells had been arguing that literature is properly a means and not an end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically disagreed . " It is art that makes life , makes interest , makes importance , for our consideration and application of these things , and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process . " 1 He wrote this in the knowledge of all the idealisms he had pondered , from the visitors to his remarkable home , from his travels and studies iii Europe , from his friendships with dozens of painters and writers . Ile spent most of his writing years , in fact , speculating over the possibilities of his subjective reality . Judging by his most famous characters ? Christopher Newman , Daisy Miller , Isabel Archer , and Lambert Strether ? the possibilities of subjective reality are enormous but , in the end , always limited by circumstance . Placed in a cosmopolitan European society , these characters are all the more insistently American . They all overstate a bold innocence in contrast to the social manners of their environments , and the sharp contrasts provided James with the conflicts of his early international stories . Daisy Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courtship . Christopher Newman 's deliberate display of his commercial credentials destroys any hope of his marrying his French 149 // fiancee ; and his narrow honesty precludes any revenge , or even justice , for the trespasses of her family . Isabel Archer 's grand concept of being freely herself imprisons her in a marriage which denies everything about her . With many more ironies , Lambert Strether 's brave new morality constricts him as much as the old one he has outgrown . These characters range enormously from Daisy Miller 's apparent innocence of herself to Strether 's acute self-consciousness , but they all dramatize the same parable . By their own standards each of them is splendidly right , yet each of them illustrates that the world does not equal one 's own image of it . James quarreled with Emerson 's idealism precisely because of its moral innocence . During a diatribe over the lack of cultural development in the United States , his biography , Hawthorne ( 1879 ) , mentions Emerson in this connection . Such a provincial and limited society , James thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would help one to take a picturesque view of one 's internal responsibilities , and to find in the landscape of the soul all sorts of fine sunrise and moonlight effects . " 2 James politely belittled Emerson 's intoxicating rhapsodies on the intuition , and in a later essay on Emerson , which appeared in Partial Portraits ( 1888 ) , James observed " a certain inadequacy and thinness in his enumerations . " Emerson had " a special capacity for moral experience ? always that and only that . " Yet this in itself is limiting . " We have the impression , somehow , that life had never bribed him to look at anything but the soul . . . . " James 's essay delicately gives and takes away : thus , Emerson " knows the nature of man and the long tradition of its dangers , " but " He has only a kind of hearsay , uninformed acquaintance with the disorders . " s Emerson had a strangely limited conception of right , " because he had no great sense of wrong ... no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One of James 's early tales , " The Madonna of the Future " ( 1873 ) , pointedly demonstrates the limitations of idealism . It dramatizes the fate of an idealist named Theobald , an American expatriate living in Florence . Theobald has spent // twenty years preparing to paint the consummate Madonna in the manner of the Italian school . During all this time the image of his beautiful model , Serafina , has become his reality , until he abruptly discovers that his image no longer conforms to the facts . She has grown old and gross , and he has only an empty canvas to show for the great work of art to which he has been so faithful . The fable both ridicules and pities this self-styled idealist . In the moonlight he appears a heroic , fantastic genius , but by daylight he is haggard , threadbare , and looking altogether like a painter who has never sold a painting . Having reported all the evidence against Theobald , the story concludes with a final contradiction of his ideal . During all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been kept by a prosperous man who manufactures obscene statuary ? cats and monkeys ? " of an indestructible plastic material . " The story is a judgment against excessive idealism . But James had no quarrel with the validity of subjective impressions ? far from it . Another of his fables , " ' Elie Real Thing " ( 1893 ) , tells of a painter who attempts to draw some aristocratic persons by using genuine aristocrats as his models . Posed in front of him , his models leave nothing to imagine ; and his illustrations are flat and dull because they arc literal . " The Real Thing " insists that mere actuality is not sufficient . Its inadequacy , in fact , is what properly excites the painter to construct a more perfect reality . The fable anticipates James 's later statement to H. G. Wells : " It is art that makes life , makes interest , makes importance . . . and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process . " James understood subjective reality . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really the subject of all of his fiction . Each story fixes a subjective order in conflict with circumstance and tests its validity . Such was James 's preoccupation . James passionately believed that a fiction is an order of re152 Everyman His Own Poet ality . One of his early critical essays , a review of Anthony Trollope 's novels , states the imperative premise that the fictive world is a real one , an assumption from which the reader must never be allowed to escape . James was amazed and dismayed at Trollope 's " suicidal satisfaction in reminding the reader that the story he was telling was only , after all , a makebelieve. " 4 This would never do . " It is impossible to imagine what a novelist takes himself to be unless he regards himself as an historian and his narrative as a history . " Only as a historian does the novelist have any place or standing . " As a narrator of fictitious events he is nowhere ; to insert in his attempt a backbone of logic , he must relate events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this reality James defined a few years later in his formative essay , " The Art of Fiction . " Reality lies not in actuality , lie asserted , but in the impression of actuality ; it lies not in the fact but in the experience of it . On this principle he defined the novel . " A novel is in its broadest definition a personal , a direct impression of life : that , to begin with , constitutes its value , which is greater or less according to the intensity of the impression . " 6 Impressions , he said , are experience ; and the sense of reality , which every novelist must have , is the sensitivity to experience . James defined the sense of reality as " the power to guess the unseen from the seen , to trace the implication of things , to judge the whole piece by the pattern , the condition of feeling life in general so completely that you are well on your way to knowing any particular corner of it . . . . " In defining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being precise about that quality of the artist that had so excited Emerson . But he was more interested in establishing the precise nature of the fictive reality as nothing less than the consciousness itself . His novels progressively illustrated this fact ; and his prefaces , written late in his career , confirm it . James 's perspective of his subject has an analogy close at // hand . In his biography of Hawthorne he discussed Hawthorne 's inheritance of the Puritan conscience . This fanciful novelist had surely received the legacy of his ancestors . " To him , as to them , " said James , " the consciousness of sin was the most importunate fact of life .... " 6 But James strongly qualified it , quoting from another biographer ? Emile Montegut ? to make his point . Montegut had catalogued the particulars of Hawthorne 's Puritan inheritance : the taciturn , scornful , mournful cast of mind ; the habit of gazing upon a damned world and seeing hell everywhere ; the lonely conversations between the imagination and the conscience ; the pitiless analysis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of the Puritan character have passed into Mr. Hawthorne , or , to speak more justly , have filtered into him , through a long succession of generations . " Yes and no , said James . " It is all true indeed , but with a difference ; Hawthorne was all that M. Montegut says , minus the conviction . " As James saw it , all these elements have " lodged in the mind of a man of Fancy , whose fancy had straightway begun to take liberties and play tricks with them ? to judge them ( I leaven forgive him ! ) from the poetic and aesthetic point of view , the point of view of entertainment and irony . " Here was the distinction on which James insisted . Hawthorne had inherited the Puritan world view minus the conviction . " This absence of conviction makes the difference ; but the difference is great . " The difference was the objectivity Hawthorne gained thereby , the perspective of his material . Ultimately it becomes the difference between believing a doctrine and representing it . James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated the Puritan metaphysics . The donnee of each was a particular metaphysical view , subject to the transaction of fiction . The transaction was an appraisal which each author worked out by involving his metaphysical view in conflict . This is substantially what James did with what he inher154 Everyman His Own Poet ited . The rest of this chapter is about how he did it , and what he achieved thereby . To explain how James dramatized subjective reality first requires a few generalities . Using these , it will be possible to construct a theoretical model from all his fictions , a kind of typical or normal narrative . Later , the model can illustrate specific fictions . To begin , the conflict in James 's fiction characteristically occurs in the original consciousness , in the mind of an individual who has complete freedom of choice , and whose motive , whatever it may be , has helped to create the circumstances which confound him . So far this does not distinguish James 's protagonist , or this protagonist 's world , from a great many others ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , impervious to all doctrines or ideologies that might lie outside of it . Nothing whatever determines the character except his own action and its consequences . " What is character but the determination of incident ? " James asked in " The Art of Fiction . " " What is incident but the illustration of character ? " 7 The singularity of James 's fiction lies in the relation of character to incident . The typical or normal narrative can usefully explain this relationship . Such a narrative would begin with a character 's intention ; only that , and usually not a very clear one . At the outset all we know about him is his intention . Incident begins in response to this intention , usually an adverse response , in the other persons around him ; and incident continues with his awareness of these reactions to his intention . This awareness precipitates his struggle , which is an attempt to discover simultaneously the nature of his opposition and a more precise understanding of himself . He proceeds by doubt and conjecture ; as James said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At any given point in the character 's struggle , his bewilderment goads him on , subtly increasing and enforcing his intention to the point of preoccupation and sometimes to obsession . The more he discovers , the more complex the refinements of his predicament become . // The reciprocity of character and incident in James 's fiction is startlingly like Emerson 's idea of the relation between the person and the event . In " Fate " Emerson said , " . . . the secret of the world is the tie between the person and the event . " Emerson had a determinism in mind ( " person makes event , and event person " ) which necessarily develops the person and makes him more complete ; he intended an ethical progression from one state of awareness to another . This same progression of a character in James 's fiction also has a literal significance . The interaction of character and incident is literally the means of developing and determining a character . Simply by the process of becoming aware the character grows : not merely grows up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and form , and evolves into being . He appears to create himself by the process of fixing and certifying the circumstances around him . The more of his struggle he confirms , the more circumscribed and the more defined he becomes . This process of prescribing both his own nature and his circumstances gradually burdens him with a realization to acknowledge , and sometimes with a choice to make . It is characteristically a moral choice or recognition ; it involves rights and obligations : his own and those of adversaries . l le has unquestionable freedom to choose , and either way there is a maximum of consequence . It is a moral recognition , and very often shocking . James used melodrama to emphasize the shock of recognition . The melodramatic quality is excessiveness : thus , an action is not logically prepared for , or a character 's response to a situation exceeds what is expected . James exploited this disproportion between cause and consequence , contradicting the reader 's sense of probability : the sudden turn of events against a character , or a serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character ; he finally gets the point ; he sees the occult logic of events . In the earlier stories the hero is not always likely to see his own complicity in the sudden turn of events , but as James 's fiction continued over the years , the 156 Everyman His Own Poet denouement of a story progressively involved the character 's recognition of its significance . The end of a story ( more abruptly in a tale than in a novel , but essentially the same ) reveals that the perceiving character had somehow been an accessory before the fact . His recognition of his complicity is the more shocking , because he has considered himself innocent . His initiation has been the discovery of his reciprocity with his circumstances , and therefore his responsibility for what has happened . The significance of the choice or recognition lies in the ordeal that has caused it , iii the confusion and distress and sometimes the passion of slowly defining what the dilemma really is . It has been a mental ordeal , and the character 's chief feeling has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has clearly perceived his relation to his circumstances , and the significance of his situation , his dilemma is resolved , and James 's drama of the consciousness concludes . There is no more story , nothing more to write , except James 's characteristic signature , which is a final , ironic realization ( sometimes in the character and always in the reader ) of how clearly this character has determined what he gets . It has all been a version of Pandora 's box . Such is the typical narrative of James . There are variations , of course , but even this much reveals the extraordinary quality of his fiction . As he continued to write over the years his stories became apparently all consciousness and nothing else . James took a long step in this direction with The Portrait of a Lady ( 1881 ) , and the fiction after 1895 consistently emphasizes the consciousness . Everything that happens in these later stories seems to develop in the mind of the same character who is emotionally committed to evaluating the action . Virtually all the detail appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress . The entire construction extends the character struggling within it , and the only facts are impressions , recollections , or surmises . The whole burden of subjective realization is what this fictional world is all about . // James 's fiction over the years increasingly insisted on the fact that one 's impressions of occurrences are themselves the events . His prefaces are a long and loving exegesis of this refinement . Written for the New York edition of The Novels and Tales of Henry James ( 1907-1917 ) , these eighteen prefaces are stories of how he wrote his stories . They are contemporary with his later , intricate fictions in which the conflict and the mind that contain it are reciprocal and interdependent . This mind , for James , had become the center of composition ; he called it that . Reminiscing in these later years , he re-examined his earlier fictions , and he defined his aesthetic , which concerns the morality of awareness . James had several synonyms for this mind , this center of composition ; he called it " the intense perceiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The essence of this consciousness was its freedom to observe , to speculate , and to explore its own possibilities , unlike the other characters in the fiction . In his preface to The Spoils of Poynton ( 1897 ) James distinguished between this " free spirit " and the fools around him ; " . . . the fixed constituents of almost any reproducible act ion arc the fools who minister , at a particular crisis , to the intensity of the free spirit engaged with them . " The fools have all the best of it ; they are fixed in their situation and satisfied that they know what they want or do not want . But the free spirit is uncertain ; it is his nature to quest for what he wants without knowing what it is . He is " free " only by the fact that he continues to explore his own possibilities ; " and the free spirit , always much tormented , and by no means always triumphant , is heroic , ironic , pathetic , or whatever , and . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 8 The famous statement in The Ambassadors ( 1903 ) , which James said was the germ of his novel , is a preachment of this ideal of being free to explore one 's possibilities . It is Lambert Strether 's new realization that he passes on to his young friend : " Live all you can ; it 's a mistake not to . It does n't so 1 58 Everyman His Own Poet much matter what you do in particular so long as you have your life . If you have n't had that , what have you had ? " The notion of right and trespasses is closely related to this singular ideal of freedom . Any act that hinders a person from realizing the full possibilities of his own character is a trespass . To inflict the abuse of limitation on one 's self is even worse . This is what happens , for example , in " ' The Beast in the Jungle " ( 1903 ) , in which a man so strongly fears that an unknown something or someone will poach on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Another late story , " The Jolly Corner " ( 1909 ) , dramatizes a man 's intense preoccupation with what he might have been . He conjures an image of himself , a retrospective vision that is plausible but contrary to fact , a kind of subjunctive alter ego , so monstrous as to shock himself senseless . In these two talcs and in The Ambassadors , James 's notion of the " intense perceiver " fused with his concept of conflict . But this organic joining of perception and conflict was a later development . In his earlier fiction James employed the perceiving mind not as a subject but as a device to record a conflict occurring elsewhere . The events in " Daisy Miller " ( 1879 ) , for example , are reported largely by Winterbourne , a young American bachelor who has been accustomed to the mores of European courtship . His eyes select the details , and his awareness of the rules Daisy breaks intensifies the conflict between Daisy , a free spirit , if you will , and the women who conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome . Winterbourne is bewildered by Daisy , and he indulges in grave , academic speculation in his attempt to categorize her . Like a lens , he focuses and magnifies the conflict . Another early tale , " Madame De Mauves " ( 1875 ) , employs the same device of a narrator who feels a conflict beyond his knowledge of it . It dramatizes the disagreement of a Frenchman and his American wife over the license which he takes in sexual indulgence , and which she understands to be // nothing but adultery . This conflict between two unalterable attitudes is ordered and evaluated primarily by Longmore , an American young man who innocently admires Madame de Mauves . The selection of details from the point of view of this wholesome youth who is partial to the suffering wife provides James with a means of rendering shock , when it turns out that this righteous woman has driven her husband to suicide . In his preface to Roderick Hudson ( 1875 ) James discussed the strategy of refracting a conflict through another consciousness . This novel is named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero 's friend and patron is what enables the story . " The centre of interest throughout ' Roderick ' is in Rowland Mallet 's consciousness , and the drama is the very drama of that consciousness . . . . " What " happened " to Rowland , said James , " was above all to feel certain things happening to others . . . . " 9 Elsewhere James referred to such centers of consciousness as his " registers or single reflectors ' " ; and the preface to ' 17w Princess Casamassima ( 1886 ) catalogues them all , from Roderick Hudson ( 1875 ) to The Golden Bowl ( 19o4 ) . The preface to The Princess Casamassima is James 's great argument for complexity in fiction . And complexity has everything to do with what he meant by awareness . The relationship is this : Characters both do and feel , James observed , but their actions impart interest only in terms of their feelings ; to represent the wholeness of the character , therefore ? one 's actions through one 's feelings ? is necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to reveal ; but only the sensitive person ( who is committed , who has something to lose , and who cares about it ) can convey the whole ambience of the action . " I confess I never see the leading interest of any human hazard but in a consciousness . . . subject to the fine intensification and wide enlargement . " 10 A fine awareness and a necessary complexity . These two 6o Everyman His Own Poet ideas were interdependent to James , whether he was talking about his own fiction or the fiction of other writers . He chastised Zola for the naturalistic theory that prevented him from making a full and representative collection of human qualities , and which was therefore scarcely natural . He disagreed with the simplistic fictional theory of Guy De Maupassant . He scorned De Maupassant 's disdain for the analysis of character and his preference for illustration . James thought there could be no sharp distinctions . " It is as difficult to describe an action without glancing at its motives , its moral history , as it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Our history and our fiction , he said , are what we do . Determining where " what we do " begins or leaves off is notoriously hopeless , but this does not relieve the artist from being faithfully comprehensive . James celebrated Balzac 's fiction , because it came so close to representing " completeness " and with such intensity . Despite his faults of pedantry and bad taste , James said , Balzac 's breadth and depth , his penetration into his subject , his " saturation with his idea , " his negotiating as completely as possible " the complicated human creature or human condition " really accomplished the function of art . But there must be proportion . The dense consciousness must match the intricacy of the complications it experiences . James commented of Middlemarch ( 1871 ? 1872 ) that George Eliot 's heroine was too complex to be wasted on the narrow moral question of whether she should marry and thereby forfeit her legacy . ' With its abundant and massive ingredients , James argued , Middlemarch should have represented a weightier drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's characters , Emma Bovary and Frederic Moreau , each of whom he thought inadequate to the complexity of their subject , which he considered to be nothing less than the nature of the romantic imagination . James practiced what he preached . He strove for complexity in his own work , but also for a means of controlling it . His // subject was the consciousness ( " subject to the fine intensification and wide enlargement " ) ; but the conscious ? which he called the " reflector " ? must be its own lens and provide its own focus on itself . It took James years to develop a technique of generating and controlling the intensity that he wanted . his first major breakthrough was in The Portrait of a Lady , when he discovered the precise relation between his subject and his means of representing it . In The Portrait of a Lady both the conflict and the consciousness of the conflict inhere in the same character . The preface tells how " a certain young woman confronting her destiny " is both the germ and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? His first problem , " organizing an ado ' about Isabel Archer , " he would solve by seeing that she insisted on " mattering " in the world . But how to do this ? " Place the centre of the subject in the young woman 's own consciousness , " I said to myself , " and you get as interesting and as beautiful difficulty as you could wish . Stick to that ? for the centre ; put the heaviest weight into that scale , which will be so largely the scale of her relation to herself . " 12 In the development of a compositional center ( that is , a single consciousness attempting to organize the teens of the very conflict in which it is involved ) , The Portrait of a Lady anticipated most of James 's fiction thereafter . The step-by-step reasoning by which James evolved an Isabel Archer anticipated his development of the heroine of What Maisie Knew ( 1897 ) . The preface to his novel is an epitome ; it is the most complete , compact , and self-sufficient illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel . It tells about how he began by recognizing a germ of fiction in an actual situation ; how he singled out the central character ; and then , by way of solving certain mechanical problems , how he discovered the real subject to be // this character 's consciousness of the conflict , from which consciousness the whole of the character would evolve . The actual situation concerned a little girl , the child of divorced parents , one of whom had remarried . James 's transformation into fiction began by marrying off the other partner as well , and establishing , with this symmetry , an even conflict for possession of the child 's affections . The little girl , Maisie , would be not only the center of contention but also the " register " or " reflector " of all the action . She would be the compositional center of the novel . The sordid refinements of an adult world would ultimately present her with an absolute choice to make . As the novel proceeds both new marriages founder , largely because of the adulteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage each other in a love affair , and thereby make a new claim on the child . Each step-parent genuinely likes her ; they are living together , and have asked her to live with them . Throughout the novel Maisie has had a governess , a self-appointed protectress ; but there is clearly no place for her in the proposed new living arrangement . So the parties for the contention of Maisie change once more . She must choose between her step-parents and the governess . To make a child the compositional center of this jaundiced , sophisticated world was indeed a tour de force . How to render the whole situation intelligibly through her consciousness and yet keep her believable ? James pondered this in his preface , deciding that he would exploit the possibility that children comprehend more than they can articulate . Maisie 's awareness would be innocent and unselective , and the adult reader would necessarily see significances in whatever Maisie might contemplate . Above all , Maisie would be credible . The child would exist at that fleeting moment in life of really knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for that much knowing , she would accept knowledge without wanting to question it . What did Maisie know ? On the face of it she knew that // she could trust no one to put her ahead of himself . This was what she learned . It was everything . It was her salvation . But James arrived at this thematic conclusion only by the way he worked out the technique . Technique begat theme . As James saw it , the conflict and the means of rendering it would enable and reinforce each other . In the story the child would be the center of contention ; in the rendering she would be the center of composition . He would therefore have to " save " Maisie from moral squalor , and keep her uncontaminated for the sake of her role as recorder or register : " The small expanding consciousness would have to be saved , have to become presentable as a register of impressions . " 13 But the process of her registering the impressions of her purgatory ? for which she was salvaged ? makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The process of her small consciousness expanding is what saves her . There is the illusion finally that Maisie is aware of everything that could possibly have been revealed . This sense of total awareness was what James was after . His use of the point of view , or the relation between the narrator and the story , was his means . The first problem was how to remove from the fiction the illusion of the author 's presence and to focus instead on a consciousness within 1 he story . One of the earliest and still one of the best critical studies of his work , Percy Lubbock 's The Craft of Fiction ( 1921 ) , explains how James manipulated the point of view to make the consciousness within the story seem to function nakedly , without being described . Lubbock pointed out that James alternately displayed two views of a given consciousness , open and closed . Alone and by itself the open consciousness meditates freely for the reader , expressing an interior monologue about whatever concerns it . Then abruptly , in a scene with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from view ; thought is described , not rendered ; and the consciousness , through dialogue , is thrust into the plane of the other actors on stage . 164 Everyman His Own Poet This is Lubbock 's clarifying analysis of what James in his prefaces called the " picture " and the " scene . " By the rhythm of change , from the open , visible thought and feeling ( of the " picture " ) to the sealed-off mind ( in the " scene " ) , the reader helps carry the energy of the consciousness on to its next confrontation . By means of the repeated and interrupted glimpses of the mind in the act of perceiving , at some point in the fiction , the whole character seems to emerge at once . Even though details may still elude him , the reader suddenly has a sense of cause and continuity , a sense of the total situation . The whole point of a fiction , to James , was the shared sense of the wholeness it could impart . The experience of reading any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this out . As 1 , nhlxock explains , at some undetermined stage in the narrative , without knowing how or where it happened , the reader suddenly realizes that he is aware of the entire situation , with all its nuances and refinements , including the intense perceiver 's awareness of it . To use James 's word , the reader suddenly has an " appreciation " of it all . It has not really been a reasoning process , rather more of an intuition . But the reader scarcely guesses , until he has experienced an approximate revelation about the self-sufficient wholeness of the fiction . The author 's experience , in fact , has become a desperate struggle to control his material , even as it has grown under his pen . The most complete testimonies of the author 's tortuous struggle are his Notebook entries about The Spoils of Poynton ( 1897 ) and What Maisie Knew ( 1897 ) , These were the first two novels he completed after his disastrous apprenticeship at playwriting . He worked on them both at the same time , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new discipline he had acquired so dearly . After adapting a novel to the stage , he had written five plays between 1890 and 1895 . The only one produced was a disaster , but the experience of structuring plays had immediate effect on his narThe // rative fiction . He thought of scenes and sequence in terms of the stringent economies that a playwright must observe , and he discovered new possibilities of compression . He continually speculated over how and where his principals should confront one another , working out their motives in terms of these encounters . He could define the particular quality of a scene yet unwritten : " It must be unmitigatedly objective narration ? unarrested drama . It must be in a word a close little march of cause and effect . " 14 Later in this same Notebook entry James issued instructions to himself : " I must n't interrupt it too much with elucidations or it will be interminable . IT MUST BE AS STRAIGHT AS A PLAY ? that is the only way to do . " Speaking of his wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spoils , James thought that he had possibly discovered the key to his narrative fiction : " What I have gathered from it will perhaps have been exactly some such mastery of fundamental statement ? or the art and secret of it , of expression , of the sacred mystery of structure . " ' G Before long he had come to depend utterly on the notion of " fundamental statement " : I realise ? none too soon ? that the scenic method is my absolute , my imperative , my only salvation . The march of an action is the thing for me to , more and more , attach myself to : it is the only thing that really , for me , at least , will produce L'OEUVRE , and L'OEUVRE is , before God , what I 'm going in for.16 This " scenic method " was a periodic disciplining of events into a sequence whose logic he could perceive . This sequence was what he called his fundamental statement . It would furnish the motive for a new scene which he could then construct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logic of soliloquy ( or " picture " ) and " scene , " the sequence of opening and closing the mind of his " intense perceiver . " The discipline helped James to isolate and circumscribe the compo166 Everyman His Own Poet sitional center of a fiction , and to refine the consciousness , and to represent it more completely . He committed himself passionately to this process of analyzing and compressing . His Notebooks could scarcely contain him . He strove for the mastery of the art and for the secret of what he called the sacred mystery of structure . The scenario , this intensely structural concept , became a mystique ( " Ali , this divine conception of one 's little masses and periods in the scenic light ? as rounded ACTS " ) , and he was rapturous about it : this patient , pious , nobly " vindicating " application of the scenic philosophy and method ? I feel as if it still ( above all , yet ) had a great deal to give me , which might carry me as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed and dying day ? that isl 17 No wonder his excitement , if " the scenic philosophy and method " could render the entirety of a situation , if it could achieve mass with intensity and manage to sustain it . Certainly the last three novels which he completed did achieve this . The Wings of the Dove ( 1902 ) , The Ambassadors ( 1903 ) , and The Golden Bowl ( 1904 ) all render the illusion of a dense , intense completeness of the mind . In each of these novels the individual consciousness , under great emotional pressure , is engaged in the process of becoming totally aware of itself and its circumstances . It is a tortuous process . We want it clear , James wrote , but we also want it thick ; he insisted that thickness inheres in the consciousness that records and amplifies and interprets events . Thickness in order to serve clarity ; this was the aim of James 's technique , particularly in these three novels . He continued to experiment with the consciousness as a center of composition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its predecessors , although this fact is obscured by the order of their publication . The Ambassadors ( 1903 ) was published a year after The Wings of the Dove ( 1902 ) , but it was completed earlier . This fact clarifies // James 's continuous experimenting , for The Ambassadors is told through one consciousness , and the two later novels are told through several . James considered The Ambassadors his finest novel . The mind in it seems exactly to circumscribe the subject of it . The book dramatizes Lambert Strether 's mission in Paris , where he has been sent by a wealthy widow to rescue her son from a love affair and fetch him back to New England . Psychologically and dramatically the dominating and sustained event in The Ambassadors is Strether 's change of mind about his mission , and this is also thematically the novel 's sublect . Matter and manner are virtually the same thing . The subject of the book is Strether 's growing appreciation of a life of selffulfillment . His imagination responds to the young man whom he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress , and to all his friends , and to the life of Paris - but the book is the action of his mind . Every stage of Strether 's change of mind is limited 1n its representation to what Strether is capable of comprehending at that moment . The sum of his responses to the situation is his conception of an ideal of the capacity for full life , which invalidates the commonplace existence he has known , and makes it impossible to complete his mission . The Young man does not have the capacity to realize this ideal , and lie returns to his home ; but this does not alter the reality of the ideal for Strether . In the end the conception itself and the events by which he has arrived at it and tested it have become organic in his appreciation of the irony of his whole situation . Thickness , to James , was a dimension of clarity . His Jelincation of a consciousness in The Ambassadors has the thickness of a transparent overlay . But he was not yet satisfied . Having achieved this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wings of the Dove he constructed three compositional centers , attempting a kind of community of consciousness . Like The Ambassadors it is a parable about // the ethics of sexual acts and commitments . It represents the mutual involvement of an engaged couple and another woman , as a result of the fiancee 's scheme to lend her lover to the other woman . Kate is the fiancee of Merton Densher , and Milly is the other woman . Milly is the quintessence of virtues in the Jamesian world ; she has beauty , charm , wealth , and above all an excitement for living , the more urgent because she has an unknown but terminal illness . Kate must be secretly engaged , because Merton Dcnshcr has no money and Kate 's aunt has ambitious plans for hcr . In these circumstances , since Milly is already fond of Densher and has not long to live , Kate deliberately reasons that a short marriage , after which Milly would leave her estate to her husband , would then enable Densher to marry Kate in style . Everyone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of it , but only if Milly could be kept happily ignorant of the ulterior motive . For their own reasons , Kate 's aunt and Milly 's chaperone enthusiastically join the conspiracy to marry Milly off to Densher . The crisis occurs when Milly learns of the fraud and , dying , leaves her estate to Densher anyway . Once again , as so often with James 's fiction , a technical problem determined the way the novel turned out . Although Milly 's plight was what first engaged James , the growth of Densher 's perception is the sustaining event in the novel . The intrigue itself and Milly 's beatific response to it cause Densher to develop a conscience . All along Densher is reluctant , loving Kate and pitying Milly and wanting not to dishonor either relationship . His doubts and reappraisals of his agony focus all the conflicts . Although the early notes for the novel , in James 's Notebooks , are mostly about Milly , they contain the germ of an idea about Densher : he is evenhanded ; he is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for him , or , as James observed , " some great loss or disaster . " Densher began to engage James . As the novel took shape , this character 's small dilemma became emphatic ; // and still later , after finishing the novel , James felt that he had not sufficiently availed himself of the privilege of seeing it all through Densher 's eyes . James 's preface indicates that his developing interest in Densher was really the result of a technical decision over how to represent Milly . James originally saw his subject to be the disintegration of Milly , the ordeal of her consciousness . The conflict would be precisely the young woman facing her catastrophe , her prospect of dying without yet having lived . As James saw it , her whole predicament would have to be prepared for her , ominously defined before she would appear . To accommodate this he would delay her entry , establish successive centers of consciousness ? Kate , Densher , and then Milly ? through the first half of the novel ; and then he would use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases to accentuate the complication . Technically his purpose was to anticipate the " scene " with " pictures " of more than one mind . He wanted to achieve a dense totality of consciousness : " Under certain degrees of pressure , a represented community of vision between several parties to the action where it makes for concentration . . . . " 18 What he achieved in the last half of his novel was the illusion of a continuity of thought from one mind to another , the impression of a collective , expanding consciousness in which individual realizations merge with what is already known . In the intrigue the characters pool their information , each sharing a little to get a little , so that awareness , like some great reservoir , absorbs all soluble responses . I t is an eerie medium . James was not entirely satisfied with the result . Reviewing his accomplishment , in his preface , he still believed in the use of multiple compositional centers , in the complexity of his " elastic but definite system , " but he felt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , with the result that parts of the novel were more extravagant than lucid . So he continued to experiment . The Wings of the Dove had posed // a new problem in ways and means . He reaffirmed the principle of its structure in The Golden Bowl ( 1904 ) , which also employs more than one center of consciousness ; but it employs two instead of three and allows more space for their expansion . The central situation in The Golden Bowl is less complicated than in the previous novel , but it is just as liable to accretion and refinement . A father and a daughter , each newly married , continue their long and loving parent-child relationship while their spouses share a liaison of their own . In his early notes for the novel James talked about a circular movement of the relationships , a " rotary motion " of recriminations and consolations , from one person to another . But he abandoned this concept . Recriminations and consolations are left unsaid . What is pointedly and repeatedly not said is what intensifies Maggie Verver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she gropes her way to a knowledge of the intimacy between his wife and her husband , as she comes to understand herself . The structure James finally employed was a refinement of what he had built in The Wings of the Dove . Two intense perceivers , each the object of the other 's awareness , render the conflict and its resolution . Less intricate than The Wings , this scheme is nevertheless more reflexive . Maggie and her husband each dramatize the story by perceiving the other 's situation . As James explained it in his preface , " the thing abides rigidly by its law of showing Maggie Verver at first through her suitor 's and her husband 's exhibitory vision of her , and of then showing the prince , with at least an equal intensity , through his wife's. . . . " la James explained his use of point of view with a metaphor of opening a door , pointing out that the way it is opened is itself meaningful : It is the Prince who opens the door to half our light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to half our light upon // himself ; the rest of our impression , in either case , coming straight from the very motion with which that act is performed . This is the dialectic of the novel ; rather , the dialectic is the novel . " We see very few persons in The Golden Bowl , ' but the scheme of the book , to make up for that , is that we shall really see about as much of them as a coherent literary form permits . " The illusion of complete experience was what he was after : " To play the small handful of values really for all they are worth . " In the aesthetics of Henry James two ideas are bound together : the idea of the rich , fine consciousness of his characters and the idea of the dense complexity necessary to represent this consciousness . In the association of these two ideas his art is of a piece , whole and comprehensive . The evolution of a fine consciousness , dramatically and through conflict , is the fiction 's evaluation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actuality only by explaining itself . By complexity in the whole artifact , by development , by reinforcing and amplifying through indirection , by subtle repetition , the fiction is intended to explain itself . These two ideas together , the presence of a fine awareness in t he flct iota and the necessary complexity in its evolution , make James 's art a moral system . The moral value of any fiction lies in its clarification of the recognizable , actual world . James held that the proper subject for fiction is not actuality but the experiencing of actuality ; and experiencing , in his fiction , means recognition of one 's own complicity and participation in the turn of events , and therefore his responsibility . This recognition serves no particular moral code . James was emphatic about this . One might as well ask a painter for a moral picture or a sculptor for a moral statue , he said in " The Art of Fiction . " James had no patience with doctrinaire fiction . His preface to The Portrait dismisses any " reduction to the inane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral . " Rather , he argued , the moral sense of a work of art perfectly depends on the amount of " felt life " in producing it . Complexity is crucial to this intense illusion . Here we get exactly the high price of the novel as a literary form ? its power not only to . . . range through all the differences of the individual relation to its general subject matter , all the varieties of outlook on life , of disposition to reflect and project , created by conditions that are never the same from man to man . . . lint positively to appear more true to its character in proportion as it strains , or tends to burst , with a latent extravagance , its mould.2 ? James was preoccupied with the moral matter of rights and obligations . But he assumed that any given moral system is parochial , limited , intractable , and useless , even dangerous , beyond a certain community of interests . Time and again he dramatized a given consciousness arriving at this particular awareness , of realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable and ultimate . His fiction therefore involves the conflict of moral codes . " We may strike lights by opposing order to order , one sort to another sort ; for in that case we get the correspondences and equivalents that make differences mean something ; we get the interest and the tension of disparity where a certain parity may have been in question . " 21 Opposing order to order , as he worked it out , inevitably meant juxtaposing different convictions of what constitutes a trespass . James used moral systems to dramatize the experiencing of the individual . The Ambassadors precisely illustrates this use . James 's preface recalls the germ of his novel to have been in the idea of one man exhorting another to exploit his full capacity for experience ( " Live all you can ; it 's a mistake not to . It does n't so much matter what you do in particular so long as you have your life . " ) ; but James was interested in the development of this germ . What reason might there be for such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the false position of the man making this statement according to some // basic belief that had become inadequate . What would this false position be ? The answer is clear : The false position , for our belated man of the world .. . was obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that boundless menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most approved pattern which was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid facts ... ? 2 Going back to Strether 's passionate advice to " live all you can , " James made his point . The moral system to which the hero subscribed has just proven to be inadequate . And Strether 's felt sense of inadequacy becomes the core of the novel . The agents in any drama are interesting , James said , only in proportion to their feeling for their situation . Acute awareness is also an intense emotional state . The person with the capacity to get the most out of what happens to him also conveys the most . So James opted for " the acute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to be finely aware and richly responsible . " 23 Consciousness in this sense and to this degree is conscience , the highest order of conscience . It is a simultaneous awareness of one 's own motives , of some norm by which to evaluate them , and more : the sense that they ought to be evaluated . " Conscience " universally connotes a sense of " oughtness . " No matter what authority it invokes , its true nature is substantially what James describes as the power to be finely aware and richly responsible . " Their being finely aware ? as Hamlet and Lear , say , are finely aware ? makes absolutely the intensity of their adventure , gives the maximum sense of what befalls them . " In James 's fiction , " the maximum sense of what befalls " one is a dramatic value ; it is also a moral state of being . In developing an aesthetic principle James also developed a moral corollary . " The essence of moral energy is to survey the whole field , " James said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiction of intense complexity in the broadest scope . But this caused 174 Everyman His Own Poet an excruciating consequence . His whole technique of portraying the true moral awareness produced a continuous system of cerebration which could have no end . " The secret of the world is the tie between the person and the event , " Emerson had said ; and his system was a dynamic , never-ending reciprocity . James 's fictions represent the same condition ; refinements of refinements are the necessary consequence of any given situation . ( " As soon as I begin to appreciate , " he said , " simplification is imperilled . " ) Given his technique of generating chain reactions of awareness , the only perfect fiction would be a continuum of thought . When we realize that a continuum is a life process we sec the special significance of James 's preachment , " It is art that makes life . " James 's work as a whole can be explained by the contagion of subjective reality and how it infected him . Like Hawthorne ( who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction ) James began with a particular world view . It was idealism , and he developed a formidable technique to represent it . But in the process he developed this world view plus a conviction about it . He discovered the endless possibilities of adapting a playwright 's methods to the narrative form ( all of which he called " the sacred mystery of structure " ) ; and his technique became , in his later novels , the means of representing his own personal system of reality . As author he lived exactly with the consciousness he represented , or as close to it as he could manage ; and the intensity of that consciousness was his own , as he tried to control and confine its myriad possibilities of awareness . James ended up like the romantic cosmologists , those poets engaged in constructing continuous , organic worlds . " Remember that your first duty is to be as complete as possible ? to make as perfect a work , " he wrote at the end of " The Art of Fiction , " and he spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuum of thought . CHAPTER EIGHT The Poetic Dialogues of William Faulkner The romantic cosmology provides a reference for William Faulkner 's major novels . It helps to explain the function of mythology in these novels , and also the fact that they so often proceed like poems . Faulkner wrote his own version of the Emersonian poet , the embattled individual searching for a principle to explain the known world . He used the subject of the mind in the act of finding what would suffice and constructing analogies in order to sec what scheme of cause and effect ? if any ? might emerge . lie scheme that emerges in Faulkner 's major novels is usually a metaphor of an encompassing order which both extends and contains the character who has conceived it , as in the case of the romantic cosmology . The poetic property of Faulkner 's novels is the way they develop an idea primarily by repeating elements of it . The elements are past events which are identified only by sensations and fragmented impressions or recollections ; and these sensations or impressions are organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are agitated into patterns whereby they accumulate symbolic value to the character that identifies them . Faulkner 's novels are insistently dramatic , emphasizing the mind laboring to control the elements of some encompassing scheme . Thanks to a formidable and painstaking body of criticism , the mythology in Faulkner 's novels is by now in the public domain . His cosmos is Yoknapatawpha County , a mythical 175 176 Everyman His Own Poet part of Mississippi with a population of three Negroes to every two whites . Yoknapatawpha County is a singular version of a determining force called the South , which is a history , a condition , and a state of mind . The condition is a matter of history : of the Civil War and the era of so-called reconstruction , during which the property and dignity and health and even life itself were taken from the defeated Confederates . The condition of defeat and disorder has bred a pervading state of mind , involving doubt , recrimination , pride , hurt , and shock . This defeat can be explained by the myth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ? as George Marion O'Donnell first pointed out . But the terrible extent of this defeat is explained by the myth 's aspect of divine retribution ? as Malcolm Cowley first explained . This latter aspect of the whole myth ( which I will refer to , for convenience , simply as the myth ) is a version of the covenant theology of the Old Testament , according to which God repeatedly made firm contracts with mankind which men repeatedly disregarded , thereby necessitating God 's punishment . According to the mythical covenant of Faulkner 's fictional world , God gave the land to the white men in return for which the white men would work it and harvest its abundance . But the white men broke this contract , importing slaves to work the land , and God punished the white men by cursing them with the enduring consequences of this slavery . This myth of divine , categorical retribution is an ingenious and constant explanation of cause , but it is also a distorting and determining force to the characters who acknowledge it yet without understanding their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been abstracted from the fictions that generated and considered and evaluated it as some monolithic and extrinsic force in the world . This is the peculiar service that a great deal of Faulkner criticism has rendered , approximating as it does what the characters in the Yoknapatawpha novels and stories seem to believe . In // varying degree to these characters ? the ones who belong to the traditional , humanistic society ? the force of circumstance is this massive , intractable myth of divine retribution . One way or another this myth limits and determines the characters in Faulkner 's major novels : The Sound and the Fury ( 1929 ) , Light in August ( 1932 ) , and Absalom , Absalom ! ( 1936 ) , and in " The Bear " ( 1942 ) , as well as the characters in the stories closely related to these . These four titles , and a lesser novel , Intruder in the Dust ( 1948 ) , reveal a typical relation between the character and the myth , which is the attempt to put the myth into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most explicit statement of the myth is the story interpolated in Light in August , the story told to Joe Christmas by his white mistress , Joanna Burden . It begins with her whisky-drinking Calvinist grandfather from New England , and it features her father 's sermon to her about whites and Negroes when he shows her the anonymous carpetbagger graves of her brother and her grandfather . The sense of her father 's sermon is that the black man 's presence is God 's curse on the white man . It is a white man 's myth about a white man 's God , since obviously no Negro ( any more than a white man ) would regard himself as a curse . The myth itself is sick . This interpolated narrative occurs precisely in the middle of Light in August ; it is an overstatement of the theme of this novel . A more distorted overstatement occurs in Intruder in the Dust , when Gavin Stevens ? more spokesman than character ? alludes to the Negro as Sambo : the little black boy persecuted by the tigers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devour one another , while he survives to butter his pancakes with their remains . The significance of this myth in most cases is the way the character has to work out his personal version of it . He must relive the particular trauma of his own in order to be able to live with himself . In terms of psychoanalysis he must abreact. // This tortuous cerebral process Faulkner represents poetically , whereby a character painfully recalls the fragments of some shocking event . The poetry lies in the various and distorted repetition of fragments , a process which continues until a new , whole realization of one 's self emerges . In most of Faulkner 's fictions three components are apparent and related : one is the character 's groping toward some immense understanding ; another is the oppressive presence of the past , which the myth represents ; and the third is the various repetition of fragments in some reinforcing pattern . In most of his fictions this repetition relates the character 's groping to the oppressive presence that he is trying to penetrate and understand . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intruder in the Dust , usefully illustrates the way in which Faulkner made the repeated elements correlate all of a fiction 's cause and effect . It will serve to show an organizing principle of his other fictions . Intruder is a detective story with implications . It begins with a corpse and a murder suspect ; the corpse was once a white man and the suspect is a Negro , Lucas Beauchamp , in jail awaiting trial . In order to clear the suspect before he is lynched , a sixteen-year-old boy must unravel the complicated details of a murder , which involve exhuming one corpse and exchanging it with another . Intruder is as complicated as any conventional detective story ; more so , because it is not always clear about what point of view is reporting the action . Yet this novel can be understood without the conventional retelling . The repeated images and attitudes reveal everything that is needed to understand the relations between events , the reasons for the events , and their consequent significance . The crucial event in solving the crime occurs when two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to see what is buried there . This occurs in Chapter 4 , nearly halfway through the novel , and thereafter is recalled by fragmentary passing allusions . Each new allusion to " two children and an old woman " ( Chapter io ) adds new significance to the // event : one of the boys is a Negro ; the old woman is white , a spinster , the godmother of the suspect 's first child ; their trespass on the grave , if discovered , would bring violent retaliation from the murder victim 's kin ; and from the murderer , too , since they discover a corpse which is not supposed to be there . But they are dedicated to the ghoulish chore . " It took an old woman and two children for that , to believe truth for no other reason than that it was true . . . . " ( Chapter 6 ) . A second group of repeated fragments clarifies the reason why " three amateurs , an old white spinster and a white child and a black one " ( Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . The trouble all along has been Lucas Beauchamp 's " refusing to mean Mister to anybody even when he says it " ( Chapter 3 ) . Eleven references in four chapters repeat variations of this indictment . " If he would just be a nigger first , just for one second , one little infinitesimal second " ( Chapter 2 ) . l lc has been asking all his life for the fix he is in : " A damned highnoscd impudent Negro who even if he was n't a murderer had been about to get if not what he deserved at least exactly what he had spent the sixty odd years of his life asking for . . . . " ( Chapter 7 ) . An overstatement of these allusions to Beauchamp 's stubbornness occurs ( in Chapter 3 ) when the speaker says of another white man : " He has nothing against what he calls niggers " ; and he continues : " All he requires is that they act like niggers . Which is exactly what Lucas is doing ; blew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably convinced all Negroes want to do ? and now the white people will take him out and burn him , all regular and in order and themselves acting exactly as he is convinced Lucas would wish them to act : like white folks ; both of them observing implicitly the rules : the nigger acting like a nigger and the white folks acting like white folks and no real hard feelings on either side ... once the fury is over ; in fact Mr. Lilley would probably be one of the first to contribute cash money toward 18o Everyman His Own Poet Lucas ' funeral and the support of his widow and children if he had them . " A third series of allusions intensifies the white boy 's motive for trying to save Lucas . " So this is what that plate of meat and beans is going to cost me " ( Chapter 3 ) . The boy has a past : " Then to be foiled here by the fact that four years ago a child whose presence in the world he was not even aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Negro insomnabulist " ( Chapter 1o ) ; Lucas had taken him home and dried him out and fed him , and then he had disdained the coins the boy had offered for his meal . And now the boy has to keep reconstructing the incident : " Maybe he will remind me of that goddam plate of collards and side meat " ( Chapter 3 ) . Just by being himself in these circumstances this boy has arrived at his present predicament . So has Lucas . Each has collaborated with events in such a way as to be responsible for consequences beyond his own complicity with circumstances . These realizations are conveyed by a sustained dialogue , partly between the boy and his uncle , Gavin Stevens , and partly within the boy 's consciousness . It holds for everyone : this reciprocity of person and event has tangled the destinies of white men and Negroes , and determined them all . The theme of the dialogue is simply that mutual interdependence of white and Negro is inevitable and bewildering and terrible . But on this larger subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the repeated fragments that convey the idea of reciprocity recur less in the boy 's mind and progressively more in the uncle 's . The fragments grow into monologues ; realizations are replaced by concluded opinions , as the uncle sermonizes about whites and Negroes . The more didactic he becomes , the more confusing he sounds . He keeps repeating the same circular argument : the Negro was our fault ; we must be allowed to help him ourselves ; the // righteous Northerners will only divide and destroy the whites ; anyway , maybe the Negro does not want freedom ; but keeping him in this condition is terrible ; the Negro was our fault ; but we must be allowed to help him ourselves ; and so on and on . Stevens 's confusion might have become a dramatic event , but it turns out to be merely unassimilated opinion ; and this stunts the book . Despite its limits , however , Intruder has the same properties that enable Faulkner 's greater fictions . Its point of view is dynamic . It moves in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his predicament in keeping with his own realizations . This point of view is a scheme that allows several voices to express different awarenesses of the situation : the boy 's voice , and the voice of the boy 's unspoken apprehensions , and the uncle 's public voice , and the voice of another , nameless presence . This nameless voice speaks with the intensity of the boy and the authority of his uncle ; and it can even rhapsodize the " ultimate cosmolined doom " of the door of a prison cell . Until it degenerates , the governing pattern of the shifting point of view is the dialogue between nephew and uncle . Ostensibly educating the nephew , it has all the significance of the primitive tribal relationship between the two closest males related by blood ? there being no father in evidence . Faulkner exploited this primitive family relationship in " The Bear , " between Ike and his older cousin . And the dialogue between Shreve and Quentin prevails in Absalom , Absalom ! In these two fictions , Absalom , Absalom ! and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensations and recollections of separate minds into a shared and continuing experience in which the reader necessarily participates . But the organizing dialogue was one of Faulkner 's later developments . He preceded it , in earlier fictions , by representing separate voices in succession , notably and stunningly in The Sound and the Fury . This book is a sequence of impressions of four separate // days , refracted by four points of view proceeding by stages from the unrelated impressions of an idiot to the rational narrative of the omniscient author . Two of these separate voices , Benjy the idiot and Quentin his brother , in Parts i and 2 of the novel , express fragmented recollections and sensations ; and many of the repeated , unrelated images in the mind of the idiot become subjects in the consciousness of Quentin . As these sensations and recollections accumulate , the voice of Brother Jason , in Part 3 , and finally of the author , in Part 4 , present an increasingly ordered and representational view of the Compson family . The compelling fact about The Sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actuality . The book begins with impressions of a world like an exploded diagram whose components are held in space , piecemeal and ready for assembly ; and successive minds assemble these components into a new order . Some fifteen years after he had finished the novel Faulkner wrote an appendix which is like a rational set of directions for assembling these parts thematically . The appendix is all about the myth of the degenerating dynasty . Its brief biographies of the Compson ancestors , over a period of nearly two hundred and fifty years , trace the disposition of the land from the first purchase of a square mile of territory to the present time , when there is nothing left but a house lot and a cemetery plot . But the book does not need this appendix ( which is another fiction , anyway ) to convey a felt sense of the way things are in this particular world . There is no rational theme , no evolving statement of attitude ; instead , there is a developing sense of the end of things . Fragmented images refracted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there is no stop to it ; time and duration are the same . This closed and separate world is a continuum of degeneration . A continuum of some sort is the only inference we can draw from the images in the idiot 's mind . His sensations of present experience and recollections of the past are interThe // changeable and of equal value or nonvalue . Looking for a quarter in the grass , listening to the golfers in the pasture hail a caddy , burning his finger on the candle of a birthday cake , walking in the cold to deliver a letter , swimming in the brook , smelling the burning leaves , and seeing the mourners at a funeral are not discrete units of experience in this particular consciousness . " I begin to cry " and " Caddie smelled like leaves " have the same significance . The repeated images in Part 2 , in Quentin 's consciousness , insist on a continuum , explicitly denying any value of time : the college bells announcing hourly obligations , unheeded ; the smashing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clocks all telling different times at once . The narrative that contains these images is simple enough . Quentin Compson leaves his college dormitory , rides a trolley to the end of the line , and spends most of the day walking on his shadow . His state of mind is totally disconnected from the present . Quentin 's recollections are so intense that lie relives a past episode without even realizing that he has imposed it on the present , and this confusion involves him in a series of absurd misunderstandings . Quentin conceived of incest with his sister Caddie , and so he reconstructs a past experience , of losing a fight with Caddie 's lover , in order to validate the incest which never happened but which he has always wanted to claim . Meanwhile , in the narrative present , the father of a little girl , thinking that Quentin wants to rape her , has him arrested ; and Quentin discovers himself fighting , and being beaten by , an acquaintance whom he has happened to meet . The present episodes parody the past which Quentin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fewer repeated images in Parts 3 and 4 , but even these emphasize the sense of frustration and degeneration . Part 3 begins and ends " once a bitch always a bitch , " and reviews the failure of Jason Compson to cope with his niece , his mother , or the Negress who has always run the household . " Once a bitch always a bitch " sums up his attitude . " I // know I am just a burden to you , " his mother says over and over and over , as he uses her to build a neat , mean tyranny over his niece and her income . " Once a bitch always a bitch . " Benjy cries continuously , and Jason 's indictment stands . Part 4 continues the narrative , in which Jason pursues his niece to retrieve the money that she has stolen back from him . " I 've seed de first en de last , " says the timeless Negress in the kitchen where the crazy clock is perched . It strikes five times at eight o'clock and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house itself . " I seed de beginnin ' , en now I secs do cndin ' , " says Dilsey . It is surprising how clearly this ambience of a closed world is conveyed without logical connectives . Here are simply four versions of the dissipation of consequence . Each has supplied local substance to the same recurring idea , which is the destroying presence of the past in a community of minds no longer capable of proportioning events . The Sound and the Fury represents a real world of its own . The process of creating such a subjective and self-consistent world is the subject of Absalom , Absalom ! and of " The Bear . " These two fictions deliberately and explicitly represent the experience of a character 's creating a new , separate world by abreacting , by reliving under great pressure what he thinks was his own past . Of all Faulkner 's fictions , Absalom , Absalom ! ( 1936 ) most closely resembles the romantic cosmology , and can be understood in these terms . It is about the desperate labor of Quentin Compson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian ? trying to construct an order of history which will explain itself and show cause for all the tangled events that happened or might have happened or might never have happened . Quentin and Shreve finally manage to create a fictional world , a closed system of cause and effect which for them becomes a reality . The substance of their fictional world is a series of events which occurred two generations before them in the life of Thomas Sutpen , who had attempted and failed to // found a dynasty . Both Quentin and Shreve assume that reconstructing the Sutpen saga will explain the South , which is Quentin 's heritage . Their struggle to build a theory of events occurs in the form of a dialogue , and the dialogue creates the illusion of a single consciousness at work . Although their attitudes sharply differ , their awarenesses have somehow fused under the tremendous emotional pressure . This illusion of Quentin and Shreve as a single identity grows as the dialogue proceeds , and later in the novel ( Chapter 8 ) the illusion becomes explicit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Shreve speaking , though for the slight difference which the intervening degrees of latitude had inculcated in them ( differences not in tone or pitch but of turns of phrase and usage of words ) , it might have been either of them and was in a sense both : both thinking as one , the voice which happened to be speaking the thought only the thinking becomes audible , vocal ; the two of them creating between them , out of the rag-tag and bob-ends of old talcs and talking , people who perhaps had never existed at all arnywherc , who , shadows , were shadows not of flesh and blood which had lived and died but shadows in turn of what were ( to one of them at least , to Shreve ) shades too , quiet as the visible murmur of their vaporizing breath . " This statement has authority partly because Quentin is already convinced of it . Earlier in the dialogue ( iii Chapter 7 ) , with Quentin straining to piece together some of leis father 's evidence about Sutpen , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two children ' thinking Yes . Maybe we are both Father . Maybe nothing happens once and is finished . " Quentin begins to see that there is more than just the identity of two present minds . He secs a continuity of Shreve 's mind and his own with the minds of his father and grandfather , and he develops an elaborate metaphor to express this continuity of awareness . It is a metaphor of two // pools of water joined by a channel , so that a disturbance in one pool causes a continuous agitation that reaches the other pool . It is an apt metaphor of the whole book . Maybe happen is never once but like ripples maybe on water after the pebble sinks , the ripples moving on , spreading , the pool attached by a narrow umbilical water-cord to the next pool which the first pool feeds , has fed , did feed , let this second pool contain a different temperature of water , a different molecularity of having seen , felt , remembered , reflect in a different tone the infinite unchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watery echo whose fall it ( lief not even see moves across its surface too at the original ripple-space , to the old ineradicable rhythm thinking Yes , we are both Father . Quentin secs even more implication in this continuous identity of minds , past and present : " Or maybe Father and I are both Shreve , maybe it took Father and me both to make Shreve or Shreve and me both to make Father or maybe Thomas Sutpen to make all of us . " The shared consciousness of the past is what joins Shreve and Quentin as they build a fictional world . The substance of their world is a series of eight events that occurred between 1833 and 1869 . Thomas Sutpen arrived in Yoknapatawpha County in 1833 with a deed to a hundred acres of land traded from the Chickasaw Indians , and he began to build a mansion with the labor of Negro slaves . In 1838 he married Ellen Coldfield against her wishes but according to the wishes of her father . In 1839 the marriage yielded a son , Henry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbade his daughter 's marriage to Charles Bon , his son by another marriage ; and Henry Sutpen renounced his birthright in favor of Bon . In 1865 , at the gates of Sutpen 's Hundred , Henry killed his half brother because of Bon 's intention to marry Judith . In 1869 Sutpen was killed by the grandfather of a common white girl on whom he had sired a female child . // These events mark Sutpen 's abortive design to found a dynasty . Their significance is partly determined by two pieces of evidence . One of them is doubtful : Sutpen 's discovery that Bon , the child of his first marriage , was part Negro . If so , this would explain why Sutpen had forbidden him to marry Judith . An incestuous marriage was no problem at all compared with miscegenation , which would also explain why Henry had killed his half brother . The other piece of evidence concerns Rosa Coldfield , who was Sutpen 's sister-in-law . Sutpen had proposed to sire a child upon Rosa and to marry her if the child were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the primary source of information about Sutpen , but this unfortunate event has undoubtedly distorted her testimony . Along with these major events in Sutpen 's saga , other fragmented episodes come to light , about Sutpen before his arrival in Yoknapatawpha County , and about his progeny after his death , some thirty episodes over a period of seventy-seven years . The sequence in which all this evidence comes to light is eccentric and distorted . New fragments of evidence continually interrupt chronology and modify whatever Quentin and Shreve have already found out . The first five sections , roughly the first half of the novel , present the testimony of Rosa Coldfield , now an old woman , in a sequence determined not by chronology but by her own agitation . In the last four sections of the novel Quentin and Shreve piece out this testimony by hearsay evidence , and try to evaluate it all by analysis , surmise , deduction , and outright invention . This hearsay evidence comes from Quentin 's father who is objective but limited to the occasional observations made over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa more about some aspects of Sutpen than his grandfather did . Anyway , even without Rosa this knowledge of the South is already bone deep in Quentin : because you knew it all already , had learned , absorbed it already without the medium of speech , somehow from hav188 Everyman His Own Poet ing been born and living beside it , with it , as children will and do : so that what your father was saying did not tell you anything so much as it struck , word by word , the resonant strings of remembering . ( This occurs in a long interior monologue in Chapter 6 . ) But this instinctive remembering is not enough and too much ? both . Everything Quentin knows or learns about Sutpen is subject to amendment . Ile and Shreve can not evaluate Sutpen 's " design " and its disastrous consequences without having the whole story , and the whole story is what they must recreate ? and even create ? for themselves . The fragmented narrative past is contained within the dialogue between Quentin and Shreve which occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation of Quentin 's attempt to reconstruct or create a plausible order of events . He labors desperately to understand all this in order to understand himself . Nothing less will suffice . Here is the problem of the typical character in Henry James 's fiction , who can discover what he is only by knowing his circumstances ; but the problem in this case is compounded , for the circumstances are in the past , not in the present , and they are knowable ? if at all ? only through distorted evidence . For Quentin the past tense is ever-present tension . And not just for Quentin , but for Shreve as well . Throughout the novel neither character exists apart from the past which they jointly conjure up . Shreve shapes the dialogue . He asks the questions that force Quentin to retell what he knows , what he has somehow always known about the South . Quentin 's labored repetition accretes new meaning . And Shreve sums up , overstates , and oversimplifies . " So he just wanted a grandson , " Shreve says ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . Jesus , the South is fine , is n't it . It 's better than the theatre , is n't it . It 's better than Ben Hur , is n't it . No wonder you have to come away now and then , is n't it . " And his distortions force Quentin to rebut . Time and again Shreve gets it all wrong or too painThe // fully right , and so they plunge into the history once more . Shreve 's astonishment and disbelief turn to commitment , and he leads the way in elaborating and refining the Sutpen fiction . He devises a motive for Charles Bon ( a mission to blackmail or torture his father and half brother for their renunciations of him ) . Bon really loved Judith , Shreve reasons , but would have renounced her if his father would only have recognized him . As Shreve devises Bon 's strategy , he begins to identify with Bon , and Quentin takes Henry 's part . The extent of their fiction is apparent in that neither Quentin nor Shreve can substantiate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . But no matter , the present dialogue between Shreve and Quentin becomes a concentric repetition of the conflict between Bon and Henry . ( " Maybe nothing ever happens once and is finished . Maybe happen is never once but like ripples maybe on the water after the pebble sinks , the ripples moving on . . . . " ) The dialogue is irresolvable ; it settles nothing . Quentin knows too much , Shreve knows too quickly ; and the reciprocity of Quentin 's paralyzing knowledge and Shreve 's tabloid judgment is the only reality that they can build . Shreve concludes with an inventory of Sutpcn 's dynasty , ending up with only one survivor , an idiot Negro , Jim Bond ; and lie prophesies that the Jim Bonds are going to conquer the Western Hemisphere . But this definitive statement defines nothing more than a new beginning , for Shreve goes on to say , " Now I want you to tell me just one thing more . Why do you hate the South ? " His impossible question guarantees an interminable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bear . " This five-part fiction is an episodic narrative interrupted by the dialogue which also contains episodes . This dialogue obliquely comments on the narrative it interrupts by furnishing a history to explain it . The narrative , contained in the first three parts and the last part of " The Bear , " concerns the ritual of the hunt and Ike McCaslin 's initiation into the ritual . These // episodes begin when Ike is ten years old and first joins the hunting party of Major de Spain and General Compson which travels to the woods every November and every June to hunt the bear . The narrative ( like Intruder in the Dust ) explains its own significance by the various repetition of a few images , mostly as they would occur to Ike . Alone , the boy tracks and finds the bear ; he begins to learn what the rules are ; he learns from the bear and an old IndianNegro . The episodes of the hunt and Ike 's novitiate continue for six more years until Boon Hogganbcck finally kills the bear without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the passage of time , the images become symbolic : in Part 1 , a crooked paw print of the bear ; and the assertion that the dog has not yet been found that can stop Old Ben . Then a series of encounters with the bear , in Part 2 , occur after Sam Fathers has trapped a wild dog and trained him to hunt . They name the dog Lion . " So he should have hated and feared Lion " is one repeated element . The dog has yellow eyes , " a cold and almost impersonal malignance like some natural force . " Boy and bear have some mysterious affinity . " So he should have hated and feared Lion . " Boon says , " He 's the dog that 's going to stop Old Ben and hold him . " But not yet . Boon Hogganbeck shoots at the bear point-blank five times and misses . In Part 3 the bear with the crooked print is still waiting for them . Meanwhile , in Memphis , Boon gets drunk and shoots at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bear is still in the woods . Hunting for him , Boon shoots at a buck ; shoots five times and misses . In the last encounter Lion , " blinking his sleepy topaz eyes , " is taken into the woods to find " the head bear . " He does ; but Boon kills the bear , climbs up on his back , and kills him with a knife . The dialogue begins at this point . It dramatizes a situation that is almost the same as in Absalom , Absalom ! : two characters , two minds in the narrative present , both laboring to understand the dense confusion of past events , trying to disThe // cover some plausible cause or sequence by which to explain it all . They are Ike McCaslin and his older cousin McCaslin Edmonds . Here is another version of that primitive tribal relationship which approximates the bond between father and son . Ike creates the occasion for the dialogue because of his intention to repudiate his heritage . " You ca n't repudiate , " says McCaslin , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , that continuing state of mind which extends and contains them both . Ike McCaslin and McCaslin Edmonds share a dramatic relationship comparable to Shreve and Quentin . They seem to comprise a continuous unseparated consciousness : one with the other , and both together with the persons and events of the past . The dialogue occurs in the commissary of the McCaslin plantation . As it proceeds , speech and thought are not always clearly separated , and one speaker often answers the other 's thoughts . The drama correlates a spastic continuity of impressions and chantlikc recollections which seem to be imagined and could he claimed by either speaker . It could be a dialogue between the ego and the alter ego . Ike and his cousin share the name McCaslin , and in the paragraphs which designate a change of speakers , Faulkner exploits this identical name to reinforce the impression that the whole dialogue is a single , shared developing awareness . The primary documents of the South , the metaphorical world that contains Ike and that he wants to repudiate , are the commissary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dialogue ) , recording the slow outward trickle of food and supplies and equipment which returned each fall as cotton made and ginned and sold ( two threads frail as truth and impalpable as equators yet cable-strong to bind for life them who made the cotton to the land their sweat fell on ) . . . . The ledgers were begun before the Civil War , and they record the trespasses of old Carothers McCaslin on his slaves : // ... the older ledgers clumsy and archaic in size and shape , on the yellowed pages of which were recorded in the faded hand of his father Theophilus and his uncle Amodeus during the two decades before the Civil War , the manumission in title at least of Carothers McCaslin 's slaves . Ike is the direct male descendant of old Carothers McCaslin , and the trespasses of the old man are what he really wants to repudiate . These old ledgers reveal that Carothers McCaslin sired a daughter on one of his slaves and then sired another child on his daughter . The child of his child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' grandchildren and also his great-grandchildren . By way of acknowledgment he bequeathed a thousand-dollar legacy on each of the three which has never been paid . Ike wants to repay it and thereby relinquish his inherited responsibility . But this is only part of the legacy which Ike wants to relinquish . The whole of it is the complex state of mind , the metaphorical South . Organized like a poem , this dialogue repeats and amplifies the evidence of the inheritance and its burden . The argument between Ike and McCaslin involves the entries in the old ledgers which are the fragmented images of the past , and it crisscrosses these images with present events and with the other recollections of the hunt for the bear . The argument in the ledger entries between Ike 's father and his uncle over what to do with the free slaves points up the present disagreement between Ike and his cousin over what to do about his heritage . The dialogue juxtaposes the impressions of different epochs in the past , for example , the images of Uncle Hubert Beauchamp 's legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s which Uncle Hubert put in a tin cup to acknowledge the money that he had put aside for Ike in a silver cup , and then borrowed back for himself ( including the silver cup ) . Scattered images are all concentrated into the argument that ranges back and forth in time from the pluperfect past of // Yoknapatawpha County to the present moment of imperfect awareness . Chronology means nothing in this search for sense . The logic of events is in the repetition of the images . Their repetition amplifies and intensifies the ludicrous , terrifying breach of faith with self and land and God which is Ike 's legacy . The repetition clarifies the impossibility of his ever renouncing , since his awareness of all that has happened makes him a part of it . By degrees he learns how much it takes to compound a man , how complex and refined the circumstances of his past which make him what he is . " And it took Him a bear and an old man and four years just for you , " McCaslin says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about that many , maybe more , for Old Ben , and more than seventy for Sam Fathers , and you are just one . How long then ? How long ? " The unanswerable question recalls Quentin Compson 's realization : " maybe it took Father and me both to make Shreve or Shreve and me both to make Father or maybe ' Thomas Sut pen to make all of us . " To sum up . These fictions all represent a characteristic emotional crisis : the extremity of a person who can not tolerate his situation and who can not even define what it is he can not tolerate . He is desperate , possibly hysterical . In order to be able to live , to relate himself to the world around him , he must recognize and acknowledge whatever it is or was in his life that has caused his paralyzing extremity , but lie must first discover what it is he has to acknowledge . As his crisis becomes more intense , sooner or later some present event forces him to act or react ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his past . He sees it in spite of himself ; and in spite of himself he tries to work out some cause or explanation of events . He participates vicariously in the past until some seizure forces him to live through it all again . This is the crisis of his crisis , and if he survives the shock he becomes a different person . This shocking confrontation with one 's past has a particu194 Everyman His Own Poet lar relation , in Faulkner 's fiction , to the intractable myth of divine retribution . From his fragmentary and distorted knowledge of his past the character is aware that he is somehow responsible for events that have occurred , but without knowing why or how he has been to blame . Working out some plausible relation between responsibility and culpability involves him in trying to put the pervasive myth into his own terms . He must get it into his own words , and this is how the poetry occurs : the agitation of images in the mind , repeating them again and again , developing a meaning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a whole pattern , in Faulkner 's fiction , is a particular instance of the romantic cosmologies in general . The problem that really organizes the cosmologies is a ceaseless search for a way to say what would be an idea if it could only be said . Only to the extent that he can understand how the past has determined him can the character be free of it . But only to the extent that he can say it can he understand it . ' Whether or not a given character accomplishes the entire process of reliving an experience , and some of them do not , the process itself is nevertheless one way for the reader to understand him . This is because it is so prevalent in Faulkner 's fictional world . There is an analogy here to Hawthorne 's novels and tales . The progress from a state of sin to confession and penitence and then to regeneration is such a common reference in Hawthorne 's fiction that it is a measure of almost any one of his characters , no matter how far along in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faulkner 's stories . Ike McCaslin , for example , manages to purge his obsession . At the beginning of his dialogue with his cousin , Ike must renounce his heritage , without clearly knowing what it is . He has to relive the ludicrous experience of having tried to pay Carothers 's debt to Fonsiba and her husband , which would not change their lives or his obligation . But by virtue of his having tried to buy them off , as he now sees it , Ike has somehow made the old man 's burden his own as well ; and so now he can live with it . // Later in the dialogue Ike relives another commitment he has made . While being seduced by his wife he has promised to return to the land ; being male and husband , he could not repudiate his heritage . The final episode in " The Bear " ( Part 5 ) is revealing ( it occurred before the dialogue took place , but Ike could not have understood it until afterward ) ; and this final episode measures Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods with squirrels all around him and his rifle on the ground in pieces ; and Boon , hammering on some broken part of his rifle , ludicrously screams , " Get out of here ! Do n't touch them ! Do n't touch a one of them ! They 're mine ! " Boon 's concept of ownership owns him ; he is not even capable of beginning to know what has happened to him or what is wrong . But Ike , having harrowed himself , does know and can understand . Boon is one measure of Ike 's development . The two versions of Quentin Compson in two different novels represent the same harrowing process . Although the precise nature of the resolution is less decisive in either case than in Ike 's , the process nonetheless occurs . Quentin in Absalom , Absalom ! can not relive the actual events , since he did not experience them in the first place , and since they may not have happened anyway . So he creates a fiction , makes the situation his and lives it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records no resolution of his trauma . The Quentin of The Sound and the Fury also struggles with the burden of a guilt which lie can not identify until he re-experiences the beating that his sister 's lover gave him . The book records no resolution ; he dies by circumstantial evidence . Only when they are considered together do these two versions of Quentin present a resolution , and then only with the reader 's help . The exorcising of the past explains still other characters in these novels . Goodhue Coldfield , in Absalom , Absalom ! never progressed beyond his paralyzing awareness . He nailed himself up in the attic and died . But the harrowing process does occur , in Light in August , in the character of the minis.196 Everyman His Own Poet ter , Gail Hightower . He has withdrawn from the world because his grandfather was shot , not , as supposed , in leading a cavalry charge but while robbing a hen house . Not until Hightower can conjure up this humiliating contradiction of his ideal can he return to reality and commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas is too little , too late , and ludicrous ; but it is a commitment . I began by saying that Faulkner wrote his own versions of the Emersonian poet . This typically harrowed character in Faulkner 's fiction is the Emersonian poet in spite of himself . His situation corresponds to Emerson 's later doctrine of the determinism in which the individual is bound to try to think his way through " unpenetrated cause . " But Emerson 's earlier theory also clarifies the miseries of this character . Emerson believed that the poet 's ideal reality is ineffable until and unless it is acted out ; the poet could unfix the land and the sea , rearrange actuality into a new order only by somehow experiencing this new order . The idea is not real until the poet perceives it , but to perceive it is to live it . Here is the dreadful plight of the practical idealist . The ideal is not a reality at all until it is workable in the actual world in which the poet finds himself . It is a harrowing situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strategy of escape and return , the idea being to suppose a new environment , to illuminate and clarify actual experience . But some poems insist on the new environment to such an extent that their clarifying purpose is obscure . By its nature , any poem ( or any fiction ) is a theory of events , but when the events themselves are theories of events the poem is already once removed from the experience it is attempting to clarify . Such a poem or fiction may turn out to reveal something other than what its author intended . Such is the case with two cosmologies : E. A. Poe 's Eureka ( 1848 ) , which he called a poem , and The Education of ! hairy Adams ( 1907 ) , an autobiography . Both works propose a definitive relation between mankind and his total environment . They are both intensely cerebral , and superficially they are alike . Eureka and The Education are both theories of theories . Each one appropriates certain mathematical explanations of the physical universe to its own use , and incorporates these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The supertheory is of course metaphorical . Specifically each cosmology proposes a dynamic system that relates the human being to the physical universe in terms of motion : the motion of thought and the motion of natural energy . The Education dramatizes the making of a metaphor , but the most convincing aspect of Eureka is that Poe had to write it . 197 // Poe spent much of his life trying to construct an imaginary world around himself . He finally created such a world in Eureka , which is almost unreadable . It epitomizes dozens of murky pieces by Poe that do not justify all the criticism that has been lavished on them . Part of the fascination of his writing is that many parts of it are apparently unrelated ; his work eludes any comprehensive and convincing explanation of why it is what it is . But Eureka provides a convincing overview of the man and his work , once you see it is the culmination of many experiments . This explanation attracts me because it can afford to admit Poe 's poor writing and his limitations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he often did not know how to say what he wanted to say . Eureka is dense , obtuse , and precious . It has almost no relation to fact ? other than the fact that Poe finally managed to write it , yet it explains a great deal about most of the other things Poe wrote , and why he wrote them . They are what they are because he was trying to work out an organic cosmos that would extend and contain E. A. Poe . Many of his fictions are abstruse and self-indulgent because he could not often dramatize his idea . Some of these fictions were actually fragmentary sketches of the organic theory of being that he was finally able to state in Eureka , and his poems , his tales , and his critical theory all variously anticipated it . They are characteristically about a man trying and failing to make the actual world serve his vision of it . Poe composed Eureka the year before he died , and it was his final sublimation of himself . Eureka was Poe 's exorcising of the intolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different kind of culmination . It is self-sufficient . It contains its own explanation of the theory it proposes by the way it evolves this theory . Starting with false assumptions and proceeding through a maze of contradictions , Adams devised a strategy of turning experience into evidence and then abstracting a principle from this evidence . This principle is the continuous interacParadigm // tion of mind and matter . Testing it by what he called a dynamic theory of history , Adams explained the development of Western civilization . His dynamic theory is a version of the process by which he discovered it . This process he called his " education . " The chronology of Adams 's search occurs approximately in halves . The first twenty chapters describe his formal schooling and his self-styled careers in law , diplomacy , journalism , and teaching ? all a failure according to his definition of education ; and the next sixteen chapters put the experience of these failures to use in his search . But even as he reassesses his principles , events overtake him . His orderly account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century becomes , instead , a desperate attempt to understand the twentieth century . The third cosmology in the next cluster of chapters is William Carlos Williams 's Paterson ( 1946-1958 ) . Like Eureka , it culminates a lifelong endeavor to build a comprehensive system of cause and effect , and , like The Education , it is also a self-sufficient system . Like the other two cosmologies , Paterson deliberately presents the apparently causeless , formless elements of the condition of actuality , and it appropriates theories of relationships from other sources to build a clarifying statement of the order inherent in this condition . But the theories that Paterson appropriates are not mathematical ; they are aesthetic . The actual and universal condition it acknowledges is the condition of language . It evolves a theory of the relationship of art and actuality by borrowing theories of technique in one medium and adapting them to another . It appropriates a theory of painting and collage to explain how language means . But Paterson does not explain ; it dramatizes a mind searching for order . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovers the order that the poet protests does not exist . Paterson is about words and the succession of sounds that make meaning . In its broadest terms it is a large scrapbook of 200 Everyman His Own Poet borrowed public prose , punctuated by lyric verse that worries what it borrows into larger meaning . Most of the public writings are newspaper stories , faithful records of mere actuality which make sense without significance . The verse is all subjective , probing the undisclosed and deeper reason in events . The poet borrows fragments of public records , of letters he has received , of speeches and sermons and legends and recollections , all of which echo the discrepancy between what he sees around him and what he knows must be there . Paterson probes the nature of meaning by countless variations of related patterns in these documents . It juxtaposes the words in chaotic disarrangement or in superficial order with new patterns of those same words . The poem is a vast and intricate collage of lyric verse and fragmentary facts which interrupt each other . 1 t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmologies , like all the others , confront the same dual realities of mind and matter ; and they all allege or assert or dramatize an organic cosmos on the premise that mind and matter are components of the same reality . Significantly , with the exception of Poe 's Eureka , they all work out some system of determinism ; they all devise some version of a dynamic reciprocity between the individual mind and universal matter . Significantly , with the exception of Eureka , they arrive at a doctrine that approximates Emerson 's determinism by enabling or even causing the individual to collaborate with his environment . The accent is always on reciprocity , or , as Emerson said , on the tie between the person and the event . The process of discovering a deterministic system is particularly schematic and obvious in Emerson 's successive essays . In Nature , he first proposed a cosmos in which the mind paradoxically contains the world beyond itself . It does so through its impression of the totality of all things . But his system showed no cause . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the condition of a world within a Paradigm Five zor mind should necessarily exist for any other person . So Emerson amended his system over the years until he arrived at exactly the opposite relation of these two entities , the mind and the world around it . In " Fate " he proposed a system in which the mind is contained within the world by means of a reciprocal relationship . He proposed a dynamic system in which the reciprocity of world and mind continuously and forever necessitates the mind 's trying to overcome the limitations of being contained by what it does not know or understand . All these cosmologies propose some dynamic relationship between the mind and its environment . They all devise a strategy , like Emerson 's , of revising terms in order to incorporate contradictions . Adams called this strategy " the larger synthesis . " He worked with the concept of Unity and Chaos . But before he could express his dynamic theory of history he had to abandon the idea that Unity is a given absolute , and to redefine it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a determinism extraordinarily like Emerson 's " Fate , " based on the interaction of men 's minds and the forces extrinsic to them . The other cosmologies devise the same reciprocity of mind and matter , terms which they identify differently . Thoreau , in Walden , worked with the concepts of the self and its natural environment . The organizing force of his whole system is the repeated recognition , wherever he looked , of reflections of himself . The mind 's continuous analogizing is what incorporates the self and the environment in a great organic whole . The duality that Whitman saw in Leaves of Grass was the simple-separate self and the society of mankind , or " the ensemble , " as he called it . The self , he asserted , is equivocal , being separate and yet part of humanity at the same time . Whitman defined the United States of America as a political entity incorporating a contradiction of majority rule and minority rights , and he could see this equivocal society as an extension of the equivocal self . Later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
