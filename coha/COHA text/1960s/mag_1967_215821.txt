" The script , " allowed House Republican Leader Gerald Ford , " is a good one from our standpoint . " Indeed , the plot that he laid out was compelling , if not exactly original . It called for G.O.P. Representatives and their Southern Democratic allies to deny Lyndon Johnson his request for an unpopular tax increase , beat every tom-tom and kettledrum for economy , and force the President to take responsibility for specific spending cuts . The House last week voted 238 to 164 to do just that . <P> Amending a routine financing measure , the House lopped between $5 billion and $8 billion off projected federal spending in the current fiscal year . The exact amount was impossible to reckon because of massive loopholes embodied in overlapping amendments approved by the House and because the actual amount of war expenditures is uncertain . The first amendment , proposed by Mississippi Democrat Jamie Whitten , would limit spending for many activities to last year 's level . But the Viet Nam war and a number of domestic programs such as highway construction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment , put forward by Ohio Republican Frank Bow , put an arbitrary limit of $131.5 billion on all spending with the proviso that Johnson could add to that figure only to meet new war costs . The effect of the bill would be to compel Johnson to gut such programs as educational aid , urban development , antipoverty operations and foreign aid . <P> Do-It-Yourself Kit . It was a blatant bit of buckpassing . Moreover , only a week earlier the House had passed a pay increase for civilian employees that was more generous than the Administration had requested . That bill singled out the postal workers , who have the most powerful civil service lobby , for a larger raise than other groups and denied employees of the Office of Economic Opportunity any raise at all . Many of the most economy-minded Congressmen protested when the Administration recently imposed temporary freezes on certain construction projects . In the course of a six-hour debate last week , members loyal to the faltering Democratic leadership tried in vain to remind the House that 1 ) Congress has the power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) economy could well begin in the House itself . <P> New Jersey 's Charles Joelson was brushed aside when he proposed a " do-it-yourself economy kit " with which each Congressman would trim 5% from federal projects in his own district . Michigan 's Martha Griffiths captured the mood perfectly when she volunteered : " If the rest of you want to cut something out of your districts , I 'll be glad to help . " No one took up the offer . Silvio Conte of Massachusetts pointed to the " Capitol police falling all over themselves , elevator operators running automatic elevators . " Even Arizona 's John Rhodes , who as chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee had every reason to feel victorious , lamented : " There 's got to be a better way to run a Congress than this .
