DO N'T GAMBLE PLAYERS ' LIVES // Like many Americans , athletes are flying a lot nowadays . The airplane has made possible tight schedules in football , basketball , hockey , baseball and some other sports . It has made the intersectional game a commonplace . Parents of college athletes have become accustomed to their sons ' aerial expeditions . They have taken it for granted that school authorities employ reliable pilots and that equipment is first-class . // No more . The cruelly unnecessary crash that killed 16 members of the California Poly football team in Ohio a fortnight ago has started a lot of parents asking questions . If someone had asked some of these questions of Cal Poly and Arctic-Pacific Airline officials before the Ohio junket  --  and had gotten honest answers  --  there would have been no trip and no tragedy . For example : // Q. Does the line have a good safety record ? // A. Before the crash Arctic-Pacific Airlines was fined $16,000 by the Federal Aviation Agency for violations by the pilot of the fatal plane . Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended by the FAA for gross disregard of public safety and FAA regulations . // Q. What about its equipment ? // A. For this flight Arctic-Pacific provided a two-engine C-46  --  a World War II plane originally notorious for its " bugs . " Manufacture of the C-46 ceased in 1950 , and the FAA says the bugs have been " modernized " out . Last year California Poly chartered an identical aircraft from Arctic-Pacific to fly the football team to Montana State . One of that plane 's two engines conked out , but luckily the craft did not crash . // Q. What about the pilot ? // A. Last July 15 the Federal Aviation Agency revoked the air transport rating of Donald L. J. Chesher for violations of the civil air regulations . Chesher appealed and , pending decision on the appeal , was allowed to resume flying . His decision to take off on the night of October 29 even though there was a fog so dense that no other pilot dared fly would seem to support the FAA judgment of Chesher. // Everyone knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards . There are easy , though often expensive , ways to minimize them . One of the easiest is to fly on scheduled airlines with modern , carefully maintained equipment . Another is to investigate thoroughly the safety record and reliability of a charter firm before engaging it . In the modern air there is room only for first-class airplanes run by first-class people . There is no room at all , in the air or on the ground , for the kind of college official who is willing to gamble with his players ' lives . // OPEN TENNIS OPENLY ARRIVED AT // In recent years unilateral action has become unfashionable , to say the least , in international political circles . But one case of unilateralism meets with our qualified approval . It is Jack Kramer 's worldwide campaign to make tennis open  --  with or without the consent of the ancient Pooh-Bahs of big-time amateurism . The Pooh-Bahs had a chance last summer to negotiate an honorable peace with the advocates of open tennis . They haughtily refused . // So now Kramer is ruthlessly and systematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis Cup competition is over , Kramer probably will get the last holdouts . Amateur tennis , thus decapitated , has no discernible prospect of survival , but only the chance of resurrection  --  in mixed , realistic company . Those clinging to amateurism , even at the cost of mediocre tennis , must learn to coexist with legitimate professionalism . The Davis Cup , Forest Hills , the Wimbledon championships should be open to pros and amateurs , just like the biggest tournaments in golf . // We do not intend here to crown pragmatic Jack Kramer as the idealist of tennis . But we do thank him for taking a big step forward against the forces of hypocrisy and narrow self-interest .
