THE LOVE MACHINE by Jacqueline Susann. 51 1 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $6.95 . <P> <P> It 's only a matter of time before someone designs a thin , 9-in. by 6-in. portable TV set that opens like a book . Since 90% of all contemporary writers of fiction can do little more with language than concoct dialogue and make wordy pictures , Televolume might benefit writer and reader alike . Novels that normally take six to eight hours to read could be transformed into two hours of viewing simply by eliminating the need to read descriptions of aquiline noses , snowy breasts , silken haunches , the interminable lighting of cigarettes , pouring of drinks and brewing of coffee . Once liberated from the vestigial sanctity of hard covers , the popular novel could be promoted with the same big budgets and honest enthusiasm as any other mass entertainment . <P> One author who is not waiting for such technological innovations is Jacqueline Susann , a former utility actress and semicelebrity who finally got her share of limelight and lettuce ( more than $1,000,000 ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susann 's latest excitement is The Love Machine . A preposterously engaging sex-and-power fantasy targeted mainly at middle-aged females , The Love Machine is already nudging Portnoy 's Complaint off the top of the bestseller lists , and should gross at least $2,000,000 . In it , Miss Susann once again demonstrates her remarkable instinct for the varicose vein . <P> <P> Valley was a pharmacological and gynecological nightmare . Reader interest , soaring along on a series of drug ingestions , couplings and nervous breakdowns , finally hit an apogee with breast cancer . Love Machine lacks Valley 's primitive vigor but equals its obsession with pathology : leukemia , gall-bladder trouble , heart disease , neurasthenia and nymphomania play important roles . One man is terrified of losing his genitalia ; another surrenders them gladly in order to become a woman . The central character , a power-mad television executive with a superhuman capacity for vodka and coitus , is mysteriously incapable of love and marriage . The explanation is only a cut above those delivered in Hollywood psychodramas of the 1940s in which a white-coated mental hygienist resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> As a novelist , Miss Susann unwittingly gravitates toward a caricature of naturalism , a relatively uncomplicated form of literary life born in the seminal spillage of Darwin 's The Origin of Species and kept alive by public demand . Naturalism at best tends to project the human animal as an unappetizing accumulation of nerve endings and appetites . But in Miss Susann 's handling , appetites consume the characters they inhabit , leaving nothing behind but a bad taste . <P> In a Delicatessen . With two huge successes in less than four years , Jacqueline Susann is thrusting past such bestseller fabricators as Harold Robbins , Arthur Hailey and Leon Uris . She is now in a commercial sphere where fame matches fortune as a spur to effort . <P> <P> " Money is applause , " Miss Susann sums it up with characteristic baldness-and that must be the case .
