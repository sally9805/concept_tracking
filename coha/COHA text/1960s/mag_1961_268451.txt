The melee at the gate to New York 's Lewisohn Stadium looked like the running of the bulls at Pamplona . With elbow , knee and hip , the lovers of the arts and the avid curious jostled and shoved in a wild struggle to get inside . Those who failed craned their necks over the fences or peered from apartment house windows more than a block away . Inside , early arrivals snatched all available folding chairs , forcing many a reserved-seat ticket holder to hunker on the ground . The scene was an impressive if chaotic tribute to the continuing musical phenomenon known as Van Cliburn . <P> The Lewisohn concerts have had a bad summer at the box office , only once filling better than half the seats . But Pianist Cliburn 's appearance there last week-his first in New York at popular prices in more than a year-drew a capacity 20,000 , proving that three years after his Moscow triumph he still commands a movie-fan idolatry rare among longhairs . His ardently romantic manner of playing the piano is only part of the appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a showman 's sure instinct for using his gifts . At Lewisohn , Showman Cliburn was in peak form . <P> Scheduled to come on during the second half of the program to play the Rachmaninoff Concerto No . I ( which , along with the Tchaikovsky Concerto No. 3 , is still his big showpiece ) , Cliburn artfully delayed his appearance for several suspenseful minutes after the lights went down . Finally he strode boyishly out , all arms , to thunderous applause . <P> Expertly supported by Conductor Vladimir Golschmann , Cliburn shaped a characteristic performance-simple , water-clear , eloquent in every detail . And it brought an ovation . As the orchestra was packing its instruments , Cliburn reappeared to play an encore-Chopin 's A-flat Polonaise . Then another , Rachmaninoff 's Etude Tableau . The orchestra left for the night , but the audience stayed on . Cliburn played Albniz ' Eritaa . He walked offstage and came back again , smiling and bowing . At last he stole a look at the piano , walked over to it . put a hand on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etude No. 3 . <P> In the past year , Cliburn has crisscrossed the U.S. , visited Mexico and made his second triumphant tour of Russia , rarely playing to anything but sellouts . Cliburn is something of a prisoner of his success : a man whose temperament and talent favors the romantic , he has recorded Schumann . MacDowell , Prokofiev and Beethoven . But his audiences often demand Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff . What he clearly needs to do now is learn the trick-invaluable to any artist-of occasionally saying no to the fans .
