When the Soviet 50-megaton test-bomb exploded on Novaya Zemlya last October , it set the earth 's whole atmosphere vibrating . Last week in London , Seismologists Eric Carpenter , George Harwood and Thomas Whiteside reported how the bomb waves looked when they were recorded on the microbarograph at Britain 's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment . <P> The bomb exploded at 8:33 a.m . British time . By 11:44 a.m. , the first air wave reached England , having taken 3 hr. 11 min. to travel from Novaya Zemlya at the speed of sound-about 700 m.p.h . At 4:40 p.m. on the next day , the barograph pen jiggled again , recording the air waves that had taken the long path and circled the earth in the opposite direction and approached England from the southwest . At ten minutes past midnight on Nov. 1 , the first wave swept over England again , making almost as strong a record as on its first trip . At 12:40 p.m. on Nov. 2 , it made its third appearance , three days after the explosion . Seismologist Carpenter is sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have detected the persistent waves for several more days . <P> In 1883 the explosion of the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa sent out air waves that registered easily on the crude barographs of the period . Big as the Soviet bomb was , its waves were far weaker than the volcano 's , but the time they took to circle the earth was almost exactly the same : 36 hr. 27 min . Small variations in their speed were due to varying winds and temperatures . Carpenter is now putting the Soviet bomb test to unexpected and peaceful use : he is asking the world 's scientists to send him copies of their barograph records so that he can study atmospheric conditions revealed by the behavior of the bomb 's waves .
