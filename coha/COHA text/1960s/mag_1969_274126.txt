As just about every golfer not in the P.G.A . class soon learns , golf balls are deceptively fragile items . They are prone to chipping , cracking or denting when not stroked properly . Keeping an adequate supply on hand makes the game an expensive pastime . Now modern manufacturing techniques are taking away much of the strain . At least four firms , including the Faultless Rubber Co. of Ashland , Ohio , and the Chemold Corp . of Jamaica , N.Y. , are making " solid-state " balls that are all but indestructible . <P> Unlike conventional balls , which have gelatinous centers encased in hard rubber , various layers of rubber windings and dimpled hides of balata rubber , the new balls are uniform in structure . Molded from a mixture of plastic and rubber , they are immune to the kind of slice that can cut ordinary balls to the core . Priced from $6 to $15 a dozen , about the same as standard balls , they are sold at sporting-goods counters , in department stores and at driving ranges . Golf-course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they threaten a lucrative replacement trade . <P> Frankly designed for the three out of four golfers who never quite manage to break 100 for 18 holes , the solid balls have already captured 10% of a market that this year will sell 9,600,000 dozen balls for $61 million . <P> Though some of the solid balls have not yet been accepted for tournament play by the U.S. Golf Association , the players who use them are not complaining . Tournaments are not for the over-par golfer anyway . The only real trouble with the solid-state balls is that - just like the old ones-they are embarrassingly easy to lose .
