Last winter , after several years of waiting , I put to test what I believed was a secret formula : how to become an art collector on a shoestring ? or almost . I had set my heart on acquiring some medieval icons , and one of the ways of bypassing predatory dealers was to go straight to the source . The opportunity finally came my way during a visit to Belgrade , Yugoslavia , a country reputed to be one of the remaining storehouses of Byzantine art . Of the three letters of introduction I had brought with me , one was found to be addressed to a person who no longer lived in Belgrade . The second addressee happened to be in jail for black-marketeering in national art treasures . The third and last letter took me to the beautiful six-room apartment of an elderly couple named Jovanovic , in the old part of town . Mr. Jovanovic turned out to be a charming and hospitable specimen of what is locally referred to as " the old guard . " Three whole rooms were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever seen . Displayed on the walls were about a hundred pieces ; several dozen more lay in packing cases , awaiting cleaning and restoration . They were a stunning sight . How did my host manage to keep this treasure from being nation-alized ? Mr. Jovanovic 's story was long and rather bizarre . A successful dentistbefore the war , he had started collecting in the ' twenties when inflation and wholesale closures of aristocratic estates were glutting the European art market with Renaissance works . The scramble for the medieval art of the Balkans was still a couple of decades away . Jovanovic toured the Serbian and Macedonian villages and bought icons from churches , monasteries , and private homes at a few dinars apiece . By the time the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in 1939 , he had close to a thousand pieces , most of them housed in his villa on Kalimegdan . The villa suffered a direct bomb hit and was burned to a cinder . When liberation came in 1945 he was left with about 400 pieces ; these were stored in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nationalized . The Juvanovics lost the right to their large apartment on the ground of " insufficient utilization . " They would have to look for a smaller place and put their collection in storage . By that time , European art dealers were scouring the countryside for old art and the regime had waked up to the notion that medieval relics were a tourist lure and a prestige builder . A department was set up for-their preservation . Jovanovic thought of a bold and original scheme . He sought an audience with the officials and told them of his icons . His case was that they were part of the national heritage and ought to besuitably looked after ; he desired to place them under state protection . He was not asking for subsidies ? only the privilege of keeping his apartment , where the collection could be properly looked after . As a quid pro quo , he would be delighted to keep open house to state guests and visiting foreign notables . The officials fell in with the suggestion and he was left unmolested . Subsequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat needed to keep the treasure at a safe temperature . Later they gave him expert help to restore those icons still in the packing cases . Last but not least , whenever one of his icons was reproduced in an official publication , the picture credit always included the phrase , " Collection of R. Jovanovic . " It was a sensible arrangement all round . Mr. Jovanovic 's pleasure in his collection was tinged with an obvious pride of ownership as he showed me around . Like a true collector , he was a walking encyclopedia of iconology . I learned , for instance , that icons were painted exclusively on wood ? never on canvas or parchment . They were usually unframed , except when one was mounted as a pious ornament on a church iconostasis. the tall screen that divides the congregation from the sanctuary in an Eastern Orthodox church . Here sometimes a gold or silver casing was placed in a cutout over the icon , leaving only the figure exposed . Gem-studded and enamel-encrusted , these casings were sometimes gaudy and in bad taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Macedonia ? they were works of art in their own right , designed to complement and enhance the painting itself . The use of icons was not , of course , confined to churches . Every home . even the humblest , had one ? often several . They were portable holy pictures , rather like the penates in a Roman household . Travelers put them in their saddlebags when journeying . At prayer time in the home , the family icon would be passed from hand to hand and kissed . When not used , it would hang in a corner of the room where the soot of the burning candle or oil taper would gradually tarnish its high color and eventually blacken it out of recognition . Mr. Jovanovic grew more expansive . " Although the icon tradition is generally associated with Byzantium. " he went on , " its origins are traceable to early Christianity in the Syrian-Palestinian area . Legend has it that St , Luke painted the first image of the Mother of God , thus creating the icon archetype ; but scholars prefer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian temple art . Be that as it may , Virgin and Child became a recurring theme of the icon painters and a symbol of the early Marian cult , stylized in two main variations : Eleusa or Lady of Mercy , and Galactotrophusa or Milk Giver . The range was later expanded to include Jesus Christ in his role as Pantocrator or Ruler of Everything , and also certain saints and scenes from the New Testament , such as the Annunciation , the resurrection of Lazarus and the like . " It was the rise of Byzantium , however , that gave the icon painter his hour of glory . From being an anonymous hack of devotional artifacts , he rose by degrees to a place of importance beside the fresco painter and the sculptor . The concept , style , and technique of his work became refined and systematized . He was still anonymous , but the best of his painting brilliantly captured the Eastern Church 's glimpse of heaven ? those cool , melancholy divine visages which , for all their gilded splendor and lavish Oriental detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a world of pure spirit . It was a sublime but eloquent vision . The icon art spread out through the Balkans , north through the Slavic lands to Russia , south to Greece and Crete , and westward to the ends of Italy . The primitives of the quattrocento , especially Duccio , Cimabue , and Giotto , bear witness to the irresistible contagion . So do the mosaics of Venice , Ravenna , Rome , and Palermo . After the fall of Constantinople , the Byzantine icon painters dispersed to the Greek islands and Crete and to the hinterlands of Macedonia , Serbia , and Bulgaria , where local schools had been thriving for some time . During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , some brisk cross-pollination took place ( " bastardization " was Jovanovic 's word for it ) and the Renaissance spawned a style of icons known as Italo-Cretan . It can be recognized by the lurking sensuousness in the Virgin 's face and in the shiny opulence of her garments . But the new school failed to ruffle the traditional styles of Serbia and Macedonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century , When commercial lithography and letterpress finally made them obsolete . There were several rather lush halo-Cretan pieces in Mr. Jovanovic 's collection , but from the manner in which I was hustled past them it was evident that he was not especially proud of them . " One does n't look for an Italian Madonna in an icon , " he told me . " Would you believe in a Joan of Arc modeled by Sophia Loren ? There was one thing our old masters insisted on . A Virgin had to look the part ! Now look at this one , " he commanded , pointing to a three-handed Virgin and Child . " This is a Virgin ! " The painting was an eighteenth-century replica of the legendary three-handed icon ? the Tricherusafrom the medieval Serbian monastery of Studenitsa , reputed to have been painted around 1300 . " Here you see Serbian School at its best , " explained Jovanovic . " Modified Byzantine , a blend of the esoteric and earthy , but strictly within the style 's canon . None of your cinquecento @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had quite a vogue at one time . The story had it that a fire broke out in the Studenitsa monastery , but the original Tricherusa soared away miraculously and came to rest on the back of a mule , which promptly trotted south to Mount Athos in Greece . There the monks recognized the miracle and took the icon into the monastery of Chiliandary . By next morning , the icon had mysteriously found its way into the abbot 's chapel pew . This remarkable event occurred three times in all and was AFTER HOURS interpreted as a sign of Divine Will . From that time on the monks stopped electing an abbot and adopted the Tricherusa as the head of the monastery . Presently , over a demitasse of aromatic Turkish coffee , served by Mrs. Jovanovic , I managed to coax her husband back to the original subject of my visit . He was sympathetic but doubtful . To begin with , now that his collection was in the state catalogue , he no longer enjoyed a pipeline to private " entrepreneurs " : he was not trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander up and down the country as he used to . Rut once in a blue moon , some villager or other might drop in with a few icons in a burlap bag , and that might be an opportunity . It would be a pig-in-apoke purchase , though , since most icons were blackened over with the candle soot of many generations and had to be restored first . The restoration might uncover a masterpiece , or a smudge of decayed nothing . I told him I would take that chance . We discussed the problem of getting my purchase out of the country . " You could try and smuggle it , but I would n't advise you , " he said . " They are brittle things , these icons . " Some years ago a . French dealer had cunningly affixed a crate of them under the chassis of his Renault , believing that if he took a little-traveled route to the Austrian frontier he would avoid sophisticated customs officials . As he was approaching it , he came on a bad patch of road and smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspector noticed the dangling wood splinters and the ruse was discovered . The icons were missing . Both men drove back down the road and found them ? broken and badly chipped . The fragments were confiscated , the dealer fined and detained for two days . Later , in Paris , he received a polite letter from Belgrade advising him that the " religious articles " had been repaired and he could have them by making the usual export application . He went back there the following spring and got them . Jovanovic thought that , as a private individual , I stood a good chance of getting an export permit ; especially if it was only a question of a few pieces . What the authorities were set against was wholesale commercial pillaging , not private art lovers . When the time came , he would tell me where to apply and haw to go about it . " How soon will that be ? " I asked , and he smiled charmingly and rolled his eyes to the ceiling . " That 's up to the villager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was several months ago . I am still waiting and hoping .
