. It was high noon in Bethlehem when photographer John Bryson and I were there , after completing a reporting tour of duty throughout the Middle East . The tourists had left the candle-lighted gloom of the Church of the Nativity to swarm into the little souvenir shops on Manger Square , where they bought camels and Wise Men carved out of olive wood , rosaries made of olive seeds , crowns of thorns , and post cards , in memory of their visit to the place where Christ was born . Around the square at little sidewalk tables old Arabs , their dark , hawklike faces shrouded under white head-cloths , sat sipping their cups of bitter coffee flavored with cardamom seed . Nearby a young Arab student listened to a small transistor radio . From it came the strange wailing cry of a muezzin , broadcasting from Jerusalem , calling the faithful of Islam to noonday prayer . Quietly the young guide translated : " ' God is most great ! . . . There is no God at all but Allah .... 1 testify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer . . . Come to prosperity. ? And then the Lord 's Prayer of the Moslems : " ' Praise be to Allah , Lord of the Worlds , the Beneficent , the Merciful . Owner of the day of judgment , Thee we worship . Thee alone we ask for help . . The wailing call died away , and a newscaster came on , his voice sharp with excitement . All the serenity with which he had heard the prayers had gone from the young Arab 's face as the newscast ended . He had , instead , the despairing , disbelieving look of a man who has just been stabbed . " Syria , " he said , his voice shaking , " has broken away from Egypt . The republic is finished . " " Was Syria your country ? " I asked him . " Syria is my country , " he answered bitterly . " Egypt is my country . I am a Jordanian and a Palestinian and an Iraqi . I am all of these , for I am an Arab . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fears , the loyalties and the hatreds , the unity and the disunity that seethe and surge in that segment of the Middle East that lies between the Tigris and the Nile , had shown suddenly for a moment in clear outline . The voice of the muezzin , speaking Arabic , and the prayers that he uttered represent the great unifying forces  --  a common language and a common faith  --  which give to all the Arab world a sense of brotherhood and the vision of a common destiny . To these must be added a common memory of greatness , of the time a thousand years ago when Arabs ruled the world from India to the Pyrenees , and Arabic philosophers , poets , astronomers and mathematicians carried the lamp of knowledge into the intellectual darkness of the lands beyond the Mediterranean . The young student 's proud assertion , " 1 am an Arab , " reflects the conviction held throughout the Arab world today that the time has come at last for Arabs to unite again in one great nation which can take its place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern world . To him the United Arab Republic had been the first step toward that goal , and his angry outburst expressed the hurt and disappointment which he and millions like him felt when Syria 's secession brought the stark realization that the hatreds and the distrusts which have divided the Arab nations are still more powerful than the elements which unite them . The Arab is like other men , however . In times of crisis and failure he looks desperately for a scapegoat . " It is you Americans who have divided us , you and the Jews , " the young student said angrily , snapping off the radio . This attitude warps and poisons the Arab mind today , and we as a nation must recognize it in all our dealings with the Middle East . The Arab 's hatred of the Jew is implacable and unwavering , made more bitter by the fact that ethnologically they are brothers  --  Semites claiming a common ancestor , the prophet Abraham . The Arabs are equally convinced that the western powers , now represented by the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Arab world solely for the purpose of weakening and dividing the Arab states . It is futile to argue with him or his fellows that American support of Israel implies no malice toward the Arabs , but stems , rather , from a deep compassion for a people who , having been savagely maltreated throughout history , at last have established a homeland in which they hope to live free from fear . It does no good to recall that the first seeds of Arab nationalism were sown by Americans nearly one hundred years ago , when Presbyterian missionaries at Syrian University , now the American University of Beirut , taught the explosive doctrines of independence to Arab students from all over the Middle East . It is useless to point out that there is no logic whatsoever in the view that Israel 's presence in the Arab world serves to divide Arabs against each other , for one emotion which all Arabs share is the conviction that Israel is an enemy who must be destroyed . Nor can he be persuaded that the United States , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a strong , unified , and independent Arab state established peacefully and without political chaos . Only in this way can we be assured that the oil of the Middle East will keep flowing to our friends in western Europe , that our ships will freely transit the Suez Canal , and that Russia will continue to be denied dominion and control over the great land bridge that links Europe , Asia and Africa . " We are not deceived by words , " an Arab nationalist told me angrily . " We know that the Israelis arc your proconsuls here , and that you must keep us weak and quarreling . For you know that , once we are strong and united , we will drive them into the sea . " The anger and anguish that the Arab intellectual and the Arab peasant felt when the news of the Syrian revolt came out of Damascus last September was far different from the joyful emotions which stirred the capitals where the Arab leaders sit . Instead of sorrow there was jubilation in Beirut and Baghdad , Amman and Riyadh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamcl Abdel Nasser 's northern province had severed its tics with Egypt . This meant that a mortal enemy had suffered a crippling , if not fatal , blow . 14 To the Arab intellectual , of course , Mr. Nasser had his flaws . An Egyptian , it was hard to look upon him as a true Arab ; for the Arab , with his nomadic tradition as a wanderer and a warrior , looks upon the sedentary , peace-loving Egyptian as a softer breed of man . But Mr. Nasser had not behaved like an Egyptian . He was a strong man and a leader , and around him shone an aura of power and success . After all , he had defied the West by seizing the Suez Canal , in retaliation for our refusal to build the Aswan Dam . He had persuaded the Russians to build the dam and to arm his air and ground forces . Then , to prove that he was no man 's lackey , he had jailed the Communists in Egypt and sternly rebuked Mr. Khrushchev when he protested . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . defiant of all who might seek to control him  --  and he was still the strongest voice crying out for the triumphant , . united " Realm of the Arab " which the Koran had promised . To the hungry Arab peasant , herding his goats on the Jordanian hills or tilling a field in Iraq eroded by 3000 years of cultivation , the voice of Mr. Nasser was the voice of hope . The land reforms , tax reforms , and socialization of industry which he had imposed upon his docile Egyptians , held out the promise of a better life to poor Arabs everywhere . To the Palestinian , gnawing his ' heart out in the refugee camps of Lebanon , Jordan , Syria and the Gaza Strip , Mr. Nasser 's threats against Israel offered the glittering hope that someday he could go home again . Arab political leaders saw Mr. Nasser in a different light . To them he was a modern Pharaoh , clutching for power , seeking to establish throughout the Arab world , through revolts and assassinations , the kind of police state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against their rulers , he was not the architect of Arab unity , but the instrument of Arab division and distrust . The leaders had strong reason to hate and fear him . From a gilded tower in Cairo that stands higher than the pyramids , his state-controlled " Voice of the Arabs " radio had heaped vilification upon each of his neighboring chiefs of state , urging their people to rise and overthrow them . The Iraqis , being men of violent nature , had heeded the call to violence . In July of 1958 they had killed their young king , Faisal 11 , his family and his prime minister and had dragged their bodies through the streets of Baghdad . The net gain to Mr. Nasser was nil , for the pro-Nasser colonel , Abdel Salam Mohammed Aref , who engineered the bloody coup , was soon replaced by Brig . Gen. Abdul Karim Kassem , who felt that he , not Mr. Nasser , should be the one supreme ruler of the Arab world . At the time of the coup in Iraq , Mr. Nasser 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so endangering the government that the U.S. Marines were sent in to restore order ; and in Jordan , British paratroopers were moving in to protect King Hussein from another pro-Nasser plot . It was the second time in two years that Hussein had had to call for outside help to save his throne from Mr. Nasser 's nationalists . In 1957 the U.S. 6th Fleet hadmaneuvered ominously in the Eastern Mediterranean , bolstering Hussein as he quelled a pro-Egyptian revolt . In August of 1960 the conspirators were still at work in Jordan . A bomb exploded in the office of Hussein 's prime minister , killing the minister and eleven others , and the assassins fled to refuge in what was then Mr. Nasser 's Syria . It was little wonder then that Syria 's revolt caused glee in King Hussein 's Amman , in Kassem 's Baghdad , in King Saud 's palace in Riyadh , and in the ministries of Beirut , where shrewd . sharp-trading Christian Lebanese feared any coalition of Moslem power . In BenGurion 's Israel , the news of Syria 's defection was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two sworn enemies on one 's flanks . It is even more uncomfortable when those enemies are united under one government . The Israelis know that , so long as the Arab states remain divided , there is little hope that they can ever come to an understanding with their Arab neighbors . The ruler who even hinted that he might be willing to treat with Israel would be killed , as in 1951 Hussein 's grandfather , King Abdullah , was murdered at his prayers because he was thought to be soft on Israel . Israel 's only hope for peace therefore lies in the eventual formation of an Arab government strong enough to face realities and to talk of peace in the face of fanatical opposition . On the other hand , a united Arab nation might not wish to negotiate . Burning with the desire to avenge the defeats that Arab troops have suffered each time they met the civilian armies of Israel in battle , a strong Arab nation might make a determined onslaught on Israel . Thus the defection of Syria left the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world as it has been since the end of World War H , when the British pulled out of Palestine and the French departed from Lebanon and Syria . They left a hatred of the West as their heritage . They left the time bomb of Israel ticking . And they left the Arab nations to work out their own destiny in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust . The prospect that some form of Pan-Arab union can be achieved without violence and bloodshed seems , at the moment , remote . The observer , looking at the Arab world today and trying to predict what may happen there , is in the position of a seismologist peering at a great range of volcanic mountains and trying to guess which smoking cone will explode first . In Saudi Arabia , dissidence is growing among the princes ; all over the Arab world political observers predict a blood bath there  --  to be followed by a revolt of young , educated Saudis who are determined to seize the government from the oil-rich sheiks . In Jordan , a game little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powder keg . One third of Hussein 's kingdom , which survives today only through our financial support , is made tip of tribesmen of Bedouin descent , who are fiercely loyal to him . Two thirds are Palestinians , one half of whom are embittered refugees who still look to Mr. Nasser for salvation . The Palestinian looks upon the Bedouin as a 16 shiftless vagabond . The Bedouin looks upon the Palestinian as a soft , effete city slicker whose word can not be trusted . Palestinians outnumber the Bedouins , but the Bedouins hold the places of power in government , and they make up the rank and file of the best of the Arab armies , the Arab Legion . So long as the army remains loyal , Hussein is as safe as any Arab leader ever is who must live under the constant threat of assassination . Western diplomats believe that , if he can survive another five years , he may be safe from internal revolt . By that time , they believe , the great plans now under way for irrigating the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove valuable minerals from the brine of the Dead Sea , and the road-building projects which are opening up the country will have created a viable economy in which Bedouins and Palestinians alike can prosper . In Lebanon the problem is not prosperity , but politics . Beirut , the Lebanese capital , is the busiest city in the Middle East . Saudi and Kuwaiti oil money pours into it to construct new office buildings and handsome apartment houses on the bare , skull-like hills above the sea , and trade is brisk in the ports from which the Phoenician galley sailed . The well-to-do from all over the Middle East come to Lebanon as wealthy Europe goes to the Riviera . There they loll in the warm waters of the Mediterranean , ski on the mountain slopes and build themselves lavish villas on the hills overlooking Beirut , where the lights of the gambling casinos glow with neon in the darkness . " We 'd swap all our oil , " a Saudi sheik said , sighing enviously , " for the climate of Lebanon , the culture , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom . " All this glitter , unfortunately , is built upon a shaky base . Of the 1,500,000 citizens of Lebanon , a little more than half are Greek , Armenian and Arab Christians . The rest are Moslems . By reason of better education , greater talents and greater energy , the slim Christian majority holds precarious control . The Moslems suspect that an honest census would show that they , instead of the Christians , are in the majority . The Christians privately admit that this may be so . The Christians have been migrating by thousands to the western world . The Moslems stay at home and breed . Peace is maintained because both Moslems and Christians are internally divided . The Moslems are Sunni and Shia , rival sects who find it difficult to make common cause . The Christians are Maronites , Greek and Armenian Orthodox , Greek and Roman Catholics , and Protestants . mainly Presbyterians , all of whom view their fellow Christians with suspicion . " Lebanon , " one observer said , " is not a country , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their single-minded devotion to trade . In this , Christian Arabs and Moslem Arabs are alike . They are Arabic in blood , but not in their hearts . They do n't really want to be a part of a unified Arab nation . They just want to sit here , as they 've done forever , trading with all who pass , under as corrupt a government as any that ever existed in the Middle East . " In Kuwait the problem is not politics , but prosperity . The ruling sheik , Prince Alaclullah as-Salim as-Sabah , is a wise old Arab who is well aware that his sandy principality , so small , so weak and so rich , can not long survive unless it finds a way to make some valuable contribution to the standard of living of its poorer neighbors in the Arab world . Up to now the Kuwait sheiks have used much of their nearly 5400,000,000 a ? year in oil revenues to provide schools , hospitals , clinics , roads and housing for the nomadic tribesmen and the thousands of other Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare-state facilities the country needs , either built or on the drawing boards , the Kuwaitis are seeking to spread their riches around . They are sending well-trained teams of investigators into other countries to seek worthwhile projects which Kuwait money might finance . As a robed Kuwaiti sheik put it , sitting cross-legged and barefoot in his office chair , " We want to serve the Arab countries as the United States , through ICA , has served the rest of the world . We want to establish our own Point Four program . " Shakiest , perhaps , of all the governments , but one that has survived for three years despite predictions that it would soon dissolve in bloody revolution , is that of Iraq under Faithful Leader Abdul Kassem . Politically it is a clumsy police state , governed by a strange , dreamy-eyed man whom foreign observers consider to be slightly daft , but who has shown an amazing genius for political survival . Economically it is going rapidly downhill . Under the murdered King Faisal and his tough old prime minister , Nuri Said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle East toward providing a better life for the hard-pressed peasant . Under U.S , technical guidance , the bulk of the country 's oil revenues of some $250,000,000 a year was going into big dams , roads , irrigation systems , education , health and support of land reform . Today , though some progress is being made in health , education and land reform , most of the population is still hungry , ignorant and riddled by disease ; and a frightened Kassem is spending his oil money on Russian arms . His survival problem is made more acute by the presence in Iraq of a large and truculent non-Arab population . the Kurds , who , in their mountain fortresses , have long dreamed of joining their Kurdish brothers in Iran , Turkey and the Soviet Union in an independent Kurdish state . This dream of separation From the government at Baghdad is secretly supported by the Russians . Periodically Mr. Kassem must send his Russian-made planes and tanks to put down a Kurdish revolt . Then with vast illogic he announces that he has foiled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This , of course , is idiocy , " one western observer said . " It is to the oil companies ' interest to keep the wells flowing , and this is impossible when there 's fighting around the oil fields . Admittedly , we could bear with fortitude the news of Kassem 's overthrow , The chances are , however . that he 'd be replaced by somebody worse . " The possibility seems unlikely that any lasting confederation of Arab states can be formed until Kassem departs from history 's stage . Long before Syria had broken away from Egypt , Kings Hussein of Jordan and Saud of Arabia , though their fathers were mortal enemies , were discussing the possibility of forming some sort of confederation between their two countries , Kuwait and Iraq . The idea was that such a coalition could eventually draw Syria away from Nasser , thus leaving Egypt isolated in her far-off capital on the Nile . This scheme , was , in a sense , leaping to avoid Mr. Nasser 's frying pan and falling into Mr. Kassem 's fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free , there will be further efforts to form such a coalition in which Syria would be included , leaving Iraq and Egypt isolated on the flanks of an Arab heartland . In order to checkmate this move , Mr. Kassem is now earnestly wooing Syria . To the non-Arab observer , any peaceful union which could bring together for the mutual good of all Arabs the oil riches of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , the business acumen of Lebanon , the fierce energies of the Palestine refugees in Jordan , and the potentially rich and under-populated agricultural lands of Syria and Iraq , would in time become a strong and prosperous state . To this coalition Jordan could also contribute the spiritual and financial drawing power of one great treasure shared by Moslems , Christians and Jews alike  --  the Holy Land  --  the world 's greatest tourist attraction . If to such an Arab state could be added the brains and vision of Israel , contributing the scientific techniques by which she turns dry deserts into blooming gardens , the poor , eroded , drought-stricken Arab countries might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . Only the Jews , however , have any hope of such a coalition ; and they are implanting the idea subtly and by indirection by sending teams of scientists into the underdeveloped countries of Africa . " We are trying to demonstrate , " a Jewish spokesman said , " the kind of contribution we could make to our Arab neighbors if ever we could work with them in peace . " In the present mood of the Arab countries , that time is still far off . What happens next in the Arab world depends to a great extent on Mr. Nasser . Like camels scenting the approach of a sandstorm , the other Arab leaders are craning their necks , peering nervously toward Cairo , awaiting Nasser 's next move . Will he abandon his ambitions to lead a Pan-Arab state and concentrate instead on the vast projects which are afoot in Egypt ? He could profitably do so . His land reforms are making progress ; farms are being divided among the fellahin ; agricultural banks are being set up ; deserts are being irrigated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nationalization of Egypt 's industry is getting under way . But his police state is becoming entangled in its own red tape , and on the lower bureaucratic levels his government is as corrupt as it was under King Farouk . A strong hand is needed to straighten things out . Now that the financial burden of Syria is off his back , will he push his efforts to become a power in the great black continent to the south ? Already Egyptian imams are moving about in the newly formed African states , spreading the religion of Islam , and from his limited supply of technicians Nasser is sending what experts he can spare to help his African friends . Will he step up his campaign to extend Egypt 's influence into Africa ? Or , as is more likely , will he make some bold foray against Israel , in a dramatic effort to recapture his lost prestige among the Arabs ? Will he , as the Palestinians have urged , send thousands of unarmed refugees  --  men , women and children  --  marching into Israel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek some solution to this fifteen-year-old problem ? Or , more dramatic still , will he send his bombing planes on a ten-minute flight to smash Israel 's huge atomic reactor on the dry plains south of Beersheba ? The Israelis claim that in this plant they are working to develop a reactor which will operate on unenriched uranium derived from Dead Sea phosphates , a scientific breakthrough which , if achieved , would benefit all the world . The Arabs , however , are convinced that it is an A-bomb factory , and the very fact that it is there terrifies them . The final question is What should the U.S. do in the dangerous years ahead to try to keep the peace in the Middle East ? The answer at the moment seems to be : Nothing , other than what we have been doing . Our goals are still the same  --  to keep the oil flowing , for without it western Europe can not survive ; to keep the Canal open ; to prevent the creation of a political vacuum into which the Russians could move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs are determined to be neither pro-U.S. nor pro-Russia , but pro-Arab . Even so , we can continue to offer friendship and aid to those who wish our help . We can continue to support the UN agencies  --  UNRWA , which feeds the refugees , UNEF , which guards the explosive border between Egypt and Israel , and UNTSO , which in Syria , Jordan and Lebanon sits in judgment on the border violations which threaten to flame into war . " If we can just keep them from fighting , " one American said hopefully , " maybe in a few years the old hatreds will begin to die down and some sort of ' stability will come . " Maybe so . But many an old hand in that part of the world is dubious , for he remembers the story of the frog and the scorpion . The scorpion , wishing to cross the Nile , begged the frog to ferry him across on his back . The frog refused . " No , " he said . " When we are in mid-stream you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That is illogical , " the scorpion replied . " If I sting you , we both will drown . " So the frog agreed and the scorpion climbed on his back . Halfway across , the scorpion stung him . " I told you so , " screamed the dying frog . " You 've killed us both . What is the logic in that ? " " Who thinks of logic ? " said the drowning scorpion . " This is the Middle East . "
