txt To THE EDITOR : MR . ANDREW SARRIS , in his stimulating interview with Joseph Losey , discusses Losey 's American period during which he directed " The Boy With Green Hair , " " The Lawless , " " The Prowler , " " M , " and " The Big Night . " Writes Mr. Sarris : " The director has very mixed feelings about the work of his so-called American period . Except for ' The Prowler , ' the movies he directed were dominated by strong and experienced script writers . " ' A writer like Dalton Trumbo , ' Losey recalled , ' would hand me a script with all the camera angles indicated . I would never accept such a detailed script today . Harold Pinter , for example , delivers very poetic , evocative scripts ? " the moon was a silver crescent , etc. " ? but he leaves the camera angles to me ? " Reference to the moon as " a silver crescent " may be poetic to Mr. Losey , but . I am sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not ) , considered it pure and precise description . Crescent is the astronomical definition of the moon 's shape in its first and final quarters ; silver is the adjective which best describes its color in those particular atmospheric conditions which turn it silver rather than yellow or orange . The only choice Mr. Pinter entrusted to his director was whether the horns of the crescent be shot pointing right or left Since film can be " turned over , " it really did n't matter which of the moon 's two possible phases Mr. Losey found more beautiful . In the course of a somewhat checkered career I have worked with perhaps 3D directors , some almost as distinguished as Mr. Losey , not one of whom has objected to my custom of breaking a script into shots . Most of them , indeed , have asked me to include even more shots in the second draft than appeared in the first . Reason : a script written in master scenes ( leaving the rest to poetic fancies and brave visions secreted in the director 's heart ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time than a script with exhaustive description and detailed general shots . There are few unhappier men on this earth than a director , caught on a short schedule , who calls for a crane shot in a unit that has no crane . Of course the ideal filmmaker creates his own story , writes his own script , and then directs it . Few qualify , but those who do ( with the exception of two or three sports ) schooled themselves first in the craft of writing , after which the shift to writer-director seemed quite natural . The reverse , I believe , has never occurred . Meanwhile , such handicapped craftsmen as Losey and Trumbo ? directors who ca n't write and writers who ca n't direct ? should blame God rather than each other for their limitations . Professionally , they are both cripples , as hopelessly dependent on each other as a team of one-legged acrobats . Neither can complain of the other without revealing the unhappy truth that he , himself , is but half a filmmaker rather than a whole one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script which I " handed " Mr. Losey " with all the camera angles indicated " resulted in the only one of his five American films ( I thought it rather poor ) which he views with unmixed feelings : " The Prowler . " I was blacklisted at the time , and S. P. Eagle , the producer ( previously and latterly Mr. Sam Spiegel ) , required a legitimate - name on the screenplay . I asked my life-long ( and then unblacklisted ) friend , Mr. Hugo Butler , to lend me his . Most generously he did . I not only handed Losey a first and second draft of the script , but also , under the pseudonym of John Abbott , dubbed the voice of the cuckolded husband from first ecstatic description of green vegetables and fresh fruit to ultimate death cry . Not once did Mr. Losey complain about the script 's objectionable shots and " camera angles " or the fruity quality of my voice on the sound track , perhaps because I was working at cut rates : $7,500 for the script , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of legal action ; and $35 for my dubious vocal talents . A year or two later , Mr. Butler himself was blacklisted . With the understanding that his name would not appear on the screen , he wrote for a fraction of his former fee the screenplay of " The Big Night " which Mr. Losey thereupon directed . Still later , in England , under the same pledge of namelessness , he wrote the first draft screenplay of " Eva , " which again Mr. Losey directed .

Exhausted by an economic , political and professional struggle which carried him and his family from the United States to Mexico , Italy , England , and finally back to the United States , Hugo Butler died in Hollywood on January 7 , 1968 , at the age of 52 , survived by his wife and six children , four of whom are still in school . Not everything in Hollywood  --  or England , for that matter  --  is done with mirrors . Most of the truth still lies on the dark side of the glass . DALTON TRUMBO .
