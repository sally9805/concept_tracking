For 67 uninterrupted years , a powerful G.O.P. machine ruled Philadelphia-and stole it blind . Then , in 1951 , a group of young , liberal Democratic reformers threw the Republican rascals out of office . During the next years , the last 5 of them under Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the reformers , with their programs for slum clearance , improved park and recreation facilities , and road construction , made Philadelphia a model of municipal progress . But as of last week able , aggressive Dick Dilworth was fighting for his political life as his aging reform administration was swamped by scandal . <P> Blueblooded Watchdog . Strangely , the man who exposed the scandals was a fellow Democrat , a onetime protege of Dilworth 's and an official in his administration . Like the mayor , City Controller Alexander Hemphill , 40 , is a well-heeled blueblood with an Ivy League background ( University of Pennsylvania ' 43 ) . The father of seven , he is the godfather of a Dilworth grandchild , and a fancier of Utrillo and Rouault prints . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when he decided to run for election in 1957 , Dilworth tried to persuade him to withdraw . Says Hemphill : " I just told him to go to hell . " <P> Hemphill 's investigations of the city government 's spending and ethical practices at first seemed to be digging up only small potatoes : a Dilworth appointee was discovered holding two jobs ; municipal employees were seen at a race track when they were supposed to be at work ; city truck drivers were caught selling city paint ; a private citizen 's driveway was paved at public expense . But Hemphill was a serious annoyance to Dilworth . " The crooks we can cope with , " cried Dilworth . " But it is these pious phonies we ca n't handle . " <P> <P> But the scandals multiplied and grew bigger . Last winter Hemphill 's auditors discovered that an automobile dealer had set up an elaborate shell game with a possible profit of $40,000 by selling new cars to the city , then buying back used cars at cut-rate prices after they had been conveniently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal , but he was still unimpressed by Hemphill 's investigations . " It strikes me as a lot of penny-ante stuff , " he said in April-and left town on a round-the-world trip . While Dilworth was gone , Hemphill kept digging . He struck pay dirt . <P> Payola &; Whisky . Eli G. Travis , a free-spending contractor , admitted that he had lavished a small fortune on friendly city officials who helped him to get contracts and did not inspect his work too closely . On one big job-$1,000,000 worth of repairs for an elevated transit line-city officials claim that he successfully swindled the public out of $800,000 . In his various deals with city officials , said Travis , he had " paid out at least $75,000 in payola . " Travis testified that the chief of the Division of Architecture and Engineering and a former secretary had received $25,000 . Another civil servant was rewarded with a gift of $4,000 . <P> <P> The city treasurer and two other officials accepted Christmas bottles of whisky , gaily gift-wrapped in $100 bills .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
