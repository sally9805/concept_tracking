Mr. Rothenberg u working on an anthology of Indian poetry , A Summoning of the Tribes , to be published as the first issue of The Buffalo Translation Series ( University of Buffalo , New York State Council of the Arts ) . He is the author of numerous books of poems , and the editor of Technicians of the Sacred ( Doubleday-Anchor ) . He has been doing experimental translating from Navajo and Seneca on a Wenner-Gren Foundation grant . The awkwardness of presenting translations from American Indian poetry m the year 1969 is that it has become fashionable today to deny the possibility of crossing the boundaries that separate people of different races and cultures : to insist instead that black is the concern of black , red of red , and white of white . Yet the idea of translation has always been that such boundary crossing is not only possible but desirable . By its very nature , translation asserts or at least implies a concept of psychic and biological unity , weird as such assertion may seem in a time of growing dis-integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies in the face of divisive ideology . The question for the translator is not whether but how far we can translate one another . Like the poet who is his brother , he attempts to restore what has been torn apart . Any arrogance on his part would not only lead to paternalism or " colonialism " ( LeRoi Jones 's term for it from a few years back ) , it would deny the very order of translation . Only if he allows himself to be directed by the other will a common way emerge , true to both positions . To submit through translation is to begin to accept the " truths " of an other 's language . At the same time it 's a way of growing wary of the lies in one 's own , a point of vigilance that translators and poets should be particularly keyed to . I learned , for example , that the Senecas with whom I lived call the whites " younger brothers " and themselves " real people . " To understand the Seneca experience ( including where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms like these and to get to a truth about them which includes the Seneca truth . As I do , it becomes clear to me that the very nature of " Indian " and " white " ( words basic to the process I 'm describing ) is itself a question of language and translation . If the term " younger brother " would later be neutralized or come to suggest contempt , what relationship did it originally express in a culture that did n't practice primogeniture and individual ownership of land  --  in which forests and clearings ( the men were hunters , the women gardeners ) were a common ground for brothers as children of one mother and members of one clan ? Whether by birth or adoption did n't matter either : descended from a single mother ( ultimately the Earth ) , " older " and " younger " was for them a matter of precedence in time and place , their relative experience of the shared environment Thus the Senecas as older brothers recognized the rights of both to start with , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) came to the land prepared for dispossession and fratricide In the overthrow of the older ? refusing adoption to the real-personhood of the Indian way , while asserting their own great-white-fatherhood  --  they triggered a disruption of the natural ( ecological ) order that 's now making all of us its victims . A " real " person in these terms is one who has n't forgotten what and where things are in relation to the Earth . Earth-rooted , he is royal too , not by precedence of birth , but insofar as he has and shares a knowledge of the realm He has only to maintain a true eye for his surroundings and a contact with the Earth , to recognize himself as the inheritor of reality , of a more real way of life At any rate that seems to be the claim implicit in the language and confirmed by the events that have followed its denial . The issue , writes David Antin , is reality . The real person ( reality-person , in fact ) lives , like the " primitive " philosopher described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he can experience " reality at white heat . " This is a part of the tribal inheritance ( not Indian only but world-wide ) that we all lose at our peril  --  younger and older alike . Remember too how many elements are active in that situation , where we would concentrate on the words as being particularly the " poem " ( many Indian poems in fact dispense entirely with words ) : elements , I mean , like music , nonverbal phonetic sounds , dance , gesture and event , game , dream , etc. , along with all those unstated ideas and images the participants pick up from the poem 's context Each moment is charged : each is a point at which meaning is corning to surface , where nothing 's incidental but everything matters terribly Now , put all of that together and you have the makings of a high poetry and art , which only a colonialist ideology could have blinded us into labeling " primitive " or " savage " You have also the great hidden accomplishment of our older brothers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern not only to poets but to all ( red , white and black ) who want to carry the possibilities of reality and personhood into any new worlds to come The yearning to rediscover the Red Man is part of this . It acknowledges not only the cruelty of what 's happened in this place ( a negative matter of genocide and guilt ) but leads as well to the realization that " we " in a larger sense will never be whole without a recovery of the " red power " that 's been here from the beginning The true integration must begin and end with a recognition of all such powers . That means a process of translation and of mutual completion Not a brotherhood of lies this time but an affiliation based on what the older had known from the start : that we 're doomed without his tribal and matrilocal wisdom , which can be shared only among equals who have recognized a common lineage from the Earth . deleted material                @ @ @ @ @
