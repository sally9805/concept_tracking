The stage is empty , in semidarkness . Suddenly , in a huggermugger of stumbling hurry and shouted directions , a family spills out of a stairwell , dropping luggage and household possessions all over the room , and collapsing in relief . Obviously a close thing , whatever it was . The lights come up as they freeze - father , mother , daughter and Negro maid-while into the tawdry room and out through the theater comes a dreadful ululation of voices . <P> This is " The Sound , " from which they have fled their previous apartment downstairs-an apartment where , it seems , they had more rooms and possessions . But only Daughter Zenobia ( Meg Foster ) acknowledges this ; Mother and Father refuse to admit that anything has really changed . Zenobia , too , is the only one who mentions the existence of It-a silent creature , swathed in slings and bandages , who skulks along the floor , in corners and under tables , and is intermittently kicked , whipped , stabbed , slapped and kneed in the groin by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> This is the basic situation of The Empire Builders by Boris Vian , which opened off-Broadway last week as the French playwright 's first New York production , nearly a decade after his death at 39 . Vian , who was also a novelist , poet , composer , translator , jazz trumpeter and engineer , obviously owed much to the work of Franz Kafka . Ordinary , everyday characters are beset and beleaguered by fantastic circumstances beyond their control-neither exactly allegorical nor neatly symbolic - which fill them with dread . As the play progresses , The Sound drives the increasingly unsettled father into even smaller and poorer apartments . The members of the menage disappear one by one , until he is left alone with his battered , tacit adversary , known ( in the program ) as The Schmurz . What is The Schmurz-the awful awareness of one 's own death ? Is despair The Sound that drives this man into an ever-narrowing corner , where he babbles of flowers on his windowsill and dons his old uniform to fight he knows not what ? <P> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer somewhat from a lack of resolution . But the crisp , authoritative acting of Norman Rose as Father and the admirable sets by Lester Polakov that meld the eerie with the ordinary , manage to make the play most satisfactorily unsettling.
