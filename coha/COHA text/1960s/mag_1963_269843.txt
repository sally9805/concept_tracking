WHAT makes news can be either events that are fortuitous or those that are foreseeable . Each week there is a lively competition for our space between the news we can prepare for ( the museum opening , whose exhibits we can photograph in advance in color , for example ) and the disaster that catches everyone unaware . Each week the leisurely and reflective must contest with the latest and most urgent happening-and each has its adherents : without the reflective , TIME would be too much like the daily newspapers ; without the urgent , TIME would lose much of its vitality . <P> How the fortuitous and foreseeable contend can be seen in our cover story on South Viet Nam , and in this week 's Medicine section . <P> Weeks before the American Heart Association convened in Los Angeles and the American College of Surgeons gathered in San Francisco , Medicine Editor Gilbert Cant had scanned their scheduled programs and read abstracts of important papers to be delivered . He , and other medical reporters , also benefited from advance briefings in lay language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-question them . And so , from California , Cant cabled four stories-a controversy over freezing the stomach to lessen ulcer pains , the results of a remarkable Red Chinese surgical operation , the use of a pump to relieve a diseased heart , and a bowel operation to lower the blood 's content of cholesterol . These stories , edited and checked in New York , are on top of the week 's medical news-having gained from advance preparation . <P> Successful military coups , by their very nature , must come by surprise . Yet an attempt to overthrow the Diem regime in Viet Nam has been " in the wind " for months , as TIME readers know . Last September , in a five-column story , TIME discussed the dissatisfaction in the army and illustrated it with photographs of five generals and one colonel . Our top two pictures were of Generals Minh and Don , who led last week 's coup . In Saigon , TIME Correspondent Murray Gart watched the attack on Diem 's palace lying flat on his belly on a rooftop less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could expect , and the delays that military censorship might impose , Gart grabbed the first available plane from Saigon to Bangkok to file his dramatic report . <P> Senior Editor Edward Hughes , who wrote the story , had talked to a number of the generals on a ten-day trip to South Viet Nam last summer . It is his second cover story in a row . He also wrote last week 's on German Chancellor Erhard.
