txt Newark may be the next major city to have a black mayor . The election is not until next year . But the June 17 special City Council election already offers a clue to black voter strength . Newark now has a slight majority of black residents . But much of the Negro population is below voting age , and whites still have the majority of the registered ' vote . In Newark 's predominantly Negro South Ward , black leaders collected the necessary 7,500 signatures to force the first recall election under the city 's present form of government . Voters were then asked if they wanted to recall Lee Bernstein , a white , who has represented the ward for seven years . The Rev. Horace P. Sharper , pastor of the city 's Abyssinian Baptist Church who came to Newark eight years ago from South Carolina , led the recall drive , ran against Mr. Bernstein and won . There 's been Negro representation on the City Council since 1954 . But Mr. Sharper 's victory adds special momentum to the drive for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Kenneth Gibson , a Negro who has already announced his candidacy for the mayor 's chair . e Herman Badillo , fresh from a surprisingly strong showing in the New York mayoral primary , may have his gaze set on Washington . A likely goal : to become the nation 's first Puerto Rican congressman . Mr. Badillo , a reform Democrat active in the presidential campaign of Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy ; declined to seek reelection as borough president of the Bronx to seek the mayoral nomination . He finished an impressive third behind upset winner Mario A. Procaccino and former Mayor Robert F. Wagner . The congressional seat he reportedly eyes now belongs to Jacob H. Gilbert , a six-term representative who has given no indication of stepping down . Unless Mr. Badillo decides to run for mayor as an independent in November  --  and manages to win ? a stiff primary fight may be brewing for next year . Trends ... European motorists should feel right at home in Boston now . At least in two sections of Boston where the city is giving symbol-type traffic signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications of symbols used in Europe and Canada . One system indicates mandatory traffic movement by means of circled arrows . The other uses slashed arrows to indicate forbidden traffic movements . Final evaluation of the experiment wo n't come until October . But motorists have already made up their minds . A postcard questionnaire of drivers passing through the areas shows that an overwhelming majority favor symbol signs . New York City is no longer Pilgrim Rock for incoming Puerto Ricans . In the late 1940 's , 90 to 95 percent of all Puerto Rican newcomers went directly to New York . Today the figure has dwindled to less than 60 percent . Their migration has fanned out to 206 communities across the country . Direct flights to Boston , Washington , Chicago , Cleveland , Los Angeles , and San Francisco have hastened the trend . So , many - cities today have a brand-new factor  --  growing Puerto Rican communities . In Boston their population has grown from 1,200 in 1960 to an estimated total of perhaps 18,000 today .

New York 's medicaid program is under attack from two sides  --  recipients and the participating professions . One reason is the state Legislature 's austerity cutbacks that took effect July 1 . Higher eligibility standards lopped nearly one-quarter ( 200,000 ) of medicaid clients off the rolls in New York City alone . Thousands more may be dropped for failure to reregister . Those who remain in the program will receive 20 percent less money . So will the professionals who supply the care . Meanwhile , Pennsylvania hospitals are threatening to eliminate free care as a result of Gov . Raymond P. Shafer 's cutback in his state 's program for the medically indigent . The action , aimed at reducing skyrocketing . costs of the program , is expected to drop 300,000 persons from the program .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
