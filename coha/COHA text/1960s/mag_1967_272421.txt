Three months ago , nine-year-old Frank Hayes Jr . was pronounced free of leukemia following treatment with a new anti-cancer substance , L-asparaginase . Last week , in a Dallas hospital , he died . The immediate cause of death was pneumonia , brought on by a strain of bacteria that neither antibiotics nor sulfa drugs could kill . But the underlying cause was the leukemia , which prevented the boy 's natural defense mechanisms from fighting off the infection . <P> His death shattered the hope of 90-year-old John Keener Wadley , **28;14623;TOOLONG , that Frank had been cured by the enzyme ( TIME , April 14 ) . Wadley , who lost an only grandson to leukemia in 1943 , had poured more than $2,000,000 into the J.K. and Susie L. Wadley Research Institute in Dallas . But only a few weeks after Wadley 's jubilant announcement of a cure and the Hayes boy 's release from the hospital by Dr. Joseph M. Hill , leukemia cells reappeared . Frank was admitted to Bristol General Hospital , and Dr. Hill immediately resumed the daily injections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to the enzyme , but Dr. Hill reports that he was successfully desensitized , and that the treatment reduced his white-cell count from 300,000 to 33,000 , and the proportion of leukemia cells from 90% to 8% . <P> Though Frank died , L-asparaginase was shown to be a promising weapon against leukemia-but not a cure . The enzyme , which apparently starves cancer cells of nutrients that they can not manufacture themselves , is extracted at great cost-about $15,000 for a month 's treatment for an adult-from growths of common bacteria found in the human colon . Dr. Hill is still enthusiastic about the drug and will soon have an abundant supply of it for further trial . Milwaukee 's Miller Brewing Co. is closing down part of a Fort Worth brewery and donating fermentation equipment for enzyme production to Wadley 's research institute . With the brewery equipment Dr. Hill expects to increase production within the next few months by at least 100 times .
