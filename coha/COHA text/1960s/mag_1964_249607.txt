The pioneers who span commercial aviation from jenny to jet are giving way to a new generation of executives . In the last year , the presidents of three major U.S. airlines have stepped either up or out to make way for new men . United 's Pat Patterson moved up to chairman , and so did American 's C. R. Smith ; Malcolm Maclntyre left Eastern . Last week one of the greatest pioneers of them all relinquished some of the controls-although , like Smith and Patterson , he retained the post of chief executive . Just turned 65 , Juan Terry Trippe gave up the presidency of Pan American , a seat he has held zestily since he founded the airline in 1927 . <P> Moving up to the new post of chairman , Trippe picked Executive Vice President Harold E. Gray , 58 , to succeed him as president and chief operating officer . <P> Scarcely five years out of Yale ( ' 22 ) when he started his airline , Trippe nursed it with force and farsightedness . Pan Am began as a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba ; its 73,000 miles of routes now connect 85 nations , and last year 's earnings of $33.6 million on $561 million in revenues were the most ever made by any airline . Gray has been in on practically all of this growth . A member of the first group of pilots hired by Pan Am in 1929 , he was the first commercial flyer to cross the Atlantic , logged 15,000 hours before he settled behind a desk in 1944 . <P> Like Gray , the other new presidents - United 's George E. Keck , 52 , Eastern 's Floyd Hall , 48 , and American 's Marion Sadler , 53-are all operations men . So mammoth and complex has the aviation industry become that it now takes one boss just to schedule and maintain the jets and another to finance their $6,000,000 price tags and worry about the future . The time is ripe for moving in new men ; recovering from the red ink that plagued them after jets were introduced , the industry last year racked up record profits of $84 million .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
