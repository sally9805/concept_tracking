In the low hills near the French town of Eveux , 15 miles from Lyon , workmen were busy last week putting the finishing touches to what a Paris paper called one of " the celebrated ruins of the 40th century . " It is a Dominican monastery - Couvent Sainte Marie de la Tourette . <P> But it is like no monastery ever built before . Its architect : France 's famed Le Corbusier . <P> " Corbu " began " sniffing out the site , " as he puts it , in 1953 . He chose a slope to back his monastery against , propped on pillars . Then he listened and took notes while the late Dominican patron of the arts , Pere Couturier , explained the and problems of the Dominican discipline ( " Here we walk in double file . Here we prostrate ourselves " ) . For three years Corbusier and his associates worked over the plans . The result is a rugged interplay of concrete masses and angles-a top example of the architectural style that is sometimes referred to as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a terrace , seeded with grass and surrounded by a high parapet so that those on the terrace can not see the ground below but must look out toward the horizon . At first Corbusier planned to make this the cloister , where the monks walk and meditate , but abandoned the idea because " it would be so beautiful that the monks would use it for an escape , which might prove perilous to their religious life . " But he urged the Dominicans to " go up there from time to time . Let them allow you to go up as a reward for those who have been good boys . " Presumably to make it more rewarding , he has made the doors leading onto the roof exceptionally narrow . <P> The two top floors consist of 100 cells in a double row of matchboxes-one to a monk . Each is a narrow , barely furnished room of white granular cement applied with a high-pressure hose ; each is 7 ft. 5 in. high ( Corbusier 's standard human measure-the height of a man with his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its neighbor by solid concrete partitions . Monks reach their cells from the lower floors by means of a corridor with walls that grow increasingly somber as the men approach their devotional solitude . <P> But in the communal rooms below-refectory , library , oratory and classrooms - Corbusier 's creative fancies take over in a profusion of pyramids , cubes and parallelepipeds , doors in solid primary colors against the white concrete walls . Water pipes ( painted bright blue ) and electrical conduits are everywhere exposed . The building 's insides , says Corbu , are nothing to be ashamed of . <P> In the pyramid-topped oratory , the church and its curvilinear chapel ( which Corbusier calls " the rock " and the monks , despite his protests , call " the ear " ) , there are no statues . " There will be no distraction from images , " Corbu told the monks . " If you want to be good fellows and show some friendship for your poor devil of an architect , you can do it by formally refusing every gift of stained glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
