 | NEW OLDS FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE ! @# THIS fall , Oldsmobile will introduce a front whee1-drive car known under the code name Holiday . It will be the first American-built production car with front-wheel drive since the Cord , which disappeared in 1937 . It will also be the most radical piece of transportation to come out of Detroit since the Corvair . It 's currently the number one subject of arguments among car experts and buffs across the country , although Oldsmobile maintains a strictly " no-comment " attitude . Front-drive enthusiasts sad ' , Its about time Detroit admitted the advan-@#  | tages of pulling a car instead of pushing it . " European-built front-drives have been popular for years . Makers such as Citroen , Austin , Renault , German Ford , Saab , Lancia , Peugeot , and DKV will produce nearly two million front-drives in 1965 . Expensive flop ? Tradition-minded inskiers in Detroit are convinced that the Olds experiment will be an expensive flop . " Front-drive offers no real advantages on big , U.S.-style cars ? and it costs a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pros and cons , let 's take a close look at the car on paper . Our information is based on our usually reliable ? though unofficial sources . The Holiday will be competing with luxury " sporty " cars like the Thunder-@# @# bird . It will share an all-new body with the ' 66 Riviera . This is a big fastback with long , sloping hood , curved , onepiece door windows , short deck , fullwheel cutouts at the rear . The front-drive system will consist of Old 's premium engine ( 425 cu . in. , 370 hp. ) , a torque converter with a chaindrive hookup to a three-speed planetary transmission , a differential , and two open% half-shafts with constant-velocity universal joints and slip splines . Here 's how all this will be arranged in the cramped engine compartment . The engine will be located as in conventional cars , except that it will be offset to the right of center of the car . Ahead of the engine , in its normal position , is the radiator . Attached to the rear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stamped-steel housing is tacked on to the back of the torque converter . The housing extends below the torque converter and over to the left side of the car , where it is also hooked up to the transmission . This housing contains the gears and chain that make up the chain-drive system . The transmission is connected to the differential on the end opposite from the chain-drive housing . Both transmission and differential are located beside and slightly below the torque-converter combination . @#  | Delivering the power . Driving shafts extend from each side of the differential to the front wheels . But this is not as simple as it sounds . That 's because the differential delivers power to the two front wheels in two different ways , one so unusual it 's almost startling . The left front wheel is no problem . Two constant-velocity universal joints are used , one at the differential end of the shaft and one at the left front wheel . The axle shaft is not a solid piece of metal . It contains a slip spline that permits the axle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down over bumps . Routing the same type of axle to the right front wheel posed a problem , since the big engine was directly in the way . Instead of moving the engine , Olds engineers made a tunnel straight through the oil pan . The drive shaft for the right front wheel went through this tunnel . Some pre-production engines were made this way . As the oil pump was placed so far back , there seemed to be no other way to avoid aeration of the oil . Later , this problem was licked , and now the oil pan has a recess to let that shaft pass under the engine . The drive shaft is supported by a bearing on the right side of the engine . From here on , there 's the same shaft setup as on the left wheel : the slip-spline axle and two constant-velocity universal joints . OCITY NTS Because of the crush for room under the hood , it is expected that the suspension system will have coil springs located on top of the A arms . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Much more hardware is required on the front-drive system than on the front engine rear-drive setup . That 's why the 1 auto industry has gone so slow on frontdrive up to now . Those costly extra parts . Here are the extra parts you 'll have to pay for : two slip-spline axle shafts ; four constantvelocity universal joints ; silent chaindrive system ; special steering and suspension systems . The only major saving comes about from the elimination of the long , jointed drive shaft used on conventional cars . The arrangement of under-hood components will not cause any real trouble for optional-equipment parts such as airconditioning units . Olds is expected to make room for them up front , too . Price tag of the car is in the $4,500 to $5,000 range , or about the same as the  | Thunderbird . On the outside , the car is a little bigger than the T-Bird , but very close to the Riviera . Overall length will he 210 inches and wheelbase about 119 . It will weigh just about 100 pounds over the two-ton mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels do not drive the car , Olds will use a simple bar axle at the rear . The " dead ' ' , rear axle may have a " drop " in it to provide more room for rear-seat passengers and more luggage space . Pros and cons . So much for the mechanical differences . What about the arguments pro and con ? The detractors say : ? Front-drive gives poor traction , especially on hills when roads are slick . ? It causes excessive front-tire wear . @# ? It puts too much weight on front , making power steering mandati ? Its only advantage is flat fib which give more room inside ? a boon small cars , but not needed in big or ? It 's dangerous because drivers accustomed to the handling characte tics of rear-drive cars . ? The clincher : It costs too much f what you get . Front-drive advocates are vehement rejecting these criticisms : ? Test drivers with actual experience in the car say it will climb slippery hills with ease . With 60 percent of the weight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the front tires wear faster , but this is balanced by reduced wear on the rear tires . You simply rotate the tires regularly . ? Power steering would be standard . these days , on a car of the Holiday 's size and price anyway , so this requirement is no real drawback . ? That front-drive cars are dangerous is pure nonsense . Actually they 're safer . ? The cost to Olds has been estimated at about $100 more than with a similar conventional car . Driving with front-drive . The difference between front-drive and conventional drive on a typical city street or highway is almost unnoticeable . The big differences come on rough roads and during hard turning maneuvers , but drivers soon adjust . Driven front wheels have a much stronger self-centering tendency than the front wheels of a conventional car . This gives the front-drive car higher directional stability , and a front-heavy , frontdrive car is an inherent understeerer ( a handling characteristic giving greatest stability in cornering ) . On some cars . understeer is increased when power is applied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists on both front- and rear-drive cars . But when the front wheels of a reardrive car run wide , the car will ? in extreme cases ? plow straight on regardless @#  | of where the wheels are pointing . This does not happen with front-wheel drive , where front-end breakaway is a stable motion with a self-diminishing tendency . The car may be basically understeering , but it understeers less at high speeds than at low speeds , while with rear drive the situation is just the opposite . The prophets of front-wheel drive are right when they speak of extra safety in extreme conditions . Other benefits of a front-drive system show up when driving on rough roads . It gives the car better traction and stability . The increased stability shows up on rutted roads , uneven roads , and at high speeds in a strong crosswind . The front-drive keeps going in a straight line instead of lurching from side to side . Back to 1904 . America has rich traditions in front-drive cars , starting with the 1904 Christie , leading through the Millers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Checker had a front-drive taxicab in service from 1946 to 1951 ; Chrysler built an experimental front-drive model in 1956 ; Chevrolet showed the Universelle front-drive panel truck in 1958 ; and Ford has had front-drive Thunderbirds on test since 1957 . The natural question at this point is : Why is Olds bringing out this car if it is so similar in operation to a conventional car but costs so much more ? We went to the marketing boys with this one and they had a ready answer . " People want something different , " they explained , " and they will spend extra money to have it . " Look at today 's market , say the experts . Bucket seats , consoles , floor shifts , fourspeed manual transmissions ? they all cost more , and people buy them because they are different . Olds ' experiment is being closely watched by GM 's competitors ? especially Ford ? to see what the market reaction is . Ford has already made provisions to build a frontdrive Thunderbird in 1967 if the Holiday catches on . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turbine project . Oldsmobile is getting some reaction from its sister divisions in GM as well . Word around Detroit is that every other GM division except Pontiac is considering a front-drive car of its own . @#
