THE SOLDIER 'S ART by Anthony Powell . 228 pages . Little , Brown . $4.95 . <P> <P> When the time comes for the historian to get the sense of what life was like for the British between and during the two big wars , he will be better off turning to fiction than to journalism . Evelyn Waugh 's Sword of Honor trilogy will serve for a start . For a finish , he can wrap up the whole era with Anthony Powell 's incalculably brilliant series , The Music of Time . In The Soldier 's Art , the eighth novel in this marathon enterprise , * Powell , now 61 , brings his narrator hero , Nick Jenkins , into his second year of World War II . Jenkins carries on with his task of scoring for conversation the operatic ballet that keeps Powell 's 50-odd characters dancing eccentrically until war imposes its own choreography . <P> Less Blood , Much Bumf . " Awfully chic to be killed , " remarks one of them , Charles Stringham . In the first novel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , after walk-on parts in later books as a sophisticated , droll , despairing alcoholic , he appears as a wry , dry , still witty private working as a waiter in an officers ' mess at a divisional headquarters in Northern Ireland . Here , as in other scenes , the denizens of Powell 's world-upper-class intelligentsia with outposts in the City , the aristocracy and in the upper bohemia of the theater , journalism , painting and music-find their highly contoured personalities flattened into military shape . <P> At this stage , the war calls less for bloodletting than for form filling . There are no battles but plenty of bumf-British army term for paperwork . Powell 's people move through " the backwoods of this bureaucratic jungle , " and it is a novelistic miracle that he keeps their old characters vivid and alive while they are being bored to death . If not bored , embarrassed . " Embarrassed " rather than " afraid " is the word one character finds for his feeling when his bathroom is bombed . <P> <P> Rtterdmmerung . Some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house cops a packet ; the hostess goes with it , and so does Priscilla Tolland . In fact , a head count shows that six previous survivors of the Powell epic are killed off in this novel . In Powell 's war , only the rotters flourish-notably Kenneth Widmerpool , whose humorless egomania and bounderish one-upmanship have won him critical status as one of the great comic creations of modern English fiction . He is now on the make as a staff major , a virtuoso of bumf , and he chews poor Jenkins ' ear in a war of total paper . <P> The time is approaching when the instrumentalists of Powell 's Music fall silent , and what is called for is a long , critical view of Powell on his podium . That " character is fate " is a clich ; the fate of Powell 's characters is , like a capricious bomb , historical chance . There is really no sense in any of his creatures except their determination to make their folly explicit in their own words and actions . They live to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also live in the compelling echo of Powell 's funereal dance for a dead generation . <P>
