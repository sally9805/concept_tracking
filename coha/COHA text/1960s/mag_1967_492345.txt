The artist in pursuit of butterflies By Horlpert Gold /Pholoymphxhil Philippe IIal  --  wan o n the shore of Lake Geneva at Montreux , in an immense aging luxury hotel out of another time  --  all cuckoo-clock carved wood and space and silent , gliding service  --  lives Vladimir Nabokov , a 68-year-old man with a booming laugh , who loves his wife , his son , and the interior landscape of his own mind . He enjoys good wines , good food , good company , but goes to bed early , since he rises at 6 A.M. He has a passion for butterflies and spends long periods chasing up hill and down dale with net and wife . In fact , he is a distinguished lepidopterist , but he is famous for another vocation . More than a decade ago this reclusive White Russian who was then teaching literature at Cornell University , listened carefully to the speech of children on school buses , explored the spaces of America during vacation butterfly-collecting trips , marveled over the social complexities of the motel and composed an odyssey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adolescent Lolita Haze . Rejected by several American publishers , he finally sent the manuscript off to Paris . where it was published in 1955 by the Olympia Press . Admirers began importing the hook , but American editors remained skittish . " I love it . " said one of them . " It 's a great hook . Nabokov is a great writer . But 1 ca n't print it  --  you think I 'm crazy ? " Nevertheless . LoIda was finally published in the United States in 1958 , and despite a few hostile reviews . the book earned an immense critical and popular success . And for good reasons . Lolilo is a de:initive guide to American roadside culture . and also a picture of the evolving teen-ager. and a metaphor for the eternal quest for innocence , and a case history of abnormal psychology . and an exercise of comic style and picaresque form and many other things besides  --  in short . a totally original work with the rough , undefined edges and mysteries of a masterpiece . Through the curious fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household word and a movie , her author sustained an odd transmogrification . At last he is given his due as an authentic living master of the novel form , a great man of letters and also namer of the meat patties served at a San Francisco drive-in ? " Iolitaburgers . " He has made his mark at many levels . Lolila aside . Vladimir Nabokov is a unique and remarkable party . He is presently supervising the translation of his early novels from Russian into English , He is planning the publication of his collected papers in lepidopterology . His particular specialty is the classification of butterflies ; he has written 20 important articles ; be still makes field trips ; he has discovered and named several new species . As a man of many cultures , he has written eloquently about the problems of translation , and taken upon himself such duties as translation of the great Russian poet Pushkin into English and . lice in Wonderland into Russian . He moves from the creation of an immense zoo of jealous , nostalgic . obsessed , maddened wanderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in some 13 novels , in plays . in biographies , in his autobiography and his revision of his autobiography  --  toward the gradual revelation of an absolutely unique , perhaps both frightening and touching personality . Does Vladimir Nabokov live . like others , in a world he never made ? No. having suffered greatertroubles than most , he has no pity for himself . I le lives in a world he is continually remaking , " I f ravel through life in a space helmet . " he says , roaring with laughter . 1 was thinking to myself , Here I am in Europe  --  now what ? I had arrived by ship , plane , train and taxi on a hot day of Indian Summer . I checked in at that grand relic , the Montreux Palace , where Mrs. Nabokov had made a reservation for me , and decided to cool off in the pool before making contact with my friends . I was thinking . in the sight of these mountains and this lake where so many aristocratic Russians had taken the waters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally bringing his intelligence , his humor , his nostalgia , his defiance , his art and his self to this traditional spa . While leaving 35 boxes of goods with Dean 's Storage in Ithaca , N.Y . While leaving his childhood in Russia , his adolescence and early youth in Berlin and Paris , his young manhood in Cambridge t England and Massachusetts ) and his fruitful middle years in Ithaca . And yet he knows who he is . The poet is a man with a child 's needs and judgments . For Nabokov to remain a live poet . squalling and brawling . there had to be irony in his system . And steel . And Vera Nabokov watching over him . I slumped into a beach chair for a bit of friendly , cross-cultural study of the French , German and Swiss poolside mini-flirts , and suddenly there were Vera and Vladimir Nabokov , bared to the sun . in live3y conversation with some friends . Nabokov caught sight of me. seemed puzzled for a moment , and then burst into that deep . rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heavens . I was a secret agent . He had expected to meet a later train from Paris . There was jovial banter about the eight years passed since last we had met . How well I looked ! How fit ! How marvelously fit ! But then the thoughtful Nabokov swerve : " You were a bit fattish I think , last time . " One of our first occupations was for Nabokov to deny the truth of anecdotes which I had been telling about him since we had first known each other in 1958 . For example , although he recalls his dislike of Pasternak 's novel , he believes he never referred to it as " Doctor Van Clibum . " I did not check , for fear it might be denied . a conversation about a mutual friend . " Of course . " said Nabokov , " he is a very nice fellow . Of course , do not lend him any money . Of course . he is completely untalented . Of course , he is a liar and a hypocrite . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't that good you know him , he 's a very nice fellow . " But of course that was 1958 , and I am quoting from memory , and Nabokov distrusts everyone 's memory except his own . " You would like another orange squash ? " he asked now . He claims among his ancestors the first caveman who painted a mammoth , a medieval Tartar prince , a long line of German barons . an obscure Crusader , a well-known composer . the first President of the Russian Imperial Academy of Medicine , a Minister of Justice . His father was a noted liberal statesman . jurist and writer . Reading legal commentaries by his father . published over 70 years ago , he finds an eloquent denunciation of " crimes against young and tender girls by older men . " Curious , he says . Lolita , he remarks dreamily . He likes to feel he is continuing a tradition . He smiles at the thought that he is an avant-garde writer whose first work was printed more than 50 years ago . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and , in 1914 , the poet was aged 15 . His faraway childhood was rich in marvels . He learned English before he learned to read Russian . He also learned French . " 1 was a perfectly normal trilingual child . " he says . He played chess , collected butterflies . loved soccer . After inheriting about two million dollars Ca lot of money in those days " ) amt Irroniptly losing it all in 11w revolution to pet tectly ordinary thing in those days ) , he studio ! id Cambridge . England , and then wrote in Russian in Berlin and Paris . The contusion of languages ate I cult ores continued . I le received about live dollars for his translation of .1.1ree itt 11 Onflethind . I e precariously survived by teaching boxing , tennis , languages . and by making the lirst Russian crossword puzzles . He wrote plays , poetry , novels . Ile was a ( kart-time journalist , In his autobiography , Speak , Mnoo he mentions a poor disappeared Russian err , . talent , V. Sirin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars whom he found most touching . V. Sirin was the pen name of Vladimir Nabokov . There was the melodramatic shock  --  so like events in his novels  --  of his father 's murder . His father , a liberal , was killed at a meeting in Berlin by a fanatical Czarist who was aiming at someone else . Nabokov 's father had thrown himself on one of the assassins when the other pumpel bullets into him . Le fled the Nazis . He lied the Communists . He fled the embittered White Russian fanatics . He married . he had a son , he wandered the face of Europe on a sickly refugee passport . He scrambled a step ahead of pauperdom . A life of continual beginnings and new starts , exiles and comebacks , except that he has never , despite several official invitations , gone back to Russia . Arriving in the United States as Europe sank into war , he took up an academic career at Wellesley , where he taught Russian ; at Harvard , where he did research in lepidopterology ; and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on both students and colleagues and took a special delight in tormenting deans and administrators . Because he disliked department heads in particular , plus . departments in general . he was made his own private department , given his courses , and assigned a Chairman of Nabokov to take care of paper work . This was not so bad . he says with sat- . isfaction . That 's the way things ought to he . He is now permanently an American , living in Switzerland on a merely temporary basis . He may dream of Russia . the spires and summer hazes of his childhers.i. but his heart is in Ithaca or Wyoming or Columbus or someplace . He admits that he is " not emotionally involved with Indian dances or pumpkin pie on a spiritual plane , " but adds , " I am as American as April in Arizona " Nabokov 's main characteristic as a social person is a relaxed , detached affability . He likes jokes , particularly his own . He also can be impatient and sometimes brutal . A well-known writer tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love your book Lolita . " Tall , twinkling , grave Nabokov gave him a cold eye and turned on his heel . Something in the tone had displeased him . He has said , " I do n't fish . cook , dance . endorse books , sign declarations , eat oysters. get drunk , go to analysts , or take part in demonstrations . I 'm a mild old gentleman . I 'm very kind . " He telephoned mornings around nine o'clock . when his early writing was done , to make plans for our meetings that day  --  a swim . a walk , lunch . dinner . In the garden we talked about moths and butterflies . He is an expert on butterflies , not moths . he said , adding an observation ? " Did you know that the hawk moth can fly two or three hundred miles an hour ? This was discovered by an airplane pilot who found the moths outdistancing him . He thought he was perhaps standing still or flying backwards . " He is a severe judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dostoevski , Freud . Thomas Mann or Pasternak stimulated something like rage . They were interested in " ideas , " " moral judgments , " " doing good " ; they were religious or they claimed to know something or they flattered the vulgar tastes of the halfeducated arid the theory-bound . Now it seemed that his contempt for them was adulterated with a small portion of the milk of human kindness . But this did not indicate any softening of the polemical spirit . During our six days of conversation he expressed fury at mistranslation , " creative " translation , doctors , Bolsheviks , critics of America . He looked younger and stronger than in 1958 . Though he mentions neuralgia , insomnia and various other ills , he looks like a powerful middle-aged man , and his years are carried with elephantine grace . He is planning a book of studies of Joyce , Proust and other writers . He has a novel well under way , secreting it on his index cards and letting it grow . The central section is finished , he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his work . He attends to his business . There is a folk proverb which states : Behind every successful man there stands a surprised woman . Well , this is not true of Mrs. Nabokov . She is a calm , serious and protective guardian of her husband 's gifts ; and not surprised . Clearly she has always believed utterly in his genius . She writes his letters , drives his car ! he does n't drive ) , criticizes his manuscripts , arranges his business mat ters and signs hotel registers for them both ( he does not give autographs ) . There is one lifelong friend to whom he occasionally writes a postcard , He is relaxed and easy . knowing that I he way has been cleared for him . Occasionally she censors his conversation or interrupts an off-color story , but her steady regard expresses unshakable approval of her husband . Together they sometimes visit their 32-year-old son Dmitri , operatic bass and part-time racing driver , a tall , good-looking young man who has also translated some of his father 's work from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their set of suites at the Montreux Palace Hotel . They showed me an old passport photograph of Vera Nabokov with their child  --  an angelic little boy and a beautiful young woman with line eyes and strong straight nose , traveling on French papers through the perils of Hitlerian Europe . Vera Nabokov dues not like off-color jokes or jokes about Jews . She is Jewish , and one of the few social ills which seems to trouble this Russian aristocrat is racial or religious prejudice . We stroll in the garden . Nabokov still recalls , with a lopsided grin , how he arrived at the scene of his father 's murder just a few minutes after it happened . Smoke , confusion , horror . His father lay dead . An acquaintance with a flesh wound in the arm stopped him and wailed . " I was hurt too . " This event , 45 years gone now , made him rumble and hesitate as we paced on the shores of Lake Geneva . He commented on the man who showed his minor wound to a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , not insensitive , just excited . " And the murderer ? He was later employed by the Nazis , put in charge of Russian emigre affairs . One of Nabokov 's brothers was killed by the Germans in a concentration camp- He died of " inanition . " The word fascinated him ? " inanilion . " He has written about this brother in the recent revision of Speak . Memory . Nabokov 's books are melodramatic , filled with fantasies of violence and torture . He has lived with both the fantasies and the realities . Now , as they have been assimilated to his ironic , paradoxical mind . he is at peace with the demons . He almost enjoys their company . He has made his treaty with trouble , his own and history 's . Nabokov suffered all the usual childhood diseases . including the desire to write . He wanted to organize the strangeness of the world by the standards of words and classifications . poetry and arrangements of butterflies . He wanted to live by these measures and stylizations . He still makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others to see as clearly as he does . Sometimes Nabokov seems to have the quality he ascribes to Gogol : that of thoroughly planning his works after he has written and published them . But this after-the-fact reasoning is just as stubMinn as the m Wt ' ' Mal kind of development . Arad Nabokov does rail bol her to explain his work ; he know.s , and demands dial the reader know . Here is how he de . scribes the growth of a story by Gogol : " Mumble , mumble , mumble , lyrical wave , mumble , lyrical wave , mumble , lyrical wave , mumble , fantastic climax , mum , ' ble , mumble , and back into the chaos from which they all derived . " This is also the fantastic way Nabokov 's stories accumulate onto his magically shuffled index cards . And as he says of Gogol , he aims toward an appeal " to that secret depth of the human soul where the shadows of other worlds pass like the shadows of nameless and soundless ships . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appeared in English , I noticed that one " Michael Scammell " was named as the translator . Never having heard of Michael Scammell , and being familiar with Nabokov 's earnest playfulness , I decided that this was another of the master 's hoaxes . Examining the name " Scammell , " I derived a near anagram , Le Masc. which becomes Le Masque , which becomes , clearly . the Mask for Nabokov . And so I wrote to accuse him of this ghostly behavior . My suspicions were confirmed by the sweet and evasive reply from Vera Nabokov : " My husband wishes to thank you for your recent very interesting COMmunication ? . . " Epilogue to this story : It turns out that there really is a translator named Michael Scammell , though the Nabokovs did not find it necessary to disappoint me in my little " discovery . " This is an example of life turning into a Nabokov satire , Russian boxes within boxes , a phantom beckoning the pedantic friend into his hall of errors . Each day we strolled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward with a scout 's intensity to name and admire moths and butterflies . I noticed after a few days with him that I too saw butterflies everywhere . He destroyed thickheaded critics and fake scholars . He asked who else besides him supports the President 's policy in Vietnam . I told him that quite a few people do , according to the polls . With smiling generosity he tipped the waiters who brought us beer . orange squash , ice cream . He reported that one night he dreamed a scene which he then wrote down and promptly afterward saw on Swiss television . He is sure that this is not clairvoyance or telepathy or any variety of seeing into the future ; rather , it is remembering the future . Time does not move forward , tock lock Lock , like the hand of a clock , he said . We went into the Chambre de Debarras. the Room of Disorder , to see some of his stored books and materials  --  a Turkish translation of Lalita , tennis rackets , mountain-climbing equipment , Photographs and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washbasin . " You recog ? nine that ? " he asked . " I love America . " he said , " a great country . " He is opposed to racial discrimination , but otherwise , as he says . " I an-prove of everything . " lie describes the American government as one of his " lobbies . " Now we spoke again about his conception of time . which is somewhat different from anyone else 's . How to hold the instant without an object , without peopling it ? He puzzles . The problems of Time contain the other great problems . Soul , Mortality , Art . the sense of life on earth . He has entitled a section of the novel he is writing , " The Texture of Time . " Pause . He interrupts this train of thought to comment with a pleasant , mildly suffering sigh that a German television crew is coming to do him . Shake of heavy , much-imposed-upon head . Another sigh . He wonders why I do n't ask more questions . " Ask some questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nabokov character ( journalist , impertinent young fellow , poking around ) , I asked him about the movie of Lawa , Answer : He is a friend of James Mason 's , but never became a friend of Sue Lyon 's . I decided to slip into the role of another Nabokov character ( scholar , impertinent middle-aged fellow , poking around ) We spoke of clairvoyance once more . Prophecy is the wit of the fool , he says . He make it the judgment with a certain fierceness . No do is connected with his notion of simultaneity. of Nabokovian time and of the irrelevance of most human projects . Intelligence is much too important to bother with such trivial matters as predicting the future . The controversy buzzing around Nabokov 's ambiguously affable head has not been calmed , despite his fame . The novelist and critic Mary McCarthy called Pak Fire , his last novel written in English , one of the great works of the 20th century . But this strange tale of a New England scholar who may also be an exiled king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long poem . represented yet another set of Russian boxes within boxes : A satire of a pastoral epic ! A real pastoral epic ? A parody of the pedant 's habits ? A parable about exile and isolation ? The book was greeted by many of Nabokov 's admirers with the sort of disarray which greeted James Joyce 's Finnegans Wake . After we had grown accustomed to the elegant comic epic of Labia , and the and touching bumbler Pnin , and the Ironies : Ad puns and the mad , pathetic , obsessed , nosta.gic , and yet coherent monsters of so many other stories , what was this trickster genius doing in Pale Fire , what was this " crossword puzzle , " as one flustered critic called it ? Was he just putting everyone on , as some admirers insisted , or had he written . as others claimed , the ultimate novel ? And then there is his translation and commentary on the masterpiece of Russian poetry . Push-kin 's Eugene Onegin . How is it possible that his old friend , Edmund Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a quirky and even incompetent translator ? Surely their continuing bitter public controversy reads like a Nabokov novel  --  in fact , a little like Pale Fire . Who is who in this drama ? After all , it . is Nabokov who is a native Russian and Wilson who is mainly self-taught in the language . Can it be that Nabokoy , who used to help Wilson with his grammar . has somehow lost his grip on his native language . and Wilson , the scholar from New England . can lecture him about the tenses of Russian verbs ? .. But again we are in the worlds of Kinbote and John Shade . the shadowy fantasts of Pale Fire , dreaming of " Zambia , a distant northern land . " where truth is really truth and reality can be defined . May I now attempt a partial summary of the character and gifts of this triumphantly lonely spirit ? ( . Forgive inc. friend far away in Maafri Us , if l sound 11J , ' Ili/ ( moth ' I aril ? ' Ifni Plf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as sure as my real name is v. Sinn , Or rather , his answer would Ix ' : ttM ) listi , like a German TV crew . like a moralist or a censor . like a hue believer or a false believer . Nererlin.less .. ? Humor , an organized lift . and steady service by his brain help Nabokov to keep his mysteries , his reserve , his private turf . If he does n't understand the meaning of human life  --  most men do n't  - -  he at least knows what sort of map he has to the unknown country , and keeps in good repair his equipment for exploration and his sense of the treasure to be sought . " I travel through life in a space helmet , " He does not get too close to earth ; he does not judge or interpret a world . Rather , he finds and makes his own world , and makes himself the compassionate , ironic , horrified master in this made-up universe . He is absolutely self-confident . After navigating odder and harder paths than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten straight with himself . He has no need to fear putting on the wrong mask . He always has the right mask for himself and for others . Embarrassment exists only in the past , though the past endures . " I would like to say something about time . The past is gone , the future is not here yet , and the present is slipping away at every instant  --  what is Time ? " The gravity in his face is rare ; he is allowing a part of the iceberg of his real thought to come to the surface . Once more he begins to speak of a dream in which he remembered something that had not yet occurred ; he does not call it prediction , but memory of the future . This is not a joke to him , He notes that the blank abyss on one side of our lives  - -  death  --  seems to frighten us more than the equally blank emptiness on the other side . when the world was there without us and the baby carriage sat empty in the photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nabokov is deeply suspicious of the human possibility of goodness . Discussion of it quickly becomes , he intimates , " poshlosty . " " Poshlusl " is a Russian word which he defines as " vile vulgarity . " ) He has no illusions . He has built his spaceship , and he travels through life protected by it . secure in the knowledge that when he walks out of it into space . he can walk back , and if he can not , well , that was an amusing risk he was taking . Only an " s , " as he says , makes the difference between " cosmic " and " comic . " Near the hour of good-byes we spoke about the future of this man who has lived in hotels or taken rented lodgings ever since the Russian revolution . He insists on his American character despite his grand exile , like a Russian aristocrat 's , in Switzerland . He would like to live in Boston . New York or California . But his wife does n't like the Boston weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and California is very far away , though there are some good butterflies nearby . And their son is studying music again in Milan . And so , while waiting to find a permanent home , this odd genius camps out in a hotel in Niontreux. with boxes stored in Ithaca , with relics spread all over the world , writing on his index cards , planning out his terrible plans , secreting his criticisms . polemics , poems , stories , novels , autobiography . To our great good fortune he both explains and conceals himself with great skill . So let us not examine him or his life too closely ; perhaps we should even avoid the flood of dissertations which will soon engulf his privacy . Just ride with the rhythm of his spirit . Let it glow . As a farewell gift , Vera Nabokov gave me the bulletin of the Anti-Vivisection League . Certain passages were underlined . I am sure there was a reason for this , but I lost it on the plane from Geneva . Switzerland , to Cleveland , Ohio . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
