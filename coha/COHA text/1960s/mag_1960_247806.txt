During a strike in Le Havre in 1926 , a 16-year-old French Communist roughneck named Roger Riou battled cops in the streets . Thrown into reform school , seemingly incorrigible , he soon taught the Marxist gospel to 100 other inmates and then led them in an unsuccessful attempt to escape . That episode landed him in solitary confinement , manacled wrist and ankle . Last week , on Haiti 's Ile de la Tortue ( Turtle Island ) , Roger Riou was no longer fighting cops . Instead , he was ministering to the people 's spiritual needs and physical ailments . The ex-kid brawler is now a Roman Catholic priest as well as a physician . <P> Marx v. Machetes . Roger Riou 's father , a chef on the liner Ile de France , was a rabid Communist , his mother also a dedicated Red . So thoroughly did they train their child that Roger was selling the Communist newspaper L'Humanit on sidewalks at the age of nine . At twelve , he was militating in a Communist youth gang , apparently convinced on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the long hours of his stretch in solitary at reform school Roger began to doubt Red doctrine . Later , the sympathetic director of the school persuaded him that he could do more for humanity by becoming a priest than by passing out Communist pamphlets . <P> Appointed pastor of Ile de la Tortue in 1947 , Father Riou saw that the island 's 12,000 inhabitants , living six miles from the mainland , had not even the barest medical facilities . On arrival he came across a peasant woman who , having given birth to twins , was cutting the umbilical cords with a machete . Riou opened a crude dispensary and was immediately swamped . He built a room with 15 floor mats on which the sick could lie . After returning to France for a fourth year of medical school to complete the training he had received as an army medic , Riou went back to Haiti and built a second hospital room . Since then , he has constructed wards for 70 patients , a 40-bed TB sanatorium , a mental ward , a maternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist 's chair where he pulls teeth . <P> Sitting atop the 1,000-ft. hump that gives the island its name , Father Riou 's Notre Dame des Palmistes mission hospital treats 9,000 patients each year for TB , leprosy , venereal disease and a catalogue of other ills . So many come from the mainland to be treated that an outpatient hostelry is being built for them . <P> Riou 's staff is a French husband and wife doctor team , seven Swiss missionary nurses and ten Haitian nurses . The hospital spends $1,000 a month , half from donations , half from patients who can pay ( those who can not are treated anyway ) . Its beds are always filled ; 60 outpatients are treated daily , and there is a waiting line . <P>
