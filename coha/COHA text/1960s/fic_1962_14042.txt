Apartment 4-B , 44 West 53rd Street , New York , N.Y . Sunday , August 10 , 1958. 11:00 A.M. The room we see as the curtain rises no longer exists . The space it once occupied is now part of a tiered parking structure for transient cars , the owner having found that housing automobiles is better business that housing people . But in 1958 , this place was inhabited by Virginia Karger and Herbert H. Lundquist , who paid a rental of $85.00 a month for the spacious room with its kitchen , bathroom , dressing room , and closets . There is a small upright piano , painted blue . The room is in artificial darkness . Bright , decorative slivers of sunlight fall in through the spaces between the drawn blinds and the casements . The subdued sound of the popular Italian recording , " Volare , " emanates from the radio in the apartment below . It is possible to distinguish the presence of two figures in ( or on ) the bed . We see that one of the figures is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alarm clock goes off . It is not one of those friendly ones , and sounds like a muffled fire alarm . VIRGINIA KARGER ( Through the ring . ) Oh , no ! ( She groans and sighs as she rolls over . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Softly . ) Get that , babe , huh ? p. 3 VIRGINIA KARGER Hmm ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Sharply . ) Get that ! VIRGINIA KARGER ( Sitting up . ) Your side . ( She lies back . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST No . VIRGINIA KARGER Is n't it ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST No ! ( He buries his head in the bedclothes . The ring continues . Ginny sits up , reaching for the clock on her side , realizes that it is his clock ringing . She slides off the foot of the bed and makes her way around to his side , finds the clock , and shuts it off . As she does so , the alarm clock on her side of the bed goes off . In an attempt to reach it quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herb . She shuts it off . ) What the hell are you  --  ? VIRGINIA KARGER It was your side . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST What ? VIRGINIA KARGER The first one . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I know . ( Ginny puts on her slippers and moves sleepily into the dressing room , turning on the radio as she goes .

He finds a cigarette , lights it , and inhales deeply . ) THE REGAL TRIO ( Singing . ) " It 's smooth as silk ! As good as mother 's milk !

" The blending'sHappy endingsYou see ! " ( Herb finally gains control , puts out the cigarette , and swings out of bed . He puts on a red , cotton dressing gown and pads over to the window . The coughing subsides . He is an attractive young man of about thirty , especially masculine . The radio continues. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New York City and vicinity .

( Herb snaps the window shade up , flooding the room with light . We are immediately impressed by coziness of the room . Size , shape , colors , and appointments have been blended by a skillful and tasteful homemaker ( Ginny ) to achieve an astonishingly pleasant effect . People like to come here , and usually stay longer than they had planned . A comfortable place , possessing in extra measure the elusive quality called " atmosphere . " On the walls , instead of paintings , there are five photographic blowups : an enormous profile of Ginny , a leg , a hand , two eyes , two lips , a mask .

He goes over and raises the remaining window shade . More light . He picks up the foot of the bed and in a single motion converts it into a capacious daybed . The bedroom has become a sitting room . Herb goes to the entrance door , unlocks it , opens it , bends down , and picks up the enormous Sunday papers ( Times and Tribune ) . He closes the door , goes to the sofa and sits down where he searches through both papers until he finds the Drama Sections . He gathers the remaining papers into an untidy bundle , carries it across the room , and stuffs it into the wastebasket . Ginny comes back in . In the light we see that she is a head-turner , a dazzling ornament , a welcome creature . She carries a tray which is loaded with the beginnings of breakfast . Two glasses of orange juice , two bowls of cereal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . But before we notice any of this , we notice that she is wearing a shimmering , revealing , two-piece , red bikini .

She resumes her-exercises . ) VIRGINIA KARGER Hon ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( He knows what is coming . ) Any good books lately ? VIRGINIA KARGER It would n't kill you to ask me . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Ask you what ? VIRGINIA KARGER To get married . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST So you can have the pleasure of saying no ? VIRGINIA KARGER So I can have that one little pleasure . ( He stops exercising , rises slowly , and stands over her . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Ginny ? VIRGINIA KARGER ( Exercising . ) Yes ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Will you marry me ? VIRGINIA KARGER ( She leaps to her feet . ) Yes ! ( She kisses him emphatically . He is staggered . He drags himself to the side-board . ) What are you thinking ? p. 30 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I 'm just trying to decide if to cut my throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small one . Nothing gaudy . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Right . Where 's your pocketbook ? ( She laughs , lies down , and resumes her exercises . ) VIRGINIA KARGER Do you think that makes it official  --  that 's not what I mean  --  legal ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST There 's not a court in the land would convict me . VIRGINIA KARGER But ethically . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST What the hell started all this ? ( She turns to lie on her side , counting foot-lifts . ) VIRGINIA KARGER Those fortune cookies tonight . Mine said : " Marry in haste . " And yours was : " A rolling stone gathers no moss . " HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Lying down again . ) Who needs moss ? VIRGINIA KARGER It 's uncanny . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Exercising . ) It 's unhealthy . Fortune cookies . Worst thing in the world for you . VIRGINIA KARGER I guess these were . ( She stops exercising and lies still . She puts her forearm across her eyes . Herb becomes aware of her inactivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves to a position beside her. ) p. 31 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Hey ! VIRGINIA KARGER Forget it . I started the whole thing , kidding . You know . A joke . But I must have thought it might catch on . Or that you 'd  --  I guess the joke 's on  --  ( She stops as her voice catches in her throat . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( In his most placating tone . ) Look , sugar  --  ( She sits up . ) VIRGINIA KARGER Herb , it 's all been more than I 'll ever be able to  --  HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Been ? What is this ? Are you trying to  --  ? ( And his voice catches . She stands and moves to the window . ) VIRGINIA KARGER Something 's come up . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Looking at her intently . ) If you do n't fill me in here , kiddo , my whole Moo Goo Gai Pan 's going to come up . ( He glances at her middle . She catches him doing so . ) VIRGINIA KARGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST How do you know what I think ? p. 32 VIRGINIA KARGER Someone wants to marry me . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Who ? VIRGINIA KARGER A man . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Oh , thanks . I thought it might be a horse . What 's his name ? VIRGINIA KARGER Arthur Murchison . Very much and right away . ( Herb is stunned . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST He 's an old man ! VIRGINIA KARGER Fifty-seven . You call that old ? ( She crosses the room to the bed table and winds the alarm clock . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Considering it 's about two-and-a-half times your age  --  yes ! VIRGINIA KARGER Maybe it means I 'm young , not he 's old . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Unable to follow . ) What ? VIRGINIA KARGER Never mind . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Okay  --  but before we never mind  --  . Wow !

HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST That uncle routine he 's been doing with you  --  and you , too . VIRGINIA KARGER Me , too , what ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Playing it so cool . Giving me the wool he 's just some sweet old foxy grampa . Foxy is right ! ( He stands . ) How long you been juggling the two of us , anyway ? ( She slams down the clock and slaps him , stingingly . He grabs her and holds her in a powerful embrace for some time . ) You will admit , though , that the age thing ought to be considered , at least ? VIRGINIA KARGER ( Moving out of the embrace and away from him . ) Well , the younger ones do n't want to , much . What is it ? They scared it 'll tie them down or hold them back or what ? Take you . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Me ? VIRGINIA KARGER What 's your excuse ? HERBERT H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even seem to  --  VIRGINIA KARGER No . It 's I 'm not enough . I 'm okay but not perfect . And you think you can do better . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST That 's not it . Locking it up  --  the forever bit  --  it 's what a responsibility . Frightening . p. 34 VIRGINIA KARGER Nobody wants it any more  --  responsibility . Everybody wants to pass the buck . You want the human race to die out ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I just want to make sure I do n't die out . Murchison . Why all of a sudden ? Why today ? ( She rolls up the mats and replaces them . ) VIRGINIA KARGER It 's four years now  --  over  --  since his wife died and he really needs someone . That 's another thing . You do n't need .

But I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. LUNDQUIST There 's one we both seem to have missed . VIRGINIA KARGER Like ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Topic A ? VIRGINIA KARGER ( Coolly . ) Those things work themselves out . ( Her tone makes it clear that there is to be no further discussion on this point . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST You 're going to make yourself a big mistake , honey . VIRGINIA KARGER You want to know what I think is life ? One long string of mistakes . That you erase and go again . ( She sits in the armchair. ) p. 35 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Give me one reason why . Intelligent reason . VIRGINIA KARGER Because I 'm getting jumpy . I always was sure I could make it big  --  on my own . But I 'm beginning to wonder . I could use some help . It 's a rough ride . And every single day , a brand-new batch of chickies turn up  --  all ready for picking . So we do n't want to get left on the tree , the rest of us . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERBERT H.

LUNDQUIST And if you do n't ? VIRGINIA KARGER I will ! Intention . Like my gold baton when that was important to me ? I just made up my mind to be the best . ( She goes to the baton atop the piano , picks it up , and brings it down as she continues . ) Intention . And I won the whole Long Island competition . Eight hundred and seventy-nine contestants after one gold baton . Eight hundred and seventy-nine ! And notice who 's got it , do n't you ? That 's why I keep it where I can always see it . To remind me . Whenever I forget , or feel like I 'm losing my confidence , I give it a twirl . ( She does so , and puts it back . ) I did this , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About Arthur Murchison .

LUNDQUIST This whole place , falling apart . Like an earthquake . ( She is silent . He rises and turns out the light . He comes to the side of the bed . ) I get the feeling this is the last time forever . ( He gets into bed . She moves into his arms in their practiced ritual . ) God , Ginny . VIRGINIA KARGER I 'm sorry I slugged you that time . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Slapped . Not slugged . VIRGINIA KARGER No , it was slugged . Tonight was slapped . I 'm sorry for that , too . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Well , one slug and one slap in five months , that 's not so bad . VIRGINIA KARGER Five months . It seemed like five years . HERBERT H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference ? It was great , was n't it ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Pause . ) I may give up smoking at that . ( He reaches for a cigarette , lights it , inhales , and begins to cough again .

Lucy sits slumped in a chair . She is out . Seymour sits cross-legged on the floor reading an enormous book . Also present is Calvin C. Lundquist , Herb 's brother . He is three years Herb 's senior , looks remarkably like Herb , but possesses a far more thoughtful temperament . A mock wedding is in progress . Since the guests are theatre professionals , the jape is performed expertly . Only Herb and Cal do not take part , but sit observing . Jim ( the mock minister ) stands center , back to the audience , wearing an improvised cassock . Rex ( the mock organist ) sits at the piano and simulates the sound of an organ . The music is Mendelssohn 's wedding march . Maggie is helping Drina make up to look like Ginny . A curtain is placed over her head as a bridal veil .

They begin to swing it . It gets wild . To this music , Sam comes in .

Now and then his knees buckle and he begins to sink to the floor . Jim and Marty prop him up . ) JIM SIBLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be  --  SAM DILL Yeah  --  you bet !

No. this is Cal , his brother . Can I help you ? Wait a second . ( To Herb . ) Some woman . Insists . p. 40 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( He starts for the phone . ) Get the door , Jim .

Drina , in tears , stands near the piano until Jim returns and leads her out . A bell of an end to a good party . Herb comes in . He is pale . He pours himself a drink . ) CALVIN LUNDQUIST I would n't do that if I were you . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Are n't you glad you 're not ? ( A moment . ) CALVIN LUNDQUIST What happened ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST He dropped dead , that 's all . What 's so great about that ? Or so unusual ? You will one of these days  --  and so will I.

( Herb takes his hands away , and moves into the room . Ginny turns to him , tentatively . ) Herb ? ( He turns to face her , As be does so , she falls into his arms and lets it go at last . It is a shattering crackup , agonizing to see , impossible to handle . Her body goes limp with exhaustion as the sobs wrack her . Herb gets her into a chair , and tries to quiet her . He goes out and returns quickly with a damp washcloth and a dry towel . He treats her . He has also brought a small pill bottle . He gets out two pills and tries to get her to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What is it ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Nothing . Here .

VIRGINIA KARGER ( Absently . ) Sure , ( He goes to the electric coffeepot and turns it on . She pulls herself together , rises and goes about the room , cleaning ashtrays and putting glasses away . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Your Aunt Mae called . VIRGINIA KARGER Oh . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST You want me to get her for you ? p. 46 VIRGINIA KARGER Later . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Do n't be alone with it . ( She looks up at him . ) Share it up . ( She shakes her head . ) If not me , then somebody  --  or your aunt  --  VIRGINIA KARGER I ca n't . I could n't . ( The coffee boils . Herb pours a cup . Ginny moves about , catches sight of herself in a mirror , and stops . ) God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . ( Herb brings her the coffee . She is too distraught to take it . He places it on the piano . ) Did n't I leave a bag here ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Two . VIRGINIA KARGER I 'm going to get dressed .

( He looks at Lucy . ) Why do n't I get her out of here and come back ? VIRGINIA KARGER All right . ( He starts to put on his jacket . Ginny rushes in from the dressing room and throws her arms around him . ) No ! p. 47 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST What ? VIRGINIA KARGER You wo n't come back . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Sure I will . VIRGINIA KARGER ( Tensely . ) Let me tell you now . I have to . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Go ahead . VIRGINIA KARGER I know you never believed me about nothing between him and me , but  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there  --  to Atlantic City  --  the Shelburne  --  and it was beyond everything  --  not only the place itself  --  but the way he 'd done the arrangements . Flowers and flowers and in the bedrooms and dressing rooms  --  clothes and anything anyone could need or want  --  and our bags had n't even come up yet . These were things he 'd had sent down , I suppose . So we bathed and changed and went down and the car took us to this little South Sea place for dinner  --  all ordered in advance  --  and we had this fantastic rum drink  --  and it was perfect food , and we danced and laughed quite a lot , and when we got back to the hotel , a maid and a valet had been in and unpacked and arranged the place . So I said , " Ten minutes ? " and he said , " Fine , " And we went off and got into our night things and when I came back , he was out on the terrace , wearing a robe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sort of double chaise-lounge . He put his arm around me and took my hand and we stayed like that , close together , for about  --  who knows ? It was a whole lifetime . ( She stops , and looks at Herb . ) Thank you . p. 48 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST What for ? VIRGINIA KARGER For listening  --  maybe that 's the best anybody can do for anybody . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Maybe . ( From this point on , her narrative is accelerated in pace , as the story pours out . ) VIRGINIA KARGER So then he said , " I love you . " And I said , " I 'm glad . " I wanted to say the other  --  what I was supposed to , and I tried but I could n't because I got the feeling that one lie would spoil everything . But he looked at me as if to say it was all right . And some more time passed and I said , " Why do n't we go in ? " and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into my bedroom  --  there were two  --  and I fixed the lights the way I thought they ought to be and I took off my things and got into bed . And he came over and sat down beside me and touched me and he said  --  I ca n't remember the words exactly  --  but it was about how he believed in us together and that he knew there might be problems but how if we could think of it all at once  --  like a whole life together  --  it would give us the patience we were going to need . ( There is a long pause . ) Then he took me . And it was more wonderful than anything I 've ever known . Or imagined . Or thought could be . And I wanted to tell him that , but I was afraid he might think I was just  --  and anyway , he must have known . We were probaby both surprised  --  and so happy , that before either of us knew what was happening  --  we were happening again . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace  --  a minute or forever  --  he said , " How do you feel ? " And I said , " Like I 've just been born . " Because that was exactly how I did feel . And he asked me if I wanted anything and I said a cigarette and he got it for me and lit it even though he does n't smoke . ( She frowns , hard and sharply , as though stabbed by pain , and corrects herself . ) Did n't . And then we went to sleep . ( She rests for a moment against the piano . Herb lights a cigarette and gives it to her . ) I do n't know if I can tell the rest of it . ( The quality of her voice changes as she continues . ) When I woke I remember feeling sort of confused . I could n't think for a moment where I was  --  so I got up and walked around . And he was lying there . Sleeping . At least , I thought he was . But when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We smiled at each other and I sat down next to him and he said , " Wife . " His voice sounded peculiar  --  faraway . He took my hand and it felt like he was trying to press it but could n't . Then he began to breathe too hard and I got worried and I got up , but I could n't get to the phone because he was still holding onto my hand and he seemed to be trying to say something else and I leaned over and he said , " I love you . " When he let me go  --  I phoned down for the doctor and went back around to him and I thought  --  but I could n't be sure  --  and  --  ( She begins to cry . Herb watches her . She goes on as best she can . ) His eyes were still open and he seemed to be smiling but he was so still and I did n't know what to do  --  to touch him or feel his heart or not or what  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And after a while , he told me and called my aunt and put me in the car and  --  ( She tries to collect herself . ) I wish I could stop shaking . ( She gets a Kleenex and blows her nose . ) How 'd my aunt sound ? p. 49 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Hysterical . VIRGINIA KARGER Let 's have some coffee . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Sure . VIRGINIA KARGER ( She squints and shakes her head . ) I seem to be going out . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST That 's the idea . VIRGINIA KARGER You want some ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Sure , I 've only had twenty-eight cups today . VIRGINIA KARGER You 'll ruin your heart . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST What ruins your heart is bad notices  --  and no love . Sit down . ( He indicates Lucy . ) I 'll get her out of the way . VIRGINIA KARGER ( Startled . ) Has she been there all this time ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I hope so . VIRGINIA KARGER Is it something with you and her ? HERBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VIRGINIA KARGER But she is n't living here or anything like  --  HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST No , no .

Wait a second . ( He finishes making the bed and returns to her . ) Come on . VIRGINIA KARGER ( Drowsily . ) What ? Where ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Bed . VIRGINIA KARGER No .

MIKE AMIDON She 's got enough talent to make it on talent alone  --  without putting out . Do n't tell her . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I wo n't . MIKE AMIDON They 're not all talented . ( He drops his voice . ) The other one here  --  Vanessa Carr  --  you like her name ? I made it up . She 's got nothing . Looks , style , gall  --  but that 's about it . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST How come you signed her , then ? MIKE AMIDON Me ? That 's the front office . That 's how much they know about pictures  --  they 're still signing handsome he s and beautiful shes . Every year a new crop . Nothing happens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominator . You want to hear some big stars ? I mean big . I mean you put their names up and wham ! Movie history .

So , so far I 'm ahead . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST You said dames . That 's why . MIKE AMIDON No , I mean here in L.A. HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Oh . MIKE AMIDON How long you lived up there in Frisco ?

Keep the mood and the look and rock ' em . Could this be a title ? Listen . " Wild Party . " ( He enters it in his notebook . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I 'm going to take my money and run . MIKE AMIDON You call ten thousand dollars money ? p. 58 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I call a quarter money . MIKE AMIDON Ten thousand dollars would n't buy you a membership in the Bel-Air Country Club .

MIKE AMIDON ( Indicating the upstairs area . ) That little one ? Help yourself . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I have n't seen the other one yet . MIKE AMIDON The other one 's mine . This week , anyway . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Oh . MIKE AMIDON But we 're not going to fight over a couple of stock girls . That 's for sure . We 've got fifteen on the lot . Maybe twenty . Stock girls . The greatest invention since sound . Deductible gash . ( Ginny appears on the balcony during the end of his speech. ) p. 59 VIRGINIA KARGER Hey , watch your language . ( She comes down , followed by Sue , who has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on at all times and moves with assurance . The softness is gone and a brittle attitude is beginning to set . Herb recognizes her instantly and is thrown . ) MIKE AMIDON Just getting up ? VIRGINIA KARGER I had a seven-thirty call this morning . One more hat-check girl and I start tearing the hats . ( She reaches him . They embrace . ) MIKE AMIDON ( Introducing . ) Miss Carr , Mr. Lundquist . ( Ginny is at the bar , her back to the room . ) VIRGINIA KARGER ( Cordially . ) I used to know a fellow named Lund  --  ( She turns and stops speaking as she sees Herb for the first time . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Supplying the rest of his name. )  --  quist ? I know thousands . They 're all building superintendents . VIRGINIA KARGER ( Moving to him and shaking hands . ) What do you do ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I 'm a genius . p. 60 VIRGINIA KARGER Really ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Indicating Mike . ) That 's what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trying to get ' em to sign . SUE STEWART You 're the third genius I 've met . You want to hear my other two so far ? William Faulkner and Louis Armstrong . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST A good team . VIRGINIA KARGER Sign him for what ? MIKE AMIDON He made this little documentary about Frisco . San Francisco ? I caught it by mistake at the festival up there . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( To Mike , smiling . ) Mistake ? It took me eight months to make it . VIRGINIA KARGER ( To Mike . ) What do you mean made it ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Made it up . MIKE AMIDON He 's a picture maker . Like they do n't have around here any more . Like they used to . We 're going to take his little picture and blow it up . In fact , I 've got Charlie knocking out a few test scenes already . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Who 's Charlie ? p. 61 MIKE AMIDON Oh ? Did n't I tell you ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks at Herb . ) You think ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Why not ? MIKE AMIDON ( To Ginny . ) Do n't make those goo-goos at me , honey . He 's the one in charge . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST If . SUE STEWART If what ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST If I decide to ruin it . VIRGINIA KARGER Why would you want to do that ? MIKE AMIDON Because there 's no market for class stuff . Art houses . Peanuts . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I should n't have come down here . My brother told me not to . VIRGINIA KARGER Why did you ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Well , I was curious . ( He indicates Mike . ) And this guy 's the world 's greatest salesman . A genius . SUE STEWART ( Delighted . ) That makes four ! p. 62 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST He kept telling me about the milk and honey  --  fortified milk and homogenized honey . And the streets paved with gold . ( To Mike . ) Or did you say Goldwyn ? MIKE AMIDON Look around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMIDON So ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST But my brother said , " Do n't think you 're going to go where malaria is and not get it . " SUE STEWART ( Vaguely . ) Malaria ? VIRGINIA KARGER What did he mean ? MIKE AMIDON He meant that it 's hard to hang around here without getting seduced . SUE STEWART But that 's only for girls ! MIKE AMIDON ( To Herb . ) Can you stick around a while ? Otherwise , we 'll meet at Romanoff 's around eight and go from there . SUE STEWART Where ? MIKE AMIDON ( Mixing two drinks . ) I 'm running Herb 's picture for a few people . SUE STEWART Can we come ? MIKE AMIDON ( To Herb . ) Can they ? p. 63 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Looking at Ginny . ) Why not ? MIKE AMIDON I 'll have my wife , and he 's with Miss R. Get a couple of stock boys to take you . SUE STEWART Romanoff 's ? MIKE AMIDON ( To Sue . ) No . You go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KARGER I 'm busy . MIKE AMIDON Doing what ? VIRGINIA KARGER Worrying . MIKE AMIDON Come on . You 'll enjoy it . VIRGINIA KARGER I enjoy worrying . MIKE AMIDON Maybe you can help me land this fish . VIRGINIA KARGER What if I do n't like it ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST You will . SUE STEWART What 's it about , anyhow ? ( Herb answers her question . He addresses her and only her throughout the following . He moves about , pours himself a drink , drinks it , and eats some nuts  --  always focusing on her as though the other two were not in the room . But we sense that he is really talking to his old friend , Ginny . She listens , never touching her drink . Mike does not listen at all , but occupies himself with Ginny : taking her hand , kissing her neck , breathing her in  --  unaware that she is oblivious to his attentions. ) p. 64 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I 'll tell you . It 's about now and about what 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I do n't know what to do about it . It 's just the questions but I think the questions are more important than the answers . Take your question . " What 's it about ? " You asked it and that 's important . Because you want to know . ( He points to Mike . ) He never asked me and he 's the boss . It 's about now and the sickness of now . Is n't it strange the same sickness should be all over the world at the same time ? A kind of sick-of-it sickness . Me , I saw it in San Francisco . I was living with my brother . And I saw it and I thought , I 'd better take some pictures of this . So I did . Stills . They were good , but not good enough . So I got a Bell &amp; Howell thirty-five and learned to operate it and kept going and it got to be a movie , they tell me . It 's about how I see it . What I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what makes me mad . It 's slanted a little . You know what I mean ? Prejudiced . It 's about making love and making hate . And it 's about lies  --  the ones we get to swallow every day . But mostly it 's about time and growing older and growing younger . And using time . Using days . Even minutes . That 's why it 's all about one day and about getting up in the morning and how different people feel about that . It 's about having something to do  --  and it shows how life is not what you have , but what you do . I guess I better say that again , huh ? Life is what you do  --  not what you have . Got that ? ( Sue nods . ) And about eating and drinking and breathing . And even more  --  seeing and hearing . It 's a day . Some people live a whole lifetime in a day and there are others who do n't even live a day in a lifetime . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , be looks at the gold baton . ) And what it is n't about is winning  --  or losing . It is n't about death and what comes after . It 's only about what comes now . What happens now  --  here . And what could happen if we could get ourselves on the track . It 's about what 's worth it and what is n't . And one of the questions is : Is it sad to grow older or is it beautiful ? p. 65 SUE STEWART ( Wide-eyed . ) I do n't know . ( Mike gets up . ) MIKE AMIDON Excuse me . ( A pause . ) Us . ( He goes up the stairs . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Have you noticed how some grow old and some grow up ? Why is that ? As Mr. Picasso says : " It takes a long time to become young . " SUE STEWART He speaks English ? MIKE AMIDON ( From the top of the stairs . ) Vanessa ? ( Mike goes into the upper hallway . Ginny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about the main communication of all . What it is we tell each other when we make what we call love . It is n't always love . But what two people do to each other , with each other  --  for . Why and how . Yes and now . But right there is where the most is said and understood . It 's the top of life  --  or should be  --  and is n't it interesting that it takes two ? SUE STEWART ( Gravely . ) It certainly does . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST And when you see it , you 'll probably see a hell of a lot more . That 's what it 's about to me . To you it might be about something else entirely , and that 's all right too . ( A pause . ) Does that answer your questions ? p. 66 SUE STEWART Did you say this was a short ? ( Herb and Ginny exchange a long look . Ginny rises and goes up the stairs , defiantly . Sue scampers to the front door and puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she starts up the stairs , but she quickly disappears down the hallway . He turns back into the room . Coming to the sofa . ) You want to see something keen ? ( She turns the dial on the light switch . The lights in the room begin to fade . ) You ever see anything like it ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Yes . SUE STEWART I mean in a private residence ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Is that what this is ? ( She twists the lights up to full . The room is too brightly lit . ) Hey ! ( She turns them down in bounces , teasingly . ) SUE STEWART Better ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Yes . ( Another bounce down . ) SUE STEWART Say when . ( The lights continue to bounce down , until they are out  --  with the exception of three lamps . Atmosphere . ) This is my best light , right here , Know why ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST No . Why ? p. 67 SUE STEWART Because I 'm lit ! ( She laughs , delightedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moulding which is focused on her . ) It 's one of those usually for pictures  --  I mean painted pictures . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( It escapes him . ) Oh , Jesus . SUE STEWART You want an aspirin ? ( Herb shakes his head . ) What 's that you 're drinking ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Not enough . ( Sue giggles . ) SUE STEWART Want to see another trick we 've got ? ( She touches a button and music  --  stereo hi-fi  --  fills the room . It is mood music , the sound track of a recent film . ) Uh-uh . That again . ( She indicates the upstairs area . ) It 's from one of his pictures . He loves it . I hate all that schmaltzy stuff . So does Vanessa . I 'm for progressive . Are you ? ( Herb nods , absently . A Shorty Rogers recording comes on , pulsating , fresh , modern melodic jazz . ) Wow ! Goose pimples . ( She rises to her knees , leans to him and kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That goes with it . ( She sits back again . ) Mr. Lund-quist ? p. 68 HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Yes ? SUE STEWART All right to call you Herb ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Sure . SUE STEWART I mean , as long as we 're going to be friends . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Are we ? SUE STEWART Are n't we ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST I do n't know . SUE STEWART Well , if Mike wants you  --  and he usually gets his way , I found out . Why is that ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Because he 's rich and powerful . SUE STEWART Well , powerful anyway . He keeps saying he 's not rich on account of all those taxes they have . ( The record changes to a rhythmic number . ) Oh , get this ! ( They listen for a moment , during which she undulates charmingly . She gets up and holds out her arms . ) Would you care to dance with me ? ( Selling . ) I 'm good . They 're always telling me I make men feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUNDQUIST A great gift . SUE STEWART Want to see me dance by myself ? ( Herb has not heard her . He goes to the bar and fixes himself a drink . Sue kicks off her shoes and dances a few steps in time to the music . Slowly , she removes her skirt revealing beneath dancer 's lights . She drapes it gracefully across Herb 's knee as he sits at the bar watching her . Now she begins to dance in earnest . She dances superbly . Her partially improvised routine is full of feeling for the joy of life and indicative of a cornucopia of sweet passion . It is inviting without being teasing . It is performed brilliantly . A full dance . Herb 's attention is caught . Then his admiration . He watches in wonder . The dance is ritual . At its climax , Herb can not keep himself from a single , stabbing look at the hallway upstairs . He gets his attention back on to Sue and finishes his drink . Her dance ends with the music . Herb rises from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaches for the dimmer switch , and twists the knob . The room is immediately flooded in bright , revealing light . He goes to the door , opens it , and leaves .

His name is Tod Ranger . Ginny , wearing glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript in her hand . Tod Ranger , wearing glasses , is sitting on a bar stool bolding his manuscript .

" VIRGINIA KARGER " You will . You always do . " TOD RANGER " What do you want , Laurie ? " HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST More . TOD RANGER What ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST More . Get sore . TOD RANGER " What do you want , Laurie ? " ( To Herb . ) Like that ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST No , that 's just louder . Mean it is what I mean . p. 71 TOD RANGER ( Ill at ease . ) I 'll work on it .

That 's the essence of this guy . He 's horizontal . TOD RANGER All right . I feel like a shmo , but I 'll do it . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST A thousand thanks .

VIRGINIA KARGER What did she have that I did n't have ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Three kids ! Half a year it lasted . I would n't admit it to myself , I 'd goofed . So I gave her everything I had  --  except one Rollei , and I took off  --  kept going east and slow . Last year I wound up in San Francisco . Cal 's the assistant managing editor already , and his wife  --  you never met her , did you ?  --  she 's a cutter on documentaries , a real pistol . That 's how I got spun in .

It was sort of a joke  --  a technicality . Like if you found a wad in a taxi . Would n't you give it back ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( After thinking it over . ) How big a wad ? VIRGINIA KARGER Most people would . Do . Anyway , that 's not what I 'm after . ( He looks at her curiously and seriously . ) HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST What are you after ? VIRGINIA KARGER ( Simply . ) I want to be a star . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST And what else ? VIRGINIA KARGER A big star . ( There is a pause . ) HERBERT H.

HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST And what 's happened ? Professionally . VIRGINIA KARGER He 's grooming me . He says I need more experience . And he 's right . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Sometimes at night , or taking a bath , or putting on mascara and looking at yourself . Do you ever wonder if this is right for you ? p. 80 VIRGINIA KARGER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUNDQUIST A few months . That 's a long time as you get older . VIRGINIA KARGER I 'm not getting older . I 'm getting ahead . And saved some dough . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST How much ? VIRGINIA KARGER You got a good agent ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST The best . Myself . VIRGINIA KARGER Watch yourself . They 're dynamite , these guys . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST Only if you want what they 've got to offer . VIRGINIA KARGER Who does n't ? HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST But it 's like an ending . I 'm not sure if I want that . I have n't had enough beginnings . VIRGINIA KARGER ( She has put on her eyeglasses and begins to study a script . ) Sure you have . Try an ending . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Suddenly . ) Listen . Pack it up and let 's take off. , Bring your money and I 'll bring mine  --  my share ought to be about four thousand . I know several spots  --  far away .

How about it ? p. 81 VIRGINIA KARGER It sounds like for the art houses , but I 'll think about it . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Picking up the phone . ) Come on . Call him up and tell him you quit . Just like that . Or better still  --  let me tell him . I 'll take that as a birthday present  --  instead of the usual cufflinks . VIRGINIA KARGER Slow down . You 're puffing . Now , here 's something for you to rattle around in your noggin . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Replacing the phone . ) Yes ? VIRGINIA KARGER Make your deal . Get to be somebody  --  and I will , too . And meantime , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same proposition as yours , practically , except in mine we stay on a payroll . ( She winks at him . ) Earn while you learn . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST And what happens to  --  ? ( This place , this situation . ) VIRGINIA KARGER Nothing . HERBERT H. LUNDQUIST ( Herb studies her for a moment , unbelievingly . ) I see . All you want is to have your cake and eat it and sell it and rent it and share it and put it under seven year contract . You 're in trouble , baby . Big trouble . p. 82 VIRGINIA KARGER No  --  big trouble was last year when I was running the elevator at the Beverly-Wilshire . You know how many round trips I made ? A hundred and eighty-four thousand . And living  --  I mean trying to  --  on unemployment insurance . Whoever figured out that fifty-five a week I only hope they get to try it themselves some day .

VIRGINIA KARGER ( Placatingly . ) Look , Blake  --  BLAKE TREMAINE ( With rising anger . ) There 're people downstairs and they 've been nice and friendly , but they know I 've been stalling them and I do n't want to do it much longer , so you get dressed and be down there in five minutes , six at the most . At the most ! ( He turns to go . ) VIRGINIA KARGER ( Exploding . ) I ca n't be in two places at once !

And just lie there sipping and reading for several months . I happen to be a Civil War buff . That surprise you ? ( He calls to Ginny . ) My parting advice . When you hear : ( He performs the signal again : Buzz , knock knock knock . Buzz , knock knock knock . ) You better hop to it , or you 'll be playing hat-check girls again .
