Doctors have been disappointed more than once in their high hopes of eradicating gonorrhea with wonder drugs , but last week the U.S. Public Health Service reported that before the end of 1963 the anti-gonorrhea campaign may be made vastly more effective . This time it is not a new drug that is arousing new hope , but an improved and speedier way of detecting the disease . <P> No Immunity . Though gonorrhea is less dramatic than syphilis in its crippling and death-dealing powers , it is not to be taken lightly . It not only produces painful symptoms , but also can cause sterility , blindness in the newborn , crippling arthritis and fatal heart disease . And to public health crusaders trying to stamp out all venereal disease , gonorrhea presents some special problems . It is twice as prevalent as syphilis in the U.S. , with about 250,000 cases reported annually and an estimated 1,250,000 unreported . It is much more highly contagious than syphilis , and easier to catch from a single indiscretion . The infection , even when effectively cured , confers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same victim can catch the dis ease again a few days after being cured - and often does . <P> Despite these difficulties , gonorrhea can be conquered , said Dr. William J. Brown of PHS 's Communicable Disease Center , if only it can be detected promptly and surely . With a man , this is no problem once he goes to a doctor . In a woman , the gonococci may spread and hide , or mingle with other germs to make diagnosis extremely difficult . In the new detection method described by Dr. Brown , the gonococci are made fluorescent and visible through a microscope under ultraviolet light only a few minutes after a smear is taken from a patient . Hospitals across the U.S. are now testing the test , and by the end of the year it should be ready for general use . <P> Massive Medication . Although VD researchers are still arguing over whether some strains of the gonococcus are now resistant to penicillin , cure is almost certain if the treatment is intensive enough . To give the germs no chance . PHS experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for simple cases of gonorrhea and as much as 20 million units a day for such serious complications as gonorrheal arthritis and heart infection . For the few patients who can not tolerate penicillin , several other antibiotics are almost as good . <P> The World Health Organization has glumly reported " complete failure to control gonorrhea in spite of the very widespread use of antibiotics , " but in the U.S. , and other well-doctored countries , the available drugs and the new test should turn the tide . Elsewhere , the organization fears , the only hope lies in a protective vaccine , and none is yet in sight .
