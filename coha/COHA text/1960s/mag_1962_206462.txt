AN ANSWER FROM LIMBO ( 322 pp. ) - Brian Moore-Atlantic-Little , Brown ( $5 ) . <P> <P> To hear the writers tell it . all writers have bad characters , if indeed they have any character at all . Matricides may be dealt with kindly in novels , an author may find a spark of good in a drug-addicted card cheat or a grasping banker , and it is an immutable law that prostitutes ' hearts are warm . But let a novelist introduce a wretch whose vice is writing novels , and there begins a recital of character faults that would have horrified Caligula : the fellow is meanspirited , lazy , a coward , lustful but inept at sex . soggy with drink , cruel to his children , and two months behind on the phone bill . <P> Brian Moore , the talented Irish-Canadian author of The Feast of Lupercal and The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne , is the latest novelist to turn savagely on his own kind . Moore 's miscreant hero is Brendan Tierney , a young Belfast short-storyist who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its place a magazine job , some fake Danish furniture and an authentic American wife . Brendan 's problem is that he is almost 30 , the age at which a promising writer either writes something or becomes merely a pawned talent . <P> Moved to action by the severest shock a writer can sustain-a friend two years younger announces that his own novel is to be published-Brendan finds a solution . He imports his dear old mother from Belfast to look after the two children , puts his wife to work , quits the magazine , and dusts off his old manuscript . The novel goes well ( the reader is never told what it is about , and it may , indeed , be about a writer ) , but nothing else does . Mother Tierney can not understand Brendan 's wife , and is shocked by the paganism of his household ; she baptizes the children in the bathroom . The wife resents everything-Mother Tierney , the novel , her job-and gets even by having an affair with the sort of slob whose pants do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work , but will you sacrifice yourself ? " a friend asks Brendan , and at the book 's end Brendan thinks the answer is yes . Supposing himself to be the cause of the calamities that have overtaken the Tierney family , he figures that he has made the supreme sacrifice to his art by turning himself into a thoroughgoing bastard . <P> And yet is he , really ? Novelist Moore obviously thinks so . But to the reader , Brendan seems unpleasant but no monster of iniquity ; his wife , on the other hand , is a certifiable bitch , and her bitchery has very little to do with her husband 's occupation . Without much question , Moore has got hold of the wrong villain , something an artist of his skill would not do if his topic had not blurred his vision .
