This may be remembered as the TV season when public-affairs programs , as they are primly called , began to come into their own . While they can not possibly match the concern a network lavishes on a profitable husband-and-wife comedy , they have made some impressive strides into prime evening time . Spurred equally by the guilt feelings left over from the quiz frauds and by interest in the political campaign , the networks are putting more information programs on the air than ever before . If the 1960 campaign seems to have been less fustian than others in the past , TV 's exacting eye and ear deserve much of the credit . <P> Apart from The Great Debate , which despite shortcomings stayed consistently exciting , other shows , such as NBC 's Meet the Press and CBS 's Face the Nation and Presidential Countdown , have kept the candidates steaming under glass . Always at their best when covering events as they actually happen , the networks ' cameras were brilliantly active during the U.N . ' s recent parliament of fouls , picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro bearding pedestrians outside his Harlem hotel . <P> But the real test of TV as a news medium is whether it can organize and analyze events . In that field , the most notable effort so far this year is being made by a former college instructor and science researcher who bears the improbable title of Executive Producer , Creative Projects , NBC News and Public Affairs . A cigar-smoking , rumpled , un-Brooks Brotherly type , Irving Gitlin , 42 , jumped networks last May after being instrumental ( as CBS 's Director of Public Affairs ) in the development of Twentieth Century , Face the Nation , Conquest and other first-rate shows . " CBS is a mature situation , " says Gitlin . " NBC is ripening . " Translation : having lagged far behind CBS in information coverage for years , NBC is using Gitlin to try to close the gap . Among Gitlin 's projects : <P> The NBC White Paper Series . Six hour-long reports on topics ranging from American flacks to U.S. problems with the Panama Canal . The series begins next month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U-2 program . <P> The Nation 's Future . A weekly , hour-long series of debates . Gitlin started by making a list of 50 " impossible " opponents , e.g. , Ben-Gurion and Nasser , is still trying to line up as many as possible . The first , hardly sensational encounter , on Nov. 12 , joins Atomic Scientists Edward Teller and Leo Szilard on disarmament . <P> Purex Specials . A daytime series intended mainly for women-although the first program interested a nearly equal number of men . Called The Cold Woman , it dealt with sexual frigidity in the human female , effectively balanced four acts of slightly soapy dramatization with clinical commentary by a psychiatrist and a psychologist . <P> Outside Gitlin 's domain is one of NBC 's greatest assets this year : Robert Saudek 's memorable Omnibus , which , after a season off the air and years of scuttling back and forth between networks , resumes on NBC next month . The first show studies the various ways in which U.S. Presidents have used their power .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
