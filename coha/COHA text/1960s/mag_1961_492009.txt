JAMES STEWART : PART TWO How I Became an Actor Andy did odd jobs around the store  --  stoking the furnace , sweeping out , weighing ten-penny nails . But mostly he could be found way in the back , dozing in a chair alongside the potbellied stove . When dad had all the " so you 're Jimmy 's father " he could take , he would escort his visitor back to the stove where Andy was sleeping . " There he is , " dad would say . " A sad case . We try not to wake him too often . " If movie audiences think of me as a small-town American boy , born of God-fearing par- I ents who were endowed with a sense of humor , they are right . My parents , Alexander and Elizabeth Stewart , were deeply religious , and both had a saving sense of humor . And I certainly grew up in a small town ; in 1908 , when I was born , Indiana , Pennsylvania , had fewer than 6000 inhabitants . My earliest memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my dad 's hardware store . There were many odors , but I was n't particular . I liked them all  --  the dry smell of coiled rope , the sweet smells of linseed oil and baseball gloves , the faintly acid tang of open nail kegs . I 've bren told that when I ran away from home , at age three or four , I went directly to the store . With Marlene Dietrich in the 1959 movie Destry Rides Again . By this time he was an established , four-year veteran of Hollywood and had stopped worrying about being skinny . 19 to : The Philadelphia Story , with Katharine Hepburn , brought Jim , then thirty . two years old , his second Academy-award nomination . This time he won the Oscar . I do n't remember that , but I do remember George Little , who was in charge of cutting window glass , threading pipe and making keys . He worked in the basement , and I loved to watch him . I remember the zip of his glass cutter , the lapping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the big glistening sheet . And there was a knife counter , and rows of push-it-yourself lawn mowers ; and later , when automobiles became common , there was a special department for tires , batteries , jacks , and horns that went Aah-oogah . When 1 was eight years old , dad let me work in the store part time ; he had to , because I was running away from home to the store all the time . Years later , in 1927 , when I was away at Merccrsburg Academy , the store burned to the ground . Only its walls were left standing . Insurance covered only part of the loss , but dad put on a new roof and repaired the interior and bought new stock , making up in courage and determination what he lacked in ready cash . My father is a big , demanding , stubborn man of Scotch-Irish stock . His surname is Scotch , of course , but there was a Kelly in his family , and Kelly blood dominates him . A writer who interviewed me some time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad , but he must have a sane , solid , American way of sorting his thoughts mentally before spilling them verbally . Jimmy talks that way . I figure he inherited that from his father . He seems to think before he talks . " I do think before I speak . Perhaps I think more slowly than most men . I do know that my mental processes are not lightning fast . That 's why I 'm no good at card games , and why it takes me such a long time to memorize my lines . But that interviewer was wrong about one thing . If 1 speak slowly and deliberately . I 'm following my mother 's style , not my dad 's . My mother was the most tolerant and understanding of women . She not only forgave me when I was bad , she forgave faults in everybody else . Music meant a lot to her ; she played the piano and she played the organ in church too . She was so close to her family that we took the place of friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three close women friends . She was n't a clubwoman type ; and while she loved 10 play bridge , she did n't belong to a bridge club . I can honestly say that she never did anything to embarrass me as a boy , although small boys embarrass easily . No one doubted she was going to get into heaven . In our family dad took care of disciplining me and my two sisters , Mary Wilson Stewart and Virginia Kelly Stewart . ( Both are younger than I am , both are married now , and neither of them lives in Indiana , Pennsylvania . ) The discipline we got from dad was not harsh at all . I was never afraid of him the way some boys are scared of their fathers . When I became involved in what he called my projects , he went along with me enthusiastically . Before I was ten I started making my own crystal radio set by unwinding and winding loose couplers on oatmeal boxes . On this ( Continued on Page 77 ) James Stewart ( Continued from Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach our corner of Pennxlvania. it came from station KDKA in t*ittsburgh and it described the inauguration of President Harding . At school the next day I was asked in assembly to describe the broadcast . I stood up and said , " It really was n't much . The President spoke . They all cheered . Then there was another speech . " If I had stopped then , the other kids in assembly would have just hated me a little , but 1 added , " Then the band played Columbus , rite Germ of the Ocean . " I 've never lived that down . When I was home in Indiana last year , a fellow named Tub Blair brought it up . " What did you say the name of that tune was , Jim ? It sounded like Columbus , the Germ of the Ocean . " When I finished messing with my oatmeal-box receiver , I still needed a radio tube called an Audion . It cost sixteen dollars , and 1 did n't have that much money . But dad took me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To get home dad had to drive over sixty miles of bumpy road . I cradled that tube in my lap as if it were a baby . Later , when earphones became old stuff , dad bought me my first loudspeaker . With that loud-speaker hooked up , I could rattle all the windows in the house . Trying for good reception was no longer my aim . All I wanted was to see how far 1 could stand away from our house and still hear my horn blaring . If I got two stations at once , with music or talk overlapping , it did n't matter . I could boast , " I got KDKA three blocks away last night . " When I was eleven or twelve , I got the idea that I wanted to hunt lions in Africa . ) Dad pretended to go along with me on that too . " Very well , " he said , " we 'll go . " Then I decided that 1 did n't want to shoot animals ; I wanted to bring them back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to me , full of stories about snaring animals , and a secret valley where elephants went to die . I remember going to the iron department in our hardware store with dad and selecting iron bars strong enough to hold a lion . It must have been hard for dad to humor a small boy who kept asking about a date to begin lion hunting in Africa . I was packed and ready to go for weeks . Dad says he decided to take me on a railroad trip to Atlantic City and talk his way out of going to Africa from there . On our way we passed a train wreck , and dad somehow convinced me that the wreck made it impossible for us to go - Ito Africa " at this time . " To console me , he said that going to Atlantic City was an adventure in itself . " You may not have trapped any lions , " he told me , " but you 've never seen the ocean either . " Dad had seen the ocean in two wars , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart has walked away from our town or our store to fight in every war this country has been in since 1861 . My grandfather , James M. Stewart  --  my name now  --  opened the store in 1853 . A few years Later he went off to the Civil War with his brother . Grandfather survived , but his brother was killed . When the Spanish-American War broke out , dad was a student at Princeton , working with two classmates on a chemistry thesis . All three were agreed that they should leave school and enlist , but somebody had to make the first move . One day , when dad was watching a Bunsen burner , he got to thinking about what the Spaniards were doing to the Cubans . He walked off , leaving the Bunsen burner burning , and sought out his pals . " This , " he said , " is the time . " So they went off to find the dean , to tell him they were going to war . The dean said , " Fine . " They went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see much action . When it was over , all three of them came home and were graduated in their uniforms . After that , dad forgot about chemistry and went to work in the family store . When World War I started , dad again got the urge to be a soldier . Once more his reaction was sudden . He told mother one day that he had to go to Washington , D.C. ; the next day he came back as an Army captain in command of an ordnance company . For this quick promotion he could thank his service record in the Spanish-American War and his long-ago schooling at Pennsylvania Military College . When he left Indiana , the quartet from the Presbyterian-church choir came down to the railroad station and sat in the train vestibule with dad , my mother , my two sisters and me . They harmonized sad songs like Till We Meet Again until the train pulled out . Just before dad went overseas , mother took me to New York to bid him good-by . We did a lot that day . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building , so 1 could look up and down Manhattan , and 1 made them walk me up into the head of the Statue of Liberty . I wanted to see her nose close up , so dad hung onto my foot while I crawled through one of the windows in her crown . I saw her nose , and he pulled me back in . That night we found a shooting gallery on Broadway , and dad held me up so I could shoot . Woodrow Wilson was speaking at Carnegie Hall , and we walked right in . The place was jammed , and dad held me up there too , so I could see Wilson speaking . The next morning his troopship sailed " at an undisclosed hour . " When dad came home from his second war , he was as ready as ever to encourage my boyish enthusiasms . A barnstorming flier had begun to land his Curtiss pusher biplane in Ed Bennett 's field , south of town , which was really a cow pasture . Two people could sit in front of that pusher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 could n't sleep nights . The pilot was getting ten dollars for five minutes of flight , so I began to hoard my money . Then I had to talk dad into letting me go up . He consented finally ; but when he took me down to the field , he brought along our family physician , Doc Torrence , " in case anything goes wrong . " I went to grade school in Indiana , Pennsylvania , then to Mercersburg Academy . My presence at Mercersburg was the result of a feeling-out process my dad engineered . 1 thought I wanted to go to the Naval Academy ; dad took me to Washington , D.C. to consult a man who run a cram school for the academy . 1 was supposed to decide what I wanted to do ; but dad had his mind made up about what I was really going to do-1 was to go to Mercersburg and then to Princeton . Mercersburg was full ; there was n't a chance 1 could enter . but dad talked me in somehow . 1 went out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and center of the lightweight team . That team was really light ; it averaged 130 pounds . 1 drew cartoons and cover designs for the academy yearbook , I sang in the choir and the glee club , 1 played the accordion in the school orchestra and 1 studied . And then , after an attack of scarlet fever , I went ( Continued on Page 79 ) Caminned from Page 77 ) home to recuperate . The disease left me with a kidney infection that kept me out of school for three months . I was still at home on May 20 , 1927 , when Lindbergh made his k now-historic flight from New York to Paris . 1 had been a bug on flying for years , filling scrapbooks with photographs and news clips about such aviation pioneers as Adcock and Brown and the French pilots Nungesser and Coli . One scrapbook was crammed with every picture and clipping I could find on Lindbergh , beginning with his flight from the Ryan airplane factory in San Diego . One of my tasks during my convales:cnce was trimming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for his flight , I made ready for a simulated flight of my own , First I put together a model of his plane , the Spirit of St , Louis . Then i built my idea of New York 's Woolworth Building on one side of the window , and the Eiffel Tower on the other side . In between I spotted Newfoundland and Ireland . Then Lindbergh took off , and the next the world heard of him he was sighted over Newfoundland . I knew about that sighting at once because I kept running across the street from the hardware store to watch the teletype in the office of the Indiana rening Gazette . Every time I got a flash that a fishing boat or a steamer had sighted Lindy 's plane , I rushed to the store window and moved my model plane closer to France . Then came the moment when Lindy landed . It was like New Year 's Eve in our town . Church bells rang . Everybody quit work . The town busted loose . It gave the whole country an emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could forget about the weaknesses of our society in the roaring , amoral ' 20 's  --  the gin flask , the flapper , the parking and petting , the bribery of big-city cops by prohibition 's gangsters . Lindbergh 's feat reminded everyone that a man could still find the courage , the determination and the devotion to face a seemingly insurmountable challenge and win . Soon after the shouting died away , I was well enough to return to my classes in Mercersburg and a role in the senior play . We called this opus The Wolves ; it was all about the French Revolution . All our props and furniture were borrowed from the townspeople and the school . When a big burly sophomore , Angus Gordon . was telling the audience how we " wolves " were going to attack at midnight . he swung his sword so violently that he split a borrowed table in two . After that , it was hard to get the audience back into the mood . There was much emphasis in Mercers-burg on religion , which I took as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a religious household . Dad and mother were pillars of the Presbyterian church . They did their best to raise me to shun pomposity and glibness , to be modest , because a decent gentlemanly man is modest , They tried to teach me faith in God . If I have failed them in any degree , it 's my fault , not theirs . They sent me to Sunday school at an early age , and when I was old enough , 1 attended church services too . Mother played the organ , and dad sang in the choir . In addition to Sunday school irk the morning and church at eleven o'clock , there was a Sunday-night service at seven o'clock and prayer meetings on Wednesday nights . There was a catechism for me to study , and other devotions , such as morning family prayers at home . When I grew up and began working in New York City , I attended Sunday services at a church on Park Avenue . Later , in Hollywood , I quit going to church , fur the worst possible reason  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said my prayers at night , but I rattled them off without thinking much about what I was saying . In short , I was a backslider . When 1 left Hollywood for the Army and started to fly , 1 was forcibly reminded that life can be short . If you think you might die any time , you think more about the hereafter . Anyway , I did . In the Army , no matter what outfit you 're in , you 're required to attend a lecture session every month . Usually you hear from three people . First , your commanding officer tells you what 's expected of you militarily and discusses the latest regulations . Then the flight surgeon or Army doctor delivers a talk on your patriotic duty to keep your health , emphasizing the wisdom of avoiding venereal diseases . You can become useless to your country , he warns , " if you take chances . " Sometimes he shows colored slides and cracks a few strictly male jokes on the subject . The third and last speaker is the chaplain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says , " Do n't forget to write home to your mother , " and everyone files out and forgets it . These lecture periods were standard wherever I was stationed during World War 11 , including Hobbs , New Mexico , where l attended four-engine school . I 'd been flying quite a while then . I had been a flight instructor , but 1 was just starting transition training on B-17 's . The first three sessions at Hobbs were the same thing all over again . First the commanding officer spoke ; then came the flight surgeon with his slides and little jokes , which added up to " take care of yourselves , boys , but have fun . " At the fourth session a new chaplain made the closing talk and cut the flight surgeon down to size . He talked straight , telling us we should guard our morals as well as our health . " Only , " he added , " much better . " And he went on to give us sound advice about our responsibility to our families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the C.O. and the flight surgeon . This brief sermon got to me . During the next six months , I went to chapel regularly . It was a bad period . Many men I flew with were being killed in training . Religion meant a lot to me for the rest of the war . Alter my discharge from service . I came out to California again and forgot about church-going until my dad and mother tame out to see me . When Sunday came around , dad asked , " Where 's your church ? " I had to admit I did n't know . " The nearest one is downtown , " I said , " and I 'm so far away from it out here in Brentwood that I do n't go . " He said , " There must be one around someplace , " and he went to look for it . Two and a half hours later he came back with five men and said , " You were wrong about that church , Jim . There 's one only two blocks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't a church at all ; it was half house and half barn , owned by a congregation that lacked money for building . Dad introduced the men he 'd brought home . " Elders of the church , " he said . " They need help . " Not long after that , 1 found myself with a shovel in my hands , lifting the first dirt at a groundbreaking . Many thousands of dollars later there was a church , and sometime later I was married there . There were n't any pews for our wedding . The guests sat in chairs . The pews came later . I 've gone to church ever since , and so has my wife Gloria  --  she teaches Sunday school and sees to it that our kids attend . Now when dad comes to see us , he has a church to visit . After my mother died , I installed a stained-glass window in her memory . Whenever I look at it , it seems to glow  --  just as she did all her life . Looking further back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy partly because the school was in a large sense built around its chapel . And when I went on to Princeton , she was well aware that the university was basically a Presbyterian institution , as it still is . I entered Princeton as a member of the class of 1932 , intending to become a civil engineer . A short biography prepared by my publicity agents says : " Discouraged in this field by one of his professors , he turned to architecture . " " Discouraged " is a weak word for it . What that prof really said was , " You 're doomed . My advice to you is get out ! " I was fighting a losing battle with math , a subject that would-be engineers must conquer . To get even , I wrestled with math in summer school , between my freshman and sophomore years . but that got me nowhere . Maybe I was " going through a phase , " as my mother used to say . Phase or not , I was a miserably bad student , When my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy named Frank MacDonald . By the time I got there MacDonald was teaching a Shakespeare course . It was a popular course , so I signed for it . While I enjoyed the lectures , was tempted to think , I 'm a cinch in this course  --  the man who 's giving it roomed with my father . So I did n't bother to read Shakespeare and naturally I was n't prepared for the final exam . I 'll never forget MacDonald 's judgment ? " I 've done everything for you l can in good conscience , but it 's no use . " As if I was n't in enough trouble , I tried out the next year for the university 's musical production , the Triangle Club show , spending time that a poor student could n't afford to waste . It was lucky for me that 1 had become interested in some of the prearchitectural courses the university offered . Axed by my civil-engineering profession . 1 hastily decided to become a second Frank Lloyd Wright . Once F became interested in my courses I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 was graduated in architecture with honors. 1 even won a scholarship , pointing toward a master 's degree in architecture if I wanted to accept . But my first Triangle show led me to another career . All sophomores with any talent at all , no matter how microscopic , were urged to try out for Triangle . I could play the accordion  --  so could a classmate , Bob Perry the later married one of my sisters ) . Bob and I tried out as a team , costumed as blue devils with tails , masks and horns , playing a number called Blue Hell , written by another Princeton ian . We plied our squeeze boxes lustily , hoping no one would notice the lack of tremolo effects or flash . If we were n't expert , we were loud . Those who ran the Triangle show that year must have been hard up for talent ; anyhow , we made it . All together I appeared in three of the annual Triangle shows . There was The Golden Dog , then Spanish Blades and finally , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small part in a play put on by the Princeton Theater Intime . Nobody gave us any theatrical training in the Intime . We just walked on cold and acted our brains out until the final curtain . Training for the Triangle show was more ambitious . To gain polish , we imported a singing coach from the New York Metropolitan Opera Company . My high , piping voice gave him no joy , and when he taught us gestures , I could n't master them . " Put your hands up like this ! " he 'd say . " Do this ! " In trying to obey , I felt as if 1 were falling and trying to break my fall with my arms . And the words of the song drained out of my head . After a while we got rid of our coach . Trained or untrained , good or bad , wooden or expressive , we did what came naturally . We were too young to know it , but a lot of undeveloped , big-time talent was rooting around those Triangle shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later revolving his tatooed belly in South Pacific ; and Josh Logan who sharpened his talent for directing on The Tiger Smiles and Spanish Blades ; and Bretaigne Windust . Before his death last year , Windust directed Life With Father , a couple of Lunt plays , any number of movies and television too . In 1932 , when I was graduated as an architect , a great financial depression had made jobs scarce . Perhaps I might have given it a harder try , but my future was quickly decided by a message from Josh Logan . He was in Falmouth , Massachusetts , where he had joined a group known as the University Players . These youngsters played as a stock company in the Falmouth Old Silver Beach Theater . Next door to the theater they operated something they called the Falmouth Old South Silver Beach Tearoom . Josh asked whether 1 would play my accordion in the tearoom . I said , " Yes , " and packed my bag . The word " university , " as in University Players , was no misnomer . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  specifically Charlie Leatherby ( now dead ) and Kent Smith , a busy and successful actor . Henry Fonda , who had been with the University Players some time , had attended the University of Minnesota . Maggie Sullavan was on hand , as well as that wonderful actress , Mildred Natwick . I do n't know whether they were university characters , and there 's no reason to fuss about it . Incidentally , I had already met Maggie when she visited Princeton with a show from New York . The chance to summer in Falmouth appealed to me because it was on the sea . Even more appealing was the thought of earning a living by playing an accordion . But it was lucky for me the University Players ran a real summer theater where everyone did anything that needed to be done . The tearoom served a modest dinner before the show , and after the final curtain , part of the audience and the Players collected there . My performance as a resident accordionist was disastrous . Patrons talked right through my playing and even said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given other jobs . As assistant property man , 1 built sets , helped paint scenery and swept out . Sometimes 1 was given small theatrical parts , carefully selected so they would be easy for me , In my best part that summer , I played a chauffeur in a tryout of Good-by Again . The male lead in Good-by Again played an author touring the country , autographing his novel in bookstores . Mrs. Belie Irving , a dragon dowager , sends her chauffeur  --  me  --  to the author 's hotel room with a copy of his book . The author is in the bathroom ; a secretary tells me to wait  --  her boss " is cleaning up . " I had two important lines . One was , " Could n't you just take the book in to him ? " The secretary refuses , indignantly . I put the book under my arm , head for the door and utter my last line , " Mrs. Belle Irving is going to be sore as hell . " Exit . That was all I did during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again told me that he had written in the part for me simply to provide more time between the introduction of principal characters . It 's not good technique to bring the principals trooping on-stage all at once . Myron McCormick was in that show too , but his part was a lot fatter than mine . He played a bellhop , and he was in and out so fast that if you winked , you missed him ; but at least he was in all three acts . It was Arthur Beckward , producer of the big success , Another Language , who arranged the tryout of Good-by Again at Falmouth . After a trial run of two weeks , he decided to change the bill by starring his wife , Esther Dale , in a thing called Carry Nation . There were thirty-five stage sets , each one a little vignette of the crusader barging into saloons and wrecking them with her hatchet . I had four parts in Carry : more experienced members of the Players had five or six . In one role I was a vigilante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colored gardener , a member of a crowd . Realizing how tall and skinny I was , I made a special effort to keep the audience from noticing that I was playing all four parts . By using different gestures and characterizations to bamboozle the customers , l hoped to avert any suspicion that the players included a disbanded basketball team . Carry was so successful in Falmouth that the producer decided to take it into New York . There were also plans to take Good-by Again to Broadway . My salary that summer had consisted of board and keep and ten dollars a week . Now , late in August , I had to decide whether to stay with the troupe and become the skinniest actor on Broadway or go back to Princeton and try for a master 's degree in architecture . Since I did n't have to decide right away , 1 went home to Indiana , Pennsylvania , to think about it . One night I told my family what was on my mind  --  that I was thinking of trying my luck as an actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterians do n't feel that theater-going , card playing and dancing are instruments of the devil ; still , my family could n't help thinking that the practice of architecture was more respectable than becoming an " actor fellow . " However , they rallied . " If that 's the way you want it , Jim , " said dad . My mother did n't approve heartily , but she went along , bless her heart . My mind was made up . I went to New York and checked into a hotel on 63rd Street with five of the Players , including Hank Fonda and Myron McCormick . We lived in two rooms and a kitchenette . Carry Nation opened , and I got thirty dollars a week . Out of that I had to pay ten dollars a week toward my Actors Equity initiation fee , which was seventy or eighty dollars . Unfortunately Carry did n't run quite long enough for me to pay the whole fee . One of my roommates was another Princetonian , Charlie Amt . Charlie was make-up happy , an Ivy League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better he thought he played his part . In one of his Carry Nation parts he was supposed to play a Salvation Army preacher who went into action after the tambourines stopped shaking . For some reason he decided that the role called for buckteeth and he dreamed up the idea of attaching them to his gums with the spirit gum that anchors wigs to scalps . He put the stickum right on his gums , then shoved in his fake teeth . This lashup made him talk like Mortimer Snerd . So far , so good . Now he had to go off stage and change to play another character . The teeth stuck . Tears rolled down Charlie 's face as he tugged at his glued-up gums . But his weeping gave him satisfaction  --  he was suffering for his art . In his next role Charlie played a tough gangster . For that he attached a thread to his eyelid with a bit of adhesive tape . Then he pulled the thread down his cheek tightly until it dug in , looking like a knife gash , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detaching the tape from his eye hurt even worse than pulling out his buckteeth ; but the pain signified , to Charlie anyway , that he had given a brilliant performance . Despite Charlie 's efforts , Carry Nation ran only seven weeks . So there I was , short of money aneremembering my last talk with my folks . Dad and mother had been kind , but my announcement that I meant to become an actor had been poorly received by an uncle then visiting us . " None of the Stewarts , " he said , " has ever had anything to do with the theater . Except one  --  he was with a circus for a while . Then he went to jail . " After that warning , he shook hands with me and wished me luck . I needed it . Next week Jimmy describes his career on Broadway and how he broke into the ?

With a certain unconscious grimness he worked himself into the frame of mind that ought to be typical of an executive who would n't conceivably be let out when his company was taken over by a larger one . He arrived at the plant looking reasonably cheerful , on the morning of the day he was fired . Time passed . The morning proceeded . The young man with the Phi Alpha Gamma pin got out of the car . He thanked the motorist who 'd given him a lift . The motorist filled up his tank  --  he needed only eight gallons  --  and turned off on Route 28 and went out of sight .

His mother would understand how important it was that he go on the Phi Alpha Gamma Pan-American Highway Expedition . The four of them , in Joe 's car , could undoubtedly make it down the almost-completed highway during vacation . It would be a triumph . They would be written up in the Phi Alpha Gamma Alumni Report , with their pictures , and there would be splendid adventures . There were still undeveloped sections of the highway , and there they might need the aid of oxen or half-wild horses . They would leave a Phi Alpha Gamma flag at the southernmost point they reached in Chile . And A car pulled in . He almost stood up to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crib in the back seat . There was a baby in it . People who travel with babies do not pick up hitchhikers . Not even personable Phi Alpha Gammas . He relaxed . His mother would understand how important it was .

Joe figured it at four hundred apiece for the trip , and they 'd sell the car and come back on a freighter at a dollar a day to the skipper .... Presently another car pulled in . There was only one man in it , and he smoked a thick cigar . If he was headed right , he 'd be a certainty . He 'd want to do the talking , though . Bob Patton strolled over , looking every inch the college man . " Would you be heading , " he asked ingratiatingly , " in the general direction of Monmouth ?

He liked for days to begin right . He 'd be home after only two hitches and a fifteen-cent bus ride . He 'd explain to his mother that he 'd got hungry for some home cooking , and ask negligently about Jane , and then explain about the Phi Alpha Gamma Pan-American Highway Expedition . By the time his father got home , everything would be settled . There 'd be an argument , but it would be won before it started . Martha worried . She sat at the breakfast table after her husband had left and poured herself another cup of coffee . She tried to arrange things in a practical proper order to make them come out right .
