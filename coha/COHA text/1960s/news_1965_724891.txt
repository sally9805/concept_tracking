txt Bonn Long-term credits to Communists , the " Berlin clause , " easier trading terms for East Germany  --  these are topics in the Bonn air . They add up to one conclusion : Slowly the West German Government is adjusting to a bothersome fact  --  the permanent existence of the ( Communist ) German Democratic Republic ( D.D.R. ) . Permanent may not mean forever . But already East Germany has existed long enough to force new policies on the Bonn government . This is true under Chancellor Ludwig Erhard . It will be equally true , whatever government  --  Christian Democratic or Social Democratic  --  takes the reins of power after West German elections this fall . Elusive elections Gone are the days when West German officials hoped the East German regime might be quarantined , or toppled by internal revolt . No doubt free elections in East Germany would produce rejection of Communist rule by the Soviet zone 's 17 million Germans . But free elections are not going to happen . Neither the Soviet Union , 20 of whose divisions garrison the D.D.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , the D.D.R . is growing stronger . It has become the world 's 10th ranking industrial power . The East German economy is the most sophisticated in the Communist bloc . East German trade with the free world is growing . Nine consulates and nine official trade missions of East Germany dot the underdeveloped world . Leaders i m posed West Germans may rightly deny the legitimacy of this regime . Its leaders , headed by Walter Ulbricht , were trained in the Soviet Union during the war , imposed on East Germans after the war . But illegitimacy has not caused the regime to dry up and blow a way . West German leaders , after long years of stressing legalism , have drawn the lesson . They probe for weak spots in East Germany 's armor and bend West German policy to exploit them . Chief arena is Eastern // *Bonn adjusts to Red thorn // Europe . One East German citizen put it in a nutshell . " We are allowed to take vacations in Communist lands , " he declared . " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East German marks were despised by the Czechs . West German tourists had no trouble . Czech merchants and banks snatched up their marks . Theirs was hard foreign exchange . Mine was not . " Solidarity pierced The governments of Eastern Europe are hungry for industrial know-how . A share of that know-how comes from East Germany . Seventy-five percent of East Germany 's foreign trade is with Communist countries , nearly 50 percent with the Soviet Union alone . Any slice of that market which Bonn can take away hurts the D.D.R . Also , it tends to break up Communist solidarity with East Germany . The ( West ) German Federal Republic claims the right to represent all Germans throughout the world . This sounds fine , but in fact puts Bonn often on the defensive . Every new toehold East Germany can scratch out ? in Tanzania , the United Arab Republic , Ghana , or elsewhere ? is a defeat for Bonn . The place to strike back was on the DDR 's vulnerable eastern flank . ' Berlin clause ' Bonn made a start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw and signing a trade agreement with Poland . This was followed by similar agreements , including trade missions , in Romania , Hungary , and Bulgaria . Each of these Communist nations received substantial revolving credits from Bonn . This was the thin edge of a breakthrough , and " opening to the east . " Mr. Ulbricht 's regime reacted with alarm . Particularly troubling to East Berlin was the " Berlin clause , " embedded in each of the trade agreements concluded by Bonn . This specified that the agreement was valid in the currency area of the D-mark West . West Berlin 's currency is the D-mark West . Four Communist nations implicitly had accepted Bonn 's contention that West Berlin was an integral part of the Federal Republic . Immediately East Germany turned heavy guns on Prague . The Czechs were urged to exclude a Berlin clause from the trade agreement . Bonn was hoping to negotiate with the Czechoslovak Government . The Czechs complied . They refused to accept a Berlin clause and Czech-West German negotiations fell through . Long-term credits Similarly the Soviets declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1963 . Pressure was put on the Poles to strike the Berlin clause out of their trade agreement with Bonn , due for renewal next spring . Meanwhile , the Federal Republic had taken a policy turn of its own . Bonn , along with the United States , had held credits to Communist lands to five years or less . But France , Britain , and Italy had broken through this ceiling with long-term credits and were reaping trade advantage among the Communists . Last March Bonn quietly announced its readiness to advance five-year credits to all Communist countries and up to eight years in some cases . This would permit West German businessmen to compete on more equal terms with other Western salesmen . But the Berlin clause stumbling block still loomed . So the Federal Republic secretly asked the three Western allies for permission to delete the touchy clause from future trade agreements . Every treaty , according to Bonn 's suggested formula , would apply automatically to West Berlin , unless the city specifically was exempted . West Germany would send a blanket declaration to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Poles , Czechs , or Soviets , no mention of Berlin need be raised . Bonn 's stalled momentum to the East might be regained . But the proposal touched directly on allied rights . Perilous position The United States , Britain , and France remain sovereign in West Berlin . A West German law or treaty is valid there , only if the allies do not object . France , and perhaps the other two allies , did object . The Communists , it was said , might sign a trade agreement , ignore the new West German formula , and later say the agreement excluded West Berlin . The allied position , slippery enough already , might be further eroded in the former German capital . Here the question rests , indecisively . But Bonn had shown its sensitivity to East German diplomacy among the Czechs , Poles , and Soviets . Meanwhile , Mr. Ulricht 's regime tweaked the allied nose in Berlin by unilaterally changing water traffic rules and by flying East German helicopters illegally over West Berlin . Despite this brusqueness , , Bonn stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interzonal German trade .
