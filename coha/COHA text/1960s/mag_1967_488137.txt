DEAR SIRS : On Sept. 17 , the Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities of Illinois will very likely reconsider the case of Staughton Lynd  --  a case , we believe , that raises issues of national importance In July , the board rejected the appointment of Lynd as associate professor of history by Chicago State College , even though the appointment was unanimously recommended by the department of history and the president of the college The board . did " not question Dr. Lynd 's ability as a scholar and as a teacher of history " Instead it held that his " public activities " ? his advocacy of " nonviolent civil disobedience " and his trip to Hanoi in 1965-66 ? " go beyond mere dissent " So far this case has attracted very little attention outside Illinois , but we are confident that many readers will agree with us that the board 's action represents a particularly flagrant invasion of academic freedom As such , it concerns everyone who values the right of dissent We hope that readers of this letter , singly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield , Ill. , urging upon them the principle that a man 's political views can not be permitted to override the professional judgment of his peers , Professors at a dozen private and public universities have formed a Committee for Academic Freedom in Illinois . which is attempting to publicize the case and to support Professor Lynd 's lawsuit against the board . Individuals who would like to sign the committee 's statement of principles and contribute to a fund for legal defense are urged to communicate with one of the co-chairmen of the committee who have signed this letter Chi istopher Lasch , Northwestern thrive , 5111 ' Evanston , Ill Alfred F Young , Northern Illinois University DeKalb , Ill. restoring the consensus Durham , Conn DEAR SIRS .

George M For EDITORIALS Morton the Realist Sen. Thruston Morton 's switch from the pro-war to the anti-war side may well prove to be the key event in the 1968 election . A former GOP national chairman , Morton is respected by politicians of both parties for expertise and integrity . He added to his authority by the manner in which he changed his position . He simply said , " I was mistaken . " This is the most effective way of avoiding fruitless discussion and the need for apologetics designed to prove that one can be right on both sides of a controversy It also attracts attention by reason of its novelty . Other Senators could well make use of it . In an interview with John H Averill of the Los Angeles Times , Mr. Morton discussed the public reaction to his switch He mentioned the overriding reason for making it , which is that he felt it to be in the national interest to end the Vietnamese War as soon as possible and therefore , as a matter of conscience , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , he felt that he was voicing a view that a great body of citizens was beginning to adopt in their individual thinking , One reason for this swing in public sentiment is the duration of the war and the lack of any prospect of ending it by military means . At the same time President Johnson 's mistakes , and his efforts to cover up , are becoming more evident every day . It has become imperative for responsible politicians of both parties to part company with him Mr. Morton 's timing was good . His speech of September 27 did not come out of the blue In our issue of August 29 we noted editorially that he had changed his mind and had said so in an interview that was little noted at the time . The underlying politics of the Presidential succession in 1968 furnishes ample reason for Morton 's determination to drive the Republican Party toward a peace platform . The GOP is today a third party , as George Gallup pointed out in summarizing his latest poll . Out of every 100 adults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 as Republicans If the Democrats can not win as Democrats , much less can the Republicans win as Republicans . Experienced men like Morton , Cooper and Case see this clearly  --  and they know what is going on in the minds of that 31 per cent in the middle . Every day they are getting more sick of the war . Another phase of the GOP campaign tends in the same direction . Nixon is pursuing Goldwater 's 1964 tactic and his own tactic of 1960 in trying to corral delegates , a technique at which he has no equal But this may not work in 1968 because of the large number of favorite-son delegations which did not exist in 1964 , and -- a point of cardinal importance  --  because the polls are superseding the primaries . Their temper is that a moderate Republican who is a critic of Johnson 's war policy has an excellent chance of the nomination  --  and of being elected . Whether the dump-Johnson movement will succeed is doubtful , but it does not have to succeed ? Johnson can be got rid of without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wider choice if an end-the-war candidate were available on the Democratic side , but in that case the pressure to line up the Republican Party against the war would be reduced . As for the chances of a Republican hawk , at this juncture Morton does not rate them high . " Reagan does n't know what goes on beyond the continental shelf , " he says . He is more afraid of Johnson 's switching to an end-the-war position . Johnson , Morton says , is the canniest politician alive , and once he becomes convinced that an overwhelming majority of the voters want out of Vietnam he may act . But he can not do it as Morton did  --  with a candid avowal of error . To rehabilitate the Republican Party requires a dump movement too , the dumpee being Senator Dirksen . What sensible , civilized men like Case , Morton and Cooper think of the old Illinois vaudevillian is better not quoted , but it can be imagined . As long as Dirksen speaks for the party , their work is not done . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited but effective logic in the two-party system . Morton wants to give the voters a chance to exploit this logic , and in this he demonstrates his political realism . Cogs Electronic data processing ( see " The Punchcard Snoopers " by Phil Hirsch , p. 369 ) is one of the most intoxicating techniques of our age , and there is scarcely a major activity in the country , government or private , commercial or social , that is not busy applying the ubiquitous punchcard to its problems and functions . With a data bank , every citizen 's medical record could be available almost instantly to any hospital in the country ; with a data bank , a fire department could know within minutes how many people lived in a blazing building . The historian Richard Hofstadter foresees that , with a data bank , the public could be polled any day , and if necessary every day , on matters of sovereign concern : the franchise might again be as responsive to the public weal as it was among the Athenians in the brief glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a data bank , an instant Republican Party could be created in the one-party state of Arkansas . Yet Mr. Hirsch contemplates this electronic marvel with acute uneasiness and Edgar Friedenberg ( " Hooked on Law Enforcement , " p. 360 ) suggests why . Technical innovations do not develop in a vacuum , or even according to their own nature . They are shaped by the social and political environment that spawns them . And , as Mr. Friedenberg describes in detail , this American decade is scarcely an ideal time in which to store away for instant availability the salient facts about every human being in the country . Such a compendium of almost godlike knowledge implies an almost godlike forbearance , but ours is an age when sanctions upon the individual , and techniques for applying them , grow ever more pressing . As Mr Hirsch shows , the facts about you that are solicited ostensibly for one purpose are readily and indiscriminately passed along for quite other purposes . Even when your vital statistics are not keyed to your name , they go into a pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand others must conform in getting a loan , insurance , or a job . It is not who you are that counts , it is how you fit Behind this lies something that Mr. Friedenberg calls the spirit of fascism . He is not evoking concentration camps by that phrase but rather the disposition to treat people as cogs in a consensus . It is the peculiar faculty of the computer that it can reduce the most diverse and idiosyncratic data to cogs . There is no doubt that it can thus produce knowledge that was hitherto beyond our grasp . Nor is there doubt that much of this knowledge could prove valuable to a society whose complexity grows at a bewildering speed . But there is nevertheless every reason to doubt that we are prudent to feed these machines with information about ourselves for the use of institutions whose motives we do not know and have no reason to trust . The computer revolution is at least as radical as was the industrial revolution , and is capable of as much distortion of human lives . CDC Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention here September 30 was not so spectacular as the conference on New Politics a month earlier in Chicago . However , Long Beach may prove to be more significant than Chicago . For the first time since our military adventure began in Vietnam , a group of Democrats is challenging President Johnson and his war policy within the electoral machinery of the party . The CDC , which represents 33,000 members and is the largest volunteer Democratic organization in the country , will send an antiwar slate of delegates to the 1968 National Convention . It was all accomplished under Robert 's Rules of Order and rather quietly , too . The decision to enter a peace slate was never in doubt . Twenty-one CDC directors who disapproved of the move had resigned and did not attempt to block the convention action . Those who spoke against the slate did so obviously for the record . While they spoke ( " President Johnson is more interested in peace than anyone here , " and " let 's not split the party " ) , the delegates listened passively , occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all over , what the convention had done with comparatively little fuss was to give 5 million California Democrats an opportunity next June to conduct a referendum on the war . Among the delegates supporting CDC 's position was Edmund G. Brown , Jr. , son of former Gov . Edmund G. Brown of California , who is among those in opposition . The political consequences may be serious for the West Coast Democrats . Charles Warren , state Democratic chairman , said the decision of the CDC " may well divide the efforts of those who share its goals . " A member of Warren 's law office sought and accepted a place on the steering committee . When the peace slate was proposed at the last regular CDC convention in March , even its supporters had little hope of success It was more a moral gesture than a practical political move . But the September 30 convention takes on real significance in the light of a recent profes-356 sional poll , which reported that a peace slate at this time would get 39 per cent of the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco attorney and president of CDC , and other CDC leaders are now convinced their slate will win if policy on Vietnam is unchanged . Chicago was a shake of a fist at white America by a collection of Left radicals thoroughly alienated from the country 's political institutions . Long Beach was a sharp dissent from the war , but also an expression of confidence that reform within the democratic process can bring the blacks and the poor into the American mainstream . On Vietnam , the peace slate is pledged to support a party platform and candidate committed ( 1 ) to an immediate halt in the bombing of North Vietnam , ( 2 ) to negotiation ? " including all participants " ? and ( 3 ) to international guarantees for nonintervention in Vietnam . The convention 's keynote speaker , Dr. John Kenneth Galbraith , national chairman of Americans for Democratic Action and former Ambassador to India , favored a step-by-step de-escalation " There is logic , " he said , " on the side of those who say we should simply withdraw . . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade others . And it is more in the mood of the American people to take things by steps " Liberals and radicals , Galbraith said , are persuaded we must get out of Vietnam . Their task is to persuade public opinion " Let us keep a clear distinction between political persuasion and political catharsis " Power and Responsibility Three recent events ? Carl B. Stokes 's victory in the ? Democratic primary for the office of mayor of Cleveland , the National Conference of Negro Elected Officials in Chicago , the naming of five Negroes to the new nine-member District of Columbia City Council , and of Walter E Washington as the city 's new Commissioner ( in effect its mayor ) ? raise issues of major importance . Perhaps now the voices of elected and appointed Negro officials , A who have the responsibility that goes with power , will be heard above the noise and clamor of the black na tionalists . The election of Mr Stokes , and of Richard ? Hatcher in Gary , Ind. , should they be successful , would represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Negro communities , where it 4 belongs . Cleveland , torn with racial unrest , managed to escape major violence this last summer largely because Negro voters did not want to injure Mr. Stokes 's chances ( he received 95 per cent of the Negro vote in the primary ) . But today Negro elected officials are placed in an extremely difficult position . For the most part , they are middle-class Negroes . In some respects they too have been 0 out of touch with sentiment in the " crisis ghettos . " The Conference of Elected Negro Officials grew out of the realization , on the part of certain Negro officials in Cali ? fornia , that they were not as fully aware of conditions in Watts as they had imagined themselves to be . Today the Negro official must keep in close and continuous communication with the residents of the " crisis ghettos " and must be able to articulate their demands If he can not THE NATiotv/October 16 , 1967 trouble . At the same time he must be able to communicate effectively with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairly promptly  --  some of the more urgent needs of the Negro community his tenure in office will be brief and inglorious . A great deal is riding , therefore , on the quality of the elected Negro leadership ( some 500 Negroes are in office now and after November there will be more ) . But even more depends on the response of the white community . Locally and nationally , it must respond quickly , intelligently and sensitively to the needs of the Negro community as voiced by its elected officials . And since , as the experience in Cleveland , Gary and Memphis indicates , Negro candidates can not rely on strong party support , they must have nonpartisan backing to win and , once elected , to accomplish what needs to be done Any attempt by the white community to " use " elected Negro officials as lightning rods , as by electing them without giving them the support they need once in office , will backfire in the end . Negro officials must not be " used " ; they must be supported on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The emergence of a responsible Negro leadership in positions of political power , particularly in the large cities , is essential to any solution of the present racial situation . But in the end the entire community will get the kind of Negro leadership it deserves  --  responsible if the whites act responsibly , irresponsible if they do not . ' The Damned Fool ' It takes a lot of courage for a young man to go to Vietnam with an infantry battalion and maybe return with his leg shot off , or in a flag-draped coffin . It takes even more courage to refuse to go The latter course also calls for a certain amount of enlightenment It is easier for a draftee to submit to being sent overseas if he does n't know  --  perhaps would rather not know  --  what the war is about . The ratio of the few who have that special kind of courage , in contrast to the many who do what they are told , can be estimated by the experience of 23-year-old army private , Ronald Lockman , described in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from North Philadelphia . " He was drafted five months ago and , although he was a member of the W. E. B. DuBois Club , went through his training uneventfully  --  as " a good soldier , " he says . He is not a pacifist ; he would have fought in World War II had he been of military age . But when his unit was to be shipped to Vietnam , he held a press conference in San Francisco with his lawyer , Terrence Hallinan , to explain why he was n't going . Then he reported for duty at the Oakland Army base and stood with ninety-nine fellow infantrymen , rifle at his side . The ninety-nine boarded buses for Travis Air Force Base , Lockman stood his ground . Now he awaits trial on charges of disobeying the lawful order of a commissioned officer and missing a scheduled transfer , offenses which carry a possible eleven-year term at hard labor and dishonorable discharge . The ratio of 99 to 1 is not Lockman 's fault . He did some canvassing among the members of his company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men , white and black alike , supported his stand but feared being called unpatriotic and un-American  --  not to speak of eleven years in jail . Lockman explains his own readiness to defy the Army by saying that his fight was back home in the Philadelphia ghettos where he was born and raised . " I will not go 10,000 miles away to be a tool of the oppressors of the Vietnamese people , " he says . " I feel it is about time to follow my own mind and do what I know is right . " The press and TV crew were not allowed past the gate at the Oakland base . Seeing the cluster of people , a woman driver stopped her car and asked , " What 's going on ? " A reporter told her . " Oh , is that all ? " the woman said " The damned fool ! " Blind conformity is built into the social system , but history often reveals the Lockman type of " damned fool " in another light . Many years after the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , wrote : " I do not think there was ever a more wicked war than that waged by the United States on Mexico . I thought so at the time , when I was a youngster , only I had not moral courage enough to resign " His name was Ulysses S. Grant . Beer in the Gallery Ever since the cold war got into full career , connoisseurs have noted that the satirist 's occupation was gone , at least in the realm of politics . The method of satire is to exaggerate , but when the events themselves are manifestly absurd or vicious , what is left for travesty ? The satirist becomes merely a reporter A current instance is that of the observers who were dispatched as an inspired Presidential gimmick to attest to the validity of the Vietnamese election Admitting that they had no means of detecting fraud , they nevertheless obliged the President by marveling at the emergence of democracy in South Vietnam . Three of the observers were political scientists whose background was noted in a Nation editorial , " The Experts " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overlooked , they certified the elections as being on the up-and-up , or at least no more tainted than our own . But what happened then ? Troublemakers in the South Vietnam National Assembly , not satisfied with the American verdict , persisted in investigating anew . A special elections subcommittee recommended by a vote of 16 to 2 that the elections be invalidated on grounds of irregularities The Assembly had to accept or reject the report of the committee If they accepted it , political chaos would ensue . The members had another reason for rejecting the report and confirming the victors , Lieut . Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu and Air Vice Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky , in the offices of President and Vice President , respectively . In the gallery , drinking beer , sat Brig . Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan , the South Vietnamese Beria , who can jail anybody in the country and who had already jailed peace candidate Truong Dinh Dzu , who scored the highest vote among the civilian candidates .

Many applicants who do n't conform to the life pattern programed into the credit bureau computer complex will undoubtedly alter their habits . The others simply will be denied credit , on the basis of guilt by association , because they belong to a wrong population subset In the automobile insurance industry , guilt by association already has been honed into a valuable marketing tool . The House Judiciary Committee recently began inquiring into the widespread practice of canceling policies " without sufficient justification , and often on the basis of whimsy or flimsy excuse .

In the next ten days , the committee received more than 120 complaints from individuals who claimed they had been denied coverage , or had been forced to pay excessive premiums because of age , sex , color , economic background or place of residence .

The 1970 census will , among its other questions , ask for detailed figures on individual income  --  farm and non-farm earnings , interest and dividend income , welfare payments , unemployment and other insurance benefits . Women will be asked how many babies they ever had . Those individuals born after April , 1953 , will report whether they worked at any time in the week preceding the census , and if so , how many hours ; where the employment was located ; how the individual traveled there ; whether he was absent at any time during the week because of illness , vacation or other reason ; whether he was looking for work , was unemployed or laid off ; the name of his employer ; his occupation , duties and job title . There will be equally detailed questions on marital status and living accommodations . Those who rent homes or apartments , for example , will have to tell how much they pay the landlord , what they spend on utilities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked to only a sample of the population . But this should n't stop the Census Bureau 's computers from massaging the data into matching studies tailored to the individual needs of its customers . While names will be kept confidential , the rest of the information on each census questionnaire will be an open book . Pitchmen of all types and moral complexions will be led straight to their marks , and the marks will pay most of the bill . f Beer in the Gallery ( Continued flom page 357 ) bassy was dampened slightly by an outburst on the part of Phan Khac Suu , the chairman .
