A Story by MIRA MICHAL ROYAL ASCOT W H A T does one wear ? " I asked gloomily as I looked from the elegantly printed invitation to the window , which was lashed by torrents of rain . " It tells you plainly on the attached instructions , " answered my husband . " What 1 would like to know is which horse to back . " I looked at the instructions and found they made very interesting reading . The gentlemen were supposed to wear morning coats and top hats as well as decorations . The ladies , " afternoon dresses and hats , " Departure time was ten o'clock in the morning . Nothing was said about coats and umbrellas , but after all Royal Ascot was still two weeks away and one could hope for the best . I had in my closet a garden-party dress dreamed up just before our departure from Warsaw to London by a ' little " dressmaker . It was , naturally , made of flowered organza ; its length was neither here nor there ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-heeled sandals , and long white gloves . I looked once more at the weather outside , shuddered , and decided to find out a thing or two about horses . Every morning a heap of newspapers was put on my desk . On that memorable day I turned for the first time in my life to the sports page . I soon found out that every English paper had a racing expert who selected winners for his readers . For the sake of efficiency I thought I should stick to one , and not bother with hiscompetitors . But which one should I choose ? The solution came that very afternoon at a cocktail party . While in the midst of a very conversation , and suddenly displayed strong views  --  a refreshing change from the usual diplomatic wishy-washiness on any theme . A small crowd gathered around us , and the party became one of the successes of that season . All this would n't have helped much if Lord G. , who had been doing most of the talking , had not drawn me aside and whispered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one man on this ? Island who knows , and he is the racing expert of the Daily TV oYker . Now do n't tell anybody , it 's just between you and me . " He bent down closer . " And another thing , never het on the King 's horses . No good at all , you know . " This was the best advice I could possibly hope to get . It had its positive part  --  namely what to do  --  and its negative one  --  what not to do . Could anyone ask for more ? WHEN we woke up on Ascot day , a steady drizzle was coming down from a dark sky , and it was cold . I switched on the electric heater , ignored the garden-party dress , and pulled out a black woolen suit and a colorful hat . At that very moment the telephone rang . One of the elder ambassadresses wanted to know what I was planning to wear . I told her and she gasped in horror . But did n't you read the instructions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . Besides we are going to the Royal Enclosure , which means that we are guests of the King , and you should know , my dear , that black is never worn at court except during periods of mourning . You do not want to offend the Royal Family , do you ? " That was the last thing I wanted to do , and I dragged my silk dress out of the closet . My husband now appeared all dressed up in morning coat , holding top hat , white gloves , and umbrella , and promptly declared that he would not be seen with me in that outfit on a day like this . I explained to him the rules of the game , and in silence he dragged out an old jacket of mine made of what the New York fur trade likes to call processed lamb , and threw it around my shoulders . But it is black , " I protested . " Never mind , " he answered firmly , " I shall take the responsibility for this upon myself . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at you . " It was now time to leave , and I looked frantically among the heap of morning papers for the Daily Worker , but it was not to be found . I had to give up , and we climbed into the old Embassy Chrysler and started on the long and slow drive to Ascot . Owen , the English driver , who had been with the Polish Embassy for a quarter of a century , looked me over quickly and discreetly . He glanced at my sandaled feet , my flimsy dress , my big hat , my umbrella , and fur piece and smiled approvingly . I knew I had done nothing wrong . It was one of the mysteries of British life . We settled down in the back of the car with a rug across our knees , and my husband proceeded to study the newspapers which he had taken from my desk . After a while he asked inc pointedly what I had done with the Daily Worker . I explained that I had been looking for Mira Michal is the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country at the United Nations in New York . By her own admittance , Mrs. Mic/ud 's rather sketchy acquaintance with the racecourse stems from the days when the Michals occupied the Polish Embassy in London shortly after World War II . Mrs. Michal writes a New York letter for one of Poland 's weeklies and is the author of a humorous novel published in Poland.it myself but that it was nowhere to be found , and we decided to try to buy a copy at Ascot . The road was crowded with big black limousines . Like all the other ladies , I peeped unashamedly into the cars in order to see what they were wearing , and felt reassured . They were all in printed silks . W E ARRIVED at the gates of Ascot racecourse at about noon , and stepped out into the wind and the rain , making a great effort not to stretch our limbs like dogs who had lain ton long in front of the fire . We had to be on our best behavior , as a sizable crowd was watching the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was different from any other in the world  --  oblivious of the weather , polite , gay , craning necks without pushing , and making " jolly remarks . " Separately we looked strange enough but as a group we were hilarious . The men walked with great dignity and self-assurance , pushing out their chests and pulling in their stomachs . ( Most of them had to , as their morning coats were much too tight , and seemed to date back at least to the Boer War . ) They had red or white carnations in their buttonholes and badges with their names written in unreadable handwriting . They were armed with field glasses , racing programs , and umbrellas , and somehow managed to hold onto their ladies ' elbows as well without looking burdened or harassed . Their ladies , on the other hand , looked as if they were having a terrible time . The heels of their flimsy summer shoes were sinking deep into the loose gravel , their full skirts were billowing in the breeze , they had to hold onto umbrella , handbag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously and with the usual number of hands . The only exception were the Oriental ladies . Tightly cocooned in their saris , with heavy English tweed coats unashamedly thrown across their shoulders , their heads covered in shawls , their feet in flat sandals , they presented a picture of composed comfort . After careful scrutiny by a number of stewards , we were given name badges and programs and allowed into the Enclosure . We immediately looked around for a newsstand but there was no such thing . We realized that we were very hungry and a long queue in front of a striped tent looked starved enough to be a luncheon queue . We joined it greedily and moved slowly on in stony silence in the most dignified line of overdressed , bejeweled , and frozen people imaginable . After about half an hour we found ourselves under the canopy , folded our umbrellas , and were permitted to buy our meal tickets for seven shillings and sixpence . Fifteen minutes later , a fabulously elegant headwaiter ushered us toward a table for six where four gentlemen were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thought was the menu but what turned out to be the racing programs . Menus there were none . We were given a few seconds to make up our minds between cold salmon or cold chicken and ice cream or strawberries with cream . We had the salmon and the strawberries and the only warm thing we had was a dry martini with a lot of bitters in it . Since our table companions were strangers to each other , they chewed noiselessly with the slightly offended expression which , as I later discovered , is the shy Englishman 's standard social weapon . Two of them had copies of the Daily Worker carefully folded inside out in the side pockets of their morning coats and one had the racing column clipped out and neatly folded into the pages of his racing program . I envied them but there was nothing I could do but peep discreetly and without result . W E LEFT the tent still hungry and decided to proceed immediately into the Diplomatic Box where we thought we would be warm and comfortable . We made our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box was wide open to the elements . It was furnished with several rows of hard , wooden , and rather damp benches . A group of old hands among the diplomats already occupied the choice seats , those adjoining a side glass wall which divided us from the Royal Box . We were greeted by the chef de protocol , shook numerous hands , said " good afternoon " in several languages , and sat down in the last row , from which we had a good view of the whole show  --  the racetrack , the Royal Box , the elegantly milling crowd below us , the men in the Jockey Club at the left , and on the other side of the track , thousands upon thousands of ordinary citizens . These were dressed warmly and sensibly in tweeds , rubber-soled shoes or galoshes , wrapped in raincoats and hoods , eating hot dogs and fish and chips and jellied eel and drinking steaming cups of coffee and tea . Behind them was a large amusement park with carousels and devil 's wheels , and probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of these lucky commoners were armed with opera glasses but the majority carried that great British invention , the minor on a stick . Like all great inventions it is simple . The user simply turns his back to whatever he chooses to observe , lifts his stick high into the air , and looks into the mirror which he has previously fixed at the end of it . The view of a crowd turning its back collectively on a parade or procession can be very puzzling to the uninitiated tourist but he will soon get the hang of the whole business . III contrast to that crowd , the one in the Jockey Club seemed as quiet as a funeral . Beyond the Jockey Club there was sheer bedlam . A teeming mass of bookies stood in the rain with their arms in the air , moving their fingers in deaf-mute madness . It was fascinating . From the well of our diplomatic wooden staircase now slowly and majestically emerged the best-dressed group of diplomats ' wives in their Diors and Balenciagas , their Faths and Balmains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hush fell over the crowd , followed by a collective murmur of " There they come . " All heads turned east , and there , at the cud of the long , green track , we saw a toylike procession of glittering carriages , drawn by , yes , white horses . The men in the jockey Club stood up as if by command , and raised their enormous field glasses simultaneously to their eyes , the crowd at the Royal Enclosure rushed to the white railing lining the track  --  while on the opposite side children were lifted onto fatherly shoulders and sticks with mirrors were raised into the sky . There was a sigh of " Ai n't she lovely " as the pastel-clad royal ladies drove by . The sky played its part very nicely indeed ; the clouds parted and the pale sun came out . " Royal weather , " murmured the chef de protocol dutifully . In the carriages the ladies waved their white-gloved hands in a well-studied and automatic gesture , and the gentlemen raised their toppers about two and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dropping down in deep curtsies , muddying the hems of their dresses . The King and Queen were in the first carriage , then the Princesses , the Dukes and Duchesses , while lesser royalty and plain aristocracy followed . As the procession reached our box we stood and remained on our feet until they all settled down in the adjoining box . The minute they did , the sky decided that enough is enough and the rain started again . It was now hours since we had left the house and the only horses we had seen were the ones that had pulled the royal carriages . Since I was frankly getting bored and tired , I inquired meekly whether it would not be possible to go home'and to bed with a hot water bottle . My request was dismissed as a had joke and I turned my attention . to the dresses again . I noticed that all the ladies in the Royal Box were dressed in various pastel shades  --  pinks , mauves , and powder blues  --  and that the Queen even had a fox boa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck it out for a few minutes longer in their fragile gowns and then wrapped themselves resignedly in various bits of fur , thus ruining the whole effect . My husband suggested that we could make the whole thing slightly more exciting by putting some money on one of the horses . We opened our umbrellas and followed the crowd into the paddock . The horses looked all alike to me , but we naturally made conversation with the people standing next to us and soon learned to shake our heads and say something about the fact that the track was wet , which naturally made all the difference in the world . In the first race I backed number seven , which I have always considered my lucky number . It came in last . My husband put a pound note on something called " Happy Holiday , " which came in third and paid him a few shillings . He was radiant , and began to enjoy himself visibly . In the lines leading to the betting booths not a single lady was to be seen , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My husband asked me to please leave him alone and return to the box . I strolled in the direction of the tea tent , having asked him to back number two for me in the next race , for the excellent reason that we had two children . In the tea queue I found a buxom , middle-aged woman whom 1 had met at a dinner party a few days before ( and whose name I did not remember ) in the company of a very chic friend in a black coat and cafe-au-bait accessories . They were deeply involved in criticizing somebody else 's children , and when I managed to get a word in I complimented the lady on her outfit  --  the only smart one , I thought and said so , in the whole crowd . I wanted to know why she dared to wear black . She laughed and explained to me that she was barred from the Royal Enclosure because some years ago she had been involved in a divorce case . The fact that she belonged to one of the oldest families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eighth , and that one of her ancestors had been beheaded in the Tower did n't make any difference . She was barred from the Court of St. James and all its functions forever . This lady was therefore not bound by any protocol rules and could wear and do precisely what she wanted so long as she stayed away from certain places . This fascinating piece of information made my day , and we parted after having had our tea and some sandwiches made with margarine and fish paste . The divorced lady returned to her unroyal and undiplomatic vantage point , Mrs. X to her husband in the jockey Club , and I to my wooden bench in the Diplomatic Box . My husband only waved his hand when I asked how we had done in the last race and 1 concluded that my theory of lucky numbers was no good on the racecourse . Something else would have to be tried . There was a bit of excitement in the Diplomatic Box because the main race was approaching and considerable amounts of money were at stake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the " Pink Clouds , " " Apple Blossoms , " " Curry Powders , - and " Rosy Futures " we saw suddenly the name " Russian Hero " stare us straight in the face . We smiled , looked at each other , and my husband promptly left the box for the betting booth . When he returned he handed me a ticket with a number seven on it . I made a long face as I had been let clown by seven earlier in the clay . The diplomats were now showing each other their tickets but not a single seven was to be seen . Whatever " Russian Hero " was , he certainly was not a favorite . When the race started somebody lightheartedly offered me field glasses which I kept glued to my eyes for the duration of the race . Our horse led from the very beginning and came in first without the slightest effort whatsoever . It looked too easy for words . Y husband casually spread the news of his good foriune among his colleagues as we went to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We now decided to call it a day and start for home before the big rush . It took us half an hour to find Owen , who was obviously having a wonderful time on the wrong side of the track . They called him repeatedly over the loudspeaker system , and he filially brought the car around still panting and puffing . While he held the door open for me I saw sticking out of his coat pocket a copy of the Daily Worker . My husband stretched his hand out silently and with an embarrassed smile Owen handed him the paper . As we sank into the well-worn seats of the old car , I kicked off my shoes , covered myself with a rug , and peeped over my husband 's shoulder to see what the Daily Worker 's expert had to say . The headline was " RussIAN HERO FOR FIRST PLACE . " Two clays later I met Lord G. again . By now he considered me a horsy woman worth talking to , and we struck up a conversation about Royal Ascot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to know . " Oh yes , I had Russian Hero in the main race , " I said casually . " Very good , very good . " " Did n't you ? He was recommended by your favorite expert , you know . " " Yes , yes , " he said and sniffed in that vague , Oxonian way . " but , you see , 1 naturally thought that in this particular case the man was politically biased . " And so slid everybody else , for that matter , " he added . " That is why you got such excellent odds . " He excused himself , and went off in search of a drink .
