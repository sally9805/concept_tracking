txt Last fall , Yale University established a Boston Investment company to manage its $500-million endowment . The University of Chicago , which manages its own , adopted a new investment policy last January to get more return from its $287-million . In recent weeks , Amherst College , the Colorado College land Scripps College have contracted for the services of John W. Bristol &; Co. , ? an endowment management company that already handles Princeton University , Howard University and a half-dozen others . Stanford University has just recently made arrangements for investment counseling with the Fund American group . $12-Billion in Funds Pressed by the need for more money , and prodded by the Ford Foundation , the trustees of American colleges and universities are beginning to be more adventuresome with the $12-billion they hold in endowment funds . The trend is toward more professional money management . Some institutions are turning to outside professional assistance . Others are hiring their own experts and giving more searching thought to their objectives and how to accomplish them . The search for funds reaches even to questioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate , the investment of endowment funds earns $400-million to $500-million a year , which is only about 5 per cent of the budgets of the endowed institutions ? mostly private , but some public . Thus , more daring investment can only reduce , not close , the money gap . // George Bundy , president of the Ford Foundation , gave public expression to the whole issue of underexploited endowments in his first annual report last year . " It is far from clear that trustees have reason to be proud of their performance in making money for their colleges , " he said . " We recognize the risks of unconventional investing , but the true test of performance in the handling of money is the record of achievement , not the opinion of the respectable . " While the Ford Foundation has been challenged on its record of achievement in handling its own big portfolio , most response to Mr. Bundy 's basic point  --  that performance can and must be improved  --  has been favorable . On the essential detail of how to get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester , which already performs well , got there partly through astute linvestment in Xerox Corporation 's predecessor company 1when the price of its stock was ' 56 cents a share . It is close to $280 now . Rochester 's Treasurer Hulbert W. Tripp says , however , " It would have been easy to sell out and take our profit when the stock reached $10 . Two years later It was lower , and no one was saying we were so smart then . " 9,000 Acres for Stanford Stanford was blessed with 9,000 acres of Pao Alto , Calif. , assembled by Leland Stanford . The university is bound by the terms of the gift to hold it forever . So it has developed part of the land for an industrial park and an 80-acre shopping center , which Almon Manspeaker , secretary of the trustees ' investment committee , calls " a little gold mine " . And then there are cases of opportunities missed . Sears , Roebuck &; Co. gave the Encyclopaedia Britannica to the University of Chicago . But Chicago 's trustees decided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it needed capital , so it sold out to William Benton , the advertising tycoon , politician , and Chicago trustee and encyclopedia millionaire . Chicago did not lose all , however . It gets royalties , and they came to a tidy $2-million last year . By nature , the responsibility of trusteeship breeds caution . By definition , college and university trustees are ultimately responsible for their institutions and their institutions ' money . The basic rule of trusteeship is the " prudent man " rule , from a Massachusetts . court decision in 1830 . It says that the trustee who acts with prudence can not be challenged on legal grounds , It is commonly interpreted to mean " careful " or " conservative " ? blue-chip stocks and gilt edge bonds , even though some of the best of these turn out not to be the best investment . Restrictions on Trustees There can also be specific restrictions on trustees , laid down by the donors of the money , as in Stanford 's case . Lately , student and faculty groups at some institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use endowment funds to put pressure on South Africa because of its policy of racial apartheid . The suggestion is that the universities should not invest in companies and banks which do business in or with South Africa . Just last week a commission of Cornell trustees , university officials , faculty members and students concluded that " social and moral concerns " might be relevant in shaping investment ' policy , but that it was also , relevant to consider whether an investment has a direct imPact or a slightly indirect one . The reaction of other fund maangers has been similar : They deplore racism , but they do not think that the investment or non-investment of their funds affects it much . Endowments are typically handled by a finance committee of members of the board of trustees . The chief criticism of this procedure is that it treats endowment management as a sideline . However , this arrangement has many variations , some of which work quite effectively . The chairman of Wesleyan University 's finance committee conceived an unusual deal in the early 1950 's by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ? publisher of the " My Weekly Reader " newspaper for schools  --  and in the process increased its endowment 10 times in 15 years . John W. Bristol , the New York manager of almost a dozen institution 's funds , says , " Finance committee meetings are not the way business works . The job takes seven days a week . You have to be flexible and ready to move . " Rochester 's Treasurer Hulbert W. Tripp agrees . Both men also agree on the wisdom of holding as few investments as feasible  --  two or three dozen , perhaps , carefully selected . Mr. Bristol has a special taste for deals with an unusual lextra feature , such as warrants to buy more later . Mr. Tripp reserves a small sum he calls " Funny Money , " for speculative investment  --  such as Haloid , the original Xerox company . The statistical background to university finance is as follows : In 1961  --  the latest figure ' , compiled by the U.S. Office of Education  --  public and private institutions of higher learning spent close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the private institutions , more than one-third of their revenues came from tuition and other student fees , and an equal share from government aid . For public institutions , their principal source is state , Federal and local funds . The Office of Education reported that there were 458 private and 71 public universities and liberal arf colleges with endowments of $500,000 or more , of which only 180 had $5-million or more . In other words , a few institutions have most of the money . The endowments of private institutions were almost six times as much as those of public institutions , and the grand total was estimated at that time to be about $10-billion . More current , but less complete , figures are published each year by Boston Fund  --  a mutual fund  --  for investors who are interested in knowing what the college funds are doing . Its 1967 report on 70 of the larger funds showed that in the aggregate they had 92 per cent of their money in securities , mostly common stocks , and 8 per cent in income - producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's campus and plant are not counted . ) Common stock holdings ranged from as high as 80 per cent to as low as 39 per cent . The most commonly held stocks were International Business Machines Corporation , General Motors Corporation and Standard Oil Cmpany ( New Jersey ) . Each was held by more than 40 of the 70 institutions . B crude arithmetic , Bosn to Fund d calculates that its 70 reported funds earned between 3 per cent and 5.2 per cent on their money last year . But crude arithmetic has its pitfalls . How , for instance , can Stanford , with the good fortune to be stuck with lucrative real estate , be compare &; with a college that makes its money on wit and risk , or has failed to make it because it lacked them ? A Ford Foundation committee is trying to develop a fair yardstick , so institutions can compare their performances . One inescapable limitation on endowment management is the restrictions imposed on many gifts at the time they are given . Stanford 's happy restriction on its real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also bound by the same benefactor to keep most of the portfolio investments in bonds , first mortgages and the like . Under the leadership of Her- ' bert Hoover , then a trustee , the university went to court in 1934 and won a new interpretation that permitted investment in common stocks . The nature and rigor of endowment restrictions is also under study by the Ford Foundation committee . There is a suspicion that the curbs are more imagined than real . When a benefactor says , for instance , that the university may use the " interest " earned by his bequest , does this limit the university to making only the type of investments which pay in-terest ? The most fundamental controversy under way now is over the question of what " endowment income " really is . Should a university use only the interest , dividents or other current earnings of its investments ? Or may it prudently spend out of capital , too ? Classical truth says that dipping into capital is evil . Modern theory  --  nurtured by the aforementioned pressing need for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market value of an investment can be used along with the earnings ( yield ) of the investment . Some Opposition For example , the University of Rochester might reasonably spend some of what it has gained on the skyrocketing price of its Xerox holdings , in addition to the Xerox dividends which it spends already . But Mr. Tripp is against it. ? " Some people seem to think that if you take a bit of the ammunition away the aggressive battle can go on . " Mr. Bristol says that " if you 've done the right kind of thing for your fund you do n't have to invade capital . " Yale has started doing it , to the extent of a specified small amount of its gains each year . But its latest Treasurer 's Report says rather defensively that this was only , done as " the last resort . " Harvard , in a new pamphlet explaining Its finances , explains that it has " resisted this temptation . " Chicago 's Treasurer J. Parker Halls says , " We worried about our endowment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of schemes . " His university adopted a double standard in January . Funds whose principal can not , by the terms of the gift . be touched are being invested for high yield . Funds whose principal is unrestricted are being invested for potential growth . To the extent that the yield of the growth money is less than that of the highyield money , the difference will be made up by dipping into the growth capital gains . Bundy was not the first to observe that American institutions of higher learning were not getting the most for their money . But , by giving Ford Foundation prominence to the matter , he started some to do some thinking and uncour aged others who were already thinking themselves .
