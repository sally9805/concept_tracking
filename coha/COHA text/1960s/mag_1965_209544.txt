Sweating , burbling , belching , he shouts his anguish to the world as the curtain rises . It is the beginning of a breathtaking performance that lasts longer than Hamlet and is as taxing as Lear . It is Nicol Williamson playing the lead in John Osborne 's Inadmissible Evidence ( TIME , Dec. 10 ) the most bravura performance by a newcomer that Broadway has seen in over a decade . <P> Reports of Williamson 's skyrocketing fame and fiery behavior preceded him . In England , he became notorious for demanding his audience 's complete and rapt attention ; when latecomers interrupted the play , he had the curtain lowered and began again . Rehearsing the London hit in Philadelphia , he learned that Producer David Merrick had summarily dismissed British Director Anthony Page ( who directed Williamson in more than 20 of the 60-odd plays he performed in repertory ) . In a rage , Williamson confronted Merrick backstage , threw a glass of beer in his face , then flattened him with a right to the jaw . Williamson later apologized , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Anguish &; Passion . As the angriest of the angry young men , Williamson would seem made to order to play Osborne 's Look-Ahead-in-Anger . The fact that Williamson is only 28 and Osborne 's hero is a disillusioned 39 presented no problems ; Williamson simply aged a decade on the spot . " I felt I could portray a middle-aged man just from seeing my father and friends go through the same phases of life . " So perfectly does he capture the anguish , passion and humor of Osborne 's spent hero on the verge of a breakdown that critics have been tempted to put it down as a feat of perfect typecasting . Ironically , it is a criticism that has repeatedly plagued Williamson throughout his career . In London , he was applauded for his performance in The Ginger Man while critics wondered aloud how he could do anything else . When he appeared in a production of Sweeney Agonistes , playgoers found it impossible to believe that T. S. Eliot created the hilarious Apeneck Sweeney before Williamson was born . <P> Gut Work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire . Born near Glasgow , he studied at a Birmingham dramatic school ( " absolutely nonsensical " ) , served in the paratroopers ( " Two more pounds a week , and that can buy a lot of booze " ) , then hit the long repertory road . <P> Now at the top , he finds neither the view nor his fellow actors inspiring . " England is a failing nation , a dying race , " he declares . " Writers are expressing anguish and self-destruction , always interesting to watch . " As for himself , Williamson fancies the role of drinking man 's actor , insisting that brainwork is for authors and directors , gut work for performers . Shying away from thought , intensely hypochondriacal , he insists : " Booze , that 's the really important thing . It keeps you from thinking too much , bless it . "
