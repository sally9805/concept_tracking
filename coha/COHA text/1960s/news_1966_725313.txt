txt JODRELL BANK , England , Feb. 4 011T  --  The most " sensation al " pictures ever received from the moon convinced British scientists 10 - day that the moon 's surface is a hard tho spongy- looking substance  --  like pumice stone - satisfactory for landings by heavy vehicles and men . The pictures from Russia 's Luna 9 appeared to show a dusty and rocky desert surface , dotted with pebbles and craters as small as an average dinner plate . The scientists said the pietitres show the surface dust is not deep and tend to confirm the view that the moon 's surface is a " hard sponge-like substance like pumice stone . " Pictures Recorded " It would be perfectly satisfactory for landing heavy vehicles and men , " Sir Bernard Lovell , director of Jodrell Bank observatory , said . The observatory picked up four pictures of the world 's first televised moonscape transmitted to an impatient world from Russia 's Luna .9 . The British scientists stole a march on the Russians by being first to give the public prints of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a million miles away . Public Must Wait They believed their pictures might be even better than those the Russians are getting . In Moscow , an official announcement said only that the public will be able to see Luna 9 television pictures " in due course . " It gave no idea what to expect . Lowell said the " fantastic " pictures appear to destroy the theory that the moon 's dust is many feet thick . After viewing the four pictures , Lovell said he now will " support the theory that the dust is only a few inches thick . " A Tremendous Moment One picture showed a sweep of lunar landscape . Another bore a black patch which appeared to he the shadow of the Luna 9 , the world 's first apace vehicle to make a soft landing on the moon . " It was clearly a very tremendous moment when the first photograph from man-made cameras working on the surface of the moon was received at Jodrell , " Lovell said . " 1t is quite fantastic . They ore the most sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists quickly reprinted the pictures for release to the public . ' Lovell said the last picture received at Jodrell Bank was the best . Dusty and Rocky He said it appeared to show the moon 's surface is dusty and rocky . The picture , of " amazing quality , " he said , seems to show features which must be only a matter of inches across . " I think it must be showing even individual pebbles on the moon , " Lovell said . One picture showed a moon crater which appeared to be only one foot in diameter . The pictures appeared to be taken from a camera working about 6 to 10 feet above the moon 's surface . Lovell estimated the distance of the lunar horizon on the pictures as " a few miles away " from a horizontallyaimed camera . When he said the British pictures may be better than those being received by the Russians , Lovell explained that British reception equipment was getting Luna 9 signals " at maximum strength . " The British scientists picked up the television broadcasts from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest . They translated the signals into pictures by using a facsimile machine borrowed from a newspaper . Russ Have Advantage The British scientists said the four pictures otavalued any pictures previously taken in the history of astronomy in the vital aspect that surface features could be depicted in detail against the background of the lunar sky . Even the close-up pictures taken by the American Ranger space probes could show the moon 's surface only flatly , the scientists said . In the American space pictures the moon 's mountain slopes and depressions could be deduced only from shadows . Despite the clarity of the British pictures , Lovell said the Russians would be able to make many interpretations of their own shots which can not be made at Jodrell Bank . He said the Russians have information about the camera lens , speed , and focal length not available to the west . Lovell reported that the Jodrell Bank observatory registered signals from the spaceship for Vs hours . The transmission then halted . U. S. Failure Explained Washington , Feb. 4 ( AP ) A spokesman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States has not been receiving television pictures from Russi a 's lunar probe , said : " The Russians say Luna 9 is transmitting on a frequency of 183.538 megacycles . This is quite different from any frequency used by NASA 's deep apace net which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory and includes stations at Goldstone , Cal. , Johannesburg , South Africa , and Canberra , Australia . " Thus , the spokesman told a reporter , the American network " would have to tear down and install a new receiver in order to get Luna 9 transmissions . " Too Much Disruption If this were done , he said , it would interfere with plans to pick up the American Surveyor spacecraft and lunar - orbiting spacecraft programmed for the future . He also said that any such change would also cut off reception of signals from the still-orbiting American satellite Pioneer 6 . The spokesman added that Britain 's Jodrell bank station has tong been equipped to receive the frequency used by the Russians .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
