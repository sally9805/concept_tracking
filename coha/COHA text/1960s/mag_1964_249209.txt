Paris Match , the French picture magazine , chartered a Caravelle jet to fly 55 staffers and a photo processing lab to the Holy Land . RAI , Italy 's government-owned broadcasting system , borrowed an L.S.T. from the Italian Navy , debarked 35 vehicles and 245 men . Tiny Lebanon managed to deploy a journalistic force of 60 . Even Tass , the Russian news service , and the big Moscow dailies , Pravda and Izvestia , put correspondents on the scene . All told , some 1,200 newsmen from 34 countries converged on the first papal visit to the Holy Land . Inevitably , the press and its photographers made much of the news themselves . <P> Never before has a Pope been subjected to such literally bruising personal contact with the press . But only once did Paul VI show annoyance at the ceaseless importunities of the newsmen . In Capernaum , where he knelt to pray in the ruins of a synagogue where Christ himself is said to have preached , Paul drew back in dismay when a radio newscaster thrust a microphone directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's tolerance was repeatedly put to the test , and everywhere it was difficult to tell which was more important , the Pope or the pop of a flashbulb . A swarm of 150 reporters and photographers crashed one of the Pope 's private meetings with Patriarch Athenagoras I , scuffled boisterously for position while the two religious leaders stared in surprise . Outside the walled Garden of Gethsemane , police had to pull prying newsmen from ladders . One freelance U.S. photographer managed to sneak an automatic , motor-driven camera into the tomb in Jerusalem 's Church of the Holy Sepulcher , where Paul had gone to pray . <P> At Galilee , photographers waded knee-deep into the water to snap the Pope head on . As Paul climbed back up the old stone steps leading from the shore , his path was blocked by a genuflecting Italian lensman . " Papa , benedizione Your benediction , Pope , " implored the photographer . Paul complied - giving the waylayer just the picture he had been after . <P> A Christian ? Authorities in Jordan and Israel had made press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papal tolerance . Press censorship was temporarily lifted , and passage across the border separating the two bitter enemies was made easy for newsmen . The only correspondent to encounter any serious trouble at the checkpoint was the New York Times 's Milton Bracker , who , on entering Jordan , gave the wrong answer to a routine question : " Are you a Christian ? " " No , " replied Bracker . " I am a Jew . " Authorities begged him to retract his response , if only for their records . When the defiant Bracker refused , they admitted him to Jordan anyway . <P> Official forbearance eventually gave way under the pressure of the press . Jordanian troops escorting what was soon dubbed " the papalcade " eventually resorted to muscle , swagger sticks and gun butts to keep order in the unholy mess . Cesidio Lolli , sedate papal diarist for L'Osservatore Romano , the Vatican daily , lost his temper after a manhandling by Arab Legionnaires . " You may be the soldiers of Herod , " he snapped , " but please remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
