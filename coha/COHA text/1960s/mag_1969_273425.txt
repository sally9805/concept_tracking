The traditionally fat U.S. trade surplus shrank to almost nothing last year largely because of steel . Foreign steel makers , who accounted for less than 5% of the U.S. market as recently as 1961 , won a 12% share in 1967 and a surprising 17% in 1968 . American pur chases of steel from abroad last year reached a record $1.5 billion . <P> As imports have risen , so have demands by domestic producers for protective quotas . Faced with growing Congressional support for protectionism , the Johnson Administration feared the damage that mandatory import controls would do to its policies of free trade . Thus it has been trying to induce foreign steelmakers to cut back shipments to the U.S. voluntarily . Last week the Federal Government announced that Japanese and Continental European steel producers , who together account for four-fifths of all steel imports , had agreed to impose their own restrictions for the next three years . <P> Splurge . The agreement came in " letters of intent " from the Japan Iron &; Steel Exporters ' Association and the six-nation European Coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Rusk said that other leading steel producers , presumably Britain and Canada , are expected to hold down their exports . As a result , Rusk added , U.S. steel imports-which soared to 17.5 million tons in 1968-will be limited to 14 million tons this year , 14.7 million in 1970 and 15.4 million in 1971 . <P> Senator Russell Long and Congressman Wilbur Mills , chairmen of congressional committees that have conducted hearings into proposed steel-import quotas , jointly applauded the agreement as " a welcome and realistic step . " Steelmakers were not quite so exultant . Industry spokesmen pointed out that the levels agreed upon would still amount to more than 13% of the U.S. market-greater than any year prior to 1968 . Some steelmen also feared that the Japanese and Europeans would compensate for the hold-down by shipping higher-priced lines of steel . <P> American steel companies , beset by rapidly rising costs for labor , have steadily lost ground to lower-priced foreign steel . The trend was accelerated last year , when the threat of a strike prompted consumers to hedge by ordering foreign steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers because the Europeans and Japanese made especially strong gains in the flat-rolled products that are used in such key industries as autos and appliances . <P> Unaccustomed Discounts . American steelmakers , benefiting from the strength of the economy in general and of auto sales in particular , will show total profits for 1968 of about $900 million , up from $843 million the year before . Nonetheless , profits as a percentage of sales dropped off . Imports squeezed profits by putting downward pressure on steel prices . To hold on to its markets , for example , even U.S. Steel Corp . resorted to some unaccustomed price discounting . If , as appears likely , the Japanese and European cutbacks produce firmer prices , domestic steelmakers will have to admit that the voluntary agreements were better than nothing-although they are likely to continue demanding mandatory quotas .
