WITH the beginning of the new year , TIME 'S guaranteed circulation in the U.S. reaches another new high : 3,300,000 copies a week , some 200,000 more than a year ago . This step-up fits a long-term pattern of steady growth , which has been accelerating in the past decade . In January 1946 , U.S. circulation , in round figures , was 1,500,000 ; in January 1956 , it was more than 2,000,000 , an increase of about one-third . The new circulation base marks an increase of 65% in ten years . <P> TIME 'S total worldwide circulation is now well past the 4,000,000 mark , with an estimated readership of 17 million in 150 countries . The breakdown by editions : <P> <P> U.S 3,300,000 <P> Atlantic 263,000 <P> Latin America 92,000 <P> Asia 100,000 <P> Australia 65,000 <P> New Zealand 30,000 <P> Canada 300,000 <P> <P> Worldwide 4,150,000 <P> In general , our readers around the world vary widely in age , occupation , status and interests . While not trying to flatter them or ourselves , we think of them as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the newer readers , there are some fairly clear patterns . A full 80% of our U.S. circulation growth in recent years has been in the urbs , suburbs and exurbs of the East , the industrial Midwest and the Pacific Southwest . These new readers tend to be managerial and professional people , relatively affluent , and getting a little younger . A decade ago , more than half of TIME household heads were managers and professionals , and today the figure is just about the same : 53% . Over the same ten years , their median annual income has risen from $6,090 to $10,907 ; their median age has dropped from 40.2 years to 39 . <P> The six international editions are all in English and virtually identical in editorial content ( the Canada edition carries an additional four pages of Canadian news , written and edited by a staff based in Montreal ) . They are printed in six plants around the world . Their circulation gains ( up 47% since 1956 ) have been coming largely from the economically advanced areas . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada , but only one for every 668 in Latin America . <P> TIME is even gaining behind the Iron Curtain , although the figures are n't such as to send our circulation people swinging into a mazurka . Until the 1960s , circulation there was limited to 322 ; today it is 1,161 . While most copies still go to government officials and foreign embassies , TIME is now sold on selected newsstands in Poland and Yugoslavia . <P> If percentages were everything , one might say we had made some spectacular advances in out-of-the-way places . In five years circulation in Greenland has nearly doubled-we now have eight subscribers there . And in Red China ( pop . about 750 million ) we have had our own great leap forward-from 3 to 20 copies , all to officials , and we hope they learn a lot . <P> <P> AIMING to reach an important audience with an important message on safe driving , the Ford Motor Co. chose TIME as the one magazine to make the delivery . The 12-page ad in the center of this issue represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TIME .
