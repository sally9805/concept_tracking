Never in the history of pro basketball has a rookie walked on the court to such trumpeting ballyhoo . When Lew Alcindor joined the Milwaukee Bucks this fall , he was proclaimed an instant superstar , another Bill Russell or Wilt Chamberlain-or both rolled into one . At 7 ft. 1 in .. Alcindor is the tallest man in a big man 's game , and his brilliance at center for U.C.L.A.-2,325 career points , three-time All-America , three national champion teams-was all on the record . How could he miss ? <P> In years past , Alcindor might already have made a shambles of the National Basketball Association . But basketball , like other major sports , has grown to include more teams with bigger , faster players slugging it out on tougher , longer schedules . So far , Alcindor has hardly embarrassed his opposition . At times , he has been badly outplayed by Los Angeles ' Chamberlain and such other hard-nosed pros as New York 's Willis Reed and San Francisco 's Nate Thurmond . Says Thurmond : " It used to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post men-like Russell , for instance . Now every team has a good center . Lew is finding that out . He 's got a long road ahead . " <P> Not that anyone considers Alcindor a failure . His awesome height and fluid style make him a continual scoring threat . " He 's very quick , " says Philadelphia Center Darrell Imhoff . " He makes some fantastic moves around the basket . He 's a great passer and a great dribbler-he can handle the ball like a small forward . " With the season nearly half over , Alcindor is fourth in points scored with 849 ; he is the main reason that Milwaukee , weakest in the N.B.A. Eastern Division last year , now ranks third , with a good chance of making the playoffs . <P> Better and Better . Alcindor 's biggest weakness is on defense-in the elbow-swinging battle for the ball under the basket . He averages only 14 rebounds a game ; rival coaches figure he should get 20 just for showing up . There are times , too , when he seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not hustle back quickly enough on defense , or dash down the floor at top speed on offensive breaks . <P> Lew readily admits to his failings . " But time , " he says confidently , " is going to be on my side . " After all , he is only 22 , and no less an authority than Boston General Manager Red Auerbach believes that he " probably has as great a future as anyone who ever played the game . " Adds San Francisco Coach George Lee : " I have this sick feeling that he 's just going to get better and better . "
