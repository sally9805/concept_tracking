Most astronomers and theologians assume that the earth 's life began on the earth . Maybe not , thinks Cornell 's Astronomer Thomas Gold . In a paper read at a Los Angeles meeting of space scientists , Gold suggested that " life " may have existed elsewhere in the universe for uncounted billions of years before it took root on the earth . How did life reach the earth and begin its long climb toward human consciousness ? His answer : perhaps it was brought by spaceships . <P> Life has existed on earth for about one billion years . Gold points out . It began as very simple forms of microscopic size , has developed slowly until only now is it reaching a level of physical development and technological competence that will allow descendants of those microbes to travel outside their own solar system . Certainly within the next few hundred years , he holds , man will be visiting planets of other solar systems . " Most of these planets will have unsuitable conditions for us to live there freely , but if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be contaminated with some form of microbiology brought along by the space travelers . Low forms of life are adaptable to a great variety of conditions , and so it is likely that they will stay on the planets while the space travelers will not . " <P> After a billion years , in the Gold hypothesis , the seeded planet may have evolved creatures intelligent enough to travel deeper into space , visiting fertile but virgin planets and seeding them in turn with adaptable microbes . In fact , this contamination by life is probably the normal beginning of life on any planet , including the earth . " Space travelers , " says Gold , " may have visited the earth a billion years ago , and from their abandoned garbage forms of life have proliferated so that the microbes will soon have another agent ( space-traveling humans ) capable of spreading them farther afield . " <P> What about the other galaxies that float in space far beyond the limits of the Milky Way ? Astronomer Gold is one of the leading proponents of the steady-state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , new galaxies form between them out of freshly created matter . Planets in new galaxies , he says , may be lifeless for a while , but eventually the contamination will reach them too . All they need is a single visit from an intergalactic germ-spreading spaceship . <P> When , then , did life begin ? The steady-state theory holds that space has no boundaries , and time has no beginning or end . If life spreads from old to new galaxies with the flow of time , its history may extend backward forever . It may live forever , too , renewing itself at inter vals of many billion years by planting its seeds on planets in galaxies not yet created .
