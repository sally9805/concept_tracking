Q : " What 's the best amateur first-aid for persons who have been Maced ? " <P> A : Run large amounts of cool tap water over the affected area . <P> Q : " Will any harm come to our nursing baby if my wife smokes marijuana ? " <P> A : Your baby is on a good trip anyway at its mother 's breast . Why take a chance ? <P> Q : " Is it possible to get a venereal disease in the bathroom ? " <P> A : Certainly-but the floors are usually very cold and hard . <P> The letters-some silly , some tragic-come into the Berkeley Barb , East Village Other , Los Angeles Free Press or any of 15 underground newspapers in the U.S. and abroad . Their language is raw , often misspelled , jangling with obscenities . A few are transparent put-ons . Most , though , are hippies ' cries for help on medical matters . Dropping out of " straight " society provides no immunity to mankind 's injuries and germs . Like everyone else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid . <P> Where can hippies turn for medical help ? Increasingly , many of them look to the column of Doctor HIPpocrates , the surgeon-general of the sandal-and-speed set . They call him " Dr. HIP , " but his real name is Eugene Schoenfeld . He got his schooling at the University of California , the University of Miami , the Yale University Department of Public Health and Albert Schweitzer 's hospital in Africa . Now his jungle is the turned-on , freaked-out , sex-and-psychedelic scene . <P> On the staff of Cal 's student clinic , where he sometimes treats toes that have been dislocated when their owners leaped from barricades , Schoenfeld answered so many unhip hippies ' questions that he eventually became convinced that something ought to be done . He half-jokingly suggested to Berkeley Barb Editor Max Scherr that his paper should print a medical column . " You write it , " Scherr replied , and in March 1967 Schoenfeld did . <P> Since then , Dr. HIPpocrates has become the best-read feature in the paper . Schoenfeld knew what his readers wanted-straight talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried whether spray deodorants cause cancer of the armpits , he suggests daily bathing instead . To girls fearful of pelvic examinations , he carefully explains them . To a youth ashamed of his small genitalia , he reports that some women " would rather be tickled than choked . " <P> " Do Your Thing , But . . . " Dr. HIP is permissive about pot , concluding that medical evidence is lacking about marijuana 's harm to normal people . He cites unpublished research that suggests that LSD may be no more dangerous genetically than caffeine , aspirin or other drugs . But he warns against " street drugs " with their impurities , has little good to say about amphetamines , inveighs against fad diets and fasting and harangues his readers to get VD checkups . Freedom demands responsibility , he says , so : " Do your thing-but only if it does not harm yourself or others . "
