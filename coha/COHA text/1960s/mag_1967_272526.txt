South Viet Nam was suddenly snowed under with paper . Strewn across town and countryside were two million posters , two million comic books , four million banners and 80 million leaflets . <P> For those Vietnamese who might somehow escape the government-sponsored literature , a reedy voice on Saigon radio warbled this message to a martial beat : " Viet Nam , remember Sept. 3 , and go vote for a President . Choose people of high ability and good behavior . Choose people who deserve to be heroes . " Thus last week began the most widespread political campaign in Vietnamese history . In addition to a President and Vice President , the voters will also elect a 60-member Senate . <P> <P> Peace Pitch . South Vietnamese television viewers had their first opportunity to see the eleven presidential hopefuls and their running mates on one marathon program . One after another , the candidates made brief five-minute presentations . Reflecting the general wish for an end to war , the chief pitch was a plea for peace . Tran Van Huong , 63 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian candidate , called for talks with Hanoi-though he ruled out any direct dealings with the National Liberation Front . Truong Dinh Dzu , 50 , a plump lawyer , who is campaigning with a dove as his symbol , announced that his platform calls for no more bombing of North Viet Nam and immediate peace negotiations with Hanoi . If elected , Dr. Phan Quang Dan , 49 , a Harvard-educated physician who is vice-presidential candidate on the ticket of Phan Khac Suu , the Speaker of the Constituent Assembly , promised to open peace talks at all levels , including the Viet Cong . His motto : " We must de-escalate . " Speaking for the heavily favored military ticket , Presidential Candidate General Nguyen Van Thieu made a peace pitch that was understandably more restrained and cautious . He and Vice-Presidential Candidate Nguyen Cao Ky would , vowed Thieu , " solve the war problem by convincing the Communists that they can not win militarily . " <P> Next week the candidates will begin touring the country in trips carefully arranged by the government to ensure equal exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of their time in Saigon and let representatives do the traveling for them . Ky , in fact , seemed more concerned about the Buddhists than his rivals . On a goodwill visit to a nearby hospital , Ky asked an elderly woman patient what she thought about Thich Tri Quang , the Machiavellian monk who led the Buddhist agitation against President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 and nearly toppled Ky 's own regime last spring . When the old woman allowed that she had never heard of the fellow , a pleased Ky replied : " That is the best news I 've heard all day . " <P> Buddhist Feuds . Tri Quang is less in the public eye these days because South Viet Nam 's once united Buddhists are quarreling among themselves . No longer can Tri Quang count on some 1,000,000 Buddhists to vote in accordance with his command ; he now has a solid following of only 180,000 . Thieu and Ky have helped weaken his position by recognizing an opposition faction as the sole official Buddhist organization . They also refused to allow Tri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home from his Thai exile to run for the presidency . And they barred many of Tri Quang 's men from running for the Senate .
