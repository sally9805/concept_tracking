Some composers drink . Others dabble in love affairs . Irwin ( " Bud " ) Bazelon goes to the race track . There , he says , " things crystallize for me . All aspects of life-hope , anxiety , success , joy , failure , anticipation-are capsulized in a two-minute ride . It stimulates me . " <P> It also stimulates his bank account . Last week , for example , Bazelon went to the bluegrass country to oversee the recording of his Short Symphony by the Louisville Orchestra . He took advantage of the happy coincidence by flying in a few days early to take in the Kentucky Derby , bet $200 on Kauai King , the eventual winner , and walked off with combined winnings for the day of a stimulating $500 . <P> Violent , Silent World . For Bazelon , handicapping is more than just a lucrative hobby . " The track , " he explains , " is an extension of the pulse and rhythmic beat of the city , and these are the roots of my music . " Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a dash off a few themes while hanging on the rail . In his Dramatic Movement for Orchestra , for instance , the slam-bang finale is his version of the horses thundering down the stretch at Aqueduct . <P> Thundering , in fact , is his forte . He has little use for the twelve-tone school , prefers instead a scattergun attack of drums , gongs , cowbells , wood blocks , maracas , xylophones , glockenspiels and tubas . All are brought into play in Short Symphony , a 14-minute piece subtitled " Testimony to a Big City . " It bristles with jazzy splashes , but too often falls off the pace like a mudder on a fast track . It is restless , aggressive , often directionless music , a personal statement of what Bazelon calls his " violent , silent world inside . " Just how he arrived at his present state of agitation is a case study of the tribulations faced by most young composers nowadays . <P> Erupting World . Bazelon says that he is called Bud because " Irwin just is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . That was back in the days when he was studying composition at De Paul University in Chicago . Partly because of a punctured eardrum that left him semideaf , he was " shy , diffident , introverted-an exceptionally quiet guy . " Six months of study with Composer Paul Hindemith at Yale did n't help matters much ; he lost 25 Ibs. and suffered a nervous breakdown . " I could n't take his Prussian taskmaster tactics , " says Bazelon . Bazelon eventually ' fled to California to study at Mills College with Composer Darius Milhaud , and in 1948 decided to strike out on his own . For the next seven years he worked in Manhattan as a railroad reservations clerk and wrote music on the side . <P> Then Bazelon met a psychiatrist who not only " revealed to me my true personality , " but steered him to an ear doctor who restored his hearing with an operation . Suddenly , he recalls , " the violent , silent world inside me erupted . I came out of my shell . " And how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated , tremendously buoyant -a rock ' em , sock ' em personality . And my music became just as dramatic as I am. " exit Irwin ; enter Bud .
