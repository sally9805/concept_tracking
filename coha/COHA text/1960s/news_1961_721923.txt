txt WASHINGTON , July 10 ? Top officials of the American ' Stock Exchange urged Congress today " by all means " to pro-. vide funds for the Securities . and Exchange Commission to conduct a broad investigation ' of the nation 's securities markets . Joseph F. Reilly , chairman of the exchange 's board of gov , ernors , had only one criticism , ' of a House Bill calling for such an investigation . It was that  --  the bill , sponsored by Representative Peter F. Mack Jr ... Democrat of Illinois , called for ! giving the S. E. C. only $750 , - , 000 to conduct the study , j " I respectfully state that you did not request sufficient funds to do the job , " Mr. Reilly told Mr. Mack , who heads a House Commerce subcommittee that concluded hearings today on the ' proposed inquiry . Cooperation Pledged Edward T. McCormick , president of the American Stock Exchange , pledged the organi ; zation 's full cooperation " in ' every way " in a broad S. E. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two months or . so , the S. E. C. has been con-1 ducting a limited investigation . of the American Stock ExIchange . This study grew from ' , the commission 's findings last ! spring of alleged multimillion- ' ( dollar rigging on the exchange'sj . floor in nine stocks by Gerard ' A. Re and his son , Gerard F. Re , stock specialists . The Res , both father and son , have been expelled by the American Stock Exchange , on orders of the S. E. C. They were : senior partners in the member firm of Re , Re &; Sagarese and specialists in twenty stock is sues listed on the exchange . A. stock specialist is appointed1 // by a registered exchange tol maintain a fair and orderly market in the securities assigned to him by standing ready at all times to buy or sell an issue for his own account . Both Mr. McCormick and Mr. Reilly fully defended the integrity of their exchange 's members and particularly those 160 members who serve as stock specialists . " * * I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other specialists or over-thecounter dealers in the country , " Mr. McCormick declared . " I wish to state that the American Stock Exchange is not a second-class exchange*** We believe that our present rules are adequate to provide proper protection to the public and they are now and will be effectively enforced , " he said . S. E. C. Scored Mr. Reilly criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission for not having acted against the Res in 1957 , instead of last Spring . Mr. Reilly testified that the American Stock Exchange four years ago had uncovered on its own that the , Res apparently were using nominees in an attempt to cover up their alleged illegal market practices . He said that this had become apparent when the exchange 's floor committee undertook an investigation early in 1957 of the unusual activity at that time in the common stock of the Swan-Finch Oil Corporation . Swan-Finch was then controlled by Lowell M. Birrell , who now is a fugitive . The floor committee 's investigation disclosed that Charles A. Grande had sold 256,200 shares of the Swan - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The committee was " curious as to the Grande sales , " he added , but not having the power of subpoena to question nonmembers could not interrogate him . The transcript of the committee 's findings , however , was turned over to the New York regional office of the S. E. C. Agency Action Noted " The reason for the referral should be obvious , " Mr. Reilly said , after noting that in June , 1957 , the New York office of the S. E. C. had obtained a permanent injunction against Swan-Finch , Mr. Grande and the Res against any further Iles of unregistered stock of the company . Mr. Reilly said that " the thought occurs " that if the S. E. C. 's staff investigators who had developed their case over the last year against the Res had used tit American Stock Exchange 's transcript in 1957 to establish that the Securities Act of 1934 had been violated , " the Res ' operation might have been cut off then . " As soon as Mr. Reilly had completed reading his prepared twelve-page statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation as such into the Re case . I 'm sure you are aware of that . " In his statement , Mr. Reilly proposed that to help defray any additional costs that might be required for the S. E. C. to complete a broad stock market investigation a registration fee be levied on all brokers and dealers engaged in over-the-counter trading . The Securities Act of 1934 at present requires the collection of 1 cent on each $500 in transactions of listed securities dealt in on registered stock exchanges . Over-the-counter trades , however , are exempt from this registration fee . Mr. Mack questioned Mr. McCormick at length concerning the conditions under which he had issued warnings as head of the American Stock Exchange to the public against excessive speculation . Mr. Mack noted that when he had questioned Keith Funston , president of the New York Stock Exchange , on his recent warnings that he ( Mr. Mack ) had noted that Mr. Funston 's warnings always seemed to be issued when the market was at a peak . Mr. McCormick quickly assured the Congressmen that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not made them just at the top of the market , " he said . He insisted that he constantly told any forum that he addressed to " invest intelligently and know what you are buying . " He added that when he had urged caution upon investors in mid-May , at the same time Mr. Funston issued such a warning , his own statement had been made only at the request of the press . Mr , McCormick was critical in his prepared statement of " certain segments of the press and the impression given by certain persons that have appeared at these hearings . " Mr. Funston , when he testified last month , had made it clear that he thought the New York Stock Exchange should be omitted from the scope of any S. E. C. inquiry . Mr. Funston , agreed , however , that the agency should be provided the necessary funds to review the rules and enforcement procedures of the American Stock Exchange and the distribution of so-called " hot issues " in the over-the-counter market . " I 've no comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Stock Exchange , Mr. McCormick said . " I 'm the only spokesman of the , American Stock Exchange and when I have anything to say I say it , " he declared . He added that when the governors of the American Stock Exchange " lose confidence in me , it 's up to them to change it . " Questioned on Javelin Mr. McCormick , after one outburst against the press and its lack of cooperation in iden-1 tifying its sources , appeared to ' lose his temper again when Representative John D. Dingell , 1 Democrat of Michigan , ques-1 tioned him as to the conditions under which the shares of Canadian Javelin , Ltd. , had been listed about two years ago on the exchange . Mr. Dingell noted that Canadian Javelin shares had been admitted to listing about two years ago , after its management had been charged by minority stockholders with having illegally distributed large blocks of the company 's stock . He asked if the listing was prompted by an S. E. C. requirement that the shares be traded on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal sales of the stock , " That did n't influence me any ' more than some of the other ' things the people in the S. E. C. say , " Mr. McCormick declared . He said that he was convinced that the present management of the Canadian mining company was composed of " managers in name only . " " I was convinced of that when Pickands Mather &; Co. invested $100,000,000 in the company , " he said . When Mr. Dingell persisted and asked Mr. McCormick " why would a nominal management come up with a multimillign-dollar offer of settlement " of the stockholders ' suit against it , Mr. McCor- , mick replied : " Where did Rockefeller get his money ? They were lucky . Apparently he found an ore body . " Pickands Mather Statement A spokesman for Pickands Mather &; Co. in Cleveland denied last night that the Ohio ore development concern held control of Canadian Javelin . He said that Pickands Mather " is not involved in any way with the internal affairs of Javelin . " He added that the Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The relation of Pickands Mather to Canadian Javelin , Ltd. , is solely that of managing agent for the Wabush Iron Company , Ltd. , which is a sublessee from Javelin of iron ore properties located in Labrador , " he said . He noted that Wabush " has paid to Javelin various sums of money under their regular lease agreements , " but he added that these aggregated " nothing approaching the $100,000,000 figure , " the amount mentioned by Mr. McCormick in his testimony before the House subcommittee .
