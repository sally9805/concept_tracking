ACCORDING to Arab politicians and apologists , this is what happened , this is the authentic view , these are the facts . Doubt is treasonous . There can he only one truth , according to Arab politicians and apologists , and it belongs to them : In 1948 , war took place between five Arab nations of the Middle East and the Jews in Palestine . This war was caused by the United Nations , whose General Assembly resolved to partition Palestine into two states , one for the Palestinian Arabs , the other for the Jews . The Arab nations and the Palestinian Arabs would not accept this monstrous decision . They were obliged to protect themselves against it , with force . The United Nations operated as the tool of the Western Imperialists , notably Great Britain and the United States . The United Nations wanted the Jews to proclaim the upstart state of Israel . Because of the Western Imperialists , who favored Israel , the Arabs lost the war . By massacre , threatening broadcasts , pointed bayonets , and the murderous siege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs out of their homeland . For thirteen years , these Arab refugees have languished in misery around the borders of Israel . The United Nations ( Western branch ) bears the blame for these events and must repair the damage . The condition of the refugees is a sore on the conscience of honorable men . The Israeli government refuses to welcome back to their homeland the refugees , now swollen to more than a million in number . This refusal demonstrates the brutality and dishonesty of Israel , an abnormal nation of alienswho not only forced innocent people into exile but also stole their property . There is no solution to this injustice , the greatest the world has ever seen , except to repatriate all Palestinian refugees in Palestine . Palestine is an Arab country , now infamously called Israel . Israel has no right to exist , and the Arab nations will not sign peace treaties with it but will , by every means possible , maintain the state of war . The details of the Arab case vary , depending on the political climate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always remain the invaluable , central theme . - The case is painted the coliar of blood in the Arab countries : Revenge and Return . POr the Western public , tears replace blood ; the Arab case rests on the plight of the . refugees and isa call to conscience rather than to arms . But no Arab statesman has ever promised final peace with ISraelif .. Miry the million Palestinian refugees may return to their former homes . The best Wayto consider this case is close up , by looking at the Palestinian refugees themselves , not as a " problem , " not as statistics , but as people . The Palestinian refugees , battered by thirteen years in the arena of international politics , have lost their shape ; they appear as a lump and are spoken of as one object . They are individuals , like everyone else . Despite the unique care and concern they have The Atlantic Monthly received , despite the unique publicity which rages around them , the Arab refugees , alas , are not unique . Although no one knows exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is estimated that since World War II , and only since then , at least thirty-nine million non-Arab men , women , and children have become homeless refugees , through no choice of their own . Their numbers grow every year ; Angolans are the latest addition to the long list . The causes for this uprooting arc always different , but the result is the same : the uprooted have lost what they had and where they came from and must start life again as handicapped strangers wherever they are allowed to live . The world could be far more generous to these unwilling wanderers , but at least the world has never thought of exploiting them . They are recognized as people , not pawns . By their own efforts , and with help from those devoted to their service , all but some six million of the thirty-nine million have made a place for themselves , found work and another chance for the future . To be a refugee is not necessarily a life sentence . The unique misfortune of the Palestinian refugees is that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alarming signs , from Egypt , warn us that the Palestinian refugees may develop into more than a justification for cold war against Israel . We ignored Mein Kambf in its day , as the ravings of a lunatic , written for limited home consumption . We ought to have learned never to ignore dictators or their books . Egypt 's Liberation , by Gamal Abdel Nasser , deserves careful notice . It is short , low-keyed , and tells us once again that a nation has been ordained by fate to lead ? this time , to lead the Arab nations , all Africa , all Islam . The Palestinian refugees are not mentioned , and today , in the Middle East , you get a repeated sinking sensation about the Palestinian refugees : they are only a beginning , not an end . Their function is to hang around and be constantly useful as a goad . The ultimate aim is not such humane small potatoes as repatriating refugees . THE word " refugee " is drenched in memories which stretch back over too many years and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England , Italy , Holland , Germany . In Madrid , between artillery bombardments , children were stuffed into trucks to be taken somewhere , out of that roulette death , while their mothers clung to the tailboards of the trucks and were dragged weeping after the bewildered , weeping children . In Germany , at war 's end , the whole country seemed alive with the roaming mad ? slave laborers , concentration camp survivors ? who spoke the many tongues of Babel , dressed in whatever scraps they had looted , and searched for food in stalled freight cars though the very rail-yards were being bombed . From China to Finland , people like these defined the meaning of " refugee . " No one could wish to see even a pale imitation of such anguish again . In the Middle East , there would be no high explosive , no concentration camps , but the imagined , expected scene was bad enough ; lice and rickets and tuberculosis , bodies rotting in the heat , the apathy of despair . Why , in 1961 , did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what I had read , as one of the average absorbent reading public ; notions float in the air exactly as dust does . Nothing that I had read or heard prepared me for what I found . What do they look like , the undifferentiated mass known as the " Palestinian Refugee Problem " ? What do they think , feel , say ? What do they want ? How do they live , where do they live , what do they do ? Who takes care of them ? What future can they hope for , in terms of reality , not in terms of slogans , which arc meaningless if not actually fatal , as we know . The children are as fast as birds , irreverent as monkeys , large-eyed , ready to laugh . The young girls , trained by carrying water jars or other heavy household bundles on their heads , move like ballerinas and are shrouded in modesty and silence as if in cocoons . The young men , crudely or finely formed , have in common the hopefulness and swagger of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sexes . After this the women , who age quickly but not as quickly as the men , wear unpainted experience on their faces ; they look patient , humorous , and strong . When the men have grown visibly old , they turn into a race of grandees . Their color , infant to patriarch , ranges from golden fair to mahogany dark , all warmed by the glaze of sun . The instinct for hospitality , the elegance of manner have not been exaggerated . UNRWA ( the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ) , inheriting its role from previous caretakers , has been the splendid mother-and-father of these people for eleven years . In the course of its parenthood UNRWA has spent about $360 million on the Arab refugees , this money having been contributed by members of the United Nations , with smaller but loving donations from private charitable organizations as well . Of the total the United States provided more than $238 million , Great Britain over $65 million ? but spread across the years and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy See , have helped with cash . The Soviet Union has never paid one cent . This is a tiny note of malice : Arab refugees often express tender emotions for the Soviet Union , whereas most of the village orators blame the United States and England , or that bogey , " Western Imperialism , " for their exile . In the so-called " host countries , " Lebanon , Jordan , Syria , and Egypt , UNRWA runs fifty-eight refugee camps . The camps in Egypt are not in Egypt but in the Gaza Strip , which is Palestine ; Egypt is the de facto mandatory power , the land and the government of the Gaza Strip are Palestinian . The majority of camps in Jordan are also on what was the territory of Palestine , now annexed to Jordan . UNRWA has never yet been allowed to make a total proper census of its refugee population , so statistics about the number of ex-Palestinians are nothing except the best estimate possible ; UNRWA itself says this . Over half of the registered Palestinian refugees do not live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private arrangements varying from first-class houses , at the top , to hand-built Hooverville shacks , at the bottom . UNRWA calculates that , at the end of June , 1960 , 421,500 refugees were living in their camps , almost double their camp population ten years ago . The advantage of living in a camp is that life there is rent free ; and for the poor , the standard of housing and sanitation in an UNRWA camp is better than that of the native population . The international personnel of UNRWA , Americans and Western Europeans , is small ; 128 men and women work in four countries . The mass of those who serve the Palestinian refugees are Palestinian refugees themselves , something over 10,000 of them . UNRWA is running a world , simply , a little welfare state . It makes villages , called camps , and keeps them clean and free of disease , feeds , educates , trains teachers and technicians and craftsmen , operates clinics and maternity centers , sends out visiting nurses , encourages small private enterprises with small loans , distributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , footballs , youth clubs , mosques . UNRWA is a kind , impartial parent ; it has no favorites . However , people are all different , luckily ; and though one man will arrive in exile as a destitute refugee and in time own a whopping Chevrolet and be a self-employed taxi driver , with a cozy home and a smiling wife in a flowered print dress and a gleaming refrigerator in the dining room , another will remain in whatever shelter UNRWA gave him , sitting either on his own floor or at a cafe table , waiting for nothing , or for divine intervention , or for the mailed , promised , delivering fist of Nasser . UNRWA did not invent the human condition . Of UNRWA 's fifty-eight camps , I visited eight ? in Lebanon , the Gaza Strip , and Jordan . The plan and facilities of every UNRWA camp are alike ; they differ only in size and are better or worse depending on whether they are newer or older and on the character of the people who live in them . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warehouse center for distributing rations , " supplementary feeding station , " where hot meals are served to those who need them , village bazaar street with small shops , market booths , cafes . The bigger the camp , the bigger the bazaar . I also went round two hospitals , two vocational training schools , and was received in two private homes , having been invited by refugees . My guide and chaperone was an UNRWA employee , a Palestinian Arab , who served as translator when needed . My system was to say : please show me your best and your worst camp , and if time permits , let us also look at the in-between , In the camps , I knocked on any door and many . Nothing was planned . We chatted at random and went wherever I liked . In the Gaza Strip , I was accompanied for a day by a young Palestinian in a pin-striped suit ; he or someone like him is a cross every foreigner has to bear . He is local Secret Service , and the refugees know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Palestinian government officials in Gaza are , or must appear to be ; and he is by avocation a propagandist and demagogue . At one Gaza camp , besides this young gent , I had an escort of three Palestinian cops who lent an even heavier note to the proceedings . Otherwise , my visits were uncensored . I may have seen a true cross section of the Palestinian refugee population , and I may not have . I only know that I saw real people in the flesh , and a large number of them , and I know what they said . When the word " they " appears on these pages , it means those Arabs whom I saw ; it means nothing more . BEIRUT is a lovely boom town , an entrancing mixture of Asia Minor and France , with scenery to lift the heart and glamour hotels all over the lot and more abuilding . We set off , my Palestinian guide and I , in a shiny car for an UNRWA camp in the Lebanese hills . My guide , like his colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an UNRWA department , dressed in a Western business suit , a self-assured , middle-class Organization Man . The refugees are not only individuals , but they come from widely different social backgrounds . Men of the class of my guides would not be living in refugee camps ; thty might work in them as doctors or teachers . This camp was inhabited exclusively by Christian Arabs . I wondered aloud at a separation by creed . My guide was a Muslim and said that Christian camps were always cleaner and superior to Muslim ones , and besides , very few Christians lived in camps ; they arranged their lives better on their own . The camp consisted of little cement or frame houses rambling over the hillside , a village of poor people , disorderly and beflowered and cheerful . School was letting out for lunch ; troops of children , dressed in the pinafore uniform that small boys and girls wear in Italian schools , meandered home , shouting bye-bye at friendly , giggling length . They are Roman Catholics here , but the young teachers are refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Palestine , since most of them have never seen the country and even the oldest can not remember it . The children are taught hate , the Garden of Eden stolen from them by murderers ; their duty is to live for Return and Revenge . The miniature white clinic had only one customer , a nice-looking girl of twenty-one who had brought her fourth baby for a checkup . Her husband works in Libya ; she too lived there for a few years but returned . Libya is very expensive ; she can live here with his parents and thus save money for the future . The resident nurse , a buxom elderly woman , said they had no real sickness ; in summer , the children got a bit of conjunctivitis and diarrhea ; oh , no , trachoma is very rare , and besides , we cure it ; there 's some chicken pox now . My guide announced that if any refugee needed an operation he was taken in an ambulance to a hospital in Beirut where UNRWA reserved beds and paid for everything ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get such good and speedy treatment . Her fourth baby , I mused , and she only twenty-one . Yes , yes , said my guide , the refugees have a higher birth rate than any other Arabs , and healthier children . Refugees receive a monthly basic food ration of flour , pulse ( dried peas , beans , lentils ) , sugar , rice , oils , and fats ; this amounts to 1500 calories a day per person , increased in winter to 1600 calories a day , and it is not enough . The refugee must find some way to earn money to increase his diet , or keep poultry or rabbits , or grow vegetables . Many had planted tiny gardens here , but charmingly and with more enthusiasm , they also grow flowers for the joy of the thing . There is a daily milk ration for children and pregnant and nursing mothers ; and hot meals are served in the " supplementary feeding station , " to those who need them , on the doctor 's order . In this camp , said my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there are hardship cases , when no one can bring money to the family , UNRWA 's Welfare Section steps in . This pattern is universal . If you think it your duty , I said , to make everything seem better than it is , do n't . I 'm not on an inspection tour , I only want to get some idea of what life is really like . He stopped , offended , in the middle of the stony path and explained : here , in Lebanon , 80 per cent of the refugees are better off than they were in Palestine . Twenty per cent are not . The 20 per cent were small capitalists , and there is much rivalry with the Lebanese in business , they make obstacles . Also it is political ; they do not give the refugees citizenship , you understand , because the main part of the refugees are Muslims and that would upset the balance here , where the Christians rule . I do not speak to you of the rich Palestinian refugees ; they are richer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required visite de politesse to the camp leader . Every camp leader acts as an appointed village mayor ; he has to keep the place running , serve as liaison officer with UNRWA local headquarters , and handle the complaints of his own people . Sitting in his neat office , with my guide , the principal of the school ( a former member of the Palestinian police ) , and the camp leader , I listened to the first of what became an almost daily Mad Hatter conversation . It went like this : " The Arab countries invaded Israel in 1948 to save the Palestine Arabs from being massacred by the Jews . " " Were there massacres ? Where ? " " Oh , yes , everywhere . Terrible , terrible . " " Then you must have lost many relatives and friends . " This , being a tiresome deduction from a previdus statement , is brushed aside without comment . " Israel overran the truce lines and stole our country . We left from fear . We have a right to our property , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we had our own money , we would need nothing from UNRWA . Our own money is much more . We do not have to be grateful for the little money spent on us . We should have our own . " " Then , of course , you want to return to your property and to Israel ? " " Not to Israel . Never to Israel . To our own country , to our own part . " " But did n't the Jews accept Partition , while the Palestine Arabs and the Arab governments refused ? " " Yes , yes . And England protected the Jews . An Arab was arrested if he carried a pistol only to defend himself , but Jews could go through the streets in tanks and nothing happened to them . Also , England told the Arab states to attack Israel . " The principal of the school then spoke up . " In our school , we teach the children from their first year about their country and how it was stolen from them . I tell my son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eighty and a child so high , all , all will go home with arms in their hands and take back their country by force . " On this warlike note , we left . My guide had seemed a sober contented fellow until our little meeting , whereupon he sounded like a politician running recklessly for office . He then astonished me again . " It can all be solved with money , " he said . " Now the people have nothing in their mouths but words , so they talk . Money fills the mouth too . If every man got a thousand dollars for each member of his family , for compensation to have lost his country , and he could be a citizen in any Arab country he likes , he would not think of Palestine any more . Then he could start a new life and be rich and happy . And those who really do own something in Palestine must be paid for what they had there . But those are not many . Most had nothing , only work . " HIGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groves and the satin blue of the Mediterranean , is a small Muslim camp named Mia Mia . Here one whole Palestinian village , amongst others , had landed ; they came from a mountaintop in Galilee , a place called Meron . Their headman , or village leader , the Muktar , plied us with Coca-Cola and Turkish coffee in his exile 's parlor . He is a beautiful man , perhaps sixty-five years old , lean , with exquisite manners . He wore the handsome white Arab headdress , held in place by the usual black double-corded crown ; he was dressed in a well-preserved cream silk jacket , a white silk shirt , pressed gray flannel trousers , polished Italianate black shoes . Whilst we sucked Coca-Cola through straws and studied his son 's pitifully bad but lovingly executed paintings ? a portrait of Nasser ; Christ and the Virgin ? the Muktar talked . Seventeen people of his village were massacred , which was why they fled , but an old blind woman of 104 was left behind and the Jews poured kerosene over her and burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all fled ? Well , then the Jews went away and some villagers crept back and found her , and besides , the United Nations Truce Commission also found her . My guide looked embarrassed . The Truce Commission was a shaky point . It was a strain to believe that the UN military observers , occupied with armies and frontiers , would have had time to investigate each atrocity story in the country . I wondered where the families of the massacred and the cremated were ; everyone knows everyone else in a village , surely the surviving relatives were the best witnesses . " I could tell you many such stories , " said the Muktar . " I am sure of it , " said I. " But please tell me about Meroo . " So I heard of Meron , their beautiful stone houses , their lovely groves , their spacious and happy life in Eden ; all lost now . I could readily imagine this aristocrat living in a palace on a mountaintop and decided that I would later go and see his home ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we set off to pay calls in the camp . A woman of forty or so , with a face like the best and juiciest apple , and lively eyes , seized me and hauled me into her house . She began , with gestures , to deliver an oration . She touched the ceiling with contempt , pulling bits away ; she called upon heaven to witness her misery . Her voice soared and fell in glorious rhythms . She loved doing it and I loved watching it . In mutual delight , we smiled more and more as the tale of woe unfolded , until she could keep it up no longer , burst into roars of laughter , and kissed me copiously . My guide seemed unduly glum about all this , perhaps because this diy we were three ; a European UNRWA official had joined us . " She is a big liar , " said my guide , when we had left her house . " She lies as she breathes . We gave her all the material for a new roof . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make a pilgrimage to Mecca this year . She does not have to make a pilgrimage . Do you know what that costs ? One thousand pounds . " In Lebanese money , this amounts to about $350 ? a fortune . " Oh , she is a terrible bad one . " " I loved her , " I said . " She 's one of my favorite types of people in the world . A really jolly open crook . I hope she has a wonderful time at Mecca . " " But we have to fix her roof anyhow , " said the UNRWA official . In our suite of followers , I had noticed a tall boy of sixteen or seventeen , with fine intelligent eyes , a happy face , and a fresh white shirt . I spoke to him in English , and he understood ; I asked whether we could visit his family . His house was no larger than any other , but clean , peaceful , and touching , with orderly furniture and picture post cards tacked to the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother seemed older than time , of a generation so old that she had tattoo marks on her cheeks . The boy had graduated from high school and now worked as manager of the food distribution center in the big camp ( 14,000 inhabitants ) on the plain below . He must have been very competent and very reliable to merit this job . He hoped to become a TV-radio engineer . He did not speak of Palestine . There was work he wanted to do , wherever a man could do such work . UNRWA is now building a vocational training school in Lebanon ; it should be open in the autumn . With any luck , this boy will learn the technical skill he so desires and make his own life independent of anyone 's charity . We heard shrill painful child 's crying and went toward the sound . A child of about two was tied by the ankle to a chair , howling the same word over and over . A younger child was silently trying to hold its body up , clinging to the arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean little sheet , a baby twisted its body restlessly , but its legs lay still . All three were remarkably good-looking , all seemingly husky and well formed . The camp leader carried on a short barking exchange with their young mother and reported : " She is twenty-five . None of the children can move their legs ; the legs will not hold them . The child is tied because he can pull himself out of the house and get hurt . She says , please , will you help her ? " Speaking French to the UNRWA official , because no one else there knew the language , I said ; " She can easily have five or six more children like this . It is terrible for her . The visiting nurse ought to explain about birth control . " " You do n't know what you 're saying . UNRWA could not touch such a thing , not even mention it . Here are these people , and the name of their country does not exist on the map any more . If we start teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wipe out the people too . Besides , the men would never allow it . They want to have a lot of sons ; it is a matter of pride with them . And politics enters too , as into everything ; I 've heard them say it . We need to have many children and grow and increase so that the world will never forget us . " " They 're doing well , from what I 've seen , " . " About 30,000 babies a year . " The camp leader , escorting us to our car , remarked that no one here had any work . He delivered a short speech in English ; he was a very nice , gentle man . " All the men do is sit in caf ? and suffer , suffer . A young man sees time running , running , and he gets old with no years . If I did not got my land to hope for , I lose my brains . " On our way to Beirut , the UNRWA official said , " Eighty per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite a prosperous little camp . " " Do they lie just for the fun of it ? " It had been a long day . " Well , it 's natural in front of us . If they earn too much , they are taken off the ration lists . If they earn above a certain amount , they are n't eligible for the services . Free medicine and doctoring and schooling . So , obviously they do n't want us to know . " " Like non-refugees with the income tax collec-tors ? " " That 's it . " " Do you know what they are earning ? " " Not really . How could we ? Of course , if anyone has regular employment , we eventually learn of it and cut down the rolls . " The refugees , in camps as well as outside of camps , do find work of some sort ; otherwise , on 1500 calories a day , they would soon become and look like a severely undernourished , sickly group : UNRWA 's health statistics can be relied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for what reason and with what results . The standard of health is unusually high and is one of UNRWA 's finest achievements . On the plain below Mia Mia , the land is green with citrus groves , banana plantations , where nothing grew before . This is the work of refugees ; someone should be very grateful to them . Refugees who were city dwellers in Palestine gravitate to city work : taxi drivers , employees , merchants . No matter what official attitudes are , all of these people tend to seek their own previous level , under the universal refugee handicap of starting from scratch , of being exploitable , and in competition with established locals . Besides , they are living in a part of the world where poverty is an endemic disease and it is hard for anyone to make a good living , unless you are born into a silver-spoon family . Out of the blue , my guide announced : " There is no crime in the camps . No thefts , no fires , no blood feuds . It is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all brothers in refuge . There were a few murders some time ago ; someone raping , something like that . It is natural . But no crime . " And this is true . In all the camps . Exile has taught one valuable lesson : how to live peacefully and lawfully together . To ENTER the Gaza Strip you require a military visa from the Egyptian government in Cairo . I had arrived in Cairo expecting to proceed like the wind directly from there to Gaza but was informed , by the local UNRWA press officer , that this permit took two or three weeks to get , and sometimes you never got it . Besides , there was only one UNEF army plane to Gaza each Saturday , and they did n't like carrying anyone except their own personnel ; besides , it was now Thursday , and tomorrow was the Muslim Sunday , and indeed all looked hopeless . I foresaw bumming a jeep ride over the sandstorming desert and infiltrating into the Strip somehow ; but meantime I called on the Egyptian authorities . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport photos I needed and the number of offices I had to run between , it took about four days to get the visa , and every minute was enjoyable . The Egyptian officials could not have been kinder , and I loved seeing them , the new ruling class , who remind me , in their cheerful , inchoate , important busyness , of many new ruling classes I have observed round and about , over the years . It is difficult to believe that these pleasant young men , in shirt sleeves or uniforms , with their numerous callers , their telephones , their mounds of mimeographed forms , their empty Turkish coffeecups , have any connection with the vainglory , the xenophobia , the anti-Semitic hatred that sinear the press and pour over the air of their fascinating city . TE Gaza Strip , from all accounts , would be a real hell hole . It is a roughly rectangular slice of land , on the southernmost Mediterranean frontier of Israel , some forty kilometers long by five to ten kilometers wide , and 365,000 people , refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sand dune , packed solid with human flesh , blazing hot , hideous , and filthy . It is none of these . The weather was so idyllic ? a china-blue sky and a constant cool breeze ? that I assumed this was special luck and at once asked my charming landlady about it . No , the weather in Gaza was always delightful . She had lived here for thirty years ; there were two " sticky " weeks in the summer , otherwise you could not find a more benign climate . Flying over the Strip , I had noted plenty of sand , but also plenty of green . There were always citrus groves in Gaza , my landlady reported , Gaza was famous for them , but since the refugees came these had greatly increased , as had the general cultivation . Anything grows here , she said , exhibiting her blossoming garden . Then I remarked that Gaza town was a beehive of activity , with all the UNEF soldiers , Danes , Norwegians , Indians , Canadians , Yugoslays , who patrol the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free time , and the Egyptian upper crust which oversees the Palestinian officials , and UNRWA and visitors and the local residents and , indeed , the refugees . The refugees seemed to bring prosperity with them ; it was most mysterious . Not at all , said my landlady , we do not know why we are not completely bankrupt ; but she was adding a third floor to her already roomy house , so great is the demand for lodgings . Sizable villas are being built in what must be the fashionable section of Gaza . The main square boasts an array of parked Mercedes , finned pastel American cars , and humbler Volkswagens . The taxis in Gaza are new . There is an imposing movie theater , in the ugly world-wide chromium-and-junk style ; there are abundant caf ? s and numerous dingy shops , typical of the region . An economist could surely answer this riddle : if no one has any money , what are these eccentric merchants and purveyors of services doing ? The refugee camps are much larger than those in Lebanon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means luxury establishments , but many people live in a nastier state in American and European slums . The poor villagers of Gaza are not as well housed or cared for as the refugees . The Gaza Strip is not a hell hole , not a visible disaster . It is worse ; it is a jail ? with a magical long white sand beach , and a breeze , and devoted welfare workers ( UNRWA ) to look after the prisoners . The Egyptian government is the jailer . For reasons of its own , it does not allow the refugees to move from this narrow strip of land . The refugees might not want to leave at all , or they might not want to leave for good ; but anyone would become claustrophobic if penned , for thirteen years , inside 248 square kilometers . A trickle of refugees , who can prove they have jobs elsewhere , are granted exit visas . The only official number of the departed is less than three hundred , out of 255,000 registered refugees . It seems incredible . Rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by unknown methods . These locked-in people ? far too many in far too little space ? can not find adequate work . Naturally , there is less chance of employment than in the other " host countries . " Meantime , they are exposed to the full and constant blast of Egyptian propaganda . No wonder that Gaza was the home base of the trained paramilitary bands called commandos by the Egyptians and Palestinians , and gangsters by the Israelis ? the fedayin , whose job was to cross unnoticed into Israel and commit acts of patriotic sabotage and murder . And having been so devastatingly beaten by Israel again , in 1956 , has not improved the trapped , bitter Gaza mentality ; it only makes the orators more bloodthirsty . ANOTHER Mad Hatter conversation , practically a public meeting , took place in the office of the leader of two adjacent camps , a man in charge of some 29,000 people . The camp leader , the self-appointed orator , sat behind his desk . The Secret Service youth , mentioned earlier , the quiet UNRWA Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highish rank completed the company . First the camp leader told me how rich they had all been in Palestine and how miserable they were now and how much land they had all owned . I do not doubt for one minute how much land some of them owned , nor how rich some of them were , and I did not point out this subtle distinction : if everyone owned the land claimed , Palestine would be the size of Texas ; if everyone had been so rich , it would have been largely populated by millionaires . To gild the past is only human , we all do it ; and to gild it with solid gold is even more human if you are a refugee . This part of his address was already so familiar that I could have recited it for him . Then he spoke of Jaffa , his native town . The Jews surrounded the city , firing on all sides ; they left one little way out , by the sea , so the Arabs would go away . Only the very old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arab refugees tell many dissimilar versions of the Jaffa story , but the puzzler is : where are the relatives of those who must have perished in the fury of high explosive ? the infallible witnesses ? No one says he was loaded on a truck ( or a boat ) at gun point ; no one describes being forced from his home by armed Jews ; no one recalls the extra menace of enemy attacks , while in flight . The sight of the dead , the horrors of escape are exact , detailed memories never forgotten by those who had them . Surely Arabs would not forget or suppress such memories , if they , too , had them . As for those Arabs who remained behind , they are still in Jaffa ? 3000 of them ? living in peace , prosperity , and discontent , with their heirs and descendants . " The Jews are criminals , " the camp leader continued in a rising voice . " Murderers ! They are the worst criminals in the whole world . " Had he ever heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler was far better than the Jews ! " " Far better murderer ? He killed six million Jews as a start , " I observed . " Oh , that is all exaggerated . He did not . Besides , the Jews bluffed Hitler . They arranged in secret that he should kill a few of them ? old ones , weak ones ? to make the others emigrate to Palestine . " " Thirty-six thousand of them , " said the Secret Service man , proving the point , " came here , before the war , from Central Europe . " " It 's amazing , " I said . " I have never before heard anywhere that the Jews arranged with Hitler for him to kill them . " " It was a secret ! " the camp leader shouted . " The documents have been found . Everyone knows . It was published . The Jews arranged it all with Hitler . " There is a limit to the amount of Mad Hattery one can endure , so I suggested that we visit the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp leader had a chance to steer me anywhere . Two young married couples lived here . In a corner by the courtyard wall stood a group of visitors , silent Arab women , in their graceful long blue dresses , slightly hiding their faces behind their white head veils . The older women wore silver coins on chains across their foreheads ; this is very pretty and is also guaranteed to prevent sickness of the eyes . It was useless to try to lure the women into talk , but one of the husbands talked freely . The Secret Service youth translated . " It is the blame of America that this happened , because they help the Jews . We only want America to help us to get back to our land . ' ! " How ? " I asked . " By war ? " " When the Arabs are united , we will make the war . " " What do you want from us then ? Arms to make this war with ? " " No , we want you to stop giving arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25 million for arms . " " I do not believe that the U.S. government has ever given or sold arms to Israel . What about the arms Nasser gets from Russia and Czecho-slovakia ? " " That is all right . That is different . They are peace-loving nations . They only want to help the undeveloped countries . " The Secret Service man put in : " America offered us arms , but with conditions . We will not accept conditions . So we take from the Eastern countries , who give without conditions . " " What do you do ? " I asked the fat young husband . " Nothing . " " What would you like to do ? " " Be a soldier and fight Jews . " This oratory pleased the public very much . " Do you all like Nasser ? " I asked , politely . Wide smiles . General joy . " We do . Certainly . Oh , of course . He will unite us and make us strong . He is our leader . ' ! FOR rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the School Sports Day . Fifty thousand refugee children attend school on the Gaza Strip , 98 per cent of the possible school population . In Gaza 's spacious stadium , 2000 school children were gathered . They ranged from tiny tots , the Brownies , in berets and ballet-skirted orange uniforms , to boys in running shorts and muscles . They paraded past the governor of the Gaza Strip in the viewing stand , led by girls in colored outfits who formed the Palestine flag . The human flag was followed by the Brownie babies , Girl Scouts , Boy Scouts , girl gymnasts , and boy gymnasts . " We dressed every one of them , " an English UNRWA official said . " This show costs us about two thousand dollars , but it 's worth it . It gives them something to look forward to . They all love it . " They loved it and their admiring families loved it and the public loved it . The children had marched in earnest stiff-legged style . ( " Like the British Army , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) They then lined up in formation , and a loudspeaker blared out Arabic . Three times the children shouted a unanimous , squeaky but enthusiastic reply to the loudspeaker 's commanding male voice . " What are the cheers for ? " " The first is : ' Long Live a Free Palestine . ' The second is : ' Long Live the United Arab Republic . ' The third is : ' Long Live Gamal Abdel Nasser . " I stayed to see the white-clad girl gymnasts , as graceful as a field of Isadora Duncans , doing lovely swaying motions with blue gauze handkerchiefs . The Vocational Training School at Gaza is a freshly painted group of buildings , with well-kept lawns , flower borders , scrubbed Spartan self-respecting dormitories , and impressive workshops equipped with the complex machinery that modern life seems to depend on . The boys were on their playing field that afternoon , a holiday , marking white lines for various sporting events to come . A few of them drifted back and wanted to show off every inch of their school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , were they happy ? Needless to ask ; the answer glowed and shone on them . The graduates of this school find good jobs for which they are trained ; amongst its many other parental functions UNRWA operates a placement bureau throughout the Middle East . This is the new generation , the UNRWA graduates , and you find them everywhere in the Arab refugee world . They have not yet been crippled by exile , regret , or hate , and they may well be the brightest citizens of the Arab future . They are the source of all hope . Two accidental conversations stick in my memory . Once , lost in the UNRWA compound of offices , I chanced on a pretty , dark secretary , who told me the kind of inside human angle of history which is more interesting than any other . In 1956 , when the Israelis took the Gaza Strip , during what they call the Sinai campaign and we call Suez , for short , telephone communication was restored between the Strip and Israel , which is , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy occupation , the secretary 's sister-in-law rang up from the small town where she lived in Israel , to have a chat . How was everyone ? The sister-in-law reported that they were fine , her husband was doing very well , they had a nice house and no trouble of any kind . The secretary , recalling this family news , said , " I think if we had all stayed where we were , nothing would have happened to us . All this would not have come about . And what is it for ? My children have never seen Palestine . I tell them ; and in every school , every minute , they are always told . But when they are grown ? The people who knew Palestine will die , and the young ones ? will they be interested ? " The second memorable talk took place at the Sewing Center . The Sewing Center is another of UNRWA 's camp inventions , and it is self-supporting . UNRWA Sewing Centers teach dressmaking and new uses for traditional Palestinian embroidery ? vast tablecloths and sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good prices to local customers and to city specialty shops . Hundreds of refugee girls earn small wages and stave off boredom , while learning a trade . The Gaza center was managed by a bustling cheerful plump Palestinian refugee , who would be taken for a bustling cheerful plump young Jewess in any Western country ; but , of course , Arabs and Jews are the same race , Semites . The young manageress showed me massive tablecloths ( which none of us would be grand enough to own or get washed ) , and she praised her girls , who sat on a long porch , embroidering , flattered , giggling . It was as clear as if she wore a sign , but I asked anyhow : " You 're happy , are n't you ? " " I have a nice husband , and two children , and a comfortable house . I like my work very much ; it is very interesting . Yes . We are happy . " And she smiled . Such a smile . The world is n't lost , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees live scattered around Gaza in rented private houses . A few Christian families asked for free government land at the edge of a Muslim camp , the usual free allotment of building materials from UNRWA , borrowed extra money , and built their own houses with small well-tended gardens . My UNRWA guide , himself a Greek Orthodox Arab , took me to visit one of these trim , respectable self-made homes , belonging to a family he had known before in Jaffa . The old mother was half blind ; the recurrence of eye disease is a Middle Eastern , not a refugee affliction . My guide and this family had not seen each other for some time , and immediately after their first greeting , the old woman wept with incurable grief and was consoled , gently , but as if he had done so often before , by my guide . He explained : this family had suffered a great tragedy . One of the sons was killed by shellfire , in Jaffa . I report this because it was the only family I met where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , the infallible witness testified ; and here this death , thirteen years old , was mourned as if it had come upon them yesterday . My UNRWA guide behaved as if this case were unique and deserved the aching pity which everyone feels for those who have lost a loved member of the family in war . I left Gaza , wishing that I could take all the young people with me , and not to Palestine , but out into a wider world . Their destiny should not be to go back , but to go forth . They need exactly the opposite of what the Jews need . There is plenty of room for both needs . OFFICIALLY , over 600,000 Palestinian refugees live in Jordan , more than in the other three " host countries " put together . But legally there is no such thing as a refugee in Jordan . The refugees are full citizens of Jordan ; they have every right and privilege and opportunity that a born Jordanian has . Many of the Palestine Jordanians are contented and have made good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undeveloped country places on all its inhabitants . Much of the barrenness and poverty could have been corrected by a scheme for the use of the waters of the Jordan River , to irrigate land now wasted . Eric Johnston , who was President Eisenhower 's special representative to implement this life-giving plan , finally reported : " After two years of discussion , technical experts of Israel , Jordan , Lebanon and Syria agreed upon every important detail of a unified Jordan plan . But in October 1955 it was rejected for political reasons at a meeting of the Arab League . " Judging by the refugees I saw in Jericho , in camps outside Jerusalem , in Jerusalem itself , the boon of citizenship fosters sanity . The emotional climate in Jordan is noticeably different from that of the Gaza Strip . A school principal stated that children are taught the history of Palestine , " without politics . " Exactly what this means , I can not say . In Jordan , a refugee 's education and self-reliance showed at once in his politics . The better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on thoughts of violent revenge , and give their loyalty to King Hussein . The more ignorant and less competent nourish themselves with a passion for Nasser , war , and Return . Two men , living next door to each other in a camp outside Jerusalem , aptly illustrate this difference in personality and politics . The camp watchman , who lived in a new little UNRWA house which was already a pigsty , with empty sardine tins on the floor , a filthy yard , rags for bedding , announced , " We were evicted by force , and so we will return . Led by Nasser and Hussein and all the Arab leaders . " His neighbor , an old man , had cleared the stony ground around his house and made a flourishing vegetable garden . Inside his courtyard you could hardly move for the rows of drying laundry . He did not have a word to say about war or force or Arab leaders . He said that he would rather starve to death than not give his grandchildren education . " As long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university . " The largest Jericho camp is run by an objectionable tyrant , yet its cleanliness was nearly Swiss . " I gave them six thousand trees , " said the refugee-tyrant , speaking in his capacity of God . " Five years ago , the Muktars the village leaders would not let me give the people trees ; they said if they plant trees , the people will never want to go home . " Now trees rise over the walls that separate the little houses , and more trees are to be distributed . An inexhaustible supply of clean water flows from twenty-one water points . Forty thousand people live here in solid dwellings , under the stern eye of their tyrant ; bird-fast children play in the streets . " How is your name ? Are you well ? Good-by ! Good night ! Hello , leddy ! " The children chirped and circled ; the tyrant tried roughly to shout them off . One boy , determined to have his say , presented me with a whole English sentence . He took me to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for visiting ) , a neat yard , presided over by a smiling serene-faced mother , very proud of her son who could speak alone in a foreign language to a foreign guest . He told me , slowly , of his life , his family , and his ambitions . He was thirteen and had studied English here for two years , in school . He had never talked English with anyone before , except his teacher . After this encounter , I visited some English classes in another camp , to watch the miracle in the making . The boy wants to become a teacher . " In this country ? " I asked , waiting for the expected cry , " No ! In my country ! Palestine ! " " No , not in this country , in Jerusalem or Amman . " So finally I realized , as I should have all along , that " country " means town or village ; when the Arab peasant refugees talk of their country ? even if they happen to be in it , as they are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthplace . The boy 's mind had gone no farther than the big cities of the only country he knows ; his mind may travel much farther than that . The highest ambition of all the best students is to become a teacher or a doctor . Teachers and doctors are needed throughout the world , and the Arab world needs them intensely . Jordan has a Vocational Training School also , as happy and hopeful as the school in Gaza . Here I forgathered with a class of budding plumbers , another set of citizens the world can well use . They were very merry in their blue work clothes and greasy hands , and full of plans for the future . One wished to go to Kuwait , one to America . One boy said he wanted to plumb in Palestine . The youngest and smallest of them , in a curiously wise voice ? both bored and dismissive ? said , " Oh , all that will take a long time . " None of them was interested enough to go on with it . The only place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the Jordanian part of divided Jerusalem , in the old Ghetto . Jews had festered in those lightless rat holes , jammed among the ancient stones , for longer than one can imagine ; for thirteen years , Arab refugees have endured the same hideous life . This is medieval misery and squalor ; nothing like it exists in me modern world . From a fetid passageway , a straight-backed , cleanly dressed , handsome boy bounded into the cobbled alley street . He took the arm of his teacher , who happened to be my guide that day ; they were good friends . He was the star pupil of his class . Where could he possibly study ? In the street , the boy said , anywhere outside . He has known no other home than a single damp room , a dungeon , where he lives with his bedridden grandfather , his parents , and a brother . " All the boys from here are good boys , " the teacher said , and his amazement showed in his voice . " And very witty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did the UNRWA Director know of this vile slum ? No , said the camp leader . I hurried off to ask why UNRWA allowed human beings to live in such revolting squalor . Whereupon I was informed that the Director had visited the Jerusalem Ghetto within two weeks of taking on his job . UNRWA had tried , at various times , to move these refugees , who refused to go because they preferred living inside the city . But now , since their birth rate had risen at such lightning speed , they were more than ready to leave , and within the year they would be settled in a new camp outside Jerusalem . There were two more dreadful refugee slums in the " host countries " ? did not see either ; these were the only subhuman living conditions , and it was not UNRWA 's fault they continued . They would , in time , be eradicated . Despite all difficulties , UNRWA runs a welfare state ; no other exists in the Arab Middle East . " The refugee has a net under him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an UNRWA official . It should be stated that the UNRWA personnel loves its Arab charges , which is not only right but essential . You can not help those you do not cherish . WTH my suitcases packed , and my mind overpacked with " treasonous " doubts , I set off for Israel , across the street . I had not dared tell anyone , including the Western UNRWA officials , of this intention : to have been in Israel , to go to Israel , is enough to brand you as an enemy and , more possibly , a spy . The Arab psychosis ( an ornate word but not too strong ) about Israel is official , and infectious . There may be many reasonable people in the Arab countries who are able to think calmly about Israel and about Arab-Israel relations ; if so , they choose safety and keep their mouths shut . When it comes to moving from one side of Jerusalem , which is Jordan , to the other side of Jerusalem , which is Israel , the world of dream sets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly you arrive at a small Jordanian frontier post , also in a city street . You wait , in this little shack , while your passport is checked against the exit list . After this formality , a charming courteous young porter carries your suitcases half a block . You tip him , and he deposits them on the porch of a house which is no longer there . Artillery fire removed it , years ago . Around you are shelled houses ; one side of the street is Jordan , with laughing soldiers in the shelled houses ; one side of the street is Israel , with washing hung out on lines . You walk a half block further , leaving your bags behind . You are now at the Israel frontier post , another shack . Like crossing the river Styx , this is a one-way journey . When you have left Jordan for Israel , you can not return by this road . The Arab blockade of Israel thus extends to foreign visitors . You would have to fly from Israel to neutral territory and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a visit to Israel . Since you will not be admitted to any Arab country if you have an Israeli visa on your passport , you carry your Israeli visa on a separate sheet of paper . Other nations than ours present their traveling citizens with two passports . After the Israeli border police have checked your visa , an equally charming courteous young porter , an Israeli , collects your bags from the porch of the nonexistent house in no man 's land . You tip him and put the luggage in a taxi and drive a few blocks to your hotel . From your hotel in Israel you have a fine view of the beautiful wall and the Old City of Jerusalem , where you were residing three quarters of an hour ago . There is not a war on , not by any terms we know . The object of this non-peace ? non-war exercise is to destroy Israel , which remains undestroyed . I can not see how it helps the Arab countries , but perhaps it does . Perhaps they need one enemy they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their nationalism . I wanted to visit Palestinian Arabs in Israel , the ones who stayed behind , the non-refugees . Seeing them at home , I thought I might better understand the mentality of their brothers in exile . Some important clue was lacking , but I could not name it or define it . The driver of my car , on the journey in Israel , was an Israeli Jew , born there , who speaks Arabic as his second mother tongue and looks so like Nasser that it is a joke . I said I wanted to visit the village of Meron , on a mountaintop in Galilee . He said that at Meron there was an ancient temple of the Jews , the grave of a famous rabbi , a synagogue , a Yeshiva ( the Orthodox Jewish equivalent of a Catholic seminary ) , but nothing else to his knowledge . Let us go and find out , I said . So we drove north through this country , which is a monument to the obstinate , tireless will of man . In 1949 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were planting trees : their first job . It looked as if they were planting blades of grass and seemed a pitiful act of faith . Now the trees have grown . There are countless changes in Israel , but the Arab villages along the road to Nazareth have not changed . The old adobe or field-stone houses cling to and grow from each other . They are charming , picturesque , primitive , and wretched ; but not to Arab peasants . This is the way it always seas ; this is the way they like it and want to keep it . We drove up the mountain . Between the synagogue and the heroic ruins of the two-thousandyear-old temple , we did indeed find Meron , the home of the aristocrat who had offered me a rose on a mountaintop in Lebanon . There were not more than twelve houses in the village . The Muktar 's palace is a long narrow stone shed , with an ugly narrow porch along the front . Instead of beams , bits of rusted railway track hold up the porch . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field stone , with traditional graceful doors and windows . Inside , the houses were like stables unfit for decent animals . The rich fields and groves the Meron refugees had described were the steep slopes of the mountain behind , where the villagers cultivated tobacco and some fruit and fig trees . In their day , the village had no electric light or water ; the women carried water on their heads from the wadi at the foot of the mountain . The view is a dream of beauty . Hardship for hardship , Meron is no better than their refugee camp , Mia Mia , perhaps not as good ; but memory is magical , and Meron was home . Beside these pretty stone hovels tower the remains of a great temple . The blocks of granite in the fragmented wall are as massive as those in the wall of Solomon 's Temple in Jerusalem . The broken pillars are enormous , unadorned , and suddenly Samson is real and pulled down real pillars as heavy as these . Here , two thousand years ago , the Jews were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not all that much in the history of the Jews or of this land . And here , with weeds around their low walls , stand the abandoned houses of the descendants of warrior strangers , the Arabs who came to this country and conquered it when the temple was some six hundred years old , doubtless already a ruin . Were the villagers of Meron happy when they lived on this mountain ; did they think it Eden then ? And why did they run away ? The war never touched this place . ON January 1 , 1960 , according to Israeli statistics , 159,236 Muslims , 48,277 Christian Arabs , and 22,351 Druses lived in Israel . These people will have increased , but that is a good enough basis to work on ; roughly a quarter of a million Arabs by now . The Jewish population , coming together here from the four corners of the earth , was 1,858,841 . These dissimilar people live on eight thousand square miles of quite beautiful , laboriously and lovingly reclaimed rock heap and sand dune ? of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate and secret sect , are a phenomenon ; they are content . They trust and approve of the Jews ; they are loyal citizens of Israel . The remaining Arabs are something else again . On this tour , I visited a Christian Arab village near the Lebanese frontier ; a Muslim Arab village on the coastal plain near Acre ; two Muslim villages near the Jordanian frontier ; a new Muslim settlement near Tel Aviv ? the exact copy of a new Jewish settlement , built by the government ; and a Roman Catholic priest , in the beautiful Crusader city of Acre . My idea was to search out Arab schoolteachers , on the grounds that they would probably speak English , were educated men , would know the feelings of their communities , and would have thought about Arab problems . Arabs , living in their own communities , have their own schools , by their own wish , where the children are taught in Arabic , according to Arab principles . Nissim , my driver , was to serve as translator until I had found someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not want anyone to feel hampered by his alien presence . I might have spared myself anxiety . The candor of the Arabs is proof of their freedom inside the state of Israel ; they are not in the least cowed . In the Christian Arab village , the schoolteacher was an attractive lean young man , with prematurely gray hair , working in his garden in the cool of the evening . He had a good modern house , a young modern wife , and after six years of mar- riage , a first baby , a six-months-old girl named Mary , whom he and his wife so adored that neither of them took their eyes off the child at the same moment . He was healthy , prosperous , respected , freely doing his chosen work , loved and loving ; by any standards , a fortunate man . After hours of listening to him , I had grasped the lacking clue , and felt hopeless . " Great Britain helped the Jews , " he said . " The English gave weapons to the Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this village we were all armed ; we all fired at the Jews , every one of us . But our bullets were no good ; the English gave bad bullets to the Arabs . Four out of five of the bullets were no good . When we saw this , we ran away to Lebanon for two weeks and then we came back . " " Were any of you killed in these battles ? " " No , no one . Yes , we refused Partition . We did not want the Jews here ; we wanted the whole country for ourselves , as is right . We only lost because of the United Nations and the Western powers . " The Ottoman Empire crushed the pride of the Arabs . The Western powers divided the Arabs into many nations , after the First World War , to keep them weak . In the 1948 war , the next village was bombed by the Jews ; when we saw that , we knew we had no hope . " ( Pause for breath : the Jewish Air Force at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little plane , not a bomber ; the next village was a good seven or eight miles away . ) " Now we have military zones , all along the frontiers . We must ask for permission to travel or work in different places . They have taken our land which is in the military zones . Yes , they pay for it , but very cheaply . " " At the price it used to be worth in the Mandate ? Before it was improved by the Jews ? " " Something like that . No , even cheaper . Just now two boys from this village were caught on the Lebanese frontier ; the Lebanese police sent them back . The Israelis are holding them for interrogation . How could such boys be spies ? " " I do n't know . But you do remember that the Arab countries are at war with Israel ? I should think it might be hard for the Jews to know what Arabs they could trust . " " They are right not to trust 50 per cent of the Arabs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent ? " " Oh , they know everything . They have a C.I.D . agent in every Arab village . He is a Jew , and everyone knows him . " " What 's the use of having a secret policeman if everyone knows he 's a secret policeman ? " " There are plenty of informers . I do n't know what it is that has taught all Arabs to be spies . " He said this with real despair . " There is compulsory education in this country up to the age of fourteen . That is a very good thing . We did not have such a thing before . But the Muslims do not send their girls to school half the time and do not send the boys if they can earn . Then what ? The fine for the father is only five pounds . What is five pounds to the father ? " " Do you really mean that you want the Jews to supply the schools and the law which makes education compulsory , and also to force the Arabs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this education ? Would n't that make the Jews even more unpopular ? " He admitted , with a smile , that this might be the case and went on : " Nasser buys arms from Russia because he could not get them from the West . Egypt has twenty-two million people , so it needs many more arms than the Israelis , who are only two million . But Nasser is not crazy ; he will not make war . He spends as much on social reform as on arms . All children now go to school in the Arab countries . " " Have you ever visited the Arab countries ? Have you been to Egypt ? " " No . " We drank more coffee ; we lit more cigarettes . I braced myself for further enlightenment . " The Arab Kings were not the true representatives of the Arab peoples when they made war against Israel . Now all the refugees should come back and we should have Partition . " At this point , I decided to make one long , determined stand to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of mutually accepted facts and reasoning . " Please bear with me and help me , " said I. " I am a simple American , and I am trying to understand how the Arab mind works , and I am finding it very difficult . I want to put some things in order ; if I have everything wrong , you will correct me . In 1947 , the United Nations recommended the Partition of Palestine . I have seen the Partition map and studied it . I can not tell , but it does not look to me as if the Arabs were being cheated of their share of good land . The idea was that this division would work , if both Jews and Arabs accepted it and lived under an Economic Union . And , of course , the Arab countries around the borders would have to be peaceful and cooperative or else nothing would work at all . The Jews accepted this Partition plan ; I suppose because they felt they had to . They were outnumbered about two to one inside the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies and forty million or more citizens , not feeling friendly . Are we agreed so far ? " " It is right . " " The Arab governments and the Palestinian Arabs rejected Partition absolutely . You wanted the whole country . There is no secret about this . The statements of the Arab representatives in the UN are on record . The Arab governments never hid the fact that they started the war against Israel . But you , the Palestinian Arabs , agreed to this , you wanted it . And you thought , it seems to me very reasonably , that you would win and win quickly . It hardly seemed a gamble ; it seemed a sure bet . You took the gamble and you lost . I can understand why you have all been searching for explanations of that defeat ever since , because it does seem incredible . I do n't happen to accept your explanations , but that is beside the point . The point is that you lost . " " Yes . " It-was too astonishing ; at long last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " Now you say that you want to return to the past ; you want Partition . So , in fact you say , let us forget that war we started , and the defeat , and , after all , we think Partition is a good , sensible idea . Please answer me this , which is what I must know . If the position were reversed , if the Jews had started the war and lost it , if you had won the war , would you now accept Partition ? Would you give up part of the country and allow the 650,000 Jewish residents of Palestine ? who had fled from the war ? to come back ? " " Certainly not , " he said , without an instant 's hesitation . " But there would have been no Jewish refugees . They had no place to go . They would all be dead or in the sea . " He had given me the missing clue . The fancy word we use nowadays is " empathy " ? entering into the emotions of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had felt no blanket empathy for the Palestinian refugees , and finally I knew why ? owing to this nice , gray-haired schoolteacher . It is hard to sorrow for those who only sorrow over themselves . It is difficult to pity the pitiless . To wring the heart past all doubt , those who cry aloud for justice must be innocent . They can not have wished for a victorious rewarding war , blame everyone else for their defeat , and remain guiltless . Some of them may be unfortunate human beings , and civilization would collapse ( as it notoriously did in Nazi Germany ) if most people did not naturally move to help their hurt fellow men . But a profound difference exists between victims of misfortune ( there , but for the grace of God , go I ) and victims of injustice . My empathy knew where it stood , thanks to the schoolteacher . " Do you follow the Eichmann trial ? " I asked . An Arabic daily paper , weeklies , and radio station thrive in Israel . " Yes . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you not imagine that all the Jews in Israel believe this massacre of their people could have been prevented if the Jews had had a homeland to escape to ? Do n't you think that they knew , also , what you just said : there would have been no Jewish refugees from here ? they would be dead or in the sea ? Does n't that perhaps explain them to you a little ? " He shrugged , he smiled ; with these gestures ha tacitly admitted the point , but it was of minor importance . " In 1948 , the Arabs were not united ; that is why we lost . In 1956 the Jews beat Nasser . He will never make war . But when there are five million Jews here in Israel , the Jews will make war , because they will need more land . " " Israel is about the size of New Jersey , a state in America . Some six million people live quite comfortably in New Jersey . Israel could become an industrial state , a very useful one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab nations will not allow it . They will not trade with Israel . They will not let Israeli ships go through the Canal . They do not wish Israel to do these things . They will not accept Israel . " " It is hopeless , " I said . " In my lifetime , those who threatened war sooner or later produced it . If Arab-Israel politics keep up like this , my friend , perhaps all of us , everywhere ? you and your wife and Mary , and my child and my husband and I ? will have the privilege of dying in the same stupid final war . " He thought I was making a rich foreign joke . He has never seen even a corner of a real big war ; he can not imagine it . He thinks war is something that lasts a few weeks , during which you shoot off bad bullets at a remote enemy , no one is killed , you run away for a bit and then come home to your undamaged houses and lead a good life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Arabs has suffered anything comparable to what survivors of modern war know ; none can imagine such catastrophe . TIE Christian schoolteacher sent me on to a friend of his , a Muslim schoolteacher , in a village called Masra on the plain near Acre . The Muslim schoolteacher was a young black-eyed beauty , who received me in a bleak cement-walled room , scantily furnished with an ugly desk , wardrobe , straight chairs , and day bed . He wore striped pajamas , traces of shaving cream , and a princely ease of manner . We got right down to business . Before 1948 , the population of Masra was 350 ; now it is 200 . They owned little land , they had worked on neighboring kibbutzim and in Acre factories . ' they always had good relations with the Jews . " No one here shot at Jews ; and no Jews shot at us . " ( Note the order of the sentence . ) But now Masra had grown and swollen ; 900 refugees lived here . " Refugees ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , across the fields . " What ? From villages nearby ? " " Yes , yes . Those villages . They are maybe seven kilometers away . " " And you consider them refugees ? " " Of course . There was no fighting near here , but the people are frightened , so they fled to the Dense villages , where they know they will be safe , because the Druses were always friendly with the Jews , and after , they came here . The Israeli government will not let them go back to their villages . The government offered them other land , but they will not take it . Before the war , only my father sent his sons to school from this village . Now we have a school and 240 children in it , 100 girls and 140 boys . We have a water tap at every house and electric light ; never such things before . No one owned a radio ; now there are 100 radios and frigidaires too . The people earn good wages . " " Then everyone must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not glad . They want to go back to their old houses , even if there is no light or water or money . " They knew the refugees were " living under good conditions " ; he had brothers in Lebanon and Syria who were doing well . How did he know ? They wrote messages to the Israel radio , which broadcast them , and the Lebanon radio sent messages back ; that way they heard news of their families . But all the refugees should return and Israel should be partitioned . I put the same proposition to him as to his Christian colleague ; if the Arabs had won the war , would they accept Partition ? " No , never , of course not . We would let some few Jews live here as immigrants but not be masters , not in any part of Palestine . " " Why do you think the refugees left in the first place ? " Well , there was much fear . Then , they all knew about Dir Yassin and expected the same to happen to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refugees ' stories of massacres ; they do not have to account for flight , since they are still at home . They know what happened around them , and their neighbors know , and such stories would be pointless . But they do speak of Dir Yassin , which was a genuine massacre and took place in the village of that name , near Jerusalem , on April 9 , 1948 . Before the official Arab-Israel war started ( on May 15 , 1948 ) there had been months and months of " incidents . " ( " From the first week of December 1947 , disorder in Palestine had begun to mount . The Arabs repeatedly asserted that they would resist partition by force . They seemed to be determined to drive that point home by assaults upon the Jewish community in Palestine . " ? Trygve Lie , In the Cause of Peace , Macmillan , 1954 . ) By February , 1948 , aside from scattered Arab attacks on scattered Jews , and reprisals for same , the " Arab Liberation Army " had moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besieged , and cut off . The Jews were trying to run food to the beleaguered Jewish population of Jerusalem . A lot of Jews were getting killed in that effort , in Jerusalem and elsewhere , and in the eyes of some Jews not enough was being done to prevent or avenge this . The state of Israel did not exist ; no functioning Jewish government could control this anarchic , deadly phase of undeclared war . Two famous illegal groups of militant Jews , the Stern Gang and the Irgun Zvai Leumi , had their own ideas on how to fight fire with fire . The British regarded them both as terrorists . The Jewish Agency and their underground army , the Haganah , which were the official Jewish authorities in Palestine , also rejected the Stern Gang and the Irgun Zvai Leumi , because of their ruthlessness . Under the circumstances that created them , these two outlawed bands do not seem very different from Resistance groups , Partisans , or Commandos , all of whom were admired as patriots , and none of whom obeyed the Queensberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behaved like desperate men at war , not like the millennial inheritors of a high moral code . The village of Dir Yassin lay close to besieged Jerusalem and its life-line road . According to the Irgun , Dir Yassin was a nest of snipers and armed Arabs ; an effective enemy concentration . On their own , the Irgun decided to attack Dir Yassin . Their leader was killed by Arab fire from the village ; the Irgun fighters then went brutally mad and shot everyone in sight . Two hundred and fifty Arabs were killed . To this day , Israelis can not get over their shame for Dir Yassin while failing to remind themselves , the Arabs , and the world that murder , horribly , begets murder ; and they could present a longer casualty list of Jews killed by Arabs , before and after Dir Yassin , during the twilight period of terror that preceded open war . The news of Dir Yassin spread like the tolling of a funeral bell throughout Arab Palestine , According to their own ethical code and practice of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future to the Arabs . They intended to massacre the Jews ; if the Jews were victorious , obviously they would massacre the Arabs . As the beautiful schoolteacher pointed out , Dir Yassin threw the fear of death into vast numbers of the Arab population . In panic , they fled from Palestine . Since we were talking about war , we came easily to the subject of Nasser . " Here they love Nasser . All love him . He is Arab person . They do not believe what he says on the radio ? kill the Jews , kick thefts into the sea . So long he says it , and nothing happens , It will not be war . Something else will arrange , but not soon . " The Christian Arab schoolteacher had told me of a priest in Acre whom I should see , but I could not find him . Instead , I directed myself toward the nearest church steeple , rang a doorbell beneath , and was admitted by an enormous , rotund priest in a brown cassock . He looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country for nearly thirty years and had learned how to survive : by laughter . He laughed at everything , and it was an awesome sight , as if a hippopotamus broke into silent mirth . We settled on his stiff upholstered visitors ' chairs , and he ruminated on the problem of the refugees . If there was the choice between a big financial compensation or return , only 50 per cent of the refugees would wish to return , and most of those who came back would not stay . " They could not endure how this country is run . The discipline . The work . " The refugees are kept thinking of Palestine by the Arab leaders , by propaganda . Why not build factories and arrange land resettlement in the Arab countries ? ( The Arab governments do not wish this , Father . ) Give the money to the Arab governments and tell them to get on with the job and control it . ( How ? ) By force . ( But what force , Father ? ) He often told Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany to West Germany ; they were all absorbed into West Germany and enriched the country . Why would not 800,000 Arab refugees enrich the Arab countries , which were big and underpopulated ? But it is no use ; Arabs have never heard of any other refugees or any other problem than their own , and they can not think about that , in a practical way . The whole problem is between the East and the West ; the Arabs are very happy in the middle , using blackmail . This would stop if the East and the Nest came to terms , or if the West was united and strong and could impose its will . ( But how , Father ? ) Ah well , the Jews might as well let the refugees come back ; the Arabs here are loyal to the state . ( " The ones I 've seen detest the Jews and the state , Father , and you know it . " I expected his laughter to make a sound , it was so violent . ) Yes , yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no resistance , no underground . Think what they could do if they really wanted to , with the Arab countries all around as a base . ( Some Arabs did for a long time , Father ? until 1956 , in fact ; look at the countless incidents with the UN police force called out to investigate murders , thefts , sabotage . ) Oh , that was nothing , nothing to what they could do if they really wanted to . With another mute roar , he told me that the Arabs said , First we will finish with the Shabbaths , and then with the Sundays . They never changed their ideas . They went around looking at the women and the houses they would take when they managed to get rid of the Jews and the Christians . He laughed himself into a good shake over this one . I asked about the Eichmann trial and the reaction of his Roman Catholic parishioners . Well , his Christian Arabs thought Eichmann was right , because the Jest 's were the enemy of the German state . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to drive them out of Egypt , the Persian King tried to clear them out , Ferdinand and Isabella kicked them out of Spain . No one could live on good terms with them , so Eichmann was right . ( Horrified , really horrified , I said , " Surely that is not a Christian attitude to the most appalling murders we know about ? " He found it terribly funny that I should expect a Christian attitude from Arabs . ) " I do not like either Arabs or Jews , " the priest announced with great good humor , " but I serve them with my whole heart , as I must . " He asked me at the door whether there are any Christian Arabs in refugee camps . Yes , I had seen a camp of Christians in Lebanon . " I am surprised . There must be very few . I would have expected them to manage better . They do not dream all the time . They have more contact with reality than the Muslims . " By now I could foretell one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not lose the war against the Jews ; various others are responsible for the defeat . Then they boast cheerfully of their present material well-being , as if they had invented prosperity . At this stage , the Israeli Jews might be wisps of smoke ; they had nothing to do with building the country . However , Arabs are miserable ; although they never had it so good , it is not good enough , owing , of course , to the Jews . Usually these Arabs say how much they love Nasser and in their devotion are curiously remindful of Nazi Austrians , twenty-five years ago , when they praised the handsome distant leader , Adolf , from whose hand all blessings would flow . What they believe they now want is to bring the refugees home and partition the state . They have not considered this as a practical matter , nor imagined its effects on their new-found prosperity . IVISITED a school in a village where prosperity had broken out like a rash ? new houses , shops , hospital , high school , bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After telling me how well off everyone was , and bragging of their growth , they told me they were all unhappy and poor because they had owned 40,000 dunams of land ( 10,000 acres ) and now only owned 10,000 dunams . But another Arab , who had not overheard this conversation and was employed as an agricultural inspector , explained that the 10,000 dunams were irrigated , which was new , and also they were scientifically farmed , and therefore produced far more than the 40,000 dunams had . To listen to these conversations is work for a psychiatrist , not a journalist . I yearned for my silent hotel room in Jerusalem , but Nissim had two heart's-desires , and Nissim was such a nice man that I could not refuse him . There was a " great lady " he wanted me to meet , a Muslim . " She began a Muslim women 's club all alone , she , " Nissim said . " Such a thing has never been . What a brave woman . The Muslims go to a place and learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not wonderful ? " I could see that Nissim was by nature a suffragette . He also wanted me to visit a new village of government-built houses , which the Arab citizens buy on the installment plan by paying a low rent . Not everyone has a chance to own such fine , inexpensive houses , and Nissim ? like all Jewish Israelis ? is ardently proud of every improvement in his country . First we called on the lady , who lived in a modern villa , luxurious by middle-class standards anywhere and palatial by Middle Eastern standards , very shiny and tasteless . Nissim thought it wonderful ; so did she , with well-bred restraint . She was young , charming , just returned from her schoolteacher 's job , bathed and dressed for the afternoon in a sleeveless red dress . She spoke of her Muslim women 's club , whose members ranged in age from fifteen to sixty , and learned sewing , cooking , child care , listened to lectures , and were enthusiastic over their new venture . I am a suffragette like Nissim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The peasants , she said , have work and money and do n't care about anything else . But the educated people suffer ; they have all this education , and after they finish their studies , what can they do ? Only the professions , and business , and a few are elected to Parliament ; but they can not get positions in the army . Her husband , a pharmacist , has to take four buses to reach his place of work , but here is this village of eight thousand people without a pharmacy ; why do n't the Jews open a pharmacy ? " If there is such a crying need for a pharmacy here , why does n't your husband start one himself ? This is not a Communist state ; there are no laws against private enterprise . You are well-known people , full and free citizens . You could certainly raise a loan , if you need it . " You are not supposed to argue about com- plaints ; it is abominable manners . Her face closed like a lovely olive-colored trap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? except the Druses , who insisted on it themselves ? because the only people the Israeli Army would ever have to fight are Arabs . It seems decent to me , and it seems like reasonable military security . How would your men feel if called upon to fight fellow Arabs , who might be their blood relatives and intended to be their liberators ? Do you think it is a good job for a man to join an army he can not serve with his heart , and would sell out if the time came ? That may be excellent work for spies , but not for soldiers . " She opened her closed face to say , " Yes , I see . But it is our country . " It was too hot , and too futile . Besides , I was tired of the convention which apparently requires non-Arabs to treat Arabs as if they were neurotic children , subject either to tantrums or to internal bleeding from spiritual wounds . This girl did not strike me as a pathetic weakling . " Only by right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh century . The Jews got here first , about two thousand years ahead of you . You have n't lived as masters in your own house for a long time . Aside from the Crusaders , the Ottoman Turks bossed you for a steady four hundred years , before the British took over . Now the Jews have won back their land by right of conquest . Turn and turn about , " I said , feeling as beastly minded as an Arab myself . " Fair 's fair . " " How was it ? " asked Nissim , who had been waiting in the car . " She is fine , is n't she ? Think that she starts to teach the Muslim women . No other one did . " Israelis are the first to explain ( and who can know better ? ) that it is painful to be a minority : the Arabs in Palestine became a minority suddenly . It is grievous ( as who knows better than Israelis ? ) to be separated from the numerous , needed members of your family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn in two : their racial loyalty belongs to the enemies of Israel , and they are afraid ; if the Arab nations make war against Israel , as is regularly promised on the radio from Cairo , Damascus , Beirut , what will be their fate ? Would the outside Arabs regard them , the Arabs inside Israel , as collaborators , traitors ? The emotional position of the Israeli Arabs is tormenting ( and is held in that torment by the Arab radio stations ) , though they are materially secure , protected by equal justice under law , and by an almost exaggerated respect for their feelings . If the Arab nations made peace with Israel , it is possible that all Israeli Arabs would relax , be happy , and wholehearted supporters of Israel . If not , not . No one , after listening to Israeli Arabs , could believe that Palestinian refugees would be either contented or loyal citizens of Israel . The new village , that so pleased Nissim , was rows of small plastered houses painted in pastel shades , or white with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large rooms , a kitchen , a shower-washroom , and small gardens . No working-class Arabs I saw anywhere in the Middle East possess houses like these , but the owners were not satisfied , as I knew they would not be . One boy of about fourteen could speak Lnglish ; boys of this age are valuable informants ? they parrot their elders without reflection . " We are very poor , " he said . " How can you be very poor and live in these houses ? You have to pay for them . " " We must to work very hard . More harder than before . Terrible work . We have no land . " " Was n't farming hard work ? " " No . That was easy . Not like now . " " How does your family manage ? " " My brother works . In Tel Aviv . In a gasoline station . That is terrible hard work . " When we left , the pretty , healthy children ran beside the car , shouting . I waved . Nissim looked queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's the matter , Nissim ? " " Nothing . What the children say . " " You mean just now , shouting ? " " Yes . They say : ' Where you going , bastard ? I spit on you . ' " What for , I thought , what for , and will it never stop ? " Do you hate the Arabs , Nissim ? " " No . Of course no . " " Why not ? " " What is the good of hate ? " What indeed ? Arabs gorge on hate , they roll in it , they breathe it . Jews top the hate list , but any foreigners are hateful enough . Arabs also hate each other , separately and en masse . Their politicians change the direction of their hate as they would change their shirts . Their press is vulgarly base with hate-filled cartoons ; their reporting describes whatever hate is now uppermost and convenient . Their radio is a long scream of hate , a call to hate . They teach their children hate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is their daily bread . And what good has it done them ? THERE is no future in spending UN money to breed hate . There is no future in nagging or bullying Israel to commit suicide by the admission of a fatal locust swarm of enemies . There is no future in Nasser 's solution , the Holy War against Israel ; and we had better make this very clear , very quickly . Long bleak memories will recall the Sudetendeutsch and Czechoslovakia . In a new setting , Palestinian refugees assume the role of the Sudetendeutsch . Israel becomes Czechoslovakia . Propaganda prepares the war for liberation of " our brothers . " Victory over a minor near enemy is planned as the essential first step on a long triumphant road of conquest . A thousand-year Muslim Reich , the African continent ruled by Egypt , may be a mad dream , but we have experience of mad dreams and mad dreamers . We can not be too careful . The echo of Hitler 's voice is heard again in the land , now speaking Arabic . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Arab nations have been hit by independence and the twentieth century at the same time . It is a lot to handle , and they arc not handling it safely or sanely . The Cold War does not help them ; it encourages folly . East and West both treat the Arabs with nervous anxiety ; placatory and bribing , East and West keep their eyes fixed on the geographical location of the Arab states and the immense amount of oil under their deserts . No one does or can talk practical facts about Israel to the Arabs ; it would be useless . Even the soundest Arab leaders have tied their own hands tight in an official hate policy . At present , any Arab government which urged a quick , peaceful , advantageous settlement of the Palestine Refugee Problem would be mobbed . The mobs have been indoctrinated for thirteen years , as have the Arab refugees . The Palestinian refugees could have been absorbed into the economic life of the Arab countries long ago , despite the remark of UNRWA 's Director ? in his 1960 report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab countries . Of course they do not exist ; if they did , the Arab standard of life would be a finer and a better thing than it is now . The jobs must be made ; but the Arab countries need to have the jobs done as much as the refugees need to do them . The Director of UNRWA states , in the same report , that the majority of Palestinian refugees are unskilled peasants and there are enough or too many of those in the Arab countries already . No doubt . But unskilled peasants , all over the world , have learned to become skilled factory workers or scientific farmers , at very short notice ; that ability to learn is what snakes our modern industrial civilization tick . The Yemenite Jews who moved in a week from the Middle Ages to Israel , the unskilled Polish peasants operating the Nova Huta steel mills are obvious examples of this transformation . Neighboring Arabs regard the Palestinian Arabs as outstandingly intelligent . I would think this reputation deserved . There is no reason to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a will ? and as much unused land and wasted water , mineral and oil resources , underpopulation and undeveloped industries as in the vast Arab territories ? there 's a way . " Western Imperialists " would have to contribute most of the cash for the way , and it would be cheap at the price . It is more expensive to maintain paupers forever than to establish free , self-supporting citizens . One outlay of capital is futile and never ends ; the other is a capital investment , humane and profitable , and pays for itself . It pays in buying peace , and we do n't have to argue which is the better bargain , peace or war . " Western Imperialists " should provide the way ; the Arab governments would have to provide the will . Economics are not all , and the tragedy of most refugees is not that they starve in their countries of adoption , but that their hearts and minds and souls starve . They are lonely strangers who do not speak the language of the new land , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian refugees look , think , feel , and organize themselves socially as the Arabs of the " host countries " do . ' They speak the same language , they practice the same religion . The Christian minority would find fellow minority Christians in every Arab country except Lebanon , where they are on top . The Palestinian Arabs are not foreigners in the Arab world ; they are members of their own family . According to Arab politicians and apologists , the Palestinian refugees refuse to become integrated in the Arab world ; it is Palestine or nothing for them . Everyone shouts for the Palestinian refugees , and at them , and about them , but no one has ever asked the refugees what they themselves want : where do you want to live ; what do you want to do ? My tiny personal Gallup poll unearthed plenty of refugees who were happy where they were and had no desire to return to Palestine , no matter what ; and plenty of refugees who longed to emigrate to the richer Arab countries , where the future looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for one Christian Arab from Jaffa , who thinks Jews more honest than Arab Muslims and better people to do business with , none of them wanted to return to Israel , as Israeli citizens , and dwell in peace with their Jewish neighbors . We need a secret poll of both sexes , from the age of twelve onward , to discover the refugees ' own wishes for their own lives . The poll would have to be secret because it is impossible , even perilous , for an Arab refugee openly to disclaim interest in Palestine . Such a freethinker would be marked as a traitor to the Arab cause . Man is a political animal , but he also wants to live . Politics have offered a very dry crust to these refugees for a very long time . Yet the Arab governments insist that the Palestinian refugees are a political problem . Once a year , formally , they brandish these waiting lives at the UN Assembly . The rest of the year , with different degrees of intensity , depending on their domestic politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . The Arab governments Say they will not accept the existence of the state of Israel , now or ever . The logical conclusion is that , when ready , they intend to burst from their cold belligerent status into hot armed conflict and terminate Israel 's existence . We can not force the Arab nations to make peace with Israel , but we have to prevent them from making actual war ? for the sake of all human life , their own included . A vital preventive act would be to remove the Palestinian refugees as a justification of war . Is it fruitless to offer terms to the Arab governments ? We can not hurry them , or threaten them . Their pride has been scarred ; they are uncertain noisy adolescents in a tricky clever adult world ; their nationalism is new , and they suspect insults or attacks on it , from every side ; they do not live easily with themselves or with each other ; and they have not yet understood that a nation is only as strong as its people ? arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a useless burden . But if we know our own minds , are patient , firm , and generous , in time the Arab governments might allow us to enrich their countries . Our Western offer should be clear : UNRWA is to continue as a bridge to the future ; we will pay for the bridge and the future ? Palestinian refugees are gradually to become Arab citizens , earning their own livelihood on land , in industries , which our money and technical help will make available . All of this , but not another penny for a political problem . The Palestinian refugees must be taken out of politics forever and given the same chance that millions of refugees have had before them : a chance for work , private peace , and private life . Would the Arab governments reject such an offer flatly , in pique , and turn UNRWA over to the Russians ? The Arab leaders do not care for Communism at home . Russia , as parent and teacher of hundreds of thousands of young Arab refugees , would not charm them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oil and geography ) , we might for once risk taking a reasonable , compassionate line . We are not likely to be outbid in this field . The Arab governments do not love us , but they fear the proselytizing Communists more . UNRWA has been a splendid mother-andfather and can serve the refugees as a guide to the future . UNRWA 's greatest gift to the refugees , to the Arab world , and , indirectly , to us all is the education and health of its charges . UNRWA should receive more money and be considered primarily an educational institution . In my opinion , UNRWA will be with us for some time , an admirable training school for young Palestinians and a kindly old folks ' home for aged Palestinians . But UNRWA too must be taken out of politics . Its work should not be subject to Arab political supervision ; none of its activities should be used for Arab propaganda purposes ; and its Western personnel must keep themselves rigorously detached from the Arab-Israel controversy . TE Palestinian refugees are a chain reaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion began with the Balfour Declaration to " view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a home for the Jewish people . " More likely , the explosion started in the depths of time when the Romans drove the Jest 's from their one and only homeland , the soil that grew their history , the Bible . Nearly two thousand years later , Hitler and his followers committed such barbarous crimes against the Jews as all Christendom and all Islam , barbarous too , had never inflicted in the centuries of the Jewish dispersion . The Nazis and the gas chambers made the state of Israel inevitable : the Palestinian Arabs and the five invading Arab armies determined the boundaries of Israel . The Palestinian refugees are unfortunate victims of a brief moment in history . It is forgotten that Jews are also victims in the same manner , of the same moment . The Arab-Israel war and its continuous aftermath produced a two-way flight of peoples . Nearly half a million Jews , leaving behind everything they owned , escaped from the Arab countries where they lived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , if civilization lasts , Palestinian refugees will merge into the Arab nations , because the young will insist on real lives instead of endless waiting . If we can keep the peace , however troubled , the children of Palestinian refugees will make themselves at home among their own kind , in their ancestral lands . For the Jews there is no other ancestral land than Israel .
