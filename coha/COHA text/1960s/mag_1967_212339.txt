On his stock farm in the rolling country of Shropshire in western England , Farmer Richard Ellis noticed one day that two of his pigs were limping . He called in the local veterinarian , and received a dreaded diagnosis . His pigs had somehow become infected with one of the most contagious and toll-taking of all animal maladies : foot-and-mouth disease . That was in October , and the authorities immediately slaughtered all of Ellis ' livestock , buried them and took other preventive measures to confine the disease to one area . But the malady , which spreads with the silence and virulence of the bubonic plague of the Middle Ages , marched inexorably across the English countryside . Last week , despite frantic efforts to halt it , the worst animal epidemic in British history raged through a 17,640-sq. - mi. area from the county of Gloucester in the south to Westmorland in the north . <P> No Crossing Roads . A massive slaughter campaign to halt the spread of the disease , which affects almost all hooved animals , has turned Britain 's prize stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equipped with captive-bolt pistols and high-power rifles , have been killing cattle in infected areas as fast as they can shoot . More than 280,000 cows , bulls , sheep and pigs have already been slaughtered . Tractors pull the piles of carcasses to massive graves , and the pyres of burning animals nightly throw their smoke into the Shropshire sky . Soldiers and airmen have sprayed thousands of gallons of disinfectant on farms not yet hit by the plague , and at the border between infected and " clean " areas police prevent animals from crossing roads and carefully spray the tires of all passing vehicles in hopes of containing the epidemic . Horse racing and livestock shows have been canceled throughout the country . Many Britons will have a treeless Christmas because the government has closed down four major tree-producing areas . <P> <P> Ireland is so fearful that the disease may spread to its shores that travelers from Britain are required to walk through clouds of pungent disinfectant at Irish airports , and the Irish government placed ads in British papers appealing to Irish workers in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , Belgium and Holland have banned meat imports from the United Kingdom . Australia has ruled that emigrants from Britain can enter the country only by ship , not by air , in order to diminish the likelihood of the virus ' living long enough to infect Australian herds with the disease . <P> International Illness . British stock raisers suspect that the culprit virus came into Britain in meat from Argentina that was eaten as garbage by pigs on farms near that of Farmer Ellis . Because the incubation period is as long as ten days , a sick animal may infect thousands of others before showing signs of illness-thus the need for preventive slaughters .
