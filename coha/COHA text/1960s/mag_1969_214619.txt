The tightly controlled Sino-Soviet borderlands are about as easy for the ordinary traveler to visit as Middle Earth or Lower Slobbovia , and some of the terrain along the 4,500-mile common frontier displays characteristics of both those fabled lands . A few wanderers , including scholars , journalists and political analysts have managed to visit portions of the frontier . Their impressions , gathered by TIME correspondents around the world , of the lonely , alien and often lovely terrain where the modern empires of Moscow and Peking collide : <P> SOME 70 miles south of the site of the vicious four-hour battle between Soviet and Chinese border guards lies the enormous Chinese prison camp called Hsing Kai Hu , a complex of nine state farms and dozens of villages , all manned by penal ' labor . A former prisoner there recalls the climate as terrible : temperatures hovering around 40 below zero in winter and soaring to a humid 95 in summer . During the warm seasons , mosquitoes from the myriad swamps of the area forced prisoners to wear long-sleeved jackets and full-length trousers despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enormously fertile . In 1960 , the complex was able to produce enough food to feed a million people for a year-or so Chinese propagandists claimed . In summer , however , it is no place for combat . Veterans of Japan 's 13-year occupation of Manchuria recall the Ussuri River border area as " the worst possible place for a battle for much of the year-so swampy that it could easily swallow up an army . " The Chinese side of the Ussuri is heavily forested ; timbered hills sweep down to the river swamps for most of its length . Through the forests on the Soviet side runs the easternmost segment of the Trans-Siberian Railway , which links the key Pacific port of Vladivostok with Khabarovsk , more than 400 miles to the north . Beside the railway runs what the Japanese occupiers used to call " the Stalin Highway , " a road built in 1938 in imitation of Hitler 's Autobahnen . <P> Khabarovsk itself is a garrison city . Soviet troopers throng the streets , and though it is only 20 miles from the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . Westerners who have been there say the surrounding terrain is flat and bushy , broken by occasional birch forests . The soil is fertile : travelers describe the Amur River basin , in which Khabarovsk lies , as the " breadbasket of the Soviet Far East . " For hundreds of miles , from Vladivostok on north , industry has been built up as well . Across the border , in the Chinese provinces of Heilungkiang and Kirin , industry is also thriving : the great manufacturing cities of Harbin ( steel ) and Changchun ( trucks ) play a vital role in the Chinese economy . <P> Until recently , the Amur-Ussuri area has been the site of the most spectacular provocations . On several occasions , the Chinese made a practice of marching prisoners to the center of the river , accusing them of being pro-Soviet traitors , and then beheading them . Another favorite habit was forming up on the river ice , sticking out tongues in unison at the Soviet troopers , and then turning and dropping trousers to the Russians in an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took refuge behind large portraits of Chairman Mao .
