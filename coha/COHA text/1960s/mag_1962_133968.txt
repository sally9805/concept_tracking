There was something for everybody at the 81st National Singles Championships at Forest Hills , N.Y . last week . Next to the stadium , in which each day 's most promising matches were held , there was a shiny new automobile , put there , said the sign , as a salute to the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association . Beneath the stadium 's concrete arches there was a machine that boomed tennis balls at any customers who cared to face it . If they were able to volley its serves back into a small , round target they got a prize . There was a show of tennis fashions for those who would rather look than play . " We do applaud white for tennis , " intoned a fashion-wise lady , herself accoutered in a cloth coat with a fur collar , " but green might be a new color . " Models paraded by in green sweaters . Models in old-fashioned costumes pirouetted past . " It is said , " commented the fashion lady , " that one player always wore a cake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the exit in the qualifying round of one Hugh Sweeney , who may quite possibly be the last man ever to play tournament tennis in long white flannel pants . For those who liked tennis there was comedy and drama alike in a tensely fought match between clumsy but crafty Whitney Reed and Mexico 's dogged Rafael Osuna , a match that ended after five grueling sets with Reed hurling himself through the air into Osuna 's outstretched arms . There were a number of dramatic upsets , including those of sixth-seeded Jan Erik Lundquist of Sweden by aging Vic Seixas and of Wimbledon Champion Karen Hantze Susman by 17-year-old Vicki Palmer  --  indelicately nicknamed The Grunter. // For connoisseurs of mystery , there was the unanswered question of what became of Nicola Pietrangeli of Italy , seeded No. 7 . Nicola just plain did n't bother to come , but to make up for his absence , and to add a special spice to the tournament , there was the largest aggregation of foreign entrants ever to take part in a U.S. tournament  --  more than 110 players from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special airlift sponsored by the People-to-People Sports Committee . // The foreign players included a women 's Wimbledon finalist , Vera Sukova of Czechoslovakia , Germany 's pert brunette Helga Schultze ( SI , Aug. 27 ) Margaret Smith of Australia , bearded Jorgen Ulrich of Denmark , Maria Bueno of Brazil , cheerful Reino Nyyssoenen of Finland and the first Russians to play at Forest Hills . None of the Russians  --  Davis Cuppers Tomas Lejus , Sergei Likhachev , junior champion Alexander Metreveli and the women 's champion , Anna Dmitrieva  --  got very far in the tournament , but everyone was impressed with their good manners , earnestness and restraint when they got bad calls . All of them used the American twist service . // For true tennis fans , however , the real thrill of this year 's nationals was the attempt of Australia 's Rod Laver to become the first man since Don Budge in 1938 , and the second in history , to achieve the tennis Grand Slam by adding the U.S. championship to those he had won in Australia , France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian , Netherlands , Norwegian and Swiss championships , in addition to the big three , this hawk-nosed , freckle-faced , bowlegged Australian is a prime product of the almost unbeatable Australian system of spotting , nurturing and financing its best tennis players from the cradle . The son of a grazier ( cattle rancher ) , Laver was exposed early and often to tennis . His father was one of 13 children  --  all tennis players . He met and wooed Rod 's mother at the tennis matches in Queensland , in the town of Dingo ( named after the Australian wild dogs ) . There were tennis courts adjoining every ranch and city house the Lavers lived in . Rod 's father sometimes had to cook dinner , because Mrs. Laver was out on the courts batting tennis balls around with the children . Rod , the first redheaded , left-handed Laver , played his two older brothers from the time he was six . He used a hand-me-down racket with a sawed-off handle . // In Rockhampton the Lavers won all the tournaments in sight  --  mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splitting up the various age championships . When he was 13 Rod competed against his brother Bob for the Central Queensland junior title . Because the finals were a family affair , they were held on the Laver home court . Bob won a close match over Rod , who could hardly see higher than the net . A short while later Rod got the break most Australian youngsters hope for , when he was selected to attend a tennis course sponsored by a major Brisbane newspaper . He caught the eye , inevitably , of the man running the course , Harry Hopman , the panjandrum of Australian tennis , and the lid was nailed on his future . When a case of jaundice interrupted his school work , Rod told his father , " The other blokes have had two months ' school that I missed , and I want to quit . I do n't want to be the galah ( Aussie for " jerk " ) that failed . " // With his father 's consent , Rod left school at 15 , and through Hopman got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of job that pays a tennis player whether he is there to punch a time clock or not . With Hopman to coach him , and some of the world 's finest competition to spur him on , Laver toughened up his game while languishing in the shade of Hoad and Rose-wall . Australia 's tennis officials  --  unlike the guardians of American athletes  --  professed no worry about Laver 's lack of formal schooling in more academic fields . // Although he has traveled over most of the world Rod Laver at 24 is almost painfully uncommunicative . Coached in his early years by Hopman not to say anything to the press , he is so well disciplined that he will hardly admit he is left-handed . After winning the Wimbledon tournament last July by demolishing his countryman Martin Mulligan 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-1 , Laver admitted he thought he had played quite well . When he was asked if he thought there was a jinx on his winning the U.S. championship he said , " Anyone who thinks that is bein ' tyken in by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does a mean Charleston , thinks the grass at Forest Hills is too soft ( as do the Russians ) , likes to watch baseball , and will probably turn professional for $100,000 after Australia 's defense of the Davis Cup next December . In view of these prospects and his current fame , it might be argued that stopping school at 15 was unimportant for Laver. // Laver uses his wrist more than any other player in history except Frank Kovacs and he is the first player to combine a whipping wrist action with near-perfect control . Laver can hit a ball fiat , with topspin or with underspin , equally well from both sides . Like a squash player , he adds power to a shot and disguises its direction by putting wrist into his shot at the moment of impact . Few players have his repertory of strokes , and no player has been able to mask his shots better . He has tremendous kick on his serve , and his second serve finds its twisting way so deep in the service court that it often hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make forcing shots of returns that most players would be happy to get back at all . He is cool , too . Last July the jet that was carrying him to matches in Hilversum , in The Netherlands , suddenly dived sharply to avoid colliding with another plane . Thirteen passengers had to be carried off the plane by stretcher-bearers , while the remainder left considerably shaken by the experience . Laver changed clothes , marched out onto the court and easily defeated his opponent . A Dutch official commented , " He nearly gets killed and then he comes out here and plays as if nothing had happened . " Add to all this the most effective smash in amateur tennis today , the most lethal serve any man under 5 feet 10 has yet uncorked , an uncanny ability to hit finishing volleys from almost anywhere in midcourt ( Laver never just puts the ball in play ) and the fact that his left-handed shots curve and spin exactly opposite to what his opponents are accustomed to  --  and Rod Laver becomes a formidable opponent indeed . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rod Laver demonstrated this fact to , respectively , Israel 's Eleazar Davidman , Ecuador 's Eduardo Zuleta , Germany 's Bodo Nitsche , Mexico 's Antonio Palafox , Florida 's Frank Froehling , Mexico 's Rafael Osuna and , finally , his own countryman , Roy Emerson , the defending champion . // Aussie sweep // Considering the stakes , the pressures weighing on Laver as he went against Emerson  --  who had taken him in straight sets last year  --  were enormous . However , Rocket Rod faced his opponent as cool as a koala , and used the same tactics against him that he had used the day before on Osuna . He hit wildly spinning , hard , shoetop-high shots almost impossible to volley . Very often he hit the ball so fast that Emerson could merely watch as it skimmed by . On service , as usual , he was all but invincible . For a brief moment early in the third set Laver grew careless , and Emerson , taking heart , won the set 7-5 . But in the final set Laver broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His three-sets-to-one victory for the coveted Grand Slam was almost an anticlimax . Rod tossed his racket in the air , put a towel to his face , leaned wearily against the umpire 's stand and finally  --  for the first time in the tournament  --  smiled . // Laver 's triumph was a personal one , but it capped an unprecedented all-Australian sweep of the U.S. tournament . Not only had two Aussies contested the men 's finals but , for the first time ever , an Australian girl , Margaret Smith , had won the women 's championship . Titian-haired Margaret , 20-year-old daughter of an ice-cream packer , is big-boned , determined , earnest and skilled . Margaret has been ostracized by Australian tennis officials for sassing her elders and refusing to take orders from her team mother . None of the other Aussies were allowed even to practice with her at Forest Hills . But these things seemed to trouble her not at all as she beat twice-champion Darlene Hard 9-7 , 6-4 in a finals match notable mostly for bad calls and a weeping spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Smith and Fred Stolle won the mixed doubles . There was something for everybody at Forest Hills , all right  --  but it helped if you happened to be an Australian .
