If the reserve and national guard units are not able to maintain their force levels by volunteers , they should be filled by inductions . MINORITY GROUPS There should be more Negro draft board officials . Other minority groups , such as Spanish-Americans , should also be better represented . The commi- ? religion concluded that the Negro 's position in the military manpower situation is in many ways disproportionate : . DOCTORS AND DENTISTS A national ' computer file should be established of draft eligible doctors and dentists and allied medical professions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from local boards . CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS Recognition as conscientious objectors of those opposed to a particular war such as Viet Nam instead of war in general was rejected .

THE REJECTED Volunteers who did not meet induction standards but who can be brought up to a level of usefulness thru special educational or physical training should be accepted .
