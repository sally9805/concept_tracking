Some 260 counties in 16 states have been designated drought emergency-relief areas and are receiving federal help . In these areas , where feed is short , farmers have permission to graze their herds on conservation-reserve acreage which is otherwise closed to grazing . Farm Home Administration loans are also helping farmers to maintain foundation herds . Most severely affected by the drought were the Midwest , the central and southern great plains , and the East . Southern states south of Kentucky and Virginia and east of the Mississippi River escaped , as did the Pacific Coast and Rocky Mountain states . A spot check of five states yields this picture : ?

Rough weather in May particularly hurt the wheat crop , but precipitation in late June allowed Kansas farmers to harvest " a fairly good crop , " though not up to preseason prospects . Seventy-six counties have been designated drought emergency-relief areas and are eligible to use conservation reserve acreage . The eastern one-third of the state was not affected . Thanks to the September rains , however , the over-all outlook in Kansas is not too discouraging . " It will probably be an average year , " says a farm editor .
