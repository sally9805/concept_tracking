 | The Letters - and Life - of HENRY ADAMS HENRY ADAMS stands so decidedly in the forefront of American historians and autobiographers that it perhaps need be stressed that he stands decidedly first among American letter writers . Moreover , it is Adams the letter writer who most vividly reveals Henry Adams the man , the possessor of a particular temperament , the product of a particular society ? a society that was in one sense to help create his values ; in another , to help make them crumble . The man is fairly remote from us in the scholar and the historian , the man is posed very formally for us in the autobiographer and the man of thought ; on the other hand , the man comes brilliantly alive in the letter writer , where he is constantly the man of the world . If , again , in his letters he makes us think of another man of the world who was also a great social letter writer ? Horace Walpole ? it is not least because Henry Adams thought so himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congenial and absorbing enough to make a dinner companion of them when he dined alone , but as a young man , Adams could confess that without hoping to become a Walpole , he would like to think that in aftertimes his letters , too , might be read and quoted as " a memorial of manners and habits " ? in his case , " of the time of the great Secession of 1860 . " And " what surprises me most , " @# Adams remarks of Walpole some ten years l. : : " is that he is so extremely like ourselves ; he in : be a letter writer of today . . . until , " Adams a " I trip over a sword ! " Now , clearly , what attracted Adams to Wal was not the man himself , for in all sorts of w they crucially differed ? though more than might imagine , they could be strangely alike . allied . What attracted Adams is the world th both inhabit , and the worldly events they b chronicle , and the worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't know th people , " Adams says in 1869 of Walpole 's cast characters , " then we know some one for all world like them ! How little the world has chang in a century ! " The fact of the matter , of course , is that world had changed tremendously in a century Things are as far apart as The Vicar of Wakefield and Zola ; as early Mozart and late Wagner ; as t sedan chair and the transcontinental railroad ; as the reign of the aristocracy and the rule of the middle class ; as thirteen discontented colonies and some thirty-odd United States . The world , between 1769 and 1869 , had passed through momentous revolutions ? American and French , agrarian and industrial , mechanical and sociological . Malthus and Darwin had invaded the scene , medicine  | and science had transformed it . Most people , looking back a century from 1870 , would have an all too complacent sense of spectacular distance . And yet one can quite understand how a Henry Adams might remark on " how little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great point involved is how little the two men 's way of looking at things and what they looked at differed . At bottom Adams ' comment is not one of fact but of attitude ? of nil admirari , and of encountering nothing that really could surprise one . But in a far more literal sense , Adams could feel how little the world he encountered in Walpole 's letters differed from the world he looked out on from his Washington window . For what each man means by " the world " is almost identical , is the world of politics , seen from the , inside , and the world of society , lived at its very center ; is a world of forms and punctilios that conceal much more than they show and that make , accordingly , for a great hive of gossip , for looking through keyholes and feeling for cracks ; a world of bland treacheries and bizarre alliances and astounding coalitions , a world with moments of fairyland and more frequent moments of farce ; a world , above all , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its underside all grime . IF I so extensively compare two men who lived an eon and an ocean apart , it is to make the essential point that in Adams ' case they really did n't ? that e was in temperament very much an eighteenthcentury man , that he was most often in his sympathies both aristocratic and English . At least two very important qualities distinguish Adams from a social chronicler of genius like Walpole : Adams had a first-rate mind , where Walpole , by any significant standards , had no mind at all ; and Adams had generally , what Walpole wholly lacked , a masculine outlook . But the very fact that Adams far surpassed Walpole is what lends particular interest to his so often resembling him . The magnificence of Adams ' letters , as letters , as light thrown on a whole age and society , remains in the end their high and absolute merit . But they have an additional value , as an accumulative , unwitting self-portrait of someone not just a great letter writer , but of someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he failed to be , a great man . However different the nineteenth century might otherwise seem , it still offered its letter writers decided eighteenth-century opportunities and rewards . If the eighteenth century 's Walpole was the son of a treme ' us Prime Minister , the nineteenth century 's Adams was the grandson and great- grandson of Presidents . When young , Adams , too , had his own form of the classic Grand Tour , to become thereafter a member of a well-born and well-connected circle , and to move very rarely outside it . Adams took an eighteenth-century pleasure in the company of clever women who possessed the attributes of great ladies ; he took an eighteenth-century interest in the minor forms no less than the monuments of culture ? in objets d'art no less than paintings , in country houses as well as cathedrals . Adams , too , within his own constricted social world , became the friend of party politicians as well as distinguished statesmen ; and became , just so , as shruggingly cynical of what his friends were up to as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams professed to live apart from society ; yet , with eighteenth-century finesse , he contrived to be intimately , indeed confidentially , in touch with it . All this helped imbue his - letters with peculiar , particular , delightful eighteenth-century overtones and effects . He shared one thing further with that supreme era of social letter writers : however much he might disparage whom he was writing about , whomever he was writing to he made every effort to please . Sometimes this was simply by being playful : he wishes , he says , that he could offer news either that I was dead , or born again , or had lost my grandmother , or was left an orphan , or was elected King of Manchuria . On the contrary , nothing has happened . Almost every one else has died , as usual , or threatened to die , and whole batches of Kings have been elected in Manchuria ; but I am sitting here in Washington just as you left me ten years ago . Adams had that quality among great letter writers not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to show what could be made of it . And he had always a certain sophisticated fancifulness , or whimsicality of phrase . He describes the great Temple of Aesculapius as a sort of " Greek Carlsbad . " He writes from his summer home in Massachusetts that " the mosquitoes are so thick that on hot , sunny days they cast an agreeable flickering shade . " He had also the gift of creating something wild and amusing out of what in itself might be grisly : Old Levi P. Morton , who is hovering in or about his nineties , was in the Bernay R.R. accident the other day , and crawled out from the dead bodies through an upper window ; got a cab nearby , drove two hours , caught another train , and got to Paris at 11 o'clock , while his daughters were turning over all the corpses on the field to find him . And Adams adds by way of postscript : The man knew better than to be killed and leave his daughters ten millions apiece . No King Lear about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fiancee to one of his closest English friends : Imprimis , and to begin with , the young woman calls herself Marian Hooper and belongs to a sort of clan , as all Bostonians do . . . . She is 28 years old . She knows her own mind uncommon well . She does not talk very American . Her manners are quiet . She reads German ? also Latin ? also , I fear , a little Greek , but very little . She talks garrulously , but on the whole pretty sensibly . She is very open to instruction . We shall improve her . She dresses badly . She decidedly has humor and will appreciate our wit . She has enough money to be quite independent . She rules me as only American women rule men , and I cower before her . A little more acidly , indeed with a touch of the snobbish dowager , Adams gives this description of his first White House call on President and Mrs. Grant : At last Mrs. Grant strolled in . She squints like an isosceles triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her sense of dignity did not allow her to talk to me , but occasionally she condescended to throw me a constrained remark . . . . I flattered myself that it was I who showed them how they ought to behave . One feels such an irresistible desire . . . to tell this kind of individual to put themselves at their ease and talk just as though they were at home . Twenty-five years pass , and Adams goes again to the White House , this time to dine with the socially far more acceptable Theodore Roosevelts : they , indeed , are his good friends . We waited twenty minutes in the hideous red drawing room before Theodore and Edith came down , and we went into dinner immediately with as much chaff and informality as though Theodore were still a civil service commissioner . . . . Edith was very bright and gay , but as usual Theodore absorbed the conversation , and if he tried me ten years ago , he crushes me now . To say that I had enjoyed it would be , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indifferent , very badly served , and , for some reason , nothing to drink but a glass of sherry and some apollinaris . It is almost possible to say of Adams , here , that whether or not he enjoyed the dinner party is beside the point . What is clear is that he immensely enjoyed not enjoying it . After all , to the social chronicler , the more gaffes and solecisms and contretemps on any occasion , the better ; to a sort of drama critic of the social scene , the staging , the lighting , the performances of the actors make all the brighter copy for not being quite right in themselves . On the public and political side also , even on the side of large events , Adams can be lightly mocking , can mingle froth with bile . Though himself keeping , with a certain insistent disdain , outside the arena , he is decidedly pleased with how well he knows all the gladiators , and no less pleased with 82 having a commanding view of the show , which he describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan gets practically the whole loan , and the small thieves are furious . My view . . . is always to encourage the big thieves and to force the pace . Let 's get there quick ! I 'm for Morgan , McKinley and the Trusts . They will bring us to ruin quicker than we could do ourselves . Like Horace Walpole again , Adams is very wishful of ruin ? only to show considerable fright who anything real starts threatening him . But it is time to move on from the eighteenth- century worldling in Adams to the nineteenthcentury man of intellect , and the child of a far more complex age . The nature of the great world may have changed rather little in a century ; butt something disenchanting , and democratizing , had intervened . Where men a century before , with their modishly skeptical minds , were not too often confronted with taxing and vexing new forces and hypotheses , Adams , with his own inquiring nature , was now constantly assaulted by them . Where men a century before basked in that short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke , Adams came to manhood in a century whose geology could be as menacing as its munitions , and whose new ways of writing history seemed almost as radical as its new ways of making it . There was also a side of Henry Adams that not just responded to this but went forth to meet it . The ambivalences , the contrarieties , the ironies of life held and fascinated him ; and where a mere accomplished worldling could see only the masks and false faces of politics and society , Adams saw into the true , or at any rate trenchant , forces behind them . The lights of Adams ' searching curiosity play all over the letters from the far parts of the world where he went to satisfy it , where , often with considerable discomfort , he went poking and rambling about , and looked into corners and questioned . To grasp their range , the letters from Japan or from Samoa must be read as a whole ; short quotations can only garble general reactions . Similarly , brief extracts from the letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of political and social curiosity , of intellectual and moral inquiry he exhibited , and the student of the world at large he was , rather than the spectator of a world of capitals . To the austere , republican , crusading family strain the young Henry added a touch of what is good and enriching in Hamlet . And yet , as the letters ? which are the truest index to the personal life ? reveal , there  | came as time passed , there came increasingly , a touch of what was bad and debilitating in Hamlet , and hardly anything at all of the old true Adams strain . There was in Henry Adams on his mother 's side , as he was swift to point out at the very beginning of the Education , the Boston rich mercantile strain , what he called the State Street side . If the Adamses had put at birth a sword , or a torch , or the tablets of the law in Henry 's hands , the Brookses had put in his mouth a gold spoon . He spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as on so much else ; but in truth he was not to suffer from gagging on it , he was to suffer from being unable to do without it . It was the golden apple , the apple of inner discord , in his life . In terms of intellectual distinction , in terms of Henry Adams the serious and great historian , the paternal strain was to prevail . But with the man it did not ; with Henry Adams the man it was the State Street side , in the sensitive and cultivated forms it had the means to create , that would predominate . The tragedy of Henry Adams ' marriage ? his wife 's suicide when he was forty-seven and at the height of his intellectual career ? helps account , perhaps , for the character of his later life , for what Paul Elmer More called his " sentimental nihilism " ; for what we might call ? while saying nothing much different ? his half-rueful , half-malicious pleasure in watching the best-laid plans , or the world itself , go smash . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outset cherished , partly because it was a fine tradition and partly because it was a family product , had lost its hold on the nation ; but in any vital sense , it had also lost its hold on Henry himself . We have no right to demand a militant nature of someone with a speculative mind . Yet , however much Adams may have been deterred from the life of the arena by temperament , surely he was drawn toward it , for a time , by a consciousness of his Adams heritage and by an ambition all his own . But something ? family pride of a sort , and the very background of family Presidents ? made any rough-and-tumble seeking out of high office extremely repugnant . Clearly Adams tended to see himself as an heir apparent ; the possessor of the gold spoon expected his political career to be served up to him on a silver platter . But the rough-and-tumble political world was not so deferential or obliging ; and denied the rewards of office , Henry Adams never , in any crusading sense , endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , privately acidulous avowals , and then disgruntled dissents , and eventually mere cynical rejections . The world 's senates and the world 's stock exchanges , Adams muttered , were dominated by rascals ; and what could any gentleman , or any wise man , do but sit back and sniff and shudder ? Despite the cultivated voice of Boston and Henry Adams , we are rather close at times to the tone and temper of Baltimore and Henry Mencken . John and John Quincy Adams , surveying the triumph of vulgar materialistic democratic forces , would , in their way , have shuddered as did Henry Adams in his ; but might they not have shuddered a little , too , at what Henry was doing , or not doing ; and at what he winked as well as shuddered at ? IF Henry Adams was Hamlet in that he lacked the resolution to help avenge the murder of his grandfather 's and his great-grandfather 's dreams ; if he was Hamlet in that he , in the Education , like the Prince of Denmark in his soliloquies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Hamlet in possessing a reflective and humorous nature , veined with sensibility and streaked with cruelty and disgust , and masculine in its thinking and feminine in its emotions ? if he was Hamlet in all these things , he was Hamlet in one thing more : in relishing his privileged place in life . Adams might be the retired scholar , but on how high and high-handed a level of retirement : it was not merely as a scholar that he seldom went out in Washington but had everybody come to him ; it was as a personage , almost a potentate . That he saw no one in Washington is of course a ridiculous myth : he saw whomever he wanted to , and on his own terms . And elsewhere , any such contention would come close to nonsense ; year after year Henry Adams crossed to Europe on luxury liners and for months on end moved about Europe at least as much prince as Hamlet ? in a succession of splendid hotels and restaurants and country houses , and in an atmosphere not always so conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sumptuousness of living and haughtiness of tone ; an atmosphere , no doubt , of cultivation and elegance , but also of the great world as it had come to be , and of the often new worldlings who had come forth to be part of it . There was a savor of the English gentry about it , a certain smack of established Boston , but these sureties of aristocratic or republican breeding went hand in hand with the high-mucky-mucks and panjandrums of the Republican Party in the age of Mark Hanna , with the enlightened tone of Pennsylvania 's ruthless political boss , Senator Cameron . A great many of Adams ' companions were very rich . Henry White was to marry a Vanderbilt ; John Hay had married a fortune , and his daughter now married a Whitney ; and Adams , thanks to his quite handsome inheritance , could always hold up his end . To be sure , even when in 1900 a million-dollar fortune yielded him more  | than $50,000 a year ( perhaps $150,000 in our money ) , Adams " humorously complained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in his splendid biography , " an expert knowledge of stocks and bonds . " On this head , all the sniffs at vulgar moneymaking from somebody whose money had been made for him , and not really very far back , turn a little tiresome . And in view of his annual London and Paris visits , there is something not just tiresome , but a little fraudulent , about his remarking ? to quote just one of many examples ? " Of all parts of the world I know , the rottenest are Paris and London . " It is not that , in all this , one would cut Adams off from the cosmopolitan life and the international scene that he was heir to ; but that this cut him off from so much else . At his best Adams was a great individual , and in the letters there is something notably individualizing , too . But more and more in the letters , we begin to encounter , for all their sharp comments and vivid phrases , certain small prejudices and fixed postures ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air of criticism that would diminish the refusal to act . A distinguished intellectual is not to be summarily condemned because so many of his best friends are millionaire pillars of the Republican Party during one of its most dubious eras . But it ca n't help making us wonder how many real artists and intellectuals who lacked social credentials were part of Adams ' circle , were the people he saw and not simply people he wrote to . It ca n't help making us ask how much the worldling Brahmin in him was stopped by surfaces and appearances from appreciating what had decided value and depth . The two American writers whom Adams saw in later years are surely those we might have supposed he did : Henry James and Edith Wharton . This is unexceptionable ; but what of other writers ? His very first comment on Kipling has nothing to do with his merits as a writer or a man : " I imagine Kipling , " Adams wrote to Mrs. Cameron , " to be rather a bohemian and wanderer of the second or third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Louis Stevenson who looked , said Adams , " like an insane stork , " acknowledge Stevenson 's kindness , but they harp on the messiness of his Samoan menage , on what Adams calls its " dirt and discomfort . " John Jay Chapman was for Adams only " the most ordinary , conventional , simple-minded of cranks " : a comment that squares nicely with Adams ' brother-in-law 's assessing Chapman as " just his grandmother and nothing more . " A further drawback to being part of a tight gilded circle is that , with something like the Dreyfus case , Adams becomes an anti-Dreyfusard . And when Dreyfus was sent back to France for retrial , Adams writes : " To my regret they have brought Dreifuss sic home , and ceased to talk about him , which makes life dull . I hope they soot . begin to bait somebody else , to make it lively again . " Even accepted as banter , this sound ; nasty . In terms , again , of literary taste , Mallarm and Verlaine get short shrift ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Impressionists were still fairly easy to come by , that the Par. , dealers " offer no good pictures . " OBVIOUSLY , a man 's personal merits and shot.  - -  comings are one thing , and his values as an artist or thinker another . Balzac was not the less truthfu delineator of the great world because of his arde : . royalism , nor Jane Austen less truthful for her personal provincial snobberies , nor Proust for a snobbishness almost pathological . An insistence on telling the truth , a compulsive artistic probity , went into all such writers ' work . But it seems to me that over the years something comparably vital went out of Henry Adams ' responses to the life about him . The History remains a great monument ; both the Education and the Mont-Saint-Michel have distinction and importance . But the truth is , and the letters are our guide to it , that Henry Adams failed in the end of a certain sense of contemporary responsibility . Consider his habit , in his letters , of disparaging the powers that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism , the readiness to blame everything on democratic vulgarians or " Jew bankers " ( the anti-Semitism was so intense and rabblelike that when stocks went down , Mr. Samuels tells us , Adams " eagerly gorged himself on the filth of the anti-Semite press " ) . Such disparagement comes to sound like a glib , mindless justification of his own passivity and withdrawal . Cynicism is always a moral evasion , an inward malaise . In terms of Adams ' personal emotions , of lostness and perhaps inner deadness and unfulfillment , much that could be ascribed to his wife 's death or his frustrating love for Mrs. Cameron can be by so much forgiven . But on that score there is no excusing the callous. irresponsible shoulder shrugs about the public life of the day , or the growls that are all too often whines . All this becomes habitual , mechanical ? a fixed attitude in Adams , as John Hay described it to Henry Cabot Lodge , of " Whatever is , is wrong . " And Hay wrote to Adams himself , ir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends the truth , that his chronic complaints were " the sentiments of a scholar and a gentleman who has had a better time all his life than he deserved , and now whines because it is over . " This indeed , and only the more in coming from an intimate friend , is a summary judgment .
