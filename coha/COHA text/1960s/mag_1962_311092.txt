When tearful Jack Paar bade his brave farewell to television 's biggest late-nighttime audience , the silence that followed seemed merciful . The tantrums , the shaded vulgarity , the curious , hostile tension of his nightly soiree had come to an end . It has taken almost two months without Paar to illustrate how forceful each ingredient was . to sketch the enormity of the hole he left behind . Filling in until Johnny Carson takes over the Tonight show next fall , some of television 's tinniest princes have presided over the show , and each has left the unmistakable mark of his inability to master Paar 's charismatic tricks . <P> The replacement NBC feels most comfortable with is somebody named Merv Griffin , who has slopped over from daytime game shows . When Griffin is blessed with glib guests-as he was on several shows last week-he is at least innocuous and agile at keeping the conversation alive . Art Linkletter 's turns at the helm suggest a scoutmaster on a field trip . <P> Boyish Bob Cummings , most hapless of the lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These tentative flings sputter along , propelled by weak jokes and-when needed-repeats of a Linkletter show-and the best of Art is none too good . <P> With the critics , most successful of these temporary Paarlor maids is Joey Bishop , who confesses that no one can do the show except Paar . " There are many things the show requires-about six things , " Bishop says . " The guest-hosts have had at most three or four . Paar had all of them . " The six are , he said : curiosity , naive honesty , sense of tempo , sense of humor , pacing , and a feeling of uncertainty . " Paar superseded any of his guests , " says Bishop , " whereas the rest of us depend on who the guests are . " <P> But NBC bravely insists that the show 's ratings have climbed since Paar left ; such as it is , Tonight may now be seen over 184 stations , three more than Paar 's last audience . But for most , the parade of tryouts was only a sad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nights with cruel charm .
