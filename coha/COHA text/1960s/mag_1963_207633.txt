" I 'm not here to greet anybody , " snapped New York City 's official greeter . Public Events Commissioner Richard C. Patterson Jr. , as he strode past a clutch of curious newsmen in the lobby of Manhattan 's Barclay Hotel one morning last week . " I 'm just here to see that the lady has sufficient police protection . " The lady-South Viet Nam 's Mme. Ngo Dinh Nhu-coolly assured Patterson that her protection was just fine . Besides , she added , " God is in my corner . " <P> Even so , there were times last week when her corner must have seemed a lonely place . As curiosity about the sister-in-law of South Viet Nam 's President Ngo Dinh Diem began to ebb in the second week of her 21-day tour , sympathetic crowds dwindled , officials cold-shouldered her , and about the only people who turned out to see her were newsmen and students . <P> Poison Ivy . Venturing onto the college circuit , Mme. Nhu found little but poison Ivy along the way . At Harvard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 500 churlish student pickets who were parading outside and carrying signs with such labored slogans as NHU DEAL is NHU DIEM GOOD . They pounded on the doors , splattered the building with eggs and rattled the windows while she spoke . Inside , things were not much better . When Mme. Nhu , sheathed in brocade and silk and trailing a mink stole , complained that " Americans in Viet Nam do not live like us ... austerely like us , " the crowd of 1,700 hissed loudly . <P> At Princeton , she complained that " they showed bad manners-very bad manners-at Harvard . " But Old Nassau was not much more polite . Some 250 pickets , including six Buddhist monks from a monastery in Freewood Acres , N.J. , refugees from Tibet and Russia , turned up to razz her . Protested Mme. Nhu : " You 're not helping us by hissing or booing us . Tell us precisely what 's wrong with us . " <P> Before anyone could say " Buddhist , " however , Mme. Nhu whisked off to Washington , spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with the U.S.* " I have not met your Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , " she told an audience of some 800 which jammed the Women 's National Press Club . " But from a distance he seems more mysterious than an Asian . " The Kennedy Administration was full of liberals , she said , and while " liberals are n't red yet , they 're pink . " As for the U.S. decision to withhold some economic aid from the Diem regime in hopes of forcing reforms , it only proved that " there is no real eagerness to win the war against the Communists . " <P> " Trail of Stench . " That evening Mme. Nhu sallied forth in search of her estranged father , Tran Van Chuong , who was replaced as Vietnamese Ambassador to Washington two months ago after criticizing Diem 's policies . With a score of newsmen and photographers trailing her , she pounded on the door of the darkened Tran home on a tree-lined Washington street while her lovely , 18-year-old daughter , Le Thuy , rang the bell . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of life . She went around to the back door . Still no answer . No wonder . The Trans were in Manhattan , where the ex-ambassador was laying plans for a speaking tour designed to cover up what he called " the trail of stench " left by his talkative daughter .
