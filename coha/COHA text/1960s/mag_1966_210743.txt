Willmore is a helicopter pilot who has flown 400 assault operations in Viet Nam , has had his craft hit by gunfire 23 times , has twice been shot down and has collected the Bronze Star and eight oakleaf clusters for his Air Medal . Now Captain Willmore , 31 , has become the first and only serviceman in the Vietnamese war to declare for public office in the U.S. Willmore is seeking the Democratic nomination for Congressman in Idaho 's Second District , has already won the party 's official endorsement . Last week he started home to prepare for the August primary . If he wins the primary-and he has only limited opposition-he will face freshman Republican Representative George Hansen , 35 , who served 31 years in the Air Force . <P> Though a member of the armed forces can not officially campaign , Willmore said last week at his 1st Cavalry Division ( Airborne ) post in An Khe : " I am already running . " His wife and friends have been combing the district to drum up supporters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary . A political science graduate of the University of Idaho who joined the Army five years ago , he then will cover the district 's 42,104 square miles in a helicopter , is given a good chance of winning in what has become a swing area . He believes that the Viet Nam war will be " a major issue " in the November congressional elections , may criticize Hansen 's generally muted support of U.S. Viet Nam policy .

An unofficial favorite for the nomination last winter , O'Connor has since lost ground but still has strong organization support . His chances for the nomination , like those of the other three Democrats ( Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , Industrialist Howard Samuels , County Official Eugene Nickerson ) , depend heavily on Senator Robert Kennedy , whose muscle in the party power structure is now such that he can pick the candidate at the September nominating convention . Though ostensibly neutral , Kennedy has contributed funds to Roosevelt 's campaign , is believed to favor either Roosevelt or Nickerson.
