Stray Dog , made in 1949 by Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa , is a less expert thriller but a deeper movie than his recent High and Low . Both are cops-and-robbers chase films , starring Toshiro Mifune . But the older work , aglow with zest and freshness , displays abundantly two qualities of Kurosawa 's ripening genius : the ability to make moving pictures move , and an aching compassion for his fellow men . <P> The story is so naively contrived that the audience at times must swallow it out of simple generosity . Mifune-appearing 15 years trimmer and every muscular inch a star-plays an idealistic rookie detective whose confidence is shaken when a pickpocket steals his .38 Colt on a crowded bus . He plunges into the Tokyo underworld to find it ; and in a long sequence without a word of dialogue interrupting the flow of images , Kurosawa pulls the viewer right in after him . Mifune joins forces with a wise old sleuth ( Takashi Shimura ) , and the two men track a killer through a series of crimes keyed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Kurosawa uses plot merely as a device to view postwar Japan-a nation laid waste , exhausted in defeat , sorting out by slow social processes the stray dogs that forage among the ruins . Though the film runs two hours , much longer than necessary , its best scenes are unforgettably good . Cheering throngs at a Tokyo baseball stadium provide background for one tingling chase . In a city overcome by heat , the camera searches a line of chorus girls collapsed on a dressing-room floor , flesh glistening with sweat , each face a breathless distillation of despair . After a murder , a closeup of a splattered tomato-despite the obvious symbolism-suddenly , almost insidiously , conveys the whole meaning of horror and grief combined . <P> In the film 's brilliant climax , Mifune and his quarry battle in a flower-strewn thicket outside a suburban home where a housewife is practicing the piano . Mifune is shot , but hunter and hunted go on fighting through mud and marsh until they drop at last onto a bed of shrubbery . As a group of children go singsonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one from the other . Which is which ? Kurosawa tenderly draws the line between good and evil : the killer begins to sob .
