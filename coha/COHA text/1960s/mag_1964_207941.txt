It is afternoon , and the Bantu houseboy is in the living room cleaning the carpet . Someone has left the TV on . The boy looks up at the screen , sees a chorus line of white girls in scanty costumes . Suddenly seized by lust , he runs upstairs and rapes the lady of the house . <P> The scene is hypothetical , but it has been endlessly conjured up to explain why Africa 's most technically advanced nation still lacks mass television . In white-ruled South Africa , the government refuses to permit TV on the ground that it would corrupt both the white minority and nonwhite majority. * Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd has more or less put TV in a category with atom bombs and poison gas . " They are modern things , but that does not mean they are desirable . The government has to watch for any dangers to the people , both spiritual and physical . " Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Albert Hertzog has put the government view just as bluntly : " The effect of the wrong picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be highly detrimental . " He is on record with the pledge : " As far as I am concerned , we will never have television . " <P> The Nationalist government , composed mostly of Dutch-descended Boers , also fears that canned TV programs from the U.S. and Britain would further " anglicize " South Africa , 37% of whose white population is English-speaking . Beyond that , the Nationalists feel that Anglo-Saxon liberalism reflected in such programs could subtly undermine apartheid-although a good packager ought to be able to find some pretty safe fare . Still , Hertzog accuses South Africa 's English-dominated business community , and specifically Diamond Tycoon Harry F. Oppenheimer , of plotting to bring in television , which could mean " the destruction of white South Africa . " <P> Meanwhile , South Africans console themselves by going to the movies ; with a logic of sorts the government considers the movies less dangerous than TV , because at least they do not reach everyone 's home free . Oddly , South Africans also keep buying TV sets- " for when the time comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some closed-circuit transmissions for industrial and medical groups have been permitted . Reportedly , Verwoerd may use the promise of TV as a vote-getting device to enhance his party 's expected victory in the next election . And it is even beginning to dawn on some stubborn Nationalists that television , under strict government control , could be a powerful tool to spread their apartheid gospel in black and white , and maybe even color . <P> <P> *Even though , by latest count , 15 other African countries have TV . Among them : the ex-French Congo , Gabon , the Ivory Coast , Kenya , Liberia , Nigeria , Senegal , Sierra Leone , the Sudan , Uganda .
